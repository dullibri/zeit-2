HEADLINE: A Dismal Outlook for Growth

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Technological advances raised American living standards through most of the 20th century, but those days may be over, according to a new paper. 

 BODY:
They don't call it the dismal science for nothing.
In a new paper, the Northwestern economist Robert J. Gordon argues that the United States should get ready for an extended period of slowing growth, with economic expansion getting ever more sluggish and the bottom 99 percent getting the short end of the (ever-slower-growing) stick.
"A provocative 'exercise in subtraction' suggests that future growth in consumption per capita for the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution could fall below 0.5 percent per year for an extended period of decades," he writes.
To put that in context, American households' real consumption expanded by about 3 percent a year before the recession hit and has been growing about 2 percent a year during the recovery, according to statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Mr. Gordon's paper joins a growing economic literature that seeks and fails to find new sources of bang-up growth. (See Tyler Cowen's wonderful "The Great Stagnation" for more on that.) 
In the past, the United States economy grew quickly and its citizens got richer, in no small part because of advances made in three consecutive industrial revolutions: steam engines and railroads first; electricity, indoor plumbing and the combustion engine second; and the computing revolution third.
But the productivity and income gains begot by that third revolution have not been as impressive as the productivity and income gains from the first and second, he writes. Moreover, the United States is facing a number of headwinds. We've gotten most of the gains from the "demographic dividend." Inequality is rising. Higher education is getting more costly, and student performance waning. We have high levels of government and household debt. And we have taxes and regulations stifling innovation and businesses.
That leads Mr. Gordon to question the notion that growth is a "continuous process that will persist forever." We might not stop growing. But he argues we will stall out.
"Doubling the standard of living took five centuries between 1300 and 1800. Doubling accelerated to one century between 1800 and 1900. Doubling peaked at a mere 28 years between 1929 and 1957 and 31 years between 1957 and 1988," he writes. "But then doubling is predicted to slow back to a century again between 2007 and 2100."
Of course, there could be revolutionary new sources of growth: from the singularity, maybe, or a new renewable energy source. An article about "The Next Great Growth Cycle" also has some good pushback on the doom-and-gloom economic narrative.

HEADLINE: Is Economic Growth Going Down The Drain?

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Plumbing versus Facebook. 

 BODY:
FT Alphaville has an ungated version of Robert Gordon's latest pessimistic paper on prospects for long-run economic growth (pdf). It's not the first time Gordon has written on this subject, although I believe this is his first definitive statement that the IT revolution has been a big disappointment.
I have mixed feelings on that one; I see his point, but wonder whether there may be a lot more yet to come. But really, the point of such papers is to make you think differently. And I was very struck by Gordon's big example: the relative importance of fancy electronics (which he considers part of the Third Industrial Revolution) as compared with indoor plumbing (part of the second):
 A thought experiment helps to illustrate the fundamental importance of the inventions of IR #2 compared to the subset of IR #3 inventions that have occurred since 2002. You are required to make a choice between option A and option B. With option A you are allowed to keep 2002 electronic technology, including your Windows 98 laptop accessing Amazon, and you can keep running water and indoor toilets; but you can't use anything invented since 2002.
 Option B is that you get everything invented in the past decade right up to Facebook, Twitter, and the iPad, but you have to give up running water and indoor toilets. You have to haul the water into your dwelling and carry out the waste. Even at 3am on a rainy night, your only toilet option is a wet and perhaps muddy walk to the outhouse. Which option do you choose?
Indeed. If you visit one of my favorite places, the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, what's really striking about the early 1860s incarnations of the building was the lack of plumbing: outhouses outside, and water from a nearby well (with exactly the high infant mortality you'd expect as a result). By the 1930s the apartments were still grim -- I described them to my parents, and they said "We grew up in that apartment!" -- but they did have plumbing. And I'd say that nothing in these past 80 year matches that.

HEADLINE: Why Hayek Isn't Paul Ryan's Guru

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Paul D. Ryan likes to cite the economist Friedrich von Hayek as an influence, but Hayek supported national health care and questioned Ronald Reagan's policies, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Because the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, remains an enigma to almost everyone, those seeking insight into his core philosophy have focused on his choice of Representative Paul D. Ryan, who has been much more forthcoming about his intellectual influences, as his running mate.
Mr. Ryan has credited a variety of people, from the Representative Jack Kemp to the libertarian novelist Ayn Rand, for his thinking. An article in this week's New York Times Magazine credits another: the economist Friedrich von Hayek. Mr. Ryan mentions Hayek among his influences in the introduction to his Roadmap for America's Future, which embodies his plan to slash the size of government.
Hayek has long been popular among conservatives mainly because of one book, "The Road to Serfdom," published by the University of Chicago Press in 1944. Although written for a British audience - the Austrian-born Hayek was teaching at the London School of Economics when he wrote it - the book found its greatest success in the United States.

The New York Times had a great deal to do with the success of "The Road to Serfdom." Its introduction was written by John Chamberlain, who had been The Times's principal book reviewer in the 1930s. The Times's book review was written by one of its editorial writers, Henry Hazlitt, who was effusive in his praise not only for the book's substance but for its elegant style as well. It was featured on Page 1 of The Book Review on Sept. 24, 1944.
According to Hayek's biographer, Alan Ebenstein, The Times's review was the major reason that "The Road to Serfdom" became a best seller. Indeed, its influence continues, aided by recommendations from Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, and the radio host Glenn Beck to members of the Tea Party movement.
Hayek's basic thesis is that socialism inevitably transforms into totalitarianism. A key reason is that socialism cannot work economically, he believed. During the 1930s, Hayek was in the forefront of the socialist calculation debate, in which he, Ludwig von Mises and other economists proved that pure socialism had to fail because it lacked a true price system to guide efficient production and distribution.
The inevitable failure of socialism, Hayek thought, would eventually require authoritarian methods to try to make it work, as was the case in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. At the time he wrote his book, Britain, France and other European countries were adopting explicitly socialist policies, like state ownership of major businesses and industries.
Although there has never been much support for European-style socialism in America, World War II and the New Deal led to a great expansion of government. In 1944, it looked as if the United States were traveling rapidly in the same direction as Europe, and Hayek's thesis was not implausible, given recent history.
The big problem for that those who continue to cite "The Road to Serfdom" as a guide is that they must essentially ignore everything that happened after 1944. Communism's high-water mark occurred a few years later, and before long it became obvious that communism was not a path to prosperity. Nor has anything remotely like Nazism ever resurfaced.
By the 1970s, few reputable economists really thought that socialism was a good idea. Ironically, one of them was Gunnar Myrdal, with whom Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel in economic science.
In 1979, the conservative Margaret Thatcher, whom Hayek greatly admired, became prime minister of Britain and quickly began selling the state enterprises that had been acquired after the war. "Privatization" became a worldwide phenomenon, and the number of state-owned enterprises fell. Communism collapsed in 1989, and the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991.
Thus postwar history is exactly the opposite of what Hayek predicted. Liberalism did not beget socialism, which did not beget totalitarianism.
Another problem for conservatives like Mr. Ryan is that Hayek would have been likely to oppose many of their pet ideas, like abolishing Medicare. In "The Road to Serfdom," Hayek explicitly endorsed social insurance:
Nor is there any reason why the state should not assist the individuals in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision. Where, as in the case of sickness and accident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance - where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks - the case for the state's helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong.
In "The Road to Serfdom," Hayek also endorsed state aid to victims of floods and earthquakes, government policies to regulate working hours and to control poisonous substances. In other writings and interviews, he endorsed antitrust laws, a minimum wage and even the Tennessee Valley Authority, long a right-wing bête noire. In a 1982 interview with The New York Times, Hayek was even skeptical of Ronald Reagan's economic plan, calling it "a very risky thing to do."
Moreover, Hayek was not doctrinaire about the importance of political freedom. In a 1979 interview with The Times, he defended the Chilean regime of Augusto Pinochet, which combined political repression with free-market economics, calling the results "absolutely fantastic." Asked whether this view was inconsistent with his philosophy, Hayek replied, "You can have economic freedom without political freedom, but you cannot have political freedom without economic freedom."
For such transgressions, some on the right have long viewed Hayek as a dubious ally. For example, the libertarian economist Walter Block wrote a detailed attack on Hayek in 1996 for being at best a lukewarm defender of the free market.
I suspect that in his heart, Representative Ryan is more attracted to the dogmatism of Rand than the complex, nuanced philosophy of Hayek, who told the Cornell political scientist Theodore Lowi that Rand angrily called him "a compromiser" on the only occasion they met.

HEADLINE: CBS News Poll Finds Presidential Candidates Essentially Tied

BYLINE: MARJORIE CONNELLY


HIGHLIGHT: In the poll, President Obama was backed by 46 percent of registered voters, and Mitt Romney was preferred by 45 percent. 

 BODY:
As the Republicans began to gather in Tampa, Fla., for their convention this week, the latest CBS News poll shows the race between President Obama and Mitt Romney essentially tied. 
Mr. Obama is backed by 46 percent of registered voters, and Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, is preferred by 45 percent. Ninety percent of Republicans support Mr. Romney; just about as many Democrats want to see Mr. Obama re-elected. Independents are evenly divided - 40 percent for Mr. Obama and 41 percent for Mr. Romney. 
As is often the case, women are more inclined to support the Democratic candidate, preferring Mr. Obama by 10 percentage points. Men are 9 points more likely to back Mr. Romney. 
Voters are closely divided in their overall attitudes about the candidates. Mr. Obama is viewed favorably by 41 percent and unfavorably by 44 percent. Twelve percent are undecided. 
Similarly, 31 percent regard Mr. Romney in a positive light, and 36 percent have a negative opinion. But more voters are unable to give an opinion about Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts: 17 percent said they were undecided, and 15 percent said they were too unfamiliar with Mr. Romney to offer any judgment. 
Mr. Obama is seen as understanding the voters' needs and problems, but only about a third thinks he has a clear plan for creating jobs. Fewer voters see Mr. Romney as a candidate that empathizes with their troubles, but they are evenly divided on whether he has a strategy for dealing with unemployment. 
The nationwide poll was conducted Aug. 22 to 26 using landlines and cellphones with 1,218 adults of whom 1,051 said they are registered to vote. The margin of sampling error for voters is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Filling the Empty Suit

BYLINE: BILL KELLER


HIGHLIGHT: The GOP's convention managers would be wise to emphasize Romney's leadership strengths over his likeability - a task that's ultimately up to the candidate himself. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla.
I'm a convention curmudgeon. I've been a fitful convention-goer since the 1976 Republican show in New York. They are tedious, scripted events matched and surpassed in their shallowness by the ceaseless chorus of commentary supplied by my tribe. What we do here is not journalism, it is theater criticism of an especially pedestrian order. The real reporters in Tampa would rather be covering Isaac.
And yet this particular piece of theater has a simple and important purpose, in this election possibly a decisive purpose. 
It is not to "frame the debate" - we know what the stakes are, and there will be actual debates in which we can hope the candidates highlight their starkly different views of what government is for. 
It is certainly not to flesh out the Romney agenda. The candidate has not so far deigned to put meat on the rhetorical bones of his intentions. (An editorial in The Economist magazine described his 59-point "Romney Program for Economic Recovery, Growth and Jobs" as "Fifty Shades of Grey" without the sex.) He has withheld the details for the same reason he has withheld his tax returns - they would provide ammunition for his critics. Let's hope he doesn't get away with this until November, but the convention will not be the place we learn what tax loopholes he would close or what government programs he would shred. 
The purpose of the convention is not mainly to cast doubt on the record of President Obama. The doubt is already plentiful, in both parties. Obama's record has been disappointing. Not nearly as disappointing as the speakers in Tampa will claim, and much of the blame is fairly laid at the feet of obstructionist Republicans. But when you compare the promise of Obama's inauguration, those lofty expectations, with the large majorities who feel now the country is stuck on the wrong track, that is a simple, undeniable metric of disappointment. Tell us something we don't know.
No, the purpose of the convention is to fill the empty suit that is Mitt Romney with enough flesh and blood and spine that he becomes a more credible alternative to the disappointing incumbent.

The choreographers in Tampa seem to have decided that this means "humanizing" Romney - highlighting a sympathetic back story, an adoring family, a narrative of faith, a warmer side. Maybe. But even before Ann Romney's turn as the ultimate humanizer, this makeover has the feeling of Romney's handlers (and Fox News) trying too hard. Mitt Romney is not sentimental, he is not an empathizer, he is not fun, and no amount of homey anecdotes and loving testimonials will make him - to use the adjective of the week - "likeable." 
Portraying Mitt Romney as a guy you would invite to your kid's bar mitzvah is not credible. And in any case it's not enough. What voters are looking for, I think, is more ineffable. They are looking a combination of moral compass and strength of character. They want to be convinced that he gets them (which is not the same as being one of them), that when the hard choices come at him he will be governed by the right mix of decency and sturdiness, that he can detect the wisdom in the crosswinds of pressure, that they trust his judgment.
If Romney can pull that off, he will leave Tampa ahead in the polls, flush with cash, having shaken off the negatives the Democrats have blown their war chest flinging at him. It will not be over, but it will be his to lose.
If the convention managers are smart, they will worry less about his warmer side and lay before us his firmer side: the details of how he has been steady in the face of pressure, stories of how he has led rather than been led. But no amount of stagecraft alone can fill the empty suit. It has to come from the man himself, organically. And - as the campaign so far has demonstrated - it is very hard to fake.

HEADLINE: Is Ron Paul Winning the Future?

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Or do his gains within the G.O.P. reflect partisan incentives rather than principled shifts? 

 BODY:
With no actual convention to cover here in Tampa these last two days, the press has gravitated toward what you might call para-convention events: Newt Gingrich's week-long "Newt University" tutorial in conservative ideas, for instance, and Ron Paul's "We Are the Future" rally for his army of supporters, held Sunday at the University of South Florida. About Gingrich, at this point, there is little of interest to be said, but the boasting title of Paul's rally has at least some claim to be the truth, given how well the libertarian congressman performed with younger voters in the primary season. Writing for the American Conservative, Jim Antle makes a plausible case that Paul has moved the Republican Party in his direction, and might move it further still: From the party-wide enthusiasm for critiques of the Federal Reserve to the reappearance of "bona-fide noninterventionists" in Republican House contests to the emergence of Kentucky Senator Rand Paul as a more mainstream advocate for his father's ideas, Antle writes, "the rapid progress" of Paulism "in a short period of time is undeniable."
Antle also allows, however, that "Mitt Romney is about as far from Ron Paul as a Republican presidential nominee can be," and this cautionary notes raises the deeper question of whether the Paul-ward shifts that he's describing would survive a Romney presidency. Both on the front where I'm most sympathetic to Paul's libertarian/paleoconservative cocktail (his skepticism about the use of military force abroad) and the front where I'm most skeptical (his goldbuggery and inflation paranoia), the gains he's made over the last few years probably owe as much to partisan polarization as to deep ideological transformation. In the age of Obama, opposing the Libyan War and railing against a potential QE3 is a low-cost way for Republican politicians to draw contrasts with a Democratic president's policies and interests. The real test will come when it's a Republican president contemplating sending troops to Syria or when it's a Republican economy that's being goosed by the Fed's monetary policy. I'm fairly confident that Rand Paul will raise his voice in criticism in those cases; I'm much less confident that there will be any kind of Paulista groundswell rising with him.
The post-2012 challenge for Paul's future-looking followers, then, isn't building a movement that will outlast the man himself. It's building a movement that will outlast the current political moment, and endure even when the incentives of partisanship cut a different way.

HEADLINE: Amid a Defense Budget Fight, Military Families Plan for the Worst

BYLINE: AMY BUSHATZ


HIGHLIGHT: Though used to dislocation and stress, some military families are deeply anxious about the "what-ifs" of coming defense budget cuts. 

 BODY:
My husband doesn't whisper. So when he leaned into me before his 2009 deployment and whispered that soldiers - many soldiers - were going to die where they were going in Afghanistan, I listened. Yet I am the kind of practical woman who could hear his fear and chalk it up to predeployment jitters.
My husband was right about that deployment. In four months, 20 members of our unit, the 1-17 Infantry Battalion, Fifth Brigade, Second Infantry Division, out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash, died. I spent every other Wednesday at a military memorial sitting behind friends whose husbands were now among the fallen. 
Events like that leave scars. Like so many of my fellow military spouses, I no longer believe that every story ends with "happily ever after." I no longer believe that things always turn out for the best. I no longer think that threats are always empty.
Which is why when elected officials and pundits rant and rave about the Congressional plan to ax $460 billion from America's defense budget over the next 10 years, I feel uneasy. That surprises me. After working as a reporter on Capitol Hill, I know more than my fair share about the process of putting together a federal budget. I know that politicians often speak in hyperbole. 
But I also empathize with military families who are deeply anxious about the "what-ifs" of sequestration - the technical term for the automatic cuts written into law last year that require a sweeping, 10 percent cut to most federal programs, including defense.
Military families rely on programs financed by the Defense Department to make the challenges of military life just a little more bearable. Things like subsidized child care, easy access to a grocery store and emotional health therapy keep us sane in the face of intense stress.
Fiscal screaming matches in Washington are typically resolved without leaving the Defense Department or life as we know it in tatters. But the panic surrounding the debate is starting to drown out voices of reason. Listening to politicians make proclamations that the Pentagon spending cuts will "cause economic devastation that will follow you for decades," as Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, recently did, is becoming increasingly hard to ignore.
When it comes to what programs and subsidies might be cut, rumors run rampant, especially among those who don't fully understand how the complicated budget process works or, in some cases, fails. And those rumors are starting to take their toll.
"I heard they may take away our housing allowance," one Navy spouse recently told me, even though I know of no military or Congressional official who has officially floated a cut in housing allotments. "If they do that, we won't be able to afford to live near my husband."
Military spouses know from experience that sometimes the worst does actually happen. Before deployment, every military family is lectured by their leadership on the importance of having a plan just in case their service member is seriously injured or killed. Who will take care of his medical decisions? Where will he be buried? Who will receive the military death insurance money?
The fearmongering that has accompanied the discussion around sequestration has sent many into "plan for the worst" mode. So instead of giving deployment preparation or recovery the full attention it deserves, many of us are distracted by wondering whether budget cuts will leave our service members with inadequate weapons or body armor, our pocketbooks short on rent or our posts and bases without the support structures we rely on to make life just a little bit easier.
Is using the already strained emotions of military families as a pawn in what seems to be an ideological temper tantrum really fair or necessary?

HEADLINE: Five Questions for S.C. Gov. Nikki Haley

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina is not only attending her first Republican National Convention here this week, but she also was asked to deliver one of the event's marquee speeches. Here are five questions from an interview on Tuesday. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. - Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina is not only attending her first Republican National Convention here this week, but she also was asked to deliver one of the event's marquee speeches. Here are five questions from an interview on Tuesday. 
Q.
 What is one thing that you know about Mitt Romney that voters may not realize? 
A.
 I love the fact that in 2008, Governor Romney was a candidate that wanted to win. What are you seeing now is not a candidate that wants to win, but a leader who has spent the last four years saying, 'How would I have handled that situation? 
Q.
 A candidate who wanted to win, what do you mean? 
A.
 So many times candidates go in and they go through the talking points and they say what they think people want to hear. It's very different when you watch a candidate become a leader, when they've actually watched and say ok, 'If I was in that position, how would I have handled that? 
Now we are seeing a better candidate because he's not thinking about being a candidate, he's thinking about being a leader. He's thinking about being a president and he's showing all the signs of being a great one. 
Q.
 Does Mr. Romney need to become more likeable or improve his appeal to voters? 
A.
 We don't elect people because they look good in a picture or hold a baby well. We elect people because they have proven results. He has proven results. It's not about liking him. People don't care about liking who they elect. They care about electing someone who is going to work for them, that's going to fight for them, that's going to prove that they deserve to be there. That's what he needs to do this week. 
Q.
 Have some Republicans - like Representative Todd Akin of Missouri - contributed to the Democratic argument that Republicans are waging a 'war on women?' 
A.
 It's not serious, it's silly. Akin's comments were just insulting - it's embarrassing for him, but when you look at the party in general, for Democrats to imply that women are one-issue voters is insulting to me. It's demeaning to women. Women consider everything. They care about jobs and the economy. They are about health care and how it's going to affect families. They care about the debt that's been passed on to their children and they care if their debt is going to mean anything. I know pro-life women in the Democratic Party. I know pro-choice women in the Republican Party. 
Q.
 Can you share a highlight of your Tuesday night speech? 
A.
 "I'm going to talk about how the hardest part of my job as governor of South Carolina has been this administration."

HEADLINE: Selective Memory in Tampa

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Today's convention speakers avoided mentioning George W. Bush. 

 BODY:
The Republican speakers at the first night of the party's convention in Tampa kept shouting that "it is time" or "about time" or "past time" that the United States had a president who appreciates small businesses, or hates red tape, or wants to get rid of regulations, or wants to cut taxes.
"Small business needs a leader who will not avoid dealing with difficult issues, a leader with experience to understand what it takes," said Jack Gilchrist, a small business owner from New Hampshire who was introduced by his state's Senator Kelly Ayotte, who is most famous for trying to repeal the burdensome regulation banning the torture of prisoners.
The speakers--who by the way seemed to give the exact same speech over and over again--were carrying on as if they'd been out of power for ages. But wasn't George W. Bush president for eight years before Barack Obama? In fact, weren't Republicans in the White House for all but 12 years between 1968 and Mr. Obama's election in 2008? 

Sure, conventions are an exercise in misdirection, in the airbrushing of history and in gauzy presentation. But it is striking the way the 2012 Republicans are ignoring Mr. Bush, who was president from 2001 until 2009 and was given the same sort of grossly overblown accolades at his two conventions that were showered on Mr. Romney tonight and will be showered on him for two days more. 
This gathering of Republicans is an exercise in selective memory, and it has to be. Otherwise they might have to grapple with the fact that Mr. Bush and his allies in Congress cut taxes, and presided over the disintegration of the Clinton-era budget surpluses. In the not-so-distant past we had a Republican president, a one-time businessman, who hated red tape, and under his watch the grossly under-regulated financial system collapsed, bringing on the Great Recession.

HEADLINE: Love, Not Politics?

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The genius of Ann Romney's performance was the way she smiled so warmly as she slipped the knife into President Obama. 

 BODY:
If the purpose of the Republican National Convention was to convince Americans that someone named Romney has a soul, a heart and a rich character, then it succeeded tonight. Only the Romney's name is Ann, not Mitt.
The Republican nominee's wife gave a well written and professionally delivered speech that was full of warm talk about the special role and burden of women in American society, about falling in love with Mr. Romney, about their marriage and about her certainty that he will fix pretty much everything that's wrong with America.
(Although, when you think about it, which political wife would take that stage and declare her lack of certainty?) 
And, like many great political speeches, hers began with a declaration that "I want to talk to you tonight not about politics and not about party," and then went on to talk mostly about politics and party.
Like when Mrs. Romney spoke about "the working moms who love their jobs but would like to work just a little less to spend more time with the kids, but that's just out of the question with this economy."
Or when she said: "These last few years have been harder than they needed to be. It's all the little things -- that price at the pump you just can't believe, the grocery bills that just get bigger; all those things that used to be free, like school sports, are now one more bill to pay. It's all the little things that pile up to become big things. And the big things -- the good jobs, the chance at college, that home you want to buy, just get harder. Everything has become harder."
No politics there.
The genius of Mrs. Romney's diva performance was the way she smiled so warmly as she delicately slipped the knife into President Obama. This was no Sarah Palin, who was all teeth and no warmth.
"It amazes me to see [Mitt's] history of success actually being attacked. Are those really the values that made our country great? As a mom of five boys, do we want to raise our children to be afraid of success? Do we send our children out in the world with the advice, "Try to do okay?"
Mrs. Romney added: "And let's be honest, if the last four years had been more successful, do we really think there would be this attack on Mitt Romney's success?"
Cue the knowing smile, the small, sharing chuckle, and the little nods of recognition and waves as if she had just spotted a familiar face in the huge crowd.

Then the president took a moment to discuss the problem of greenhouse gases, something he has done less frequently of late. In a speech at Iowa State University, he noted that "We're on track to emit fewer greenhouse gases this year than we have in nearly 20 years." He did not note the role of the recession, with its attendant drop in manufacturing and car and truck trips. [White House Press Office]

HEADLINE: Live Updates From the Republican National Convention

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The Times will be providing updates and analysis from the Republican National Convention in Tampa. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's six-year quest for the Republican presidential nomination will culminate Tuesday afternoon when the 4,400 delegates gathered here officially make him their choice to reclaim the White House from President Obama and the Democrats. The roll call vote will be followed by an evening of speakers including Mr. Romney's wife Ann and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.
The Times will be providing updates and analysis from Tampa on our live dashboard. You can also follow along on Twitter @thecaucus, or follow our list of Times journalists covering the convention.
11:39 P.M. | That's a Wrap
That's a wrap for the first full day the the Republican National Convention. Come back tomorrow for more live coverage.
- 
11:21 P.M. | The Blue Screen
It swirled. It moved. It faded in and out, turning brighter blue, then fading out, like a lava lamp. It made some viewers - if you believe Twitter - feel slightly nauseated.
What was it? 
The blue background behind many of the speakers at Mitt Romney's convention.
Not all of the speakers got the car-sickness-inducing treatment behind them. Ann Romney, for example, had a more static blue background while she spoke. Other speakers stood in front of a red backdrop.
But many of the speakers delivered their addresses while the the colors of the blue backdrop - a high-tech video wall - mushed back and forth. It quickly became a fixation on Twitter as viewers took note of the oddity.
"It was a bit twilight zonish, where someone is being brainwashed," one posted.
Another wrote: "OK, am I tripping on acid cuz that wavy moving blue screen behind Chris Christie sorta makes me feel like I am."
There is precedent for such backdrop issues. 
At the 2008 Republican National Convention, Senator John McCain accepted his nomination in front of a huge digital image of a school. But all that showed on the TV screen was the bright green of the schoolyard lawn behind him.
Aides for Mr. Romney had bragged about the high-tech stage, which cost more than $2.5 million to build. They had said they were especially proud of the many video screens behind the speakers, which could be programmed any way they wanted.
Asked on Tuesday night about the odd blue screen, one adviser simply wrote: "Everyone wants to be a program director."
- 
11:23 P.M. | Some Delegates Missing in Action During Speeches
Ann Romney and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey gave the two big speeches of the night. The convention floor was alternately hushed and uproarious. So what are you doing milling on the third-floor walkway outside the arena as though it were seventh-inning stretch in a ball game?
"I'm charging my phone," said Curtis Loftis, the South Carolina chairman of the Romney campaign, sitting near a wall plug. 
"I'm treasurer of the state," he added. "I have a lot of work to do tomorrow, and I'm an early riser."
"I have vertigo," said Melody Howard, an alternate delegate from Nevada. "I'm up in the U section. It is very, very difficult. I didn't want to leave with a lot of people, so I'm heading out early.''
"It's a good time to go shopping," said David Johnson, an alternate from the United States Virgin Islands, taking advantage of no lines at the gift shop, where he picked up a couple of Romney-Ryan drink cozies for his fishing boat. "When I came by earlier, this place was mobbed."
His guest, Jennifer Galloway, a lawyer in Tampa, was also shopping while Mr. Christie could be seen but not heard on a nearby television. She bought a red "I built my business" T-shirt and a Romney banner for her 9-year-old son. 
"I'm taping the speeches at home," she said.
"I don't know how the hell people can listen to one of these - every guy says the same thing," said Leo Gildersleeve, the husband of a Texas delegate, as he sat waiting for his wife, June. "They could run this whole convention in two days. I'm 83 years old. I've got to get to bed."
- 
11:08 P.M. | Is Ann Romney Channeling Michelle Obama?
Has Ann Romney learned a thing or two from Michelle Obama's playbook? In her smiling but forceful convention speech, Mrs. Romney showed off many classic political-spouse rhetorical moves: the fond recollection of her romance, the "you don't know my husband" response to his critics.
A few moments specifically recalled lines of Mrs. Obama's. Mrs. Romney vowed that her husband would not fail; Mrs. Obama has said countless times that her husband never let her down.
Mrs. Romney also painted a bleak portrait of the struggles that women are facing: late nights, elderly parents, emergency rooms. She spoke about how the burdens of a stalled economy often fall on women. "It's the moms who always have to work a little harder, to make everything right," she said. "You're the ones who always have to do a little more." 
"I'm not sure if men really understand this, but I don't think there's a woman in America who really expects her life to be easy," she said. "In our own ways, we all know better." 
"Everything has become harder," she said.
In 2007, Mrs. Obama said nearly all of those things, talking about how the deck often seemed stacked against working families, about how an invisible bar just seemed to be getting higher. But the first lady changed her approach considerably by mid-2008, making her speeches far more upbeat, in part because she was criticized in that last campaign for having a vision of America that was too dark, for what many critics called racially based resentment. "Mrs. Grievance," National Review called her. Will anyone notice that Mrs. Romney just made some of the same points?
- 
10:47 P.M. | Love or Respect 
The final message out of today's Republican convention was a little bit conflicted.
For Ann Romney, the wife of the Republican presidential nominee, the message boiled down to one word: "Love."
"I want to talk to you tonight about that one great thing that unites us, that one thing that brings us our greatest joy when times are good, and the deepest solace in our dark hours," she said in an address to the convention.
"Tonight I want to talk to you about love," she said.
But a few minutes later, Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, had a different take.
"Tonight," he said, "we choose respect over love."
- 
10:44 P.M. | Christie Asks Country to Face Hard Truths
Chris Christie, the sharp-tongued governor of New Jersey, on Tuesday extolled Mitt Romney as an exceptional leader willing to speak hard truths to a nation weary of President Obama's policies and ready to make a much-needed change.
"It's time to end this era of absentee leadership in the Oval Office and send real leaders to the White House," Mr. Christie said, according to prepared remarks. "America needs Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, and we need them right now."
In delivering the keynote address at the Republican National Convention, Mr. Christie demonstrated his trademark bluntness - crediting his mother for teaching him how to speak "without much varnish" - but he did not lash out in personal ways at Mr. Obama, hardly mentioning the president by name.Read more ...
- 
10:29 P.M. | No Convention Watching Party for Obama
 FORT COLLINS, Colo. - President Obama checked into his hotel here early Tuesday evening after campaign rallies on two college campuses, with plans to read and get updates on Hurricane Isaac, an aide said - not to watch television coverage of the Republican convention.
 It is not hard to imagine why the president wouldn't want to watch the nonstop Obama-bashing in Tampa, Fla. But it meant that he would also miss the prime-time speech from Mitt Romney's wife Ann, much anticipated as a humanizing window into her husband. 
 One campaign adviser, who would not be identified critiquing the opposition's convention, said ahead of Mrs. Romney's appearance, "I'm sure she'll do well." But the aide suggested the Romney campaign had built expectations for her unrealistically high.
 And after hours of programming in which Republican women were ubiquitous - to try to counter what polls suggest is a bad image for their party among female voters - the Obama adviser suggested, "They seem to be under the belief that if you are surrounded by women, you understand women's issues. The two are not the same."
 Mr. Obama, seeking to energize young voters who could be crucial to his re-election hopes, spoke on Tuesday before a combined 19,000 people, mostly students, first at Iowa State University in Ames and then here at Colorado State University. On Wednesday morning - depending on Isaac's course - he will fly back east to a third rally at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville before returning to Washington.
- 
10:28 P.M. | About G.O.P. Support for the Individual Mandate 
Artur Davis, the former Democratic congressman from Alabama who fell short in his effort to win the Democratic nomination for governor a couple of years ago, used his speech on the floor of the Republican convention tonight to make the claim that Democrats had "rammed through" a health care law "without accepting a single Republican idea."
It is true that President Obama's health care law passed without Republican support. 
But the law's central, and most contested idea - of an individual mandate requiring people to buy coverage - was initially devised by conservatives and backed by Republicans, including Newt Gingrich, who saw it as a better alternative to a true government-run health system. 
It was also an idea that was seized on by a Republican who is very much on the minds of delegate in Tampa and viewers at home: the party's nominee, Mitt Romney.
- 
10:23 P.M. | This Convention, Brought to You by: 'You Built It'
Tuesday, the first full day of the Republican National Convention, brings a keynote by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, and a warm speech by Ann Romney meant to humanize her husband. But conventiongoers could be forgiven for thinking that the evening was brought to them by "You Did Build It."
Attacks on President Obama's "you didn't build that" comments last month in Virginia served as something of the unofficial motto of the night, infusing speakers' remarks, dotting hand-drawn signs, and echoing through the Tampa Bay Times Forum as they blared from overhead.
Between speeches, videos of Mr. Obama's remarks, followed by Mr. Romney's assertion that small-business owners deserve the sole credit for their success, played on huge screens hanging throughout the hall - little vignettes featuring real business owners meant to drive home what has become something of a rallying cry for Mr. Romney's campaign. 
When Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma spoke, she, too, got in on the action, warning that if you're a voter who owns a small business, the president will tell you that you didn't build that.
"You think it's the I.R.S., the E.P.A., or the federal government?" she asked rhetorically (and incredulously).
When Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia took the stage, a large "We Built It" slogan appeared on the screen behind him, and he also offered up some "You did build that" red meat to the crowd: "You did make that happen," he said, to cheers. "You did build that in America."
And shortly after taking the stage, Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina couldn't resist a dig of her own. Recounting the story of her parents, who immigrated to the United States and founded their business out of their living room, she said, "So President Obama, don't tell me that my parents didn't build their business."
Even the R.N.C. pages got in on the fun, wildly waving hand-drawn red and blue signs that said - what else - "You Built It," as the politicians onstage echoed that very same message.
- 
10:16 P.M. | On the Floor, Away From the Speeches
Yes, there are important speakers on stage, but down on the floor, what the convention most resembles is a boisterous, arm-squeezing class reunion. 
Delegates and elected officials from across the country are greeting old friends and comrades in Republican arms, a quadrennial get-together.
"You've got people who've been to conventions for 20 years. It's good being together," said Representative J. Randy Forbes of Virginia, pumping the hand of a fellow member of Congress, who are allowed V.I.P. access to the floor even if they are not delegates.
Todd Staples, the Texas agriculture commissioner, chatted with his friend Gary Black, the agriculture commissioner of Georgia. "It's a shared vision for America that brings us together," Mr. Staples said.
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, an also-ran candidate for the nomination during the hard-fought primary race, paid a surprise visit to the Texas delegation and embraced the state Republican chairman, Steve Munisteri, in a long bear hug. 
(Asked if had any regrets about not being the star of the week's show, Mr. Perry said: "I'm a team player. We've got one quarterback.")
Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi posed for pictures and tightly gripped the arm of Christopher Shays, a former congressman from Connecticut, who lost a recent primary race to Linda McMahon, the wrestling entrepreneur, who Mr. Shays dismissed as "the billionaire."
"It's a Mississippi-Connecticut Yankee reunion," Mr. Shays said.
"This is a great man," Mr. Wicker, a member of the Senate Armed Services committee, said of Mr. Shays. "He came out to Iraq 20 times."
- 
10:13 P.M. | Waiting Backstage 
Mitt and Ann Romney are backstage, waiting for their big reveal. 
What to do? 
Well, watch TV, for one. (They are catching the convention proceedings on Fox News.) And make adoring, slightly nervous conversation with the cameramen standing around them. 
MR. ROMNEY: My better side is the side that Ann is on, cover me up and let her be seen. No one has ever suggested that I am the best side of this relationship let me tell you.
MR. ROMNEY: Break a leg, you'll do great.
MRS. ROMNEY: I am excited. I am not nervous.
MR ROMNEY: I am not nervous. She is going to be great.
Mr. Romney is planning to watch his wife speak from backstage. After she is done, he will join her out on the convention floor with their five sons.

10:09 P.M. | From the Morgue: Early Signs of Romney, 1964
- 
9:45 P.M. | A Show of Hands
Rick Santorum may have just handed down the most "hand"-laden convention speech in history.
The key line of his address: "I shook the hand of the American dream. And it has a strong grip."
But he did not stop there. He spoke of his daughter's hands. He spoke of shaking the gritty hands of restaurant workers. In all, there were about two dozen hands in the speech, according to Matt Viser of The Boston Globe, who reported his tally on Twitter.
Twitter immediately lighted up with references, admiring and mocking of the "Hand Speech." 
David Axelrod, an adviser to President Obama, quickly took a swipe at the former senator from Pennsylvania: "Santorum's speech: all hands, no Mitt!" he wrote.
- 
9:38 P.M. | Santorum Highlights Social Issues 
Rick Santorum injected conservative social issues into the nominating convention of his one-time rival, but did so before the prime-time lineup when television networks began paying attention.
Mr. Santorum and Mitt Romney engaged in a bitter fight for the nomination, with Mr. Santorum repeatedly deriding Mr. Romney's commitment to the social issues that he frequently espouses.
"Marriage is disappearing in places where government dependency is the highest," Mr. Santorum said. "Most single mothers do heroic work and an amazing job raising children. But the fact is, for America to succeed, we must stop the assault on marriage and the family in America today."
The two men made an uneasy peace with each other after Mr. Santorum's upstart campaign petered out in the face of Mr. Romney's well-financed effort. After bowing out, Mr. Santorum eventually endorsed Mr. Romney but has campaigned little on his behalf.
But unlike Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who remained a thorn in Mr. Romney's side and did not get a speaking slot, Mr. Santorum was offered the ability to speak at the convention.
He took that opportunity to reprise the themes of his presidential campaign, talking little about Mr. Romney and his qualifications for the White House and more about his own personal story.
Mr. Romney's campaign has sought to keep the convention on economic issues and jobs. But Mr. Santorum, as he did throughout 2011 and 2012, steered the political conversation back to abortion and other social issues.

9:22 P.M. | Perry's Next Stand 
Texans - perhaps more than most - know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em. And on the floor of the Republican National Convention, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas wasn't ready to fold 'em just yet.
Greeting members of the cowboy hat-clad Texas delegation, Mr. Perry told reporters that he hadn't ruled out another run for president. And, in a mixed message of support for Mr. Romney, he said that his second shot at the White House might come in 2016 - when, potentially, Mr. Romney could be running for his second term.
"Oh, absolutely," Mr. Perry said, when asked if he'd ever run again. "It's a long time until 2016, and a lot of good things could happen."
Mr. Perry also said that his party's rough-and-tumble early nominating contests - "intramural scrimmages," as he called them - had helped prepare Mr. Romney for the general election.
"Whether they're in athletic events or whether they're in politics, it makes you strong," he said. "At the end of the day, it made Mitt stronger. It made him more prepared for the attacks that came from the Democrats. And he's going to be not only a better candidate, he's going to be a better president because of it."
Still, he couldn't resist getting in a final jab at his former opponent. Asked if he had any regrets about the sometimes vicious attacks he'd lobbed at Mr. Romney during the primaries, Mr. Perry chuckled and said, "Lord, no."
"We all have our shots that we take, and we give, and you know, I hope I gave as good as it took," he said.

9:14 P.M. | 'You Didn't Build That' in Context
 The recording of President Obama saying "you didn't build that" that is being played over the loudspeakers between speeches at the Republican convention has been selectively edited in a way that changes its meaning. 
 The recording being played in Tampa makes it sound as if the president had said: "Let me tell you something, if you've got a business - you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen." Small-business owners are then quoted taking umbrage at his remarks, and explaining that they did build their businesses by dint of their hard work.
 But the unedited quote from the president tells a somewhat different story. Mr. Obama, at a campaign event last month at a fire station in Roanoke, Va., actually said: "Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business - you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."

- 
8:58 P.M. | Republicans Highlight Obama 'Switchers'
Republicans are eager to make the point that many of President Obama's supporters from 2008 are now going to vote for Mitt Romney.
They will demonstrate that with a video later Tuesday night called "Switchers," in which former supporters of Mr. Obama declare their intent to switch parties in the coming election.
"I caucused for him and went to the rallies and even donated to his campaign," one woman says in the video. "I'm not supporting Barack Obama this time because I just don't see things getting better."
The video was released to reporters earlier on Tuesday, but will be played on the big screens in the convention hall today just before the speech of Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina.
- 
8:40 P.M. | Now It's Getting Personal
Political conventions are usually full of insults to leaders of the other party. But Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio took it to another level on Tuesday.
During his speech to the convention, Mr. Kasich recounted that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had boasted of being a good golfer. "I've played golf with Joe Biden," Mr. Kasich said, "and that's not true." Ouch!
Mr. Biden and Mr. Kasich played as a team against President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner last year and lost, which may explain Mr. Kasich's sour view of his erstwhile partner. But Mr. Biden might point to Golf Digest, which ranked the vice president 29th in its list of Washington's best golfers with a 6.3 handicap.
- 
8:34 P.M. | Republican Speakers Press the 'We Built It' Message
Sher Valenzuela, a candidate for Delaware lieutenant governor, kicked off the Republican National Convention's theme du jour Tuesday evening with a full-throated defense of entrepreneurship and free enterprise against what she called President Obama's stifling regulations. The message: We Built It.
But the attack on Mr. Obama's "you didn't build that" gaffe stoked liberal fact-checkers, who said her company, First State Manufacturing, has received millions of dollars in federal loans and contracts. Indeed, a recent PowerPoint presentation, unearthed by the liberal group Media Matters for America, extolled businesses to reach out for government work. 
"Bidding on government contracts has never been easier, and it's getting easier all the time," the presentation read. "That's because government agencies are mandated to work with small businesses. That's why nearly all government agencies have special small-business programs to ensure the success of business owners just like you."
Since Mr. Obama uttered his "you didn't build it" line, defenders have said his Republican critics have been taking the line out of context. The president wasn't saying that entrepreneurs do not build their businesses; he was saying he did not build the roads, bridges and infrastructure that business uses - the line before the quote.
But the Romney campaign has hammered Mr. Obama with the line, so much that its counter - We Built It - has become a Republican mantra. In response, Democrats have sought out any government largess, no matter how insignificant, that has gone to businesses showcased by the Romney campaign. 
Still, the "you didn't build that" line has become one of the engines driving the Republicans at the moment, and it is showing no sign of running its course.

8:06 P.M. | Let's Call Room Service
Mitt Romney just won the Republican nomination for president of the United States. What's he doing to celebrate? Ordering room service.
Mr. Romney, who flew here to support his wife, Ann, spent the evening in a hotel suite. (Mrs. Romney will speak later Tuesday evening.) No word on what he ordered, but in addition to Mrs. Romney, he was joined by their son, Matt; his wife, Laurie; and two of their children, Mia, 8, and Nate, 4.
"They're having dinner, playing with the grandkids," Rich Gorka, a Romney spokesman, told reporters.

7:23 P.M. | Delegates Show State Pride in Fashion Choices
The tradition of wacky individualistic outfits at party conventions is a long one, so consider the effort it must take to enforce a delegation dress code.
Nonetheless, a number of state delegations are making their collective fashion statements. New Mexico's delegates are in turquoise polo shirts with the state's Zia sun logo. Many Michigan delegates have slipped on football jerseys emblazoned with "Ford" and "48," a tribute to former President Gerald R. Ford, who played center and linebacker for the University of Michigan before representing the state in Congress.
Oklahomans wore tasteful blue blazers for men and women, with a patch bearing the state seal. Mike Sanders, a delegate, said they had been voted best-dressed delegation by NPR twice, in 2012 and 2008.
Greg Treat, a delegate from Oklahoma City, said there was a debate this year about switching the color of the blazers to advance the state's claim to be the most Republican in the nation. "Several states claim to be the reddest state in the union,'' he said, "but because we had all 77 counties go red, we talked of having red blazers." Tasteful navy prevailed. 
West Virginians are making a political statement in black coal miner's hats. "We have a war on coal in this country," said Brian Long, a delegate, blaming President Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency for regulations making it harder to mine coal and run coal-fired power plants. "We're proud of our coal mines and coal miners," he said.
No surprise, the delegation making the loudest statement with its outfits is Texas. Almost all 155 members are in white straw cowboy hats and loose shirts patterned like the state flag, with a large lone star stamped over the right breast.
"Texans are proud, and we always wear our colors with pride," said Janis Holt, a delegate from Silsbee, Tex. 
And because the unofficial Texas motto might be "too much ain't enough," the delegation will retire Tuesday's uniform and pull out a second uniform for Wednesday night's activities.

7:17 P.M. | R.N.C. Uses Obama 2008 Theme Song
Delegates at the Republican National Convention are being serenaded with the song "Signed, Sealed, Delivered," a Stevie Wonder hit from 1970.
They are swaying and signing along as the convention's evening session gets under way.
But they might be a bit aghast if they realized that the song also has another provenance: it was the theme song for Barack Obama's 2008 campaign.
Mr. Obama's team played the song all the time on the trail, with Mr. Obama jogging out to a screaming crowd as the music crested.
And then, Mr. Wonder performed the song live - and in person - at, of all places, the 2008 Democratic National Convention.
Maybe Washington politicians can agree on something after all.
- 
7:11 P.M. | Boehner to Serve the Red Meat 
In a night dedicated to sepia toned images of Mitt Romney, House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio dished the red meat to a Republican National Convention united in their dislike for President Obama.
Mr. Boehner mocked the president's record as well as his lofty slogans, past and present.
"His record is a shadow of his rhetoric," he said. "Yet he has the nerve to say that he's moving us forward, and the audacity to hope that we'll believe him."
And he used his own hard-scrabble background as the son of a bar owner who worked the place, to highlight the failures of Obama's presidency. He used the line "throw him out" to try to rally the crowd behind him.
"Believe me when I say I learned how to deal with every character who walked in the door," he said of his experience working in his dad's bar. "So let's say right now, a guy walked into our bar and said, 'the private sector is doing fine.' Well, do you know what we'd do? That's right: we'd throw him out. If a guy walked into our bar and said, 'if you've got a business, you didn't build that,' do you know what we'd do? Throw him out."
The speaker also threw his support behind Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, whom he has known from the first days of his political career but has clashed with in recent years.
"When I met Paul Ryan 22 years ago, he was a student at Miami of Ohio volunteering on my campaign. Soon, he will be our party's nominee for vice president of the United States," he will say. "Who says this isn't the greatest country on Earth?"
- 
6:59 P.M. | Some Delegates Slow to Embrace Romney, Others Warm Up
Denise Nielsen, a Romney supporter and delegate from Ventura County, Calif., acknowledged that many Republicans have been slow to embrace Mr. Romney, attributing it to the many competing ideas and degrees of ideology in the party.
"But in modern-day America, you have to consider what is really feasible, what can we go with?" she said. "As far as being a person of integrity of faith and of someone who has certainly been honorable his entire life, I don't think anyone can assail him on those. People are feeling a lot more comfortable, and his personality is starting to come through."
- 
6:30 P.M. | In Speech, Ann Romney Will Try to Humanize Mitt
Ann Romney will use her prime-time speech at the Republican National Convention to take some of the sheen off her husband's glossy image and try to humanize Mr. Romney with the very real struggles he has faced with dogged determination and inevitable success.
"I read somewhere that Mitt and I have a 'storybook marriage,'" she will say, according to speech excerpts released by the Romney campaign. "Well, in the storybooks I read, there were never long, long rainy winter afternoons in a house with five boys screaming at once. And those storybooks never seemed to have chapters on M.S. or breast cancer."
"A storybook marriage? No, not at all," Mrs. Romney will say. "What Mitt Romney and I have is a real marriage."
Many of the struggles her speech will discuss were not so much his, but hers and his father's. Mrs. Romney has multiple sclerosis and battled through breast cancer. The boot-strap section of the speech will belong to George Romney, Mitt's father who, she will remind viewers, "never graduated from college," and instead "became a carpenter" and slogged his way to head a car company, then become governor of Michigan.
But she will extol the determination of her husband.
"At every turn in his life, this man I met at a high school dance, has helped lift up others," she will say. "He did it with the Olympics, when many wanted to give up. This is the man who will wake up every day with the determination to solve the problems that others say can't be solved, to fix what others say is beyond repair. This is the man who will work harder than anyone so that we can work a little less hard."
Mrs. Romney will not dish red meat to the Republican faithful. From the beginning, she will make clear "I want to talk not about what divides us, but what holds us together an American family," love.
But the speech promises a rousing payoff.
"This man will not fail, this man will not let us down," she will promise. "This man will lift up America."
- 
6:29 P.M. | Ryan Is Officially the Vice-Presidential Nominee
Steve King, the national committeeman for Wisconsin, placed Paul D. Ryan's name into consideration to be nominated to be the vice-presidential nominee. Republicans quickly agreed to Mr. Ryan's selection by acclamation, avoiding a long roll-call vote like the one for Mitt Romney. Mr. Ryan is scheduled to deliver his address to the convention on Wednesday night.
- 
6:03 P.M. | Paul Supporters Criticize Process, Party and Rules
Earlier in the day, what was supposed to be a slow, orderly and only symbolic process erupted in anger, presenting a raucous scene that even the most seasoned delegates had not seen in some 30 years, an unexpected scene of disunity that, if for only a moment, harkened to the early days when conventions actually decided things.
Chanting "point of order" at the top of their lungs, the activists - almost all of them Ron Paul supporters - said that the party leadership had shut off their microphones and cut off their ability to raise an objection to the processes seating delegates and approving a new set of disputed rules pushed by the Romney campaign. None was louder than the Texas delegation, which drew extra attention to itself in the hall with cowboy hats and Texas-flag, button-down shirts.
The activists said they had built enough support in enough states to push a reversal of a party decision against seating several Ron Paul supporting delegates, and, more significantly, to submit a proposal rejecting the new rules pushed by the Romney campaign - which were approved in a thunderous voice vote - in a roll call vote.
"We got smushed,'' said Robert Tyree, a Nevada delegate.
A fellow Paul supporter from Nevada, Cindy Lake, fumed at being shut down, saying, "They said to us, you have no voice anymore, the Tea Party has no voice,'' adding, "This is a completely draconian disenfranchisement by the elite of the rank and file."
Activists on the floor here - dotted with the old fashioned placards marking each state delegation in red white and blue - said that earlier the rules committee deciding on the Romney rules proposal limited discussion, to reduce opposition. Mr. Romney's campaign had sought to tighten rules to ensure that a candidate who wins a state primary gets guaranteed support from the delegates they win.
Delegate apportionment varies by state, but under the current rules some states allow supposedly "bound" delegates to switch allegiance to another candidate on the convention floor - a system that helped persuade Mr. Paul, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich to stay in the nominating competition even as their losses in primaries and caucuses mounted.
On Tuesday night, a group of activist leaders and Romney officials struck a compromise, but some activists complained that it still gave party leaders in Washington power to change the rules again between national conventions.
That compromise won approval at a rules committee meeting in the afternoon, but Paul supporters said that was after limited discussion. And some of the activists said their leading champions - including the activist Morton Blackwell - were not able to attend the meeting due to transportation concerns, which some cast as suspicious.
"This is a return to smoke-filled rooms," said Steve Dickson, a delegate from Oklahoma.
Even after their cause - which included a desire by some to literally submit Mr. Paul's name for nomination - was quashed, Mr. Paul's fans screamed out their support every time a state announced some of its votes were going for Mr. Paul.
- 
5:43 P.M. | Delegates Officially Nominate Romney
Mitt Romney has officially become the Republican presidential nominee after New Jersey cast all of its ballots for him, giving him more than half of the delegates gathered in the hall.
The large screen on the platform in the convention hall read "Over the Top," as the crowd chanted "Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!" The many screens in the hall showed pictures of Mr. Romney and his family.
The moment was entirely expected after a divisive primary process in which Mr. Romney slowly but effectively pulled away from his rivals.
But the moment - unique to America's democracy - is nonetheless historic. Mr. Romney is now the leader of the Republican Party and its best hope to retake over leadership in Washington.
The crowd erupted immediately upon the announcement that Mr. Romney had clinched the nomination - an image of unity that Mr. Romney's campaign had long looked forward to.
Mr. Romney will formally accept the nomination on Thursday night.
- 
5:42 P.M. | Nevada Splits
The Nevada delegation gave 17 delegates to Mr. Paul, 5 to Mr. Romney, with 5 abstentions. Getting close.
- 
5:35 P.M. | Tonight's Lineup
The schedule of speakers Tuesday evening is a parade of who's who's and who's that's, but there is a discernible logic to the lineup, which begins at 8 p.m. Each hour conforms to a theme, which must have made easier the jobs of schedulers. It begins with a procession of Republican governors, who, like gymnasts from the same team at the Olympics, seem stacked so that the top talent goes later.
Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire leads off, followed by Governors John R. Kasich of Ohio, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Bob McDonnell of Virginia and, finally, Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a party hero for his defiance of public employees' unions and survival of a recall election this year.
Diversity is the theme of the 9 p.m. hour. It starts with Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, and continues with Sher Valenzuela, a candidate for lieutenant governor of Delaware; Ted Cruz, the Tea Party-supported Senate candidate in Texas who won an upset primary; Artur Davis, a former Alabama congressman who switched allegiance from the Democratic Party this year, and Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina.
The final hour at 10 p.m. leads off with Lucé Vela Fortuño, the first lady of Puerto Rico, where Mitt Romney won a crucial primary victory. Mrs. Fortuño will introduce Ann Romney for a much-anticipated speech. Mr. Romney is expected to make an appearance onstage with her. 
Finally, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey will give the keynote speech.
- 
5:32 P.M. | Iowa Goes to Paul
Rick Santorum and Mr. Romney pretty much tied in the Iowa caucuses, kicking off the Republican primary season, but don't tell that to Iowa's delegates at the Republican National Convention.
Iowa gave 22 of its votes to Ron Paul, the libertarian firebrand whose followers have been undaunted by his losses. Six went to Mr. Romney.
Iowa was one of several delegations taken over by Paul supporters. Another, Maine, split its vote: 14 to Mr. Romney, 10 to Mr. Paul. They have made noise on the floor, but are not about to deny Mr. Romney his nomination.
- 
5:19 P.M. | State Roll Call Vote Under Way
The roll call of states has begun, with Alabama's representative declaring the state to be "on the move" and casting its votes for Mr. Romney.
The roll call vote will go on for more than an hour as the states vote, in alphabetical order, until Mr. Romney has received enough votes to officially claim the nomination.
Some presidential campaigns in the past have engineered the roll call so that a candidate's home state becomes the one to put them over the top and earn the nomination.
A top aide to Mr. Romney said that the campaign did not intend to do that tonight. Instead, the campaign plans to let the voting go in alphabetical order.
The adviser estimated that a state beginning with an "N" would probably put Mr. Romney over the top.
- 
5:11 P.M. | 'Warmth' Is the Order of the Day
With the five Romney boys making the rounds and Ann taking center stage, the order of the Republican National Convention's first day of activities was to warm up Mitt Romney's image - to make delegates like him a lot, if not love him.
But talk to the delegates and Republican pooh-bahs that appeal has been aimed at. The predominate feeling is, warmth? Meh.
"I'm thrilled to have a businessman running for president, period," said Amanda Adkins, 37, chairwoman of the Kansas Republican Party, who went to the convention floor dressed as Dorothy from "The Wizard of Oz," beside another delegate who came as the Wicked Witch of the West and another as Glinda the Good Witch. The whole push to warm up the nominee is a "distraction from what really matters," she said.
That attitude came up again and again in interviews with delegates. Few said that Mr. Romney was a warm, likable figure. They just didn't much care.
"I don't care if he's warm and fuzzy," said Donna Hamilton, 74, a delegate from Washington State. "He's intelligent."
More professional politicians conceded there was good reason to burnish his image. Representative Brett Guthrie, Republican of Kentucky, said he spent time with the nominee for the first time a couple of weeks ago in Evansville, Ind. His wife turned to him in surprise to say Mr. Romney was a really nice guy.
"The warmth just doesn't come out" on television, Mr. Guthrie said. "If he could meet every single American, he'd win in a landslide."
"This is Mitt Romney's opportunity to show he has the vision to show where to lead America," said Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, who readily conceded that the warmth thing wasn't shining through. "It's not enough to say the president has failed."
- 
5:05 P.M. | Sununu Places Romney's Name Into Consideration
John Sununu, the former governor of New Hampshire, placed Mitt Romney's name into consideration to be the party's presidential nominee, officially setting off the roll call vote of states.
"Mitt Romney knows how to fix the unfixable," Mr. Sununu said to an enthusiastic crowd. "Mitt Romney is the right man at the right time and will be a great leader for our country."
"It is my honor to nominate Mitt Romney for the office of president of the United States of America," he added, putting in motion what he called "the final phase of our campaign."
Mr. Sununu's nomination was seconded by Barbara Comstock, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates.
It was also seconded by Ron Kaufman, a long-time Republican committeeman and a friend and adviser to Mr. Romney.
"If ever there was a time that Americans need to be inspired to be better today than they were yesterday, it is now," Mr. Kaufman said. "The time has come for a new day in America. The moment is now. That man is Mitt Romney."
- 
4:48 P.M. | Romneys Arrive at Convention in Tampa
Mitt Romney's six-year quest for the Republican presidential nomination will culminate Tuesday afternoon when the 4,400 delegates gathered here in Tampa, Fla., officially make him their choice to reclaim the White House from President Obama and the Democrats. The roll call vote will be followed by an evening of speakers, including Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Read more ...

HEADLINE: In Keynote Speech, Christie Asks Country to Face Hard Truths

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey on Tuesday extolled Mitt Romney as an exceptional leader, and as the right man to take the country in a different direction. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Chris Christie, the sharp-tongued governor of New Jersey, on Tuesday extolled Mitt Romney as an exceptional leader willing to speak hard truths to a nation weary of President Obama's policies and ready to make a much-needed change.
"It's time to end this era of absentee leadership in the Oval Office and send real leaders to the White House," Mr. Christie said, according to prepared remarks. "America needs Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, and we need them right now."
In delivering the keynote address at the Republican National Convention, Mr. Christie demonstrated his trademark bluntness -- crediting his mother for teaching him how to speak "without much varnish" -- but he did not lash out in personal ways at Mr. Obama, hardly mentioning the president by name. 
Instead, Mr. Christie reserved his sharp words for a tough contrast between the Republican approach to solving problems and a Democratic approach that he said would continue to fail to turn around the American economy and the country's broken political system. 
He accused Democrats of ignoring the truth about the country's economic difficulties and of wanting people to be coddled by "big government."
"Their plan: Whistle a happy tune while driving us off the fiscal cliff, as long as they are behind the wheel of power," Mr. Christie said.
Mr. Christie had been considered a top prospect to be Mr. Romney's running mate. He also briefly considered running for president himself this year, but ruled it out, concluding that he was not yet ready to assume the office.
The Romney campaign picked Mr. Christie to deliver the keynote address for his reputation as a straight-talking governor who has little patience for those who question his resolve.
But his aggressive style, which has led critics to brand him as a bully -- he has called people "stupid" and "idiots" -- was not on display in the hall. Nor was his anti-union fervor, which has emerged through his battles with the labor movement in his state.
Mr. Christie did offer some sharp jabs at Mr. Obama that whipped up the partisan crowd in the hall.
"It takes leadership that you don't get from reading a poll," Mr. Christie said, directing his remarks at Mr. Obama. "You see, Mr. President - real leaders don't follow polls. Real leaders change polls."
But primarily, the speech offered a challenge to the country to change course from an administration that he said was letting the nation's economy drift. He said the status quo must change, and he praised Mr. Romney as the right man to take the country in a different direction.
In describing the current crisis with the political system, Mr. Christie did not mince words or spare many, even those in his own party who he said had contributed to growing debt, a slowing economy and an inability to get anything done.
"Our leaders today have decided it is more important to be popular, to do what is easy and say 'yes,' rather than to say 'no' when 'no' is what's required," Mr. Christie said. "It's been easy for our leaders to say not us, and not now, in taking on the tough issues. And we've stood silently by, and let them get away with it."
Drawing on his two years as New Jersey's governor, Mr. Christie said the nation could do better. He said he had learned to work across the aisle with Democrats -- a claim that many in the other party would dispute.
He said that national politicians like Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, must be willing to tell the hard truths to the American people about the future of popular entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security. Voters will reward them for it, he said.
"If you're willing to hear the truth about the hard road ahead, and the rewards for America that truth will bear, I'm here to begin with you this new era of truth-telling," he said.

HEADLINE: In Speech, Ann Romney Plays to the Heart

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Mrs. Romney used her prime-time speech at the Republican National Convention to try to take some of the sheen off her husband's glossy image. 

 BODY:
Ann Romney introduced her husband Tuesday night to the nation and to the Republican Party that had nominated him as president with a rousing speech that exhorted Americans, "You can trust Mitt."
"This man will not fail. This man will not let us down. This man will lift up America," she told the Republican National Convention to a series of sustained ovations, capped by the emergence of Mitt Romney from behind the stage for a quick, chaste kiss and the nominee's first acknowledgment of the convention.
Mrs. Romney used her prime-time speech to try to take some of the sheen off her husband's glossy image and to humanize Mr. Romney with the very real struggles he has faced with determination and inevitable success.
"I read somewhere that Mitt and I have a 'storybook marriage,'" she said. "Well, in the storybooks I read, there were never long, long rainy winter afternoons in a house with five boys screaming at once. And those storybooks never seemed to have chapters on M.S. or breast cancer."
"A storybook marriage? Nope, not at all," she said. "What Mitt Romney and I have is a real marriage." 
But despite her pledge to avoid politics and speak to the nation about love, Mrs. Romney hit most of the themes that her husband and his party have used to best President Obama: a flailing economy; struggling Americans, especially women; and a choice voters must make between failure and something new.
"We're too smart to know there aren't easy answers, but we're not dumb enough to accept that there aren't better answers," she said.
Mrs. Romney entered the hall with a difficult but critical task: Transfer some of her innate likability to her husband, who even Republicans readily concede lacks a natural bonhomie.
"The warmth just doesn't come out" on television, said Representative Brett Guthrie, Republican of Kentucky, who spent time with Mr. Romney for the first time two weeks ago and professed surprised at how nice he was.
Many delegates gathered in the convention hall said they didn't care if their nominee was "warm and fuzzy," as Donna Hamilton, 64, a Washington State delegate put it. But more professional politicians in the audience, like Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, said the entire Romney family has this week to soften the nominee's edges and make him more accessible to independent and undecided voters.
Many of the struggles Mrs. Romney detailed were not so much his, but hers and his father's. She has multiple sclerosis and battled through breast cancer. The bootstrap section of the address belonged to George Romney, Mitt's father who, she reminded viewers, "never graduated from college," and instead "became a carpenter" and slogged his way to head a car company, then governor of Michigan.
But she did extol the determination of her husband.
"At every turn in his life, this man I met at a high school dance, has helped lift up others," she said. "He did it with the Olympics, when many wanted to give up. This is the man who will wake up every day with the determination to solve the problems that others say can't be solved, to fix what others say is beyond repair. This is the man who will work harder than anyone so that we can work a little less hard."
In a striking red dress, she walked out to a thunderous standing ovation. Pictures of a young Mr. Romney and his family were projected behind her. And the images of family ran throughout a speech overtly geared to women. For the moment, Mr. Romney's deficit with women has kept him tied or marginally behind Mr. Obama in most national polls. Tightening the gender gap is the key to a Romney victory in November.
"I love you, women," she shouted.
And she tried to set up a firewall against Democratic attacks on her husband's time at Bain Capital and the wealth he has amassed.
"Let's be honest, if the last four years had been successful, do we really think we'd be seeing these attacks on Mitt's success?" she asked.

HEADLINE: Charlotte Wakes Up Bankers' Taste Buds

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C.
THE first thing dedicated eaters heading here for the Democratic National Convention need to know is that this isn't a barbecue town.
North Carolina is a barbecue state, certainly. You've got your Lexington style, with its wood-smoked pork shoulders dressed up in a sauce of vinegar and pepper mellowed by ketchup. Then you've got your eastern style, where they pull meat from the whole hog and forgo the ketchup in the sauce. What kind of coleslaw should go on top of a pork sandwich, the pedigrees of pit masters and who is burning what kind of wood all make for an unending game of compare and contrast in many parts of North Carolina.
But barbecue in Charlotte? To paraphrase what the noted barbecue expert John Shelton Reed once told The Associated Press, looking for good barbecue in Charlotte is akin to seeking out great gumbo in Minneapolis.
Charlotte is a city still figuring out what kind of food town it wants to be. Banking is king here, and for years many restaurants catered to a Dockers and oxford shirt sensibility with an eye to the banker's expense account. 
Since the late 1990s, much of the growth in restaurants centered in the shiny new expanses of the Uptown neighborhood, which was filling with condominiums and tall, glass-wrapped banking headquarters. But the odd pairing of the local food movement and the roundhouse punch delivered by the financial crisis has done much for the character of a city used to playing it safe.
''I tell people visiting Charlotte that they shouldn't get blinded by the familiar chain and steakhouses everywhere,'' said Vani Hari, likely the only official delegate at the convention who is both a banking consultant and a food blogger. ''It's not who we are. We have good food, I swear!''
She ticks off a list of favorite restaurants. There is the old-school Southern excellence of Price's Chicken Coop, where a really great dark-meat dinner with a side of fried livers costs about $10, and newer takes, like Luna's Living Kitchen with its raw coconut yogurt parfaits. You can also find her at Good Food on Montford, where the menu offers steamed buns with pork belly and pickles or shrimp arepas with red cabbage slaw -- modern takes on familiar Southern flavors.
The city, North Carolina's largest, has long lived in the culinary shadow of the Raleigh-Chapel Hill area to the east and of Charleston, its charming Southern sibling a couple of hundred miles away in South Carolina.
They won't say it publicly, but Democratic staff members who started moving to Charlotte last year to prepare were concerned about how they were going to survive eating here for a year.
Now, ask one of them where to eat and the lists pour forth. Kristie Greco, the communications director for the Democratic National Convention Committee, who likes to eat almost as much as she loves politics, sent me a list with nearly 30 places she thought I should check out.
''Like mushrooms springing to life after a forest fire, it seems a serious food scene has emerged in Charlotte in the recovery from the economic crisis,'' she wrote. ''A lot of culinary ventures are so recent that a large number of long-term Charlotteans have not even explored the offerings.''
The food rally was certainly helped by a Johnson & Wales campus that opened in 2004 and small, delicious strides in locally made food like cheese and chocolate. Farmers and cooks found each other, and the whole town just seemed to be interested in expanding how it ate.
''We have always been a sleepy small town but a moneymaking mecca, so you never heard too much about the community or the food scene,'' said Cassie Parsons, who opened Harvest Moon Grille in Uptown in 2010. ''Just in the last few years, it's been a lot of fun to watch it.''
She's the undisputed queen of local food in Charlotte, running Grateful Growers Farm in nearby Lincoln County with her partner, Natalie Veres, who tends to the 100 or so Tamworth pigs they raise and process. Ms. Parsons cooks them and spreads the gospel.
The new 7th Street Market is a short walk from her restaurant in the Dunhill Hotel (which has been completely booked by the convention committee in anticipation of a mystery guest everyone is hoping will be the president).
Among the market vendors, one can find a perfect pour-over from Not Just Coffee, pizza with wheat grown in North Carolina from Pure Pizza, and well-sourced produce and protein from a little farm stand and butcher.
The fledgling market is inside the security zone for the convention, which might be the best or the worst thing that could have happened to it.
Trucks can deliver food only between midnight and 6 a.m. Employees need security clearance. Jon Stewart is rumored to be setting up shop next door for the duration. It's going to be busy.
Fran Scibelli, a recovering Washington lawyer turned baker who returned to Charlotte five years ago to open Fran's Filling Station, recently added a smaller version of her restaurant to the market.
Like most of the well-regarded cooks in town, she is booked with catering for the convention, worrying about how she will get her food from the kitchen and through security checkpoints.
And she's trying to dance the fine line between great food and the corny themes that seem to come with conventions. (The city's menus are fast filling with chocolate truffles shaped like donkeys and cocktails served on the ba-rocks.)
One of her tasks is to develop a vampire-themed party for a health care company trying to make a dry topic interesting enough for delegates. She will have meat on a stake and garlic dipping sauce, and some kind of cocktail that evokes blood.
Ms. Scibelli opened one of the first artisan bakeries in the city in 1994, when ''people here did not know from crusty bread,'' she said. From then until recently, much of the food in Charlotte stayed maddeningly safe.
''If I saw one more pan-roasted chicken breast,'' she added, ''I was going to kill myself.''
Now she's seeing more carefully made food. But she's concerned that the new Southern cuisine trend is going too far. ''It's like some experiment for the chef, all that liver mush blah blah blah, and bacon this and grits where they don't belong.''
And even though Ms. Scibelli might be more skeptical than some about the convention, politics and food (she is from the East Coast, after all), she's willing to concede that the sleepy banker's town has become a much better place to eat.
''Not even I can argue with you on that,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Banks' Financial Health Improves, F.D.I.C. Says

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The American banking industry's earnings rose 20.7 percent in the second quarter, as banks set aside less money to guard against losses and increased lending, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported Tuesday. 
But revenue growth remained sluggish, said the F.D.I.C.'s acting chairman, Martin Gruenberg, as JPMorgan Chase's multibillion-dollar trading loss weighed on the quarter's results.
The F.D.I.C. quarterly report showed the banking industry earned $34.5 billion in the second quarter, up $5.9 billion from a year earlier. The amount banks set aside to guard against losses reached a five-year low, declining $5 billion or 26 percent from the second quarter of 2011.
Banks increased lending during the second quarter by $102 billion, or 1.4 percent, after curbing lending in the first quarter. Mr. Gruenberg called the shift encouraging.
''The banking industry continued to make gradual but steady progress toward recovery in the second quarter,'' Mr. Gruenberg said. But he cautioned that ''we will have to wait and see if the trend toward increased lending can be sustained.''
Mr. Gruenberg also highlighted the banking industry's paltry revenue growth, with net operating revenues increasing only $1.3 billion, or 0.8 percent, over the same quarter last year.
A $4.7 billion decline in trading income, led by the huge JPMorgan trading loss in London, partially explained the weakness, he said.
Without JPMorgan's trading results, Mr. Gruenberg said. ''I think it would have been clearly a stronger picture.''
In May, JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, disclosed that a botched hedging strategy had led to a risky bet, which is estimated to have cost the bank at least $5.8 billion.
Over all, bank earnings also continued to face pressure from slim interest rate margins, which decreased in the second quarter from a year ago. ''In the current environment of extremely low interest rates, older, higher-yielding assets are maturing and are being replaced by lower yielding investments,'' Mr. Gruenberg said.
Troubled loans, those 90 days past due, fell again for the ninth quarter in a row, decreasing by 12.9 billion or 4.2 percent, the F.D.I.C. said.
James Chessen, chief economist at the American Bankers Association, said the industry was gaining strength. But, he said, lingering barriers to borrowing hamper banking and economic growth.
''One of the consequences of really low interest rates is borrowers know there is no urgency to borrow. They can wait for the next two years and see what happens with the debt levels in the U.S., what happens to their foot traffic,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Fatal Slip On the Stairs Cuts Short A Life at 29

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

 BODY:
Just months ago, she was studying the translucent flesh of squid bought at a fish market, in the hope of replicating their gleam in the giant, handcrafted model she was making for a special exhibit on bioluminescence at the American Museum of Natural History.
Her final model of the Vampire Squid, made of linen smeared with liquid plastic, was so lifelike that it was singled out in the museum's quarterly magazine. A few pages later in the same issue is a photo of the meticulous model maker at a museum gala -- Carlisle Champalimaud, looking like a starlet, beaming in a flame-colored floor length dress, her husband in a tuxedo by her side. 
This week Ms. Champalimaud was found dead, covered in her blood, on a landing in a building on the Lower East Side where she was staying with a friend. The police initially thought she had been attacked, but the city's medical examiner found that the injuries to her head had been sustained in an accidental tumble -- the result, it may be, of a combination of high heels, a heavy bag and slippery stairs.
With her ready smile and glamorous looks, Ms. Champalimaud, 29, the daughter of a prominent former city official, was a natural fit with the society Web sites that featured photos of her snapped at galas, charity events and gallery openings. But her life had recently begun to unravel: just a few months after the museum gala, Ms. Champalimaud and her husband separated after less than a year of marriage, though each had professed hope they could work things out.
''It was a difficult period,'' said her husband, Anthony Lindley Champalimaud, 34, who is a vice president of real estate development for a Malaysian conglomerate and was in England when he heard the news that his wife had died. ''We were intensely engaged with one another, but just needing space. It was not obvious where it would end.''
The days leading up to her death had been particularly painful. She had attended a wedding in Washington, D.C., over the weekend, just a week after her first wedding anniversary.
Her father, James R. Brigham Jr., who was New York City's budget director during the financial crisis in the late 1970s and is now the chairman of an investment bank based in St. Louis, said she had been distraught, and that he had traveled to New York that morning to help her cope. ''She said it was a really difficult weekend,'' he said. Blond and witty, Ms. Champalimaud, who studied studio art at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Va., loved the outdoors. She was an avid rafter, went on dinosaur digs, and was delighted when she parlayed an internship at the Natural History Museum into paid freelance work, cataloging thousands of specimens of fossilized mammals and fabricating exotic creatures.
Not long after her first date with Mr. Champalimaud, a longtime family friend, she agreed, on the spur of the moment, to accompany him on a 10-month work deployment to a remote town in Japan. He proposed after they returned. They married last year at St. George's, the seaside boarding school Mr. Champalimaud attended, in Newport, R.I. Three months ago, they separated.
The morning of her death she was staying at the Orchard Street apartment of a friend, John Madtes, an old college housemate. The reason, her father said, was that she had misplaced the keys to her own apartment.
Ms. Champalimaud had returned from the Washington wedding early that morning and had headed with Mr. Madtes to the Sixth Ward, a nearby bar, according to a patron who said he knew Mr. Madtes but declined to give his name. It is unclear whether alcohol played a role in her death; the results of toxicology tests will not be available for several weeks, Grace Brugess, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office said.
On Monday morning Ms. Champalimaud was planning to meet her father for lunch. As he drove into the city from La Guardia Airport they talked by phone, first at 9:25 and then at 9:30, he said. Shortly afterward, her body was found by a 19-year-old neighbor, at the foot of the stairway. She was dressed entirely in white, with the contents of a large, clothing-stuffed weekend bag around her, according to interviews he gave NBC News and other outlets. Her father arrived just after the ambulance left the building.
''It's just devastating, it's so unspeakably difficult,'' he said. ''I've received 100 e-mails, and almost to a person everyone says I don't know what to say. And I don't either, in a way. It's just devastating to lose such a beautiful creature.''

HEADLINE: Shift in Connecticut Senate Race as Democrat Is Put on Defensive

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME; Patrick Skahill contributed reporting.

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN -- Representative Christopher S. Murphy has been at once the other guy -- the largely unknown subject of attack ads by his Republican rival, Linda E. McMahon -- and the Democratic nominee who was presumed to be the heavy favorite in the Senate race to replace Joseph I. Lieberman.
But a funny thing has happened in Connecticut as the political world has focused on Missouri, Massachusetts, Virginia and the few other states considered likely to determine which party controls the Senate. Battered by Ms. McMahon's advertisements before he even became the nominee, Mr. Murphy has found himself on the defensive in a race that could add an unexpected wild card into the battle for the Senate.
Mr. Murphy, who defeated a 24-year incumbent, Representative Nancy Johnson, in 2006 to represent Connecticut's Fifth Congressional District, says he is not surprised that polls now show a tight race in a state where Republicans have not elected a senator since Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in 1982. Several months ago, polls showed Mr. Murphy well ahead of Ms. McMahon in a hypothetical matchup. 
''We've always known this race was going to be close,'' Mr. Murphy said before a luncheon with voters here, adding that Ms. McMahon has spent approximately five times as much on television ads as he has. ''And Connecticut has a history of pretty competitive statewide races, so I'm confident I'm going to win, but I don't think it's going to be a blowout.''
A Quinnipiac University poll of 1,472 likely voters that was released on Tuesday showed that Ms. McMahon was favored by 49 percent and Mr. Murphy by 46 percent, essentially tied, given that the poll's margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points. She led 54 percent to 42 percent among men. Among women, Mr. Murphy got 50 percent to Ms. McMahon's 46 percent.
Most positive for Ms. McMahon is the increase in her favorability ratings. Though she was once viewed unfavorably by almost 50 percent of the voters, the newer poll showed her being seen favorably by 47 percent and unfavorably by 35 percent, reflecting, in large part, ads focusing on her family, humble beginnings and success overcoming early business struggles. The results reflect the degree to which she has dominated the airwaves and political conversation after spending more than $65 million, almost all of it her own money, beginning with her 2010 race.
In addition to the ads reintroducing herself, she has hit Mr. Murphy repeatedly with ads saying that during the financial crisis, in his first term, he missed 80 percent of subcommittee meetings on financial issues. He responded in his own ad and in statements that he voted on 97 percent of committee business and that many of the meetings he missed were when Congress was not in session and he was back in the district.
But the exchange left him responding to her charges, so the results of the Quinnipiac poll came as no surprise to political observers in the state and to Connecticut Democrats who have been quietly fretting that Ms. McMahon's shrewd use of her millions was creating a juggernaut fully capable of winning the race. Republicans have to gain four seats to take control of the Senate, or three if Mitt Romney wins, which would make Paul Ryan, as vice president, the tiebreaker vote. Mr. Lieberman, who is retiring, is an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.
''What's clearly happening is that McMahon is winning the game of define-your-opponent,'' said Gary L. Rose, a professor of politics and government at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn. ''She's controlling the tempo of this campaign, not him.''
There are many reasons for Democrats to remain optimistic.
Ms. McMahon spent $50 million to try to win the seat in 2010, only to lose to a former Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, by 12 points in a year that saw Republicans make large gains nationwide. This time, President Obama, who won the state by 22 points in 2008, is at the top of the ticket.
And Mr. Murphy, 39, is an attractive rising star in the party, who has won handily since defeating Ms. Johnson in the most Republican-leaning district in the state. A lawyer who practiced real estate and banking law, he served eight years in the Connecticut General Assembly, four in the House and four in the Senate before going to Washington. If he wins, he would rank at or near the bottom of the Senate in terms of personal wealth. She would be at or near the top.
Mr. Murphy, whose campaign has spent about $3 million so far, has focused on manufacturing, health issues and crafting an image as a progressive Democrat with bipartisan appeal who has been willing to work with Republicans in the House. He says he is proud to put his work in government up against Ms. McMahon's history as the former chief executive of the World Wrestling Entertainment.
''Linda McMahon has spent her career running over people to get ahead,'' he said, adding that what she has billed as a middle-class tax cut would reduce her own tax bill by $7 million. ''She's made it very clear who her priority will be if she is elected to the Senate, and it will be her.''
But many observers are skeptical that the 2010 race presents a road map for the race now.
The doubts begin with Mr. Murphy's ability to withstand an advertising assault the way Mr. Blumenthal could.
''Dick Blumenthal had 30 years of building a brand that's impeccable in the State of Connecticut,'' said John W. Olson, president of the Connecticut A.F.L.-C.I.O. and a supporter of Mr. Murphy's. ''Murphy works hard, he's a fighter, he's articulate, but he's pretty much an unknown throughout the state.''
The Democrats' control of the state is viewed as somewhat illusory -- about 40 percent of registered voters are independents, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's approval ratings are lagging, and the Democratic Legislature presided over an unpopular tax increase last year. Mr. Obama seems unlikely to approach his victory margin from 2008. The Quinnipiac poll showed him leading Mr. Romney by seven percentage points in the state.
And observers from both parties say that Ms. McMahon, who defeated a former representative, Christopher Shays, in the Republican primary, is skillfully creating a narrative straight out of the good-guy-bad-guy world of wrestling, in which she is the plucky, entrepreneurial outsider and he is the out-of-touch Washington insider.
''Linda McMahon has run a nearly flawless campaign to date,'' said Jerry Labriola, the Connecticut Republican Party chairman. ''She's succeeded in defining Murphy for what he is, a liberal career politician who's accomplished nothing.''
Democrats say that she has had the advantage of having the airwaves mostly to herself. A less one-sided news media campaign, a renewed attention to the seamy aspects of her wrestling past and the Democratic gravitational pull will produce a victory for Mr. Murphy, they say. But interviews in Danbury, in Mr. Murphy's own district, indicated that Ms. McMahon remained the focus of voter attention, not him. Some of that attention was negative.
Joan Harel, an artist who lives there, said she voted for Ms. McMahon in 2010, but would not support her this time. ''I feel like she is trying to buy the election, which she can do,'' she said.
But Melissa Baumgardner, who lives in New Milford, is just the kind of voter that the McMahon campaign needs in a state that Mr. Obama will likely carry: someone who will vote for Mr. Obama and for Ms. McMahon.
Ms. Baumgardner said the image of Ms. McMahon as a hard-working woman resonated with her. ''This is a woman who's been through having to file bankruptcy, who's been poor,'' Ms. Baumgardner said. ''She knows what it's like to be at rock bottom.''
Jennifer E. Duffy, a political analyst with the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan political newsletter, said that the race had been off the national political radar screen but that she expected that to change. She said she planned to re-evaluate her rating of the race as ''likely Democrat'' after the Republican convention.
''This is a race that the Democrats didn't think they would have to spend money on,'' she said. ''They know they do now.''

HEADLINE: $3.5 Million Settlement In Mortgage Bias Case

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
A mortgage company has agreed to pay more than $3.5 million to settle allegations by federal prosecutors that it charged higher interest rates and fees on mortgages to nonwhite borrowers than to whites with similar financial backgrounds, federal officials announced on Tuesday.
Nearly all of the settlement money to be paid by the company, GFI Mortgage Bankers, will go to 600 black and Hispanic borrowers who federal authorities said paid unfairly high rates from 2005 through 2009. The settlement also included a fine of $55,000, the maximum under the federal Fair Housing Act. 
The company, which concentrates on the New York, New Jersey and Florida markets, agreed to develop new policies to reduce the discretion of its loan officers in deciding fees and rates.
''With the settlement we announce today, the hundreds of victims of lending discrimination committed by GFI will be made whole,'' said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, where GFI is based.
GFI, which says on its Web site that it originates more than $1 billion a year in mortgages, admitted that an analysis by the federal government showed that it charged higher rates and fees to black and Hispanic borrowers than to white borrowers.
The settlement was signed for GFI by Abraham Eisner, who has led the company's mortgage business since it was founded in 1983. Mr. Eisner referred questions to a lawyer.
Andrew L. Sandler, a Washington lawyer who represented GFI in the lawsuit, said the company denied that the discrepancy in average rates cited by the government amounted to discrimination. He said the company had wanted to settle the case, but could not afford to do so until the government offered a lower settlement figure last week.
''GFI can now return its full focus to its mortgage lending business,'' Mr. Sandler said.
In court papers, prosecutors said GFI's mortgage business increased rapidly, from 974 mortgages originated in 2005 to 2,270 in 2009, mostly in New York and New Jersey.
The average interest rates it charged to black borrowers each year in the review period were 0.19 to 0.41 percentage points higher than what it charged white borrowers with similar financial backgrounds, prosecutors said. Hispanic borrowers on average paid as much as 0.23 points more than whites.
Fees on the mortgages followed the pattern, with black borrowers paying as much as 1.05 points more than similarly situated white borrowers.
GFI's loan officers could base rates and fees on their analyses of the borrowers' ability to repay, and their compensation structure created an incentive to charge higher rates wherever possible, the government said. The company agreed to remove that incentive and train its officers in objective rate-setting criteria.
Mr. Sandler said the loans in question were not subprime loans, which are more expensive loans created for people whose credit histories make obtaining a traditional loan unlikely.
GFI, which sells the loans it originates, was one of the first mortgage lenders in the city to venture into subprime loans, long before that category of mortgage lending came to be blamed for the financial collapse of 2008.
In a 1997 article in The New York Times about the growing subprime market, Mr. Eisner was quoted on how he had led GFI into a new area that helped more people own homes. He described GFI's expanding subprime business, including ''no-document'' loans, as ''a different mentality, different guidelines; almost like two separate companies.''
''We've created new products for people who have glitches, hairy credit,'' Mr. Eisner said at the time. ''No-doc means all we need is your name, address and Social Security number, depending on your credit history.''
The GFI settlement comes after several larger lenders settled with the Justice Department over similar claims, including a $175 million agreement by Wells Fargo that was announced in July.
''All of this discriminatory lending did not happen in a vacuum,'' said Josh Zinner, who monitors lending bias in the city for the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project. ''There was a huge pattern of this across a whole bunch of mortgage companies and banks.''

HEADLINE: Central Banker Facing a Test

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has helped the euro zone survive August. But can he save September?
This month, Mr. Draghi stared down bearish international traders who were convinced that Europe's common currency project would collapse.
''It is pointless to bet against the euro -- it is pointless to go short on the euro,'' Mr. Draghi said at a news conference on Aug. 2, a week after telling the world that the central bank would do ''whatever it takes'' to save the euro union.
Investors, or at least the ones venturing into the lightly traded markets this month, have taken heed.
Since Aug. 2, the euro is up 3.1 percent against the dollar. More notably, battered stocks and bonds in Spain and Italy have soared. The euro bears have rushed to close out their negative bets, and even some risk-averse traders have piled into assets they previously scorned. 
But it will be September and not the lazy days of August that will truly test Mr. Draghi's market-moving mettle. He will face severe pressure to provide specific details of his plan to shore up the euro zone's weaker members by buying their bonds.
The first big test could come next week, on Sept. 6, when the bank's governing council meets. Afterward, Mr. Draghi will again hold a news conference to try to explain whatever the central bank has or has not done. Bearish traders will be poised to pounce yet again on any signs of waffling.
Worries are also swirling that Germany will refuse to grant Greece the time and resources it is seeking to reduce its debt, something that could push it out of the euro currency bloc. Looming as well is the possibility that a decision from Germany's Constitutional Court, expected on Sept. 12, will rule out German involvement in the region's new bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.
The schism within German policy circles has been revealed in recent days. In an interview with the magazine Der Spiegel on Sunday, the head of the German central bank, Jens Weidmann, who is also on the European Central Bank Governing Council, fiercely criticized any intervention by the European bank in bond markets.
But on Monday, Jörg Asmussen, a German on the E.C.B.'s executive board who was a colleague of Mr. Weidmann in the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, said during a speech in Hamburg that the bank had to buy bonds to stabilize European debt markets.
The stakes are sufficiently high for Mr. Draghi that on Tuesday, the central bank said that he had canceled plans to attend the annual meeting of global central bankers at the end of this week in the United States, citing his workload.
Despite the uncertainties, even the most savage euro bears seem willing for now to give Mr. Draghi the benefit of the doubt. And to the extent that Mr. Draghi can sustain this market mood, he will have resolved a problem that goes to the heart of the long-running euro crisis: how to compel traders to buy and hold euro-denominated stocks and bonds in the region's higher-risk economies.
''You do not go back to the lira or the drachma or whatever,'' Mr. Draghi declared at that same early August news conference. By alluding to the former currency of his home country, Italy, and seeming to put it in the same category of woebegone Greece, Mr. Draghi -- who played a crucial policy role in the euro's creation -- signaled that he was taking the bears' skepticism personally.
''It's like Dirty Harry saying, 'Make my day,' '' said Stephen Jen, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who manages a hedge fund based in London. ''You can't imagine Greenspan or Bernanke saying something like this,'' he said, referring to the previous and current chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan and Ben S. Bernanke. ''It was very Italian and very powerful.''
Mr. Draghi's weapon of choice is more subtle than the Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum favored by Clint Eastwood in the ''Dirty Harry'' movies. But from a financial markets perspective, there is no less firepower in his suggestion that his bank might buy the bonds of countries like Spain and Italy if they committed to tough measures to reduce deficits and revamp their economies.
Since Mr. Draghi took the central bank's reins in Frankfurt last fall, investors have been calling his bluff in this regard. They have been betting that he could not persuade the euro zone's biggest financier, the German central bank, to support any form of sustained bond buying because it would be seen as bailing out spendthrift governments.
But a view is now growing that Mr. Draghi may be on the way to persuading Germany that some form of central bank intervention -- by committing to buy Spanish or Italian bonds when they rise above a certain interest rate, for example -- can be justified. The challenge is to present it as simply one more step toward fiscal union as troubled euro zone members cede more control over their budgets to Brussels.
That is how Axel Merk sees it. Mr. Merk is president and chief investment officer of a mutual fund in Palo Alto, Calif., who manages about $600 million in currency-related investments. Long a euro bear, he began to buy the currency aggressively immediately after Mr. Draghi's news conference, convinced that a policy Rubicon had been crossed.
''By imposing a vision, backed by rules and conditions, Draghi is achieving what politicians are not achieving,'' Mr. Merk said. ''He is basically saying to these countries that 'if you give up control of your budgets, I will buy your bonds.' He is laying out what he will do and holding people accountable. Some might call it genius, but it is really common sense.''
That said, many investors have not altered their core outlook that the currency must weaken over the longer term as economic conditions in the troubled countries deteriorate and richer countries like Germany resist putting up more bailout cash. Some even are pointing to Italy as more of a concern than Spain. Buying bonds may help in the short term, but it does little to address Italy's inability to grow fast enough to pay down its debt, now more than 120 percent of its overall economy.
''The real problem is Italy,'' said Gennaro Pucci, the chief investment officer at PVE Capital, a hedge fund in London with a focus on European bonds. ''The banks are not lending and the debt-to-G.D.P. is going up. The sooner the country asks for help from the I.M.F. the better.''
Over the longer term, such a view may very well be valid. But when it comes to putting money to work in the euro zone, investment perspectives hew very much to the short term. And that, for Mr. Draghi, is the core problem, as frenetic buying and selling by foreign investors sustains a broad climate of fear and uncertainty in the market.
For example, from January through March of this year, investors were net sellers of close to 80 billion euros, ($100.6 billion at the current exchange rate), in euro zone stocks and bonds because of fear that Greece would leave the euro. In May and June, they bought 86 billion euros of euro zone securities as it became clear that a worst case would not materialize. Market mood swings of that sort are not conducive to the sort of long-term capital investment that can sustain economic growth.
For Mr. Draghi, then, the challenge is to persuade the newly optimistic euro zone traders to keep their positions and to persuade others that the waters are again safe for swimming. And to do that, he must persuade them that unlike his predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, he is not hostage to the doctrines that limit the bank's powers of intervention.
''Draghi has put bond buying back on the table, even though there is no solution to the crisis -- and that takes a lot of risk out of the equation,'' said Jens Nordvig, a bond and currency strategist in New York for Nomura. Mr. Nordvig is advising clients to close out bearish euro trades before Mr. Draghi's news conference next week.
''Draghi is perceived to be very pragmatic, and that is what the market respects,'' Mr. Nordvig said. ''The market does not respect dogma. If you are dogmatic in the markets, you will die.''

HEADLINE: China Frets Over Coming Pork Shortage

BYLINE: By NAVEEN THUKRAL | REUTERS

 BODY:
SINGAPORE -- Pigs may seem like an unlikely barometer of inflationary pressure, but in China, declining herds are a matter of concern amid fears that a sharp increase in pork sales could drive consumer prices higher next year.
Faced with sluggish domestic demand and the record cost of fattening animals -- the result of a steep rise in the prices of corn and soybeans as drought grips the top exporter, the United States -- Chinese hog producers are being forced to sell their herds.
China's food price cycle is driven in large part by pork, the country's staple meat. And while it is in abundance now, in about six months, meat stocks are expected to fall as a result of the sell-off, resulting in a surge in prices. 
Any increase in food prices is expected to push up inflation, which now sits at a comfortable level, having cooled from last year.
But inflation is still one of China's biggest economic concerns given the possibility that rising prices might lead to social unrest.
''If you look at corn and soy meal prices in China, the cost of feeding animals is already reaching a record,'' said Jean-Yves Chow, a senior feed industry analyst at Rabobank in Hong Kong.
''We expect pork supplies to decline by early next year if profitability remains depressed, resulting in higher prices, which will fuel food inflation.''
Worried by the state of the pig industry, China's top economic planning agency ordered the stockpiling of frozen pork this month in anticipation of a supply squeeze when consumption peaks during the Lunar New Year next February.
China holds reserves of pork, both live animals and frozen meat, to help stabilize domestic prices during extreme price fluctuations.
The stockpiling is also used to try to curtail food inflation and steady its domestic industry.
In 2007, rapidly rising pork prices became a national concern when the Chinese hog industry, responsible for producing 50 million tons annually -- half the world's pork -- suffered a deadly outbreak of disease.
The resulting jump in pork prices drove food inflation sharply higher, the effects of which were most acutely felt in the poor rural areas, home to about half of the country's 1.3 billion people.
Rising global food prices, fueled by the U.S. drought, have so far had a limited effect on China's consumer price inflation, which fell to a 30-month low in July.
Food prices, which account for about 30 percent of the calculation of the consumer inflation index, rose 2.4 percent in July from a the same month a year earlier, cooling from a 3.8 percent increase in June as pork prices eased.
But as demand for pork weakens and the Chinese economy falters, some analysts say the effect on food prices may be limited.
''The overall economic situation is not sound,'' said Wang Xiaoyue, an analyst with Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultant. ''People dine less at restaurants, and many plants have shut down, which is hurting pork demand.''
Responding to record-high domestic meat prices, hog farmers were busy rebuilding herds at the start of the year. But by the middle of the year, the cost of feed had increased sharply.
Corn and soybeans -- key ingredients in animal feed -- have climbed to all-time highs on the benchmark Chicago futures index as the worst drought in 56 years devastates crops across the Corn Belt in the United States.
The price surge could not have come at a worse time for the livestock industry in China, which imports 60 percent of the soybeans traded in the world and has emerged as the sixth-biggest corn importer.
Small farmers, who account for about 30 percent of China's pork production, have been the first to take a hit as they have struggled to meet rising feed costs.
''We are seeing depressed margins leading to hog and sow liquidation among the small producers in various parts of the country,'' said Mr. Chow of Rabobank. ''It poses real risk to supplies and prices going into early next year.''
In 2007, imports in China and Hong Kong surged because of the shortfall of domestic pork production after herds were decimated by disease. Among the beneficiaries at that time were American farmers.
But U.S. hog farmers are not expected to help meet the shortfall in China this time. U.S. hog futures sank to their lowest levels in 18 months last week amid worries that producers would sell their hogs earlier than usual.

HEADLINE: J. Allen Smith

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Smith, 55, is the chief executive of Prudential Real Estate Investors, a division of Prudential Financial.
Prudential Real Estate Investors has about $50 billion in real estate assets including, in partnership with SJP Properties, 11 Times Square in New York, which is more than half vacant.
Mr. Smith has been chief executive since 2008. 
Interview conducted and condensed by
VIVIAN MARINO
Q. Did you ever think it would take this long to lease up 11 Times Square?
A. Obviously the pro forma for this, when we undertook it, was not that we would be at a position now, in 2012, where the building was 40 percent leased. But that's why real estate development is a risky undertaking. At the time that you are often making these decisions, the markets look buoyant and you have a sanguine outlook on the future.
If we had known it would go on this long, we probably wouldn't have done it.
Q. What's holding tenants back, do you think?
A. I'm not actively involved in the day-to-day activities of 11 Times Square, but my sense is that there are a lot of tenants who are staying where they are. Let's face it: The market has not been great, and I think in general tenants have been relatively cautious in the commitments that they are making.
I don't think -- and others may want to validate this -- that there are large blocks of space, large tenants committing to space that somehow we were consistently losing to because we were mispricing it. There is a dearth of new product on the market that can offer tenants who seek large blocks of space the kind of availability they need.
Q. There's been recent activity on the retail side, with a Russian group signing on for half that space for a restaurant. Has the idea of putting an aquarium there been abandoned then?
A. I think that is an idea that may have gone by the board.
Q. Are there concerns about the building's finances?
A. Look, one of the advantages of having a substantial institutional owner like us holding a project like that is we have the financial capacity to stick with it, work responsibly with our lenders and do the right thing by the building and our investors.
We've restructured the debt and paid it down. The debt is at a level that is very manageable. It's under 50 percent.
Q. Speaking of which, Prudential Real Estate is also an active investor in the debt of various other developments.
A. Investors have a preference for investing directly in large transactions. But they can't always do that and so they're willing to consider managers to facilitate their gaining access to specific sectors of the market. The strategies that we have found them most interested in pursuing with us relate to debt-related strategies.
Since 2008-9, really, we have been positioned to invest in debt-type strategies in Europe, anticipating that there would be very compelling opportunities in that space. People perceive that the equity risk premium given the uncertainty in Europe is just not there, and that, given the distress in the capital markets and the pullback of banks, the opportunities for third parties to provide financing is very compelling.
Q. And what about in the United States?
A. I think the capital flows you see in the U.S. would be toward what I call core real estate. This is equity. They offer preservation of capital, relatively attractive yield and they are very long term. There is a flight to quality -- the best-quality assets are what people are buying.
Q. Is there a property sector that you are particularly bullish on?
A. It would be the apartment sector, where we've been active in financing development of new apartment communities. We've also been a fairly active seller of existing apartments because of high demand from institutional investors. Apartment communities probably represent two-thirds of what we've invested in the United States so far in 2012.
Q. Moving on to your real estate funds. Are you satisfied with the performance this year?
A. Generally they are doing well. That bounce-back in property values has clearly begun to level out. New construction starts are so low that even with an anemic economy -- one bouncing along at 2 percent growth -- the supply-demand fundamentals will continue to improve.
Q. Are there other areas of the world where you are focusing?
A. In terms of emerging markets, probably the market we're most focused on would be China. We have had a presence in Asia for some time that has been skewed toward the more developed markets of Asia -- so Japan, Singapore. In Asia, one of the areas where we have had tremendous success has been investing in shopping centers; we're the second-largest owner of shopping centers in Singapore, believe it or not. And so we have sought to develop a similar capability in China.
Q. So what does the ''J'' stand for in your name?
A. The ''J'' stands for Joel. I was named for a grandfather who was named for a grandfather, so there was a lineage of Joel Allen Smiths, all of whom went by their middle name.
My mother tells a story that when I went to kindergarten, I was registered as Joel Allen Smith, and they called for Joel Smith in attendance. In the middle of kindergarten they called my mother to say that Joel isn't here. And my mother said, ''Well, he doesn't know his name is Joel. He's Allen.''
I have a son named Joel and we call him Allen.

HEADLINE: Cellar Dwellers in Japan Add Pizazz, Not Victories

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
YOKOHAMA, Japan -- It is fair to say that offering discounted tickets to men who come to the ballpark dressed in drag is an unconventional approach to filling seats. The same can be said of teams that offer fans a refund if they are unhappy with the game, even when the home team wins.
The promotions, though, are two of the many ways the hometown BayStars have tried to revive one of Japanese baseball's perennial cellar dwellers. The ideas were the brainchild of the new team executives installed by DeNA, the mobile phone game company that bought a majority stake in the club last winter for 9.5 billion yen, or about $120 million. 
The purchase raised eyebrows not only because of its low price, which was a third of what the least expensive major league team in the United States is worth. DeNA is also a young, high-tech company breaking into the conservative Central League, which is dominated by the Yomiuri Giants, Hanshin Tigers and Chunichi Dragons, teams with deep pockets, grand traditions and a history of beating the BayStars.
DeNA hopes to shake up the old guard by injecting ideas and money into the BayStars, who have finished in last place in the six-team league in 8 of the past 10 seasons. The team has hired an upbeat manager and an innovative general manager, and promoted baseball's rich tradition in and around Yokohama. It also wants to do something that is unique in Japan, where owners treat their teams as promotional vehicles, not moneymakers. DeNA wants to turn a profit within three years.
''I don't know if our changes are drastic or not, but DeNA is a new company that appeals to young people,'' said Jun Ikeda, the team's 36-year-old president, who wore chinos and sneakers and carried a backpack with a laptop inside during an interview. ''We thought we could do something in the baseball world. It could improve our brand.''
DeNA is also using baseball as a way to reach new customers for its mobile games. Its founder was educated at Harvard, and the company is far more international than many owners of other baseball teams. Ikeda said he would travel to the United States to meet with several major league clubs to learn more about how they ran their teams.
The BayStars are not the only Japanese team to seek inspiration overseas to jump-start their clubs. Bobby Valentine helped transform the Chiba Lotte Marines by importing American practices, like renovating the stadium and having the players interact more with the fans. The Nippon Ham Fighters hired American designers to redo their uniforms, and the Softbank Hawks and other teams stream their games on the Internet.
Making money has proved elusive, though. Most teams, including the BayStars, lease their stadiums, often at disadvantageous rates, and their share of the concessions is smaller than what American teams receive. Viewership is low for games that do not include the Giants or the Tigers, and there are no regional sports networks, which are cash cows for American teams.
In their bid for profitability, the BayStars negotiated a new lease deal that cuts in half, to about 13 percent, the part of ticket revenue that it shares with the city of Yokohama, which owns the stadium. The stadium owners keep the revenue from billboards in the stadium, so the BayStars installed an L.E.D. screen above the outfield wall to sell their own ads.
The team has also introduced new promotions. Depending on the day of the week, fans can save 2,000 yen ($25) on an infield reserved seat if they wear a team jersey to the park, if they are older than 60 or younger than 18. Men who dress up like women receive a discount on Thursdays. Hundreds of young men and women have signed up to sit in a special dating section. Fans who show up 90 minutes after the start of the game can get in for less.
The BayStars may have pushed too far, though, when they offered a limited number of fans a refund if the team lost, or a partial refund if the team won or tied (teams stop playing after a certain number of extra innings). The team sold its small allotment of refundable tickets for games in early May. But according to several news reports, the promotion backfired because even when the team won, and the fans were presumably happy, many still asked for their money back.
One newspaper quoted Kiyoshi Nakahata, the manager, saying that the refunds were bad for his team's morale; die-hard fans said the promotion gave the team a bad image.
''It's odd that people would ask for a refund even when the team wins,'' said Yugo Tagomori, 19, who attends about 10 games a year and sits in the outfield bleachers. ''My feeling is these people are not true fans.''
Still, Tagomori and other fans interviewed at a recent game gave the new owners credit for trying to revitalize the franchise, and Nakahata, a chirpy cheerleader, has brightened the mood in the park even though the team is once again in last place. While the BayStars still draw the fewest fans in the Central League, attendance rose 5.3 percent through the first 51 home games compared with the same period last year.
''Our prospects for a title might be weak at the moment, but it's my job to develop a core of players that have the talent to win,'' Nakahata said.
Whether the BayStars can build on this good will is unclear. The team plays in a crowded Kanto region that includes the Giants, the Yakult Swallows and the Seibu Lions. The sagging economy has hurt spending, and younger Japanese are just as likely to play baseball with their video games as watch the sport live.
Still, as Robert Whiting, the author of ''You Gotta Have Wa,'' a history of Japanese baseball, said, ''With 12 teams in Japan, the odds are you'll win once every 12 years.''
The BayStars are overdue. Their last championship was in 1998.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports That Piracy Off Africa Has Plunged

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Acts of piracy in the treacherous waters around the Horn of Africa have fallen sharply in 2012, according to statistics released by the United States Navy. The Navy credits aggressive patrolling by international forces and increased vigilance by the commercial shipping industry for the decrease.
Data released by the Navy last week showed 46 pirate attacks in the area this year, compared with 222 in all of last year and 239 in 2010. Nine of the piracy attempts this year have been successful, according to the data, compared with 34 successful attacks in all of 2011 and 68 in 2010. 
Even so, senior Navy officers have been careful not to declare victory.
''The pirates are very adaptable, and they are very flexible,'' said Vice Adm. Mark I. Fox, the Navy's deputy chief for operations, plans and strategy. ''We are watching carefully.''
The prospect of renewed political turmoil in the region, especially in Somalia and Yemen, may again drive up attempts at the lucrative business of piracy, since lawless areas in these countries provide havens for pirates to launch their raids and to hold captured vessels and hostages. Further economic collapse may prompt more farmers and fisherman to choose piracy.
But the statistics so far this year are encouraging. As of last week, the last successful pirate attack in waters off East Africa had occurred on May 10, and the most recent attempted attack had occurred on June 27. The gap since that last raid represents the longest break in pirate activity in the area in five years.
Navy officers note the seasonal ebb and flow of piracy attacks in the region, influenced by the twice-yearly monsoons, and they warn that in October and November the waters and winds tend to be calmer and that pirate raids increase. But the statistics for 2012 are far below what could be explained by weather alone.
The decrease in attacks appears to be a result of increased security measures taken by commercial vessels and of sustained antipiracy patrols by the navies of more than a dozen nations, including the United States.
Admiral Fox said the shipping industry ''can take a great deal of credit'' for the trend. More commercial vessels are carrying ''embarked security teams'' of armed guards, he said, and no vessel with such a team on board has been hijacked.
Commercial ship captains are also following recommendations that they sail in international transit corridors that the navies patrol. More ships are taking measures to make it difficult for pirates to climb aboard from the waterline.
And American and European forces have conducted a handful of high-profile counterpiracy raids in which hostages have been freed and pirates have been killed or captured. Officials say those raids may be acting as a deterrent.
The effect can be seen in the busy Gulf of Aden, a hunting ground favored by pirates before the United States and other nations began patrolling a 460-mile-long shipping corridor through it. ''It is now one of the safest'' areas, Admiral Fox said.
The multinational counterpiracy effort, called Combined Task Force 151, was organized in 2009 and operates in and around the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea and other areas of the Indian Ocean, with 25 to 30 warships on patrol on any given day. Overseeing the task force is Combined Maritime Forces, which is based in Bahrain along with the Navy's Fifth Fleet. Command of the task force unit itself rotates among participating nations, and it has been held by the United States, Denmark, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey and, most recently, South Korea.
The task force coordinates its efforts with other counterpiracy missions in the region operated by NATO and European Union members, and a number of other nations send out patrols independently.
''Piracy is like an ancient disease that should be extinct in this modern world,'' said Commodore Simon Ancona of the British Navy, who is currently deputy commander of Combined Maritime Forces. ''The cure is difficult and requires the disruption of pirate actions, building law and order and livelihoods ashore, and making the merchant prey less vulnerable. Although there are signs of remission, I would judge the medicine will be required for some time to come.''
Somali pirates in particular have hijacked hundreds of vessels in the past few years, ranging from the sailboat of a retired British couple to a 1,000-foot supertanker.
East African pirates routinely hold seized vessels and hostages for ransom that can run to hundreds of millions of dollars. Commercial shipping officials say that Somali pirates alone cause an additional $5 billion a year in expenses for insurance and security, with piracy in other regions adding billions more to the cost.

HEADLINE: Unleashing Corporate Contributions

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Way back in February of this year, more than two-thirds of Californians believed raising more money from tobacco companies to finance cancer research was a good idea. That was before industry money kicked in.
In just over three months, opponents spent $41 million to defeat the initiative -- a proposition to levy an extra $1 on the sale of a pack of cigarettes -- five times what its supporters spent. On June 5, it was defeated by 50.2 percent to 49.8 percent.
Similar forces in the next couple of months could shape the November elections. All the funds raised for the presidential and Congressional races so far pale in comparison to the money expected to rush in after the party conventions this week and next.
This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court's decision in the Citizens United case removed the last barriers to campaign spending by corporations and other groups. Analysts are bracing for a tidal wave of money from rich individuals, companies and labor unions that could alter the political landscape and transform American democracy. 
Voters have always worried about the role of corporate money in election campaigns. Surprisingly perhaps, there hasn't really been that much.
Gordon Tullock, one of the first social scientists to study the effects of corporate money in politics, remarked 40 years ago that it was a mystery that companies didn't spend much more given the huge potential return of swaying legislators' votes.
Ten years ago, Stephen Ansolabehere, John M. de Figueiredo, and James M. Snyder from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology picked up the theme with a study called ''Why Is There So Little Money in U.S. Politics?'' They noted that campaign spending over the last 100 years had remained stagnant and perhaps even declined as a share of the nation's gross domestic product.
In 2000, the average contribution to a legislator by political action committees associated with unions, companies or industry groups was only $1,700, they found. This was way below the $10,000 legal ceiling and a trivial amount considering the goodies at stake. In 2000 the military procurement budget was $134 billion. Yet military contractors and their employees contributed less than $25 million to the campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
''The discrepancy between the value of policy and the amounts contributed strains basic economic intuitions,'' Mr. Ansolabehere and his colleagues wrote. ''Given the value of policy at stake, firms and other interest groups should give more.''
Even the nearly $4 billion in campaign spending in 2010 pales against the government's $1 trillion in discretionary spending. And corporate money made only a small percentage of the total.
It may seem unbelievable that there has been ''too little'' corporate money in politics. But it makes some sense. Corporations don't give more money because most of the time it isn't really that effective in producing the outcomes they desire.
Some elections -- for example, the mayoral race in New York -- seem to have been decided by a magnate's or a corporation's overwhelming campaign spending. Pressure from Wall Street lobby groups almost certainly contributed to the demise of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had barred banks from engaging in some businesses.
But, over all, there is little evidence that money is effective at swaying legislation or improving the corporate bottom line. One study found that changes in campaign contribution laws from 1971 through 2002 had no impact on the stock price of companies that were heavily engaged in campaign spending.
On the other hand, playing politics can hurt a company's brand. The chief executive of Target had to apologize two years ago when the company's contribution to the campaign of Tom Emmer, the Republican candidate in Minnesota's race for governor and a staunch opponent of gay marriage, led to threats of a boycott of its stores.
Campaign contributions can affect the priorities of elected officials, opening the door for interest group lobbyists. Studies have found that companies that lobby intensely are more profitable, on average, than those that don't. Still, the evidence suggests most companies do not get any return from their lobbying expenditures. And though businesses have historically spent much more lobbying legislators than on campaign contributions, lobbying expenditures also are small compared with the benefits they could reap.
Richard Hall of the University of Michigan notes that interest groups dedicate most of their campaign contributions and lobbying efforts to legislators they already agree with, helping them make their case, and spend little time trying to persuade opponents. And big donors don't have exclusive access to legislators, Mr. Hall found. Legislators also grant access to like-minded interest groups with little money to give.
In a way, this narrative may make more sense than the persistent fear that interest groups are shaping policy by getting their allies elected and telling them what to do.
Money can change the fate of a ballot initiative, such as California's Proposition 29 to place a tax on tobacco sales, because voters have little knowledge of the issue. But most Americans voters start with an opinion about the candidates in a race, especially of incumbents. It is expensive to sway their votes.
Studying Congressional races from 1972 to 1990, Steven Levitt of the University of Chicago concluded that campaign finance had a tiny effect: an extra $175,000 in campaign spending, in today's money, would buy only a third of a percentage point of the final vote.
Mr. Ansolabehere, now at Harvard, and Mr. Snyder reached similar conclusions: a candidate would have to double campaign spending to increase his share of the vote by four percentage points. And this is only if his rival didn't respond by spending more, too. For the typical incumbent in the House, that would mean increasing spending to $1.5 million from $750,000.
The limited impact of money on election outcomes or legislation raises two questions, of course: why do politicians spend such time and effort raising money? And why do companies make donations at all? Maybe politicians fear facing a lopsided race if they disarm unilaterally. Legislators may be able to rustle up corporate contributions without changing legislation simply by hinting at irksome new laws or regulations if the money is not forthcoming.
Still, it provides a better understanding of the role of money in politics. Money doesn't win elections, at least not consistently. And elected officials are unlikely to sell their votes to interest groups that can't guarantee their re-election.
The question is whether this analysis will hold in the new age of easy money. Or whether money will have the same sway in national politics as it did with the tobacco tax proposition in California.
Legal and regulatory changes dating to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law of 2002 have eased the way for independent players to support or attack a candidate with their money. Companies have not made big contributions to ''super PACs'' as allowed by Citizens United, perhaps because of concerns about a possible reaction against their brands. But we can't know how much they are spending: they can give anonymously to so-called 501(c) nonprofits, which are becoming prominent players in the campaign.
The flow of money into politics is rising, already bucking its 100-year trend: campaign spending for the 2008 election amounted to 0.037 percent of the nation's output, up from 0.031 percent in 2000. These new resources could transform elections into something akin to ballot initiatives, where money has a proven track record in molding the outcome.
Until fairly recently, campaign spending in national elections was rather evenly matched. Yet spending by interest groups could easily change that. In 2008 Barack Obama vastly outspent John McCain by refusing federal financing for the first time. Lopsided elections could become the norm when, say, Sheldon Adelson, Philip Morris or the American Federation of Teachers can step in and upset the balance.
A few years ago, West Virginia gave us a taste of what national politics could look like once corporations really take an interest in deploying their cash.
In 2002, a jury in West Virginia ordered the AT Massey Coal Company to pay out $50 million to plaintiffs. During the appeals process, Massey's chief executive at the time, Don Blankenship, got involved in the campaign to unseat a justice on the state's highest court -- spending $3 million of his own money to support an ally, Brent Benjamin.
Of course, he won. When Massey's appeal was heard in 2007 and again in 2008, Justice Benjamin joined 3-2 majorities to overturn the award.
The United States Supreme Court saved West Virginia from this apparent purchase of justice -- but with only a 5-4 majority and on narrow grounds. Justice Benjamin, it ruled, should have recused himself to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. On the broader issue, the attempt to buy power, the court passed.
It will be interesting to see corporate money play out on the national stage. Worried about how the next administration will impose new financial regulations, Wall Street would love to do for Mitt Romney and Congressional Republicans what Mr. Blankenship did for Justice Benjamin. With so many channels to deploy their money, maybe they can.

HEADLINE: Federal Court Finds Texas Voting Maps Discriminatory

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- A federal court in Washington ruled on Tuesday that political maps drawn by the Republican-controlled Legislature in Texas discriminated against minority voters, a decision that black and Hispanic groups claimed as a victory and the state attorney general vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court.
The three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit found that a set of maps for Congressional, State House and State Senate districts drawn by the Legislature failed to comply with part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. They denied granting so-called preclearance to the maps, because in some cases districts drawn to look like Hispanic ones on paper would actually perform to the benefit of candidates preferred by white voters. 
The decision's immediate impact was unclear. It appears unlikely to affect the November elections because those electoral maps were drawn as interim replacements by a federal court in San Antonio. The interim maps were not at issue before the judges in Washington.
Gov. Rick Perry signed the Legislature's maps into law last summer. But the federal court in Washington refused to grant preclearance, prompting the San Antonio judicial panel to create the interim maps to allow this year's elections to proceed. The federal judges in Washington presided over a trial in January and issued their decision on Tuesday.
The Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott, who is representing the state, said he would appeal the decision. ''Today's decision extends the Voting Rights Act beyond the limits intended by Congress and beyond the boundaries imposed by the Constitution,'' Mr. Abbott said in a statement.
Michael Li, an election law lawyer in Dallas who runs a Web site following the case, Txredistricting.org, said that because the Washington court had no power to fix the maps -- only to decide whether to grant or deny preclearance -- the case now moves back to Texas, where the federal judges in San Antonio will most likely fix the problems identified by the Washington court. They also may let the Legislature try to redraw the maps.
The judges in Washington found that one largely Hispanic Congressional district in South Texas that includes Corpus Christi had its minority voting strength diluted when it was redrawn to a majority-Anglo district. In the 23rd Congressional District in West Texas, the judges ruled that drawers ''consciously replaced many of the district's active Hispanic voters with low-turnout Hispanic voters in an effort to strengthen the voting power of C.D. 23's Anglo citizens,'' reducing Hispanic voting power ''without making it look like anything in C.D. 23 had changed.''
The judges found that the Congressional map as a whole was enacted with a ''discriminatory purpose,'' and they cited the concerns of black and Hispanic members of Congress who testified that they were excluded from the process of drafting the maps. In addition, several minority Congress members had the economic generators of their districts and their own district offices removed in the maps, though, as the judges pointed out, ''no such surgery was performed on the districts of Anglo incumbents.''
Lawyers for Mr. Abbott argued that the maps were drawn to help Republicans maintain power but not to discriminate, and that drawers did not know where district offices were located.
State Representative Trey Martinez Fischer, a San Antonio Democrat who is the chairman of the Mexican-American Legislative Caucus, one of a number of black and Hispanic groups that sued the state, called Tuesday's decision a proud moment for voting rights in Texas.
''I think it clearly is a representation of the obvious, of what we have been saying all this time,'' Mr. Fischer said, ''that the face of the state of Texas is changed by the day, yet our political lines and our political representation still represents the views of a very old and different Texas.''

HEADLINE: Victims' Sons in Tough Fight for Redress After China Rail Crash

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Mia Li contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- Henry Cao has stark memories of the moment the high-speed train he was riding rear-ended another last summer in the eastern city of Wenzhou: the pleasantly hypnotic rocking that gave way to a jolt he likened to an earthquake, followed by blackness and the sensation of falling as the car plummeted 100 feet off a viaduct.
''We were flying like rag dolls,'' he said.
The crash killed 40 passengers, injured 191 and shook the nation's confidence in its ambitious high-speed rail system. Mr. Cao, 33, a Chinese-American importer from Colorado, barely survived; he lost a kidney and his spleen, and head injuries have left him mired in a perpetual daze, unable to stay awake for more than an hour or two. His parents, naturalized American citizens taking him on a triumphant tour of their native land, were killed. 
As Mr. Cao has struggled to recover over the past year, he has found himself drained by a different sort of battle: trying to wrest compensation from the Ministry of Railways, an unbending government behemoth unaccustomed to dealing with determined foreign citizens.
This month Mr. Cao returned to China for the first time since the accident. He and his brother, Leo, came to collect their parents' remains and to press negotiations with the ministry. ''They know how to wear you down,'' said Leo Cao, 30. ''First they let you scream and yell, then they stall you, and finally they tell you vague and empty words. Now they say, 'You're lucky you're getting anything.' ''
Their painful and politically fraught odyssey has highlighted the workings of an omnipotent ministry that employs more than two million people and rivals the Chinese military in size and influence. The experience has been disorienting for the Cao brothers, who left China as adolescents two decades ago. ''This place is not how I remember it,'' said Henry Cao, speaking faintly as his eyes flickered and lost focus. ''Everyone is rushing around to make money. Life here is cheap.''
The ministry, which runs its own court system and is largely impervious to oversight, has long been dogged by accusations of corruption. A former rails minister, Liu Zhijun, who was fired five months before the accident, is expected to go on trial next month for charges of taking millions of dollars in bribes and other unnamed ''disciplinary violations.''
Zhang Kai, a lawyer who represented a passenger sentenced to three years in prison for slapping a train conductor, described the ministry as a ''monster left over from the planned economy era'' that resists reform or challenges to its authority. ''It is common knowledge that the ministry is responsible for generating maximum profits while supervising itself,'' Mr. Zhang said.
In a report released in December, government investigators placed the blame for the Wenzhou accident on flaws in signaling equipment. Investigators say the ministry bypassed safety regulations in its haste to create the world's largest high-speed railroad network.
For the brothers' parents -- Cao Erxing and his wife, Chen Zengrong, both 56 -- the return to China was a capstone to lives of toil in New York City sweatshops and restaurant kitchens. The father and mother, neither of whom studied beyond middle school, had left Fujian Province with their boys, taught themselves English and earned enough money to buy a house in Queens. At the time of their death, they were custodial workers at La Guardia Airport.
''They finally felt financially secure enough to take their first vacation,'' Leo Cao said.
His father died at the scene, but his mother survived for two hours, leaving haunting unanswered questions. Did she receive adequate medical care? And who was heartless enough to swipe the $10,000 from the fanny pack fastened to her waist?
In the parlance of Communist Party euphemisms, July 23 has become a ''sensitive anniversary'' -- a day for newspaper editors and columnists to ignore. After a blizzard of coverage in the days after the crash -- including reports of a botched rescue and efforts to bury one of the train carriages -- the censors blocked discussions of the topic on microblog services. Last month, victims' families were warned against holding public memorials.
But the Cao brothers, ignoring such admonitions, have become thorns in the side of the government as they seek financial assistance.
In a series of meetings, ministry officials have offered them $280,000 for the death of their parents and $85,000 for Henry Cao's injuries, the brothers said. The Caos have requested a total of $5 million, based on what they say the three would have earned over 20 years of working in the United States.
Their lawyers say the ministry is ignoring a national law that bases compensation on accident victims' earning power in the area where they lived. The ministry is citing its own regulations that rely on prevailing wages in the province where the crash occurred.
''The representatives tell us there is no room for negotiation,'' said a lawyer for the brothers, Tian Jie. ''Even they admit they don't know who makes the decisions.''
Officials did not respond to a faxed request for comment, and repeated telephone calls to the ministry's office of public information last week were not answered.
Leo Cao said that his brother was too disabled to work and that the offered compensation would not go very far in supporting his four young children and paying for his medical expenses. ''From the outside, my brother looks somewhat normal, but he's half the man he used to be,'' he said.
The ministry's minders stay in the same hotel as the brothers, paying for their accommodations and carrying their luggage. But they frequently call to find out where the brothers are. Negotiators have warned of ''troubles'' that might result from talking to journalists.
This month, as the brothers wept over their parents' coffins at a funeral home in Wenzhou, ministry employees huddled awkwardly. ''If they lose track of us they get scolded,'' Leo Cao later said with weary resignation.
In the hours after the accident, ministry negotiators descended on morgues and hospitals even before the surgeons had finished stitching up the injured. Working in teams of four or five, they separated victims' families into different hotels and relentlessly hammered out deals that in the end were nearly the same: about $140,000 for each fatality.
For the past year, the Cao brothers have angered officials by refusing to remove their parents' bodies from the morgue. Leo Cao, who was completing a doctorate in information sciences at the time of the crash, said he had been partly overwhelmed by the medical needs of his brother.
But he also came to hope the delay might help persuade the ministry to compromise, and also allow a funeral service in the family's ancestral Fujianese village. Officials refused, perhaps fearful it would draw other disgruntled survivors.
Still, the brothers held a makeshift memorial service at the funeral home and then stopped at the site of the crash. Last Wednesday, they arranged for the bodies to be shipped to New York. The funeral, scheduled for Saturday in Queens, is expected to draw hundreds of Fujianese immigrants.
As the talks dragged on, Henry Cao became increasingly withdrawn, saying he was no longer interested in the money and wanted only to return home. He spent most of his last days in China in his hotel room, reading biblical stories that touch on suffering and redemption. ''I want to move on,'' he said, staring at the floor.
But for now, his brother is determined to keep fighting and says he is prepared to file a lawsuit in Chinese court, even though several lawyers have advised him it would be futile. ''It's not only about money,'' Leo Cao said. ''I want justice.''
Among the hundreds of photographs recovered from their father's iPhone from his first and final vacation in China, one image stands out: a shaky snapshot of the LED monitor that graced the carriage of their train boasting that it was moving at 303 kilometers an hour, or 188 m.p.h.
''My father was so proud of China's progress,'' Leo Cao said. ''Unfortunately it was China's progress that killed my parents.''

HEADLINE: Court Orders City Tax Increase for Pennsylvania Capital

BYLINE: By JON HURDLE

 BODY:
HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Residents of this debt-laden state capital are facing a court-ordered income tax increase of one percentage point as part of an effort to repair the city's perilous finances.
Judge Bonnie Brigance Leadbetter of Commonwealth Court this week ordered the Harrisburg City Council to institute a one-year increase in the city's Earned Income Tax within 15 days, as requested by a state-appointed receiver, William Lynch, who is overseeing a recovery plan for financially distressed cities under Pennsylvania's Act 47.
The Council has refused to enact the tax increase, saying the receiver has no right to impose it under the act. 
For months the Council has been at odds with state officials and Mayor Linda D. Thompson over how to revive the finances of the city, which faces an operating deficit of $12.4 million on projected revenue of $47.8 million this year. According to the receiver's office, Harrisburg could run out of money as early as next month.
Judge Leadbetter acknowledged that the court's power to order the Council to enact a tax increase intruded on the fiscal power of legislators, but said such action was appropriate when one branch -- in this case the City Council -- ''imperils'' the function of another.
''Here, the Council has failed to act to alleviate an emergent fiscal threat to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens and threatened the ability of city government to function,'' she wrote in a six-page ruling on the receiver's request for the order.
The judge ordered that revenue from the tax increase be used only to pay for essential city services, and not to finance the schools or help pay off debt on a city incinerator, which stands around $320 million.
Brad Koplinski, one of a majority on the seven-member Council who oppose the tax increase, said the Council might appeal the ruling to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in which case Monday's ruling would be stayed pending the outcome. But in a possible extension of the legal maneuvering that has accompanied Harrisburg's debt crisis, the receiver's office said it might ask for any stay to be lifted.
Mr. Koplinski said the receiver should have sought a tax increase only after negotiating a settlement with creditors and selling city assets, including parking garages and the incinerator.
''In increasing the E.I.T., I believe the Commonwealth Court made a bad decision for the people of Harrisburg -- people who did nothing to get our city into our fiscal crisis,'' Mr. Koplinski wrote in an e-mail. ''The people elected us to make decisions for them -- not to carry out orders from the state.''
Mr. Koplinski said the tax increase would mean more financial hardship in a city where 30 percent of the residents live below the federal poverty line, according to Census Bureau data.
The tax increase, from the current 1 percent to 2 percent, would net the city $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of this year.
But even if the city begins to collect the tax in the final quarter, the money will not arrive in its treasury until the end of the first quarter of 2013, Gerald E. Cross, the executive director for the central division of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Economy League, which analyzes the finances of several struggling cities in the state, said during a court hearing on Aug. 23.
Revenue from the increase is projected to rise to $5.1 million in 2013 and $6.9 million in each of the three years after that. (The judge said officials could seek future tax increases by applying to the court after the initial one-year increase.) Nevertheless, every year until 2016 is expected to end with a budget deficit even if labor concessions are also factored in, according to the receiver's projections.
The city has turned to other measures to shore up its finances but has encountered obstacles with them as well. It was planning to sell a collection of Old West artifacts that were accumulated for a planned city museum by former Mayor Stephen Reed. They have been valued by an auctioneer at $6 million to $10 million, said Bob Philbin, a spokesman for Mayor Thompson.
The collection of some 8,000 items like wagon wheels, railroad spikes and antique pistols -- stored in a warehouse on the grounds of the city incinerator -- was due to be auctioned in July, but the sale was canceled, Mr. Philbin said, because of opposition from Harrisburg's controller, Daniel Miller, a political foe of Mayor Thompson.
Mr. Miller said he refused to agree to the auction because auctioneers' fees totaling 40 percent of the sale price of any item had not been budgeted by the Council. The anticipated proceeds would have allowed the city to erase a good chunk of this year's deficit, Mr. Philbin said, but any sale is now unlikely before next year.

HEADLINE: Romney Secures G.O.P Nomination After Long Quest

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Jim Rutenberg and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts who has aspired to reach the White House since his father first sought the office four decades ago, was nominated by the Republican Party here on Tuesday as its choice to become the 45th president of the United States.
The elevation of Mr. Romney at the Republican National Convention completed his six-year quest to navigate the contours of a changing party and opened a well-choreographed effort led by his wife, Ann, to swiftly reintroduce him to Americans in the hope of gaining the trust of voters and bolstering his campaign to defeat President Obama.
Mr. Romney swept into the convention from backstage after watching his wife deliver a deeply personal speech that made a direct appeal to female voters, whom she assured: ''You can trust Mitt.'' He had arrived here on Tuesday, earlier than scheduled, with his campaign keeping a worried eye on Hurricane Isaac as it threatened the Gulf Coast and made landfall in Louisiana. 
The Republican gathering served as an opportunity not only to hammer Mr. Obama but also, perhaps more important, to humanize Mr. Romney in front of the wider audience he needs to win over before November. The leader of that effort was his wife of 42 years, who urged voters to take a chance on her husband to improve the lives of all Americans struggling in challenging economic times.
''You may not agree with Mitt's positions on issues or his politics,'' Mrs. Romney said. ''But let me say this to every American who is thinking about who should be our next president: No one will work harder. No one will care more.''
As the audience listened intently, she added: ''This man will not fail. This man will not let us down. This man will lift up America.''
As the crowd of Republican delegates cheered, the Romneys embraced and took a quick stroll down the stage as ''My Girl'' from the Temptations boomed overhead. The real audience, though, was voters in swing states watching on television who have yet to be persuaded that Mr. Romney is the man to replace Mr. Obama.
While the night was filled with tributes and testimonials aimed at building up Mr. Romney, it also served as a glimpse into the rising Republicans who are the future leaders of the party should he not win in November. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey closed out the day with a keynote address that mentioned Mr. Romney only seven times and not until well into the speech.
''I know this simple truth, and I'm not afraid to say it,'' Mr. Christie said in his speech, which was deeply laden with his biography and aspirations. ''Our ideas are right for America, and their ideas have failed America.''
The prime-time network television coverage of the convention opened on Tuesday evening competing with images of driving rain and powerful winds in Louisiana during a week that marks the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. It remains an open question how much of Mr. Romney's message will break through, and his campaign kept open the possibility of upending the convention schedule again if Hurricane Isaac warranted.
The mood inside the convention hall was enthusiastic in a ritual way, with delegates cheering as speakers portrayed Mr. Obama as hostile to small-business owners, tolerant of increases to the national debt and out of touch with American values. A soundtrack of Mr. Obama's own words played again and again, trying to use his own statements on the economy against him.
But the efforts to give Mr. Romney a warmer image were aimed more at persuading wavering voters, especially women, who helped provide Mr. Obama with his substantial margin of victory in 2008. While other speakers testified to Mr. Romney's character, Mrs. Romney was vital to the effort, giving glimpses into the challenges they had faced as a couple, including her own illnesses.
''A storybook marriage? No, not at all,'' Mrs. Romney said in what amounted to her national political debut Tuesday evening. ''What Mitt Romney and I have is a real marriage.''
While she essentially steered clear of directly mentioning politics, the rest of the program featured attacks on the president that were part of the Romney campaign's increased emphasis on turning out conservative voters, especially white men and evangelicals, at higher rates than Senator John McCain did in 2008. After years in which Mr. Romney struggled to establish his credentials on the right of his party, conservatives now appear unified and energized, if more by the prospect of defeating Mr. Obama than by electing Mr. Romney.
A party that has struggled to increase its appeal to female, Hispanic and black voters featured a diverse lineup of speakers on Tuesday, including the wife of the governor of Puerto Rico, who introduced Mrs. Romney. And former Representative Artur Davis of Alabama, an African-American who seconded the nomination of Mr. Obama at the Democratic convention in 2008, turned up on stage to offer his support for Mr. Romney.
The program moved at an accelerated pace, a day after the convention's first evening was canceled because of the storm. Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina raced through her speech as the evening wore on.
''The hardest part of my job as governor of South Carolina,'' she said, ''has been this administration.''
The roll call of the states took place five hours before the prime-time television coverage began, an effort by the campaign to avoid giving up precious network time and drawing even more attention to the still-smoldering tensions from the primaries.
John H. Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor and a dean of the Republican Party, formally placed Mr. Romney's name into nomination and hailed him as a leader who can ''fix the unfixable.'' As the crowd cheered, he added: ''Mitt Romney is the right man at the right time and will be a great leader for our country.''
Mr. Romney and his wife watched from their nearby hotel suite as New Jersey put him over the threshold of necessary delegates for the nomination at 5:40 p.m. The convention hall erupted in cheers, and the crowd chanted, ''Mitt, Mitt, Mitt,'' but it was not a unanimous response from the delegates, including some who folded their arms.
When John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House, arrived on stage to read the final tally from all of the states and American territories, Mr. Romney had recorded 2,061 delegates. Representative Ron Paul of Texas, whose libertarian views have earned him a fervently loyal following, won 197 delegates as well as applause from his vocal supporters on the convention floor at the Tampa Bay Times Forum.
Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, one of the party's leading voices on reshaping the size and role of government, was unanimously nominated as the vice-presidential candidate.
The vote for Mr. Romney on Tuesday was simply a ratification of what Republican primary voters settled five months ago, but it reprised the hard feelings from some delegates, particularly those who traveled here to support Mr. Paul. While it was far from the contested convention that Mr. Romney's aides had once feared, the strains highlighted the competing factions welling inside the Republican Party.
When Mr. Paul arrived on the floor a few hours earlier, his supporters rose to their feet and loudly called on Republican officials to ''let him speak.'' Suddenly, a slow, orderly and largely symbolic process erupted in anger, presenting a raucous scene that even the most seasoned delegates said they had not seen in decades. The proceedings, if only for a few moments, harked to an era when contentious party conventions actually decided presidential nominees.
Still, the efforts to humanize Mr. Romney seemed to be working, at least for some here who began learning more about their party's standard-bearer.
Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina, who gained a national following among conservatives for shouting ''You lie'' at Mr. Obama during his health care speech before a joint session of Congress three years ago, said his earlier reservations about Mr. Romney had been resolved as he learned more about him. He said he had picked up a new biographical detail about Mr. Romney from the convention literature.
''I didn't know he had five sons,'' Mr. Wilson said.

HEADLINE: Syrian Group Envisions Transition From Assad

BYLINE: By MELISSA EDDY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Representatives from Syria's political opposition presented a road map Tuesday that they hope will serve as a guide to the democratic transition of power in their country after the expected fall of President Bashar al-Assad. 
Called ''The Day After Project: Supporting a Democratic Transition in Syria,'' the report was drawn up by 45 opposition representatives from political and religious organizations inside the country and in exile.
The group met over the past half-year for a series of secret conferences in Berlin to agree on several basic points they say are necessary to prevent their country from slipping into chaos should Mr. Assad leave power. Respect for human rights and a rule of the law constitute the underlying principles that are to guide the rebuilding of the state, including drawing up a new constitution, reforming the electoral system and changing social and economic policy.
''The project aims to be a response, in helping the Syrians, empowering them to take their destiny back into their hands, back from the rule of arms and terror, into the rule of law and democracy,'' said Afra Jalabi, a political scientist based in Montreal who is a member of the project's executive committee.
The project was initiated by the United States Institute of Peace, based in Washington, in partnership with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin and supported by other European countries. Participants included women as well as men, members of the Syrian National Council, the Muslim Brotherhood and other opposition groups, those with experience in the Free Syrian Army and youth activists.
The document is the first of its kind from the Syrian opposition, which has been plagued by infighting and power struggles. It offers recommendations for writing a new constitution and principles for institution building, and cites South Africa's post-apartheid transition as potentially ''instructive.''
On Monday, François Hollande, the French president, said that Paris would recognize a provisional Syrian government as soon as it had been formed, in the most forceful call to date by a Western country for Mr. Assad's ouster. But the opposition representatives said in Berlin that the international community needed to do more to back their struggle.
''Whilst we are grateful and we appreciate everything the international community has so far provided us, I still think there is more to be done,'' said Amr al-Azm, a professor of history at Shawnee State University in Ohio, who serves on the National Change Current. ''Those who are struggling for their lives need to be given the necessary tools, beyond just words, to help bring down the regime.''

HEADLINE: The Secret Weapon: All of Us

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
Maureen Dowd's column will appear on Thursday.

 BODY:
The Republican National Convention opened by smacking President Obama with the theme ''We Built it.''
To pound that message, Republicans turned to a Delaware businesswoman, Sher Valenzuela, who is also a candidate for lieutenant governor. Valenzuela and her husband built an upholstery business that now employs dozens of workers.
Valenzuela presumably was picked to speak so that she could thunder at Obama for disdaining capitalism. 
Oops. It turns out that Valenzuela relied not only on her entrepreneurial skills but also on -- yes, government help. Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog group, documented $2 million in loans from the Small Business Administration for Valenzuela's company, plus $15 million in government contracts (mostly noncompetitive ones).
In a presentation earlier this year, Valenzuela described government assistance as an entrepreneur's ''biggest 'secret weapon.' ''
Someone has set up a parody Web site, using the name of Valenzuela's company, First State Manufacturing, to mock the Republican message. The site, FirstStateManufacturing.com, declares, ''Thank God government was there for me.''
In short, the Republicans are inadvertently underscoring the point that President Obama was expressing in his ''you didn't build that'' comment in July. Obama noted then that ''if you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own.'' He pointed to public investments in roads and bridges that enable businesses to flourish, and then he inelegantly added, ''If you've got a business, you didn't build that.''
Fox News erupted in outrage, selectively editing the clip to confirm Republican prejudices that Obama doesn't understand the private sector. This fits into the Republican narrative that business executives are heroic job creators when they aren't held back by regulations and taxes imposed by quasi-socialist Muslims born in Kenya.
Democrats tried to highlight a flaw in that narrative when they released a new ad pointing to Mitt Romney's outsourcing of jobs and telling him, ''You didn't build that -- you destroyed it.''
Yet to me, that Democratic line of attack on Romney as a serial job destroyer feels unfair. Sometimes the way to save a company is to cut labor costs or outsource jobs, and almost nobody wants to ban trade or overseas production even though they can cost jobs.
What is fair is to observe that the Republicans' claim that they are the great job creators is a fiction.
Prof. Robert S. McElvaine of Millsaps College examined employment data for the 64 years from the beginning of Harry Truman's presidency to the end of George W. Bush's. He found that an average of two million jobs were created per year when a Democrat was president, compared with one million annually when a Republican was president.
More pointedly, and unfortunately for Romney, business executives have only a mediocre record when transferring their skills to government. In the last great economic mess, this country was led by a Republican who had been stunningly successful in business: Herbert Hoover. Hmm. More recently, President George W. Bush staffed his cabinet with C.E.O.'s who had been stellar in the private sector -- and that didn't work out so well, either.
Obama's point about our shared undertaking was made last year, more eloquently, by Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat running for Senate:
''There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own -- nobody!'' she said. ''You built a factory out there? Good for you. But I want to be clear: You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for; you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate; you all were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. ...
''You built a factory, and it turned into something terrific or a great idea? God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is, you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.''
In short, taxes don't just smother. They can also fuel growth -- when they're invested in highways or the Internet, in colleges or early childhood education. They can create opportunities, as they did for Sher Valenzuela.
Or for Romney himself. He built his Bain empire partly because he was smart and hard-working, but also because of a great education and because of tax breaks for debt financing. Tax loopholes helped him build his fortune, and other loopholes gave him the low tax rates to retain it.
If the Republican convention wishes to highlight and explain Romney's success, it should have a moment of silence to honor our infernal tax code.
Who built this country? Entrepreneurs, yes. But so did schoolteachers and railway construction workers. Doctors and truckers. Scientists and soldiers. You didn't build it, Mitt Romney -- we all built it.

HEADLINE: With Little to Act On, Markets Are Muted

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market, in another day of extremely light summer trading, barely budged on Tuesday after mixed economic data gave investors little reason to shift their focus away from the speech that the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, is scheduled to give on Friday.
It is then, during a conference of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that Mr. Bernanke could announce new measures to stimulate economic growth. While Mr. Bernanke is expected to keep alive expectations that the Fed might undertake a third round of major bond-buying, known as quantitative easing, he could keep markets guessing about the actual timing. 
Trading volume was among the lightest of the year after the market had its slowest full day of 2012 on Monday. August is normally slow, and investors mostly stayed on the sidelines.
''I don't think you can read a lot from what's going on in the market right now,'' said John Fox, co-manager of the FAM Value Fund. ''Because there's nothing going on. Everyone is waiting for the speech on Friday.''
In an encouraging report, the Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas showed home prices nationally inched up in June compared with their levels from a year ago, a sign of slow improvement in the housing sector.
But a new sign of a slowing global economy added to expectations for more stimulus by the Federal Reserve. Japan cut its assessment of economic growth, citing slowing demand for Japanese exports in the United States and China.
And consumer confidence in the United States unexpectedly weakened in August, to its lowest in nine months, as Americans turned more pessimistic about the short-term outlook, according to the Conference Board.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 21.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 13,102.99. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.14 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,409.30. The Nasdaq composite index edged down 3.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 3,077.14.
About 4.6 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and other exchanges on Tuesday, compared with 4.46 billion shares on Monday, the low-water mark for the year. The year-to-date average is about 6.6 billion shares.
The S.& P. 500 has been pinned in a fairly tight range over the last three weeks, finding a support level at 1,400 while also unable to convincingly pierce the April high of 1,422.38, which has acted as a resistance point. The index has not recorded a move of at least 1 percent in either direction since Aug. 3.
Among the day's biggest gainers, Lexmark International stock jumped $2.61, or 13.7 percent, to $21.62 after the company said it would stop making inkjet printers, cut about 1,700 jobs, and focus on its more profitable imaging and software businesses.
In contrast, shares of Hewlett-Packard, which has a substantial portion of inkjet sales, fell 31 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $16.90.
Among other gainers, stock in the apparel conglomerate PVH rose $4.28, or 4.8 percent, to $92.77 after the company raised its full-year earnings outlook for the third time this year as it expects its European business to grow and its flagship Tommy Hilfiger brand to remain popular with shoppers.
Shares of the Movado Group, the watch company, jumped $5.25, or 17.4 percent, to $35.36 after touching a record high of $36.11. The company reported a higher second-quarter profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast for the second time.
In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note increased 5/32, to 99 29/32, while its yield fell to 1.64 percent, from 1.65 percent late Monday.

DETROIT -- The Obama administration issued on Tuesday the final version of new rules that require automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks by 2025.
The standards -- which mandate an average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon for the 2025 model year -- will increase the pressure on auto manufacturers to step up development of electrified vehicles as well as sharply improve the mileage of their mass-market models through techniques like more efficient engines and lighter car bodies.
Current rules for the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, program mandate an average of about 29 miles per gallon, with gradual increases to 35.5 m.p.g. by 2016. 
The new rules represent a victory for environmentalists and advocates of fuel conservation, but were attacked by opponents, including the Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, as too costly for consumers.
While the regulations have been in development for more than a year, the White House's decision to make them final on the first full day of the Republican National Convention seemed intended to highlight one of President Obama's proudest accomplishments at a time when Mr. Romney has laid out a different energy and environmental agenda.
The administration called the new rules ''historic,'' and estimated that Americans would reduce their oil consumption by 12 billion barrels over the course of the program. ''These fuel standards represent the single most important step we've ever taken to reduce our dependence on foreign oil,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement.
But the Romney campaign has criticized the new rules as ''extreme'' and said the standards would limit the choices when consumers shop for a new car. ''The president tells voters that his regulations will save them thousands of dollars at the pump, but always forgets to mention that the savings will be wiped out by having to pay thousands of dollars more upfront for unproven technology that they may not even want,'' said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign.
The transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, said the standards would save Americans $1.7 trillion in fuel costs, resulting in an average savings of more than $8,000 a vehicle by 2025.
The fuel savings, he said, would easily exceed the estimated $2,000 to $3,000 that the more efficient vehicles would cost consumers to buy.
''You put better technology in the car and the price is going to go up,'' Mr. LaHood said in a conference call with reporters. ''But it goes up a fraction of what you save on gas.''
The administration also said the rules would cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2025, eliminating six billion tons over the course of the program.
Proponents of the rules contend that they could also generate hundreds of thousands of jobs by increasing the demand for new technologies.
''Our nation will be more secure, our environment will be cleaner, and consumers will have more money in their pockets as a result of the new rule,'' said Phyllis Cuttino, director of the Pew Clean Energy Program, an environmental organization based in Washington.
Thirteen major automakers, including General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, endorsed the new standards during lengthy negotiations last year.
The companies fought for and won inclusion of a critical midprogram review period in the final rule. The review, to be conducted at the end of the decade, is meant to assess the progress made toward achieving the 54.5 m.p.g. goal. The standard could then be altered if the manufacturers are struggling to meet the new guidelines.
One industry trade group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said a ''rigorous midterm review'' was necessary to determine how consumers reacted to new models that had better mileage but might be more expensive.
''Compliance with higher fuel-economy standards is based on sales, not what we put on the showroom floor,'' the alliance said in a statement.
Auto dealers also expressed concern that higher prices for new cars might exclude some consumers from the market. ''This increase shuts almost seven million people out of the new car market entirely,'' said Bill Underriner, chairman of the National Auto Dealers Association.
Auto companies are expected to take different approaches to meeting the more stringent guidelines.
Some, like the Japanese automaker Nissan, are counting on consumers gravitating to all-electric models like its Leaf. Others, like Chrysler, will focus their efforts on improving engines and transmissions on traditional gasoline-powered cars.
Ford is offering its new Focus compact car with a variety of power sources, ranging from an electric version to a regular gas engine.
Still, American consumers have so far been slow to buy electric cars, despite gas prices that are near $4 a gallon. General Motors is planning to shut down production temporarily of the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid to reduce a backlog of unsold inventory.
For the most part, automakers will have to accelerate their efforts to improve mileage by reducing the weight of vehicles, using more aerodynamic designs and decreasing engine size without sacrificing power.
''The vast majority of vehicles will be more efficient without using electric or hybrid powertrains,'' said Daniel F. Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, a Washington-based environmental advocacy group. ''These cars won't look any different than today unless you check under the hood.''
Even if the 54.5 m.p.g. goal is reached, most cars and trucks will get lower mileage in real-life driving. Credits for air-conditioning units in vehicles will reduce the average mileage to about 49 m.p.g., and actual driving conditions could reduce it further.

HEADLINE: Delegates Anoint Romney as Nominee

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Jim Rutenberg and Michael Barbaro contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Mitt Romney's six-year quest for the Republican presidential nomination culminated Tuesday afternoon when the 4,400 delegates gathered here officially made him their choice to reclaim the White House from President Obama and the Democrats.
The delegates nominated Mr. Romney six hours after he arrived in Tampa and just before Hurricane Isaac made landfall along Gulf Coast. 
But the Republican National Convention has hardly played out according to the script that Mr. Romney's advisers had written. The storm scrambled the convention schedule, while grass-root elements of the party loudly expressed their disapproval on the convention floor, threatening the images of a party united.
Mr. Romney's supporters passed new rules governing future primaries over the loud boos of Ron Paul supporters and other conservative activists who had objected to what they said was a power grab by the party's establishment leaders.
When the House speaker, John A. Boehner, called for a vote on the new rules, the chants for ''no'' were louder than for ''yes.'' Mr. Boehner ignored the protests, pressing ahead by saying the rules would be adopted ''without objection,'' even as the crowd continued to roar its disapproval.
Despite the dissension, the task at hand remains: to use the most-watched moment of the Republican presidential campaign to humanize Mr. Romney in the eyes of voters with personal testimonials from his friends, his colleagues and -- perhaps most importantly -- his wife.
Barring last-minute schedule changes forced by the unpredictable weather, Ann Romney will appear on the stage in prime time Tuesday night, lending her broad appeal with voters to try and bolster her husband's likability. That remains one of Mr. Romney's primary challenges as he wages a pitched political battle against a well-liked incumbent.
At the same time, Republicans will use Tuesday's evening lineup of speakers to hammer Mr. Obama and his economic policies, which they argue have made the recession deeper and more painful. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, blunt and sharp-tongued, will cap the evening with a 30-minute speech intended to forcefully make the case that the president's policies have failed America.
And, Mr. Romney's advisers will try on Tuesday to reach out to female voters with a series of speakers who will fight back against Democratic accusations that the party is waging a war against women. Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina will speak to the convention in prime time.
The vote to approve the rules came after aides to Mr. Romney said they had reached a compromise with conservative activists who had rebelled against efforts by the Republican establishment to make it harder for candidates outside the mainstream to collect national delegates at the next convention.
But grumblings persist among some delegates and other conservatives who say they do not trust Mr. Romney and organizers of the convention to have their interests at heart.
Across the convention hall on Tuesday, Mr. Paul's supporters gathered quietly in hallways, grousing about the marginalization of their candidate and plotting protests. Chris Smith, a Colorado delegate, spotted Bobby Regi with a Ron Paul sign. ''We were told no signs are allowed,'' he said. Mr. Regi told him to try anyway, discretely handing him a poster.
Sung Song, another delegate from Texas, smuggled in his own Ron Paul sign, one that can be easily folded up and hidden. ''It's very portable,'' he explained, as he clapped loudly for Mr. Paul from his seat. ''The revolution is not going to ever die,'' Mr. Song said. ''We're everywhere.''
Delegations from each of the states and territories cast their ballots in accordance with the primaries and caucuses that gave Mr. Romney victories over a slew of rivals that included Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and Mr. Paul.
The outcome is not in doubt. But organizers are hoping that enough of the votes on behalf of Mr. Romney will have been cast by 6:30 p.m. -- the start of the evening news broadcasts -- for Mr. Romney to officially claim the title that he has sought for so many years.
And yet even as Republicans moved forward on Tuesday to finally begin their convention, uncertainty remained the watchword for organizers.
The storm in the gulf looked to become a hurricane by the time it strikes land, providing a compelling -- and competing -- news event for the journalists assembled here in Tampa.
The morning television news programs all started their coverage in New Orleans -- not in Tampa -- with some of their biggest stars having been diverted to cover the storm instead of the political convention.
Convention planners were downplaying suggestions early Tuesday that their event might yet be reduced to a single night, saying that while they were keeping a close eye on the storm, they were continuing with their revised schedule full steam ahead.
And with President Obama continuing to campaign on Tuesday following his televised statement on the storm, there was growing sentiment among Republicans here that they should not be prematurely hampered by their fears of looking insensitive during a possible hurricane.

HEADLINE: How the Republicans Built It

 BODY:
It was a day late, but the Republicans' parade of truth-twisting, distortions and plain falsehoods arrived on the podium of their national convention on Tuesday. Following in the footsteps of Mitt Romney's campaign, rarely have so many convention speeches been based on such shaky foundations.
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, in the keynote speech, angrily demanded that the American people learn the hard truths about the two parties, but like most of those at the microphone, he failed to supply any. He said his state needed his austere discipline of slashed budgets, canceled public projects and broken public unions, but did not mention that New Jersey now has a higher unemployment rate than when he took over, and never had the revenue boom he promised from tax cuts. 
''We believe in telling our seniors the truth about our overburdened entitlements,'' he said, but his party has consistently refused to come clean about its real plans to undo Medicare and Medicaid. ''Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to put us back on a path to growth,'' he said, but Mr. Romney has consistently refused to tell the truth about his tax plan, his budget plan, and his health care plan.
It was appropriate that ''We built it,'' the needling slogan of the evening, was painted on the side of the convention hall. Speaker after speaker alluded to the phrase in an entire day based on the thinnest of reeds -- a poorly phrased remark by the president, deliberately taken out of context. President Obama was making the obvious point that all businesses rely to some extent on the work and services of government. But Mr. Romney has twisted it to suggest that Mr. Obama believes all businesses are creatures of the government, and so the convention had to parrot the line.
''We need a president who will say to a small businesswoman: Congratulations, we applaud your success, you did make that happen, you did build that,'' said Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia. ''Big government didn't build America; you built America!''
That was far from the only piece of nonsense on the menu, only the most frequently repeated one. Conventions are always full of cheap applause lines and over-the-top attacks, but it was startling to hear how many speakers in Tampa considered it acceptable to make points that had no basis in reality.
Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, for example, boasted of the booming economy in his state, never mentioning that he and Mr. Romney opposed the auto bailout that has played an outsized role in the state's recovery. (Apparently Mr. Obama's destructive economic policies do not apply everywhere.)
Andy Barr, a Congressional candidate in Kentucky, made the particularly egregious charge that the president was conducting ''a war on coal,'' ruthlessly attacking an industry and thousands of struggling miners.
He was apparently referring to the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and prevent power-plant pollution from drifting through the East Coast states. The country desperately needs to reduce its reliance on coal, which is far more polluting than natural gas, but that goal gets harder to achieve every time someone like Mr. Barr makes it out to be an attack on a way of life.
Considering how Mr. Romney has conducted his campaign so far, most recently his blatantly false advertising accusing Mr. Obama of gutting the work requirement on welfare, it is probably not surprising that the convention he leads would follow a similar path.
Voters looking for a few nuggets of truth would not have found them in Tampa on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: With Visits to Campuses, Obama Keeps Campaigning

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Carl Hulse contributed reporting from Denver.

 BODY:
FORT COLLINS, Colo. -- Annie Hartnett was not old enough to vote in 2008 when she volunteered for the Obama campaign at the University of Iowa, where an older sister was a student. Now 21 and a leader of the Iowa State University Democrats, she said she was as excited as she was four years ago to be working for President Obama -- yet she struggled to describe something that is missing.
''I would still say there's as much excitement as before, but in 2008, well, there was much more of a 'This is a new fresh start,' '' Ms. Hartnett said. ''When you're voting for an incumbent, it's not really a fresh start, right?'' And enlisting other volunteers is less easy: ''In '08, I feel like people were way more, like, wanting to get behind it because it was new, there was a drive, energy.''
So on Saturday she was heartened as students waited in lines for two hours for tickets to see Mr. Obama on Tuesday as he made a tour of college campuses in an aggressive appeal for young voters even as Mitt Romney was being nominated in Tampa. 
Each party used to keep a low profile during the other's presidential convention week. But Mr. Obama, trying to expand his support among a crucial demographic group that tends to vote at lower rates than older Americans, was not standing down.
''I'm counting on you,'' the president shouted to an estimated 6,000 mostly young people gathered outdoors at Iowa State, in Ames. ''Those who oppose change, those who benefit from the status quo, they've always bet on cynicism, they always bet on complacency. But throughout America's history, they have lost that bet. And they're going to lose it this time, too.''
''I'm asking you one more time to do what we did, to do what young people all across the state of Iowa did four years ago,'' Mr. Obama added.
From Iowa State, Mr. Obama went on to Colorado State University here for a rally Tuesday evening before heading back East on Wednesday to the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville. That itinerary of three colleges in three swing states, just as students are returning, speaks to the importance of young voters to Mr. Obama's prospects, and to his advisers' concern about their level of engagement.
''I do think that they must be aware that there has been a real decline with younger voters and that there isn't nearly the same amount of support for Obama and Democrats as there was four years ago,'' said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster.
''What's driving the decline,'' she added, ''is really the economy, the economic experience that young people are having.''
While Gallup's recent daily tracking poll shows that 58 percent of voters under 30 currently support Mr. Obama, that is lower than he got in 2008, according to exit polls. Then, 18 percent of those who voted were under 30 -- just one percentage point more than in recent elections, contrary to the widespread belief that young voters made up a record proportion of the electorate. But they voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Obama, 66 percent compared with 32 percent for Mr. McCain, a 34-point margin that was nearly double the point spread between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole in 1996.
Now the under-30 ranks include more than 15 million Americans who, like Ms. Hartnett, can vote for the first time. Yet in contrast to the atmosphere of hope and change that defined 2008, those newly eligible to vote have come of age in the worst economic downturn since the Depression. With college diplomas or, worse, without them, they enter an unwelcoming job market.
That backdrop and Mr. Obama's role this time as the battle-scarred incumbent give encouragement to the Romney camp.
''You can only run on hope and change once,'' Rich Beeson, Mr. Romney's political director, said.
He conceded Mr. Obama's advantage among young voters, then added, ''We're not going to win them, but we're going to eat into the margins. And those are the margins where they need to run up the score.''
The Obama campaign is scrambling to do just that, especially on campuses in battleground states, sending student-volunteers out to promote Mr. Obama's work to increase Pell tuition grants, limit interest rates on federal college loans and enact a health care law that allows people to stay on their parents' insurance policies until age 26.
Other issues, like his support for abortion rights, contraception coverage and same-sex marriage, also are more popular with younger Americans than with any other age group.
Mr. Obama himself has pitched that record in 25 campus events this year, including four each in the battlegrounds Ohio and Florida. Aides say the number will increase in coming weeks.Michael Belding, 22, a graduate student at Iowa State, was a freshman there in 2008; while he voted for Mr. McCain, he recalled the pro-Obama electricity on campus then, and the ''fun'' of the election-night celebrations.
Now head of the student newspaper's opinion page, Mr. Belding said, ''I don't hear as much about students getting involved in either campaign.''
Obama campaign aides say it is early; young people, like most Americans, are just now starting to tune in.
''The people are slowly getting excited,'' said William J. Russell, the Democratic Party chairman of Larimer County, where Colorado State is located.
Mr. Obama drew 45,000 people at Colorado State right before the 2008 election. The police estimated Tuesday's turnout at 13,000, one of the president's biggest crowds to date, though the campaign limits tickets so he can better connect with his audience, advisers say. In interviews, a number of students, including self-described conservatives, said they remained undecided about Mr. Obama but do not like Mr. Romney.
The campaign has dispatched celebrities popular with young people to mobilize support, including the actors Kal Penn and John Cho, stars of the ''Harold & Kumar'' comedy films. Mr. Penn, who said he had campaigned in 16 states, drew about 200 students last week on a campus serving several colleges in downtown Denver and urged them to make sure they voted.
''It does matter very much,'' he said.

Humanitarian Effort in Congo Puts S.E.C. in Unintended Role | War in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been deadly, filled with mass murder. So the United States government has taken its most significant step to try to halt the horror: send in the Securities and Exchange Commission. Not surprising, having your capital markets regulator engage in foreign policy may not be the best solution to ending a war, the Deal Professor writes.
The problem arises from the noble attempt to stop the sale of conflict minerals, the focus of those who are pushing for a nonmilitary way to curb the fighting in Congo. Conflict minerals include coltan, cassiterite, gold and wolframite, and while you may not be familiar with some of these, they are widely used in electronics. Your cellphone may very well contain them.
Humanitarian groups say these minerals are being mined by combatants in Congo and neighboring countries and sold to pay for military activities that lead to abuses of human rights. Activists from the Enough Project, a nonprofit group that seeks to end crimes against humanity, have been working to stop the trade in these minerals, seeking to deprive the Congo war of financing.
So where does the S.E.C. come in? The Dodd-Frank Act was intended to overhaul financial regulation, but it was also turned into an aircraft carrier as legislators dumped in almost every financial reform proposal ever dreamed up. The 1,500-some-odd provisions of Dodd-Frank not only enhance the regulation of banks, they also require shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and require the S.E.C. to explore ending the arbitration of investor claims.

HEADLINE: Housing Market Improvements Lessen Consumer Distress

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The CredAbility Consumer Distress Index hits positive territory for the first time in nearly four years. 

 BODY:
Improvement in the nation's housing markets has helped ease consumer financial woes, according to a quarterly report from a large credit counseling agency.
For the first time in nearly four years, the Consumer Distress Index, published by the nonprofit agency CredAbility, showed that consumers nationally were inching their way out of financial distress.
The index tracks the financial condition of American households by measuring employment, housing, credit, household budget management and net worth. United States households scored a 71.3 on the 100-point index, an increase of 1.4 points from the first quarter. Scores below 70 indicate financial distress. The last time the index topped 70 was in the third quarter of 2008.
Housing was the main driver of consumers' improved financial condition this quarter, according to Mark Cole, the agency's executive vice president and chief operating officer. Late payments on mortgages reached a three-year low, and housing costs dropped as many homeowners cut their payments by refinancing.
The average household also kept a tighter rein on its budget, which helped drive the savings rate to a one-year high in June. Net worth also ticked up.
The index's unemployment score improved by only a half-point, however, to 59.8 from 59.4, and continued to drag down the index. Although 381,000 jobs were added during the quarter, joblessness remained the same as more people who had given up looking began seeking work again.
Whether the overall gains persist, in light of continued economic uncertainty and the political headwinds of an election year, remains to be seen, Mr. Cole said. "This really is very fragile in nature."
This quarter's report also includes information on metropolitan areas. Several large areas remain in distress. Orlando, Fla., suffering from both housing woes and stubborn unemployment, is the most distressed city, followed by Tampa-St. Petersburg in Florida, Riverside-San Bernardino in California, Las Vegas and Miami-Fort Lauderdale. Among the 30 largest metropolitan areas, the healthiest cities are Boston, Washington, D.C., Minneapolis-St. Paul, Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver.

HEADLINE: Is the Fiscal Cliff a Big Deal?

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The sharp cuts in government spending and the expiration of tax cuts anticipated in January are likely to have less impact on the economy than the Congressional Budget Office thinks, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
With their Keynesian analysis, the Congressional Budget Office and others have exaggerated the effects of the "fiscal cliff" on the labor market and the economy.
Come January, current law provides for significant cuts in federal spending and for tax increases - and thereby significant federal budget-deficit reduction. These provisions have been collectively described as the "fiscal cliff," which emerged when Democratic and Republican leaders could not agree on plans on spending and taxes.
The Congressional Budget Office has warned that the fiscal cliff will cause a double-dip recession, but its analysis for 2013 is based on the Keynesian proposition that anything that shrinks the federal budget deficit shrinks the economy, and the more the deficit is reduced the more the economy is reduced.
In many circumstances, the Keynesian proposition reaches the wrong conclusions about economic activity, because deficits do not necessarily expand the economy or prevent it from shrinking. For example, reducing the deficit by cutting unemployment insurance - it's one of the programs that would be cut in January - would shrink the economy in the C.B.O.'s view.
But in reality, cutting unemployment insurance would increase employment, as it would end payments for people who fail to find work and would reduce the cushion provided after layoffs.
Helping people who are out of work may be intrinsically valuable because it's the right thing to do, but the Congressional Budget Office is incorrect to conclude that it also grows the economy or prevents it from shrinking. Paying people for not working is no way to put them to work.
The Keynesian proposition about budget deficits ignores incentives of all kinds, so its incorrect conclusions about the fiscal cliff are not limited to unemployment insurance. Another example: the fiscal cliff would put millions of Americans on the alternative minimum tax, which Keynesian analysis said would shrink the economy solely because it collected more revenue.
Yet economists who have studied the alternative minimum tax have found that its effects on incentives to work and produce are essentially neutral, compared with the ordinary federal personal income tax.
(The Congressional Budget Office does not use pure Keynesian analysis for its long-term projections, which include labor-supply incentive effects of tax rates, but apparently has decided that incentives' effects can be safely neglected in the short term.)
None of this implies that the fiscal cliff will expand the economy, because some of its provisions will increase the penalties for working and producing.
The fiscal cliff would cut Medicare payments to doctors by 2 percent, which reduces doctors' reward for treating Medicare patients. This may cause doctors to work less (or to work more for non-Medicare patients). The fiscal cliff would end the "Bush tax cuts" provisions, some of which have been enhancing the incentive to work (but beware - not all laws labeled "tax cuts" enhance incentives).
Perhaps the incentive-reducing provisions of the fiscal cliff outweigh its incentive-enhancing provisions, in which case the Congressional Budget Office has arrived at approximately the right answer for the wrong reasons.
But even in that lucky case, the C.B.O.'s quantitative estimates of the fiscal cliff's economic effects are not reliable until they fully incorporate economic incentives.

HEADLINE: Changing Views of Globalization's Impact

BYLINE: EDWARD ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: A senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations traces the evolution in economic thinking about the relationship between global trade and economic stagnation in the United States. 

 BODY:
For decades, economists resisted the conclusion that trade - for all of its many benefits -- has also played a significant role in job loss and the stagnation of middle-class incomes in the United States. As recently as 2008, for instance, Robert Lawrence of Harvard, one of the country's most respected trade experts, concluded that trade explained only a small share of growing income inequality and labor market displacement in the United States.
Rather than focusing on trade, economists argued that other factors - especially "skill-biased technical change," technological innovation that puts an added premium on skilled workers - played the biggest role in holding down middle-class wages. But now economists are beginning to change their minds. Responding to The Times's recent survey about the causes of income stagnation, many top economists have cited globalization as a leading cause.
While the evidence is still not conclusive, it is pretty strong. Trade's effect on jobs and income, which was probably modest through the 1990's, now seems to be growing much larger. Among the recent studies:
 In "The Evolving Structure of the American Economy and the Employment Challenge," the Nobel-winning economist Michael Spence looked at job growth from 1990 to 2008 in sectors of the United States economy. He found almost no net job growth in sectors, like manufacturing, in which global trade played a large role. Nearly all of the net gains occurred in sectors in which trade plays a minor role. Government and health care, in which trade plays almost no role, accounted for more than 40 percent of all new jobs.
 David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson looked at regions in the United States where companies are competing most directly with China. From 1990 to 2007, they found that regions that faced growing exposure to Chinese competition had higher unemployment, lower labor-force participation and lower wages than might otherwise be expected. And the effects grew over that period. In 1991, just 2.9 percent of United States manufacturing imports came from low-wage countries; by 2007, that had risen to nearly 12 percent, mostly from China.
 In the Council on Foreign Relations Task Force on U.S. Trade and Investment Policy, my colleague Matthew Slaughter looked at employment at multinational companies with headquarters in the United States, companies that account for roughly 60 percent of American exports and imports. From 1989 to 1999, those companies created 4.4 million jobs in the United States and 2.7 million jobs at their foreign affiliates overseas. From 1999 to 2009, however, those same companies eliminated a net of nearly 3 million jobs in the United States while adding another 2.4 million jobs abroad.
The usual rebuttal to these findings is to argue that they stem mostly from manufacturing. And manufacturing, the argument goes, is facing a long-run, secular decline in employment that is largely technology-driven, not unlike the story of agriculture in the 20th century. The job losses in manufacturing may seem as if they have been caused by trade, according to this view, but they have actually been caused by technological change.
Through the 1990s, that story was largely plausible. But over the last decade it is not. Manufacturing output in the United States is no longer growing as rapidly as it once was (and as you would expect if technology had simply been replacing workers in factories). Real manufacturing output grew just 15 percent in the 2000s, compared with more than 35 percent in each of the 1970s and 1980s and more than 50 percent in the 1990s. And one sector where the statistics are of dubious meaning -- computers and electronics - accounts for almost all of the recent gains. In 13 of 19 manufacturing sectors, real output declined over the last decade, in some industries quite sharply. There is no question that over the last decade United States manufacturing has declined, taking away jobs and driving down wages for those who are still employed. Robert Atkinson and colleagues have a useful paper on this topic, showing that the loss of more than five million jobs in manufacturing in a decade was not primarily a technology and productivity story.
The real-world evidence makes it surprising that it has taken economists so long to catch on. The recent strike in Joliet, Ill., at Caterpillar - a true global company -- ended with union workers being forced to accept an agreement that includes a six-year wage freeze, even as the company is earning record profits. Elsewhere, two-tier agreements, in which new hires earn wages and benefits roughly half as large as those in the old union contracts, have become standard in many of the manufacturing industries that remain in the United States.
One reason that economists may be uncomfortable talking about trade's impact on jobs and wages may be concern that it could set off protectionist responses. And economists are right that expanded trade has certainly been good for the United States. It has brought us better and cheaper consumer goods, opened new export markets, lifted up many poor countries and strengthened American alliances around the world.
But I think the fear of protectionism is overblown. One unexpected feature of the great recession was how little protectionism it led to, especially in the advanced economies. The lesson of the Great Depression - that protectionism is counterproductive - seems to have been learned.
Instead, the evidence should produce some soul-searching about the causes of this country's declining competitiveness. The list is discouragingly long: crumbling infrastructure, inadequate educational performance, stifling regulation and a cumbersome tax system. But it might not take that much to tip the scales in favor of the United States. The Boston Consulting Group, which has looked at the slight uptick in the nation's manufacturing employment over the last two years, argues that rising wages in China, high transportation costs and falling United States energy costs should bring more manufacturing back home.
With the rapid growth of middle classes abroad, trade should be an opportunity for the United States to sell into growing markets, increasing opportunities and wages for many Americans here at home. But over the last decade, that has not been the story.

HEADLINE: A Late Bet on Coal May Not Pay Off

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: A consortium of utilities decided to build a coal-fired power plant, probably one of the last that will be allowed under E.P.A. regulations, figuring it would be cheaper than buying electricity on the open market. The low cost of natural gas has foiled that calculation. 

 BODY:
ThePrairie State Energy Campus, a vast new coal-fired power plant and mine that is now approaching completion in downstate Illinois is likely to be one of the last of its kind in this country, given that new Environmental Protection Agency regulations bar plants that put out as much carbon dioxide as conventional coal plants. The builders, a consortium of municipal utilities and co-ops across eight states from Missouri to West Virginia, rushed to get it up and running before greenhouse rules could stop it, convinced that coal would be cheaper for the next few decades than alternative sources, like gas or nuclear.
But at least for the near term, the owners will be paying extra for electricity, produced at the behest of anti-coal groups. When the construction cost rose from the $4 billion estimate to what the opponents put at $4.9 billion, the price of electricity from the project, which includes the capital cost, went above the cost of electricity bought on the open market in the Midwest, according to the report, produced by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a nonprofit group in Belmont, Mass.
"The Prairie State coal plant is turning out to be the financial and environmental nightmare that many of us feared when the plant was proposed,'' said Sandy Buchanan, executive director of Ohio Citizen Action. Mostly because of the low price of natural gas, a megawatt-hour of electricity in Ohio now wholesales for about $40, but power from the first unit of the plant, which went into service in June, costs about $60, the groups pointed out, and the customers face some additional charges because of a slight delay in getting the generators into service. The second half is due on line late this year.
The details, though, are complicated. While production costs are clearly now above the market average, natural gas is at a record low, at a little over $3 per million B.T.U., and whether the plant remains above market depends on the price over the next 30 years. (In 2007, when the decision was made to build the plant,prices were about double what they are now. )
When the first unit began operation, that the 2007 decision to build "was based on sound long-term forecasts'' and that the plant's output "would be very competitive with other fuels such as nuclear and natural gas over the anticipated 30-plus year life of the facility, which remains the case today, even with some operating delays.'' Natural gas prices will vary but coal prices will remain stable, the consortium said.
While the future price of gas is one of the great uncertainties of the energy economy, one element of the price is the cost of production, which depends in part on continued use of fracking, a technique that some of the groups, including Ohio Citizen Action, oppose.
And the environmental effect is also uncertain. Prairie State's builders say that adding 1,600 megawatts will accelerate the retirement of older plants, many of them coal. And those plants often lack scrubbers that control sulfur emissions and precipitators that catch the ash, and other controls required on new plants. In addition, modern plants like Prairie State operate more efficiently and produce more electricity per ton of coal, and thus somewhat less carbon dioxide per ton.But Tom Sanzillo, lead author of the report, said in a conference call with reporters that the new capacity would also crowd out wind and solar, which are cleaner, and efficiency, which is cheaper. He said he was not sure what effect it would have in decisions about old coal plants facing low natural gas prices, low demand and high costs for new pollution control equipment.
Raj G. Rao, the chairman of Prairie State and the head of the Indiana Municipal Power Agency, which is a part owner, predicted a different path. In 2007, he said, electricity on the spot market sold in the vicinity of $80 a megawatt-hour, but the price collapsed when industrial demand declined in the financial crisis; it will bounce back when the economy does, he predicted.
The current argument has a touch of irony. The developers sold the project to the public power entities (municipal electric departments, power authorities and co-operatives) in part with the argument that they could reduce their exposure to the vicissitudes of the electricity marketplace by becoming owners rather than buying on the spot market, and by buying the fuel as well as the power plant, in the form of a 30-year coal supply adjacent to the plant.
Vic Svec, a spokesman for Peabody, said that having the users buy shares of the plant in proportion to their power needs was a common approach for projects like this. "Ultimately, when the scorecard is complete, we firmly believe Prairie State will continue to provide reliable, clean, low-cost electricity for the benefit of millions of customers in multiple states for decades to come,'' he said.
But Mr. Sanzillo said the buyers had taken on risk they could not afford. "This was supposed to be low-cost electricity that put municipalities in a better position, not a worse position,'' he said.
Mr. Rao predicted that gas would increase in price when the United States began exporting.
"Japan is buying liquefied natural gas for $18, and India for $15 or $17. Our $3 gas is not going to stay here,'' he said. "The average price could cost up to $7 in three to five years.'' And that would make Prairie State's output look cheap, he said.

HEADLINE: Cloud Computing for the Poorest Countries

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: Amazon Web Services runs things as diverse as Pinterest, Netflix and the reservation system of Intercontinental Hotels. Its big impact, however, may be in the developing world. People on cheap mobile phones now use supercomputing in California before they have decent running water. It will only get cheaper and bigger. 

 BODY:
In Tuesday'sarticle on Amazon Web Services, I wrote about lots of different data-crunching companies, mostly in the developed world.
In the long term, however, as companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft sell computing everywhere, the most dramatic changes may be in places most of us do not now see. Already, places without clean water, decent sanitation or steady electricity are using supercomputers.
Cheki isa used car classifieds business that serves up about a billion page views a month, mostly in Kenya and Nigeria. Most of the one million people using the site are looking at it with Android-based smartphones that cost about $70, according to Thomas Shaw, the company's information technology manager. Imagine things in a few years, when Huawei, which makes most of the devices, gets those phone prices even lower.
This appears to be changing markets in several other countries as well. "There are people in Malawi, Rwanda and Ethiopia looking at the cars, too," he says. Tariffs on cars are often high in these places, and a big market in another country may be a better way for them to buy.
Unlike the developed world, where speed, agility and cost are factors that make Amazon Web Services attractive, in the developing world it's good to be on battery-powered phones and servers in California, instead of relying on an often-brittle electric grid. "For Westerners," Mr. Shaw says, "the whole thing is a little bizarre."
Jobberman, Nigeria's largest jobs and careers Web site, also runs on Amazon Web Services. So does M-Pesa, the mobile payments division of Safaricom, a mobile phone provider based in Kenya. Mobile money has become so big that the Africa Development Bank says the new money may be causing inflation. In South Africa, a luxury goods company called 36Boutiques usesAmazon's service for e-commerce
In India, there is an online nationwide cab-booking service called Getmecab that uses Amazon servers, though the closest ones are in Singapore. There are consultants that teach other businesses to use Amazon.
Amazon itself holds seminars for start-ups in India, Indonesia and many other countries, hoping to foster more consumption of advanced technology among the developing economies. So does Google, for its business applications, and it will very likely do more once its cloud computing offering, part of Google Cloud Platform, gains traction.
It's quite possible that there are even Amazon Web Services being used in the Amazon. Amazon Web Servicesoperates several large data centers in Brazil.

HEADLINE: A Reprieve for New York Fed in Libor Case

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: In addition to giving the Federal Reserve Bank of New York a one-month extension, Congress is narrowing the scope of its request in its inquiry into manipulation of the London interbank offered rate. 

 BODY:
5:06 p.m. | Updated 
Congress has eased demands that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York turn over thousands of documents that detail interest rate manipulation at big banks, whittling down the request and granting the regulator more time.
The reprieve will afford the New York Fed an additional month to comply, according to people briefed on the matter. The agency had been under pressure to meet a deadline on Saturday.
The original request for documents came in July, when the oversight panel of the House Financial Services Committee sought volumes of records about the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which affects the cost of trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans. The interest rate is at the center of an investigation that has ensnared more than a dozen banks.
In a letter in July, the oversight panel asked the New York Fed to detail its correspondence with employees from the banks that help set Libor. The oversight panel, led by Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas, also ordered the New York Fed to turn over its internal Libor-related documents and any communication with other government authorities.
In addition to the one-month extension, the subcommittee is narrowing the scope of its request. Lawmakers are now seeking communications among government authorities and documents circulated internally at the New York Fed, the people briefed on the matter said.
By steering clear of e-mails from bankers, the Congressional inquiry could avoid complicating a wide-ranging criminal investigation. Once the initial documents are received, Congress may still ramp up its request to include some information from the banks, one of the people briefed on the matter said.
The New York Fed already produced reams of transcripts this summer related to phone calls officials had with Barclays employees. Barclays was the first bank to settle accusations that it tried to manipulate Libor for its own benefit. It reached a $450 million settlement with the Justice Department as well as regulators in the United States and Britain.
Regulators and criminal authorities around the world are investigating more than a dozen other big banks, including HSBC and Deutsche Bank, in the manipulation of Libor, a measure of how much banks charge one another for loans. Banks are suspected of reporting false rates during the financial crisis to bolster profits and shore up their image.
The scandal has consumed the banking industry and called into question the New York Fed's oversight powers. In the case of Barclays, the New York Fed learned in 2008 that the British bank had been submitting false rates.
During the crisis, when high borrowing costs were a sign of poor financial health, banks were artificially depressing the rates to project a stronger image.
Rather than push for a civil or criminal crackdown, the New York Fed advocated policy changes to the rate-setting process, some of which were adopted. But with the crisis in full swing, the New York Fed moved on to more pressing concerns, and Barclays continued to submit false rates.
The regulator's approach has drawn sharp scrutiny from the oversight panel.
"As you know, the role of government is to ensure that our markets are run with the highest standards of honesty, integrity and transparency," Mr. Neugebauer wrote in a letter to the New York Fed dated July 23. "Therefore, any admission of market manipulation - regardless of the degree - should be swiftly and vigorously investigated."
An earlier version of a caption accompanying this article misstated the role of Representative Randy Neugebauer. He leads the oversight panel of the House Financial Services Committee, not the committee itself.

HEADLINE: Citigroup in $590 Million Settlement of Subprime Lawsuit

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, settled for $590 million, said the bank failed to disclose its huge holdings in collateralized debt obligations. 

 BODY:
Citigroup said on Wednesday that it had agreed to pay $590 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by shareholders who contended that they had been misled about the bank's exposure to subprime mortgage debt on the eve of the financial crisis.
The shareholder lawsuit, originally filed in November 2007, contended that the bank and some of its former senior executives and directors had failed to disclose the bank's huge holdings in securities known as collateralized debt obligations that were tied to mortgage securities until November 2007, when it took a multibillion-dollar write-down on them. Citigroup later wrote down the C.D.O.'s by tens of billions of dollars more.
The bank had previously tried to conceal the deteriorating value of its holdings by improper accounting practices, the shareholders contended in an amended complaint filed in December 2008. "Citigroup used inflated, unreliable and unsupportable marks to keep its C.D.O.-related quasi-Ponzi scheme alive and to give the appearance of a healthy asset base," the complaint said.
Problems with its C.D.O. business have dogged Citi. Wednesday's settlement is on top of the $360 million that the bank has agreed to pay to resolve civil mortgage securities cases brought by federal regulators. In a statement on Wednesday, Citigroup, which denied the allegations, said: "Citi will be pleased to put this matter behind us. This settlement is a significant step toward resolving our exposure to claims arising from the period of the financial crisis."
It added, "Citi is fundamentally a different company today than at the beginning of the financial crisis."
The plaintiffs included pension funds in Colorado, Ohio and Illinois and were led by former employees and directors of Automated Trading Desk who received Citigroup shares when they sold the electronic trading firm to the bank in July 2007. The proposed settlement, which was given preliminary approval by Judge Sidney H. Stein of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, covers investors who bought Citi shares from Feb. 26, 2007, through April 18, 2008. Shares of Citigroup traded as high as $55 in the summer of 2007. By spring of 2008, its stock price had tumbled by half.
A hearing on the settlement was set for Jan. 15.
The nation's third-largest bank by assets, Citi teetered on the brink of collapse in 2008 and was bailed out by the United States government. The bank has repaid the $45 billion in federal assistance that it received.
The shareholders' accusations centered on its collateralized debt obligations. The plaintiffs claimed Citi assured them that it had sold billions of dollars in C.D.O.'s, thus averting risk to investors. But the plaintiffs argue the bank didn't inform shareholders that it had guaranteed the securities against any losses, according to court documents. To further disguise the risks to investors, the plaintiffs said, Citigroup moved the guarantees to separate entities.
In a court filing on Wednesday, lawyers for the shareholders from the law firm Kirby McInerney acknowledged the difficulty of proving that the bank knowingly perpetrated fraud on its clients: "Rarely is there concrete direct evidence of fraudulent intent."
For Citigroup, as well as other Wall Street firms, the business of slicing apart and packaging mortgages and other loans into complex securities had been a lucrative and fast-growing business before the financial crisis. The bank underwrote some $70 billion in collateralized debt obligations from 2004 to 2008.
The bank paid $75 million in 2010 to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint that the bank made misleading public statements about the extent of its subprime exposure. In a statement at the time, the agency said that "between July and mid-October 2007, Citigroup represented that subprime exposure in its investment banking unit was $13 billion or less, when in fact it was more than $50 billion."
In a separate, more recent case involving C.D.O.'s, the bank had agreed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay $285 million over allegations that it had misled investors by not disclosing that it was helping select the mortgage securities that underpinned the C.D.O. and that it was betting against it. That settlement was initially rejected by a federal judge, but an appeals court found that the judge may have overstepped his authority.
On Monday, the bank agreed to pay $25 million to another group of investors, who claimed that the bank misinformed them about the quality of securities backed by mortgages, which took big losses after the housing market collapsed during the crisis.

HEADLINE: GSV Capital, Placing Bets on Start-Ups, Falters

BYLINE: RANDALL SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: GSV, the largest of several closed-end mutual funds that offer ordinary investors a chance to own stakes in privately held companies, has been hit particularly hard by Facebook's troubles. 

 BODY:
Few investors have ridden the recent Internet boomlet like the GSV Capital Corporation.
After GSV announced in June 2011 that it was buying a stake in the privately held Facebook, the closed-end mutual fund surged 42 percent that day. Capitalizing on the euphoria, GSV sold another $247 million of its shares, using the money to expand its portfolio of hot start-ups like Groupon and Zynga.
Now, GSV is feeling the Facebook blues.
 When the public offering of the social network flopped, GSV fell hard, and it still has not recovered. Shares of GSV, which were sold for an average of $15.35, are trading at $8.54.
"We probably benefited from our stake in Facebook more than we deserved on the way up," said GSV's chief executive, Michael T. Moe, "and were certainly punished more than we deserved on the way down."
GSV, short for Global Silicon Valley, is the largest of several closed-end mutual funds that offer ordinary investors a chance to own stakes in privately held companies, at least indirectly. Closed-end funds like GSV typically sell a set number of shares, and their managers invest the proceeds. In essence, such portfolios operate like small venture capital funds, taking stakes in start-ups and betting they will turn a profit if the companies are sold or go public.
"I think GSV was really innovative in creating a kind of publicly traded venture capital fund," said Jason Jones, founder of HighStep Capital, which also invests in private companies.
But the shares of closed-end funds trade on investor demand - and can go significantly higher or lower than the value of the underlying portfolios. The entire category has been hit by Facebook's troubles, with GSV trading at a 38 percent discount to its so-called net asset value.
Mr. Moe, 49, has previously experienced the wild ups and downs of popular stocks.
A backup quarterback at the University of Minnesota, he started out as a stockbroker at the Minneapolis-based Dain Bosworth, where he wrote a stock-market newsletter called "Mike Moe's Market Minutes." He met the chief executive of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, on a visit to Seattle in 1992, and he began covering the coffee chain after its initial public offering.
"I left believing I had just met the next Ray Kroc," Mr. Moe wrote in his 2006 book, "Finding the Next Starbucks," referring to the executive who built the McDonald's empire.
After stints at two other brokerage firms, Mr. Moe became the director of global growth research in San Francisco at Merrill Lynch in 1998. There he ran a group of a dozen analysts at a time when mere business models "were going public at billion-dollar valuations," he said.
Shortly after the dot-com bubble burst, he founded a banking boutique now called ThinkEquity. At the time, he expected the I.P.O. market to shrug off the weakness and recover in a couple of years. Instead, it went into a decade-long slump.
"Market timing is not my best skill," Mr. Moe said. In 2007, he sold ThinkEquity.
The next year, he started a new firm to provide research on private companies, NeXt Up Research. He later expanded into asset management, eventually changing the name to GSV. Within two months of starting his own fund, he bought the shares in Facebook through SecondMarket, a marketplace for private shares.
GSV soon raised additional funds from investors and put the money into start-ups in education, cloud computing, Internet commerce, social media and clean technology. Along with Groupon and Zynga, he bought Twitter, Gilt Groupe and Spotify Technology. The goal is finding "the fastest-growing companies in the world," he said.
But Mr. Moe has paid a high price, picking up several start-ups at high valuations on the private market. He bought Facebook at $29.92 a share. That stock is now trading at $19.10. He purchased Groupon in August 2011 for $26.61 a share, well above its eventual public offering price of $20. It currently sells at $4.31.
Max Wolff, who tracks pre-I.P.O. stocks at GreenCrest Capital Management, said GSV sometimes bought "popular names to please investors." 
"This is such a sentiment-sensitive space, the stocks don't trade on fundamentals," Mr. Wolff said, adding, "If there's a loss of faith, they fall without a net."
GSV's peers have also struggled. Firsthand Technology Value Fund, which owns stakes in Facebook and solar power businesses like SolarCity and Intevac, is off 65 percent from its peak in April. "We paid too much" for Facebook, said Firsthand's chief executive, Kevin Landis.
Two other funds with similar strategies have sidestepped the bulk of the pain. Harris & Harris Group owns 32 companies in microscale technology. Keating Capital, with $75 million in assets, owns pieces of 20 venture-backed companies. But neither Harris nor Keating owns Facebook, Groupon or Zynga, so shares in those companies have not fallen as steeply.
GSV is now dealing with the fallout.
In a conference call in August, Mr. Moe was confronted by one investor who said, "the recent public positions have been a disaster," according to a transcript on Seeking Alpha, a stock market news Web site. While Mr. Moe expressed similar disappointment, he emphasized the companies' fundamentals. Collectively, he said, their revenue was growing by more than 100 percent.
"We have been around this for quite some time, and we are going to be wrong from time to time," Mr. Moe said in the call. "But we are focused on the batting average."
In the same call, Mr. Moe remained enthusiastic - if not hyperbolic - about the group's prospects. Many of GSV's 40 holdings are in "game-changing companies" with the potential to drive outsize growth, he told the investors. 
Twitter, the largest, "continues to just be a rocket ship in terms of growth, and we think value creation," he said. The data analysis provider Palantir Technologies helps the Central Intelligence Agency "track terrorists and bad guys all over the world." The flash memory maker Violin Memory "is experiencing hyper-growth," he wrote in an e-mail.
But Mr. Moe was a bit more muted in recent interviews. While he says he still believes in giving public investors access to private company stocks, he recognizes the cloud over GSV. "We unfortunately have a social media segment that got tainted. I completely get why our stock is where it is. It's going to be a show-me situation for a while."
Acknowledging some regrets, Mr. Moe said he was angriest about overpaying for Groupon, saying, "Yeah, I blew Groupon." He said that he also did not anticipate what he called a deceleration in Facebook's growth rate, and that it was "kind of infuriating" that some of its early investors were allowed to exit before others. GSV often must hold its shares until six months after a public offering.
But the downturn in pre-I.P.O. shares has a silver lining, Mr. Moe said. Since the Facebook public offering, he has been able to put money to work "at better prices." He recently bought shares of Spotify at a valuation of about $3 billion, roughly 25 percent below the target in its latest round of financing.
The I.P.O. market is also showing signs of life, he said, with the strong debuts of Palo Alto Networks and Kayak Software. And he still has faith in Facebook.
Whatever its current stock price, at least it is a "real company" with revenue and profit, Mr. Moe said, adding, "It's not being valued off eyeballs and fairy dust."

HEADLINE: ING to Sell Canadian Unit to Scotiabank for $3.1 Billion

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The ING Group said on Wednesday that it would sell its Canadian unit to Scotiabank for about $3.1 billion in cash, as the Dutch bank continues to sell assets to pay for its government bailout. 

 BODY:
The ING Group said on Wednesday that it would sell its Canadian unit to Scotiabank for about $3.1 billion in cash, as the Dutch bank continues to sell assets to pay for its government bailout.
The transaction comes a year after ING agreed to sell its ING Direct online banking unit in the United States to Capital One Financial for about $9 billion, in one of the largest banking deals since the financial crisis.
ING said this year that its primary goals remained bolstering its Tier 1 capital ratio and repaying the rescue of 10 billion euros that it received from the Dutch government in 2008.
 The deal on Wednesday will give Scotiabank control of one of Canada's 10 biggest banks: The ING unit has $30 billion in deposits and 1.8 million customers. The ING business also has what it describes as a strong home loan portfolio, with 59 percent of the mortgages insured. And for uninsured mortgages, the loans cover about half the price of the purchased property.
Yet the business' low-margin model deterred some would-be buyers from bidding for the unit.
In a nod to the ING unit's strong consumer brand awareness, Scotiabank said that it would keep the division's ING Direct name. 
"Scotiabank is committed to preserving what ING Direct's customers have come to love about it," Anatol von Hahn, Scotiabank's group head of Canadian banking, said in a statement. "ING Direct will continue to operate separately and customers will be able to interact the way they do now using their existing account numbers and passwords, served by the same familiar team."
Scotiabank said that it would stay within its Tier 1 capital ratio of 7 percent to 7.5 percent through the first quarter of next year.
The Canadian bank will finance the deal in part by issuing 29 million shares at $52 each, raising about $1.5 billion in new equity. That stock sale could be expanded up to $1.7 billion if demand proves strong enough. 
Shares in Scotiabank fell 2.6 percent in after-hours trading, to $52.75. They have risen about 1 percent over the last 12 months.
The deal is expected to close by December, pending regulatory approval.
Scotiabank advised itself, while ING was advised by JPMorgan Chase.

HEADLINE: Romney's Play For the Center

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Why his supposed pivot to the right is arguably a play for undecideds. 

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom going into this week's Tampa festivities is that Mitt Romney has shifted, over the last few weeks, from a generic "economy economy economy" campaign to a harder-edged and more ideological attack on the incumbent's record. The Paul Ryan pick, the wave of welfare-themed campaign ads, the "you didn't build that" attacks and Romney's "birther" joke have all been cited as evidence of this rightward shift. But this passage from a Josh Kraushaar column complicates this narrative in a useful way:
... the "you didn't build it line" has become a GOP meme, but it doesn't just strike a nerve with the base, but with small business employers struggling in the stagnant economy.
Indeed, bringing up these hot-button issues have been characterized as pandering to the base, but they're also designed to win over many of the disaffected independent voters. Welfare was once a major Democratic vulnerability; it made political sense for Clinton to rebuke his base and embrace reforms proposed by House Republicans. Medicare is an issue that Democrats have frequently invoked against Republicans; now the tables are turned.
For months now, I and others have been arguing that Romney needs to do more than just talk in generic Republican terms about low taxes and spending cuts and economic growth - that he needs to address Americans' economic insecurities more directly, and claim part of the center that the Obama campaign has vacated. And well, in a certain sense, he's spent the last few weeks taking that advice: Not in the way that I'd like, obviously (oh pro-family tax reform, where art thou?), but in a way that makes a certain crude political sense. He's used the choice of Ryan, in particular, to shore up his right flank on Medicare reform (must) even as he pivots to hammering the Obama White House for, well, cutting Medicare too deeply. That's an argument that's clearly designed to resonate with financially-strapped Sunbelt swing voters as much as with the Republican base, and the same is true (albeit in a less immediate, more symbolic way) of his attacks on the Obama White House's welfare waivers: As Mickey Kaus will happily explain to you, they're a pitch to the Reagan Democrats who sided with Republicans in the original welfare reform debate more than they are a hard pivot to the right.
In both cases, Romney is targeting the kind of voters that Reihan Salam and I (borrowing from Tim Pawlenty) called the "Sam's Club" demographic, and he's doing so with arguments on policy rather than with purely cultural appeals. He isn't targeting them in ways that I would consider forward-looking or particularly inventive, and his rhetoric on Medicare, in particular, is something conservative entitlement reformers may eventually come to rue. But it's a mistake to regard these gambits as examples of ideological conservatism taking the whip hand in this campaign: Romney is clearly trying to capture one of American politics's various centers as well as shore up his base, and recent polling suggest that he's meeting with some (very modest) success.

HEADLINE: In Florida, Tampa Is Essential to Romney Election Hopes

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: It is hard to conceive of Mr. Romney winning in November but losing Florida, and the linchpin to winning Florida is usually found in and around Tampa's Hillsborough County. 

 BODY:
The Republican Party has good reason to hold its national convention in Tampa, Fla. The Tampa area is the most competitive section of the most competitive region in one of the most competitive states in the nation - the perfect place to seek a glimmer of extra advantage in a closely-fought presidential contest. 
In many ways, the Tampa area was the weakest link in the regional coalition that Barack Obama built to win Florida in 2008. The Tampa-St. Petersburg media market is home to a quarter of Florida's registered Republicans, and Mr. Obama carried Hillsborough and Pinellas Counties - home to Tampa and St. Petersburg - by a smaller margin than Florida's other major population centers. If Mitt Romney wants to win the state, it represents the most attractive target.
And winning Florida is a must for Mr. Romney. Based on the simulations that the FiveThirtyEight forecast model ran on Tuesday, Mr. Romney has only a 0.3 percent chance of winning the election if he loses the state.
It is hard to conceive of Mr. Romney winning the election but losing Florida because Florida is an ever-so-slightly Republican-leaning state. If he loses it, he's probably having trouble elsewhere on the map as well. It's quite unlikely that Mr. Romney loses Florida but wins a state like Michigan or Pennsylvania, for instance. 
Still, the state is idiosyncratic enough that it could behave differently, moving in one direction while the other swing states move in another. Each party begins with some strengths and weaknesses in the state, and regions that are vital to its path to victory there.
Just over a third of Florida's registered Democrats live in the Miami and West Palm Beach media markets, especially in Miami-Dade County, Broward County and Palm Beach County.
Broward County, in particular, is critical to Democratic margins in Florida. While Miami-Dade County is reliably Democratic, its large Cuban-American population leans Republican and keeps the county from tilting all the way to the left. Miami-Dade County is home to 58 percent of Florida's Hispanic Republicans and 34 percent of Hispanic Democrats. Without Broward County, however, Mr. Obama would have lost Florida in 2008; his statewide margin of victory (204,577 votes) was less than his margin in Broward (252,948 votes).
Democratic support has grown more recently in Orlando, a historically Republican city and the second main population center in the Interstate 4 corridor (along with Tampa). Orlando's Orange County was just marginally Democratic in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. Then - partly because of an influx of non-Cuban Hispanics - Mr. Obama carried Orange County fairly easily in 2008, and the county itself is probably out of reach for Republicans now. 
"It's really tipping the state," Mr. deHaven-Smith said. A potential dream scenario for Democrats - and a nightmare for Republicans - is if the demographic shifts in this region are enough to shift Florida from being slightly Republican-leaning to strictly neutral, or slightly Democratic-leaning instead.
The Jacksonville area has also moved to the left, although from a more conservative starting point and for slightly different reasons. That region, which has a significant military presence, is known for its culturally moderate, business-oriented Republicans, Mr. Smith said. Former President George W. Bush won Jacksonville's Duval County with 58 percent of the vote in both 2000 and 2004.
Those same voters are still a majority, but just barely. Duval County has become more competitive as its African-American population has grown and as black turnout has increased, Mr. deHaven-Smith said. In 2008, Mr. Obama lost Duval by just one percentage point.
West of Jacksonville -- past liberal islands around the state capital, Tallahassee, and the home of the University of Florida, Gainesville -- Florida begins to look and feel like its northern neighbors, Georgia and Alabama. Affectionately known as the "Redneck Riviera", the Florida Panhandle's beautiful beaches are dotted by resorts and military installations. The area is culturally conservative and heavily Republican, but most of the counties in the Panhandle are sparsely populated. 
The last predominately Republican area of the state is southwest Florida, where a string of retirement communities stretch along the coast, giving the G.O.P. a solid base of reliable voters. More affluent retirees tend to live in Collier County, while more working-class retirees have settled in Charlotte County, Mr. deHaven-Smith said. But both communities, like Fort Myers's Lee County and most of the rest of Florida, were hit hard by the collapse of the housing sector.
The Bellwether: Hillsborough County
That leaves the Tampa area as neutral - but critical - turf. Of course, both Democrats and Republicans can do a little worse in one region if they do a little better in another. But in general, carrying Tampa has been the final step for statewide winners. In every election since 1960 the presidential candidate who carried Florida has also carried Tampa's Hillsborough County.
Economically and ethnically, Hillsborough County is a fairly good microcosm of America. The county's Democratic core in Tampa is balanced by the city's Republican suburbs, and recent Hispanic growth has been accompanied by exurban growth, maintaining the county's partisan equilibrium. 
The Bottom Line
Florida is the closest state according to the FiveThirtyEight forecast; Mr. Obama was a nominal 52 percent favorite there as of Tuesday, but it has flipped back and forth between the candidates many times.
Still, and particularly so long as Mr. Obama seems to hold a clearer advantage in other swing states like Ohio, it is much easier to conceive of Mr. Obama winning the election without Florida than Mr. Romney. For that reason, it represents more of an offensive state for him. 
For over a year, Mr. Obama has been building an extensive infrastructure in the state, despite the state's reputation for being dominated by the advertising "air war." The Obama campaign has opened 73 field offices in Florida compared with the Romney campaign's 28.
In Mr. Romney's favor is Florida's still struggling economy. In particular, the state's housing sector continues to flounder. Apart from the general distaste that a poor economy can cultivate for an incumbent, the Obama campaign's efforts to reach out to voters have been complicated by Florida's many home foreclosures, which have uprooted thousands and rendered voter lists inaccurate.
Ultimately, the calculus for undecided Tampa voters is the same for Florida voters, which is much the same as it is for undecided voters elsewhere: how much is the president to blame for the tepid economic recovery, in Florida and the nation? And is Mr. Romney a suitable alternative? The way voters in Tampa answer those questions could help determine the next president.

HEADLINE: China Slams Romney for 'Pugnacious' Policies

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney and the Republican Party favor a tougher line on Chinese trade practices and human rights, they want a more robust U.S. naval presence in the Asia-Pacific region, and they'd sell high-tech arms to Taiwan. China says the "pugnacious" proposals smack of "a Cold War mentality." 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - The Republican Party was still battening down its hatches against Tropical Storm Isaac when Hurricane China began to lash Mitt Romney and the party's proposed policies on Asia.
The principal attack came through an editorial on Monday in China Daily, the state-run newspaper, which called Mr. Romney's policies "an outdated manifestation of a Cold War mentality" that "endorses the 'China threat' theory and focuses on containing China's rise." 
The editorial said the Romney policies, as stated on his campaign Web site, were "worrying" and "more pugnacious" than the approach of the Obama administration. 
The 2012 Republican Party platform says the United States should bolster its naval presence in the region while "assisting partners that require help to enhance their defensive capabilities."
"In the face of China's accelerated military build-up, the United States and our allies must maintain appropriate military capabilities to discourage any aggressive or coercive behavior by China against its neighbors," the platform said.
But the China Daily editorial warned Mr. Romney that U.S. support of other Asian countries in their disputes with China over islands in the South China Sea "will only lead to head-on confrontation between the two countries."
"The Department of Defense should reconsider recent decisions not to sell top-of-the-line equipment to our closest Asian allies," the G.O.P. platform states. "We should be coordinating with Taiwan to determine its military needs and supplying them with adequate aircraft and other military platforms."
Any mention of Taiwan was bound to get China's attention, and China Daily said:
As to Romney's suggestion that the US step up arms sales to Taiwan, it lays bare his ignorance of the fundamentals of Sino-US ties, as this is the most sensitive issue between the two countries. US arms sales to Taiwan have thrown bilateral ties off balance several times in the past. It requires political vision as well as profound knowledge of Sino-US relations as a whole, to make sensible policy recommendations about what are widely recognized as the most important bilateral ties in the world. Romney apparently lacks both.
Mr. Romney said pressing China on human rights would be a centerpiece of his administration's policy. From his campaign site: 
If the United States fails to support dissidents out of fear of offending the Chinese government, we will merely embolden China's leaders. We certainly should not have relegated the future of freedom to second or third place, as Secretary of State Clinton did in 2009 when she publicly declared that the Obama administration would not let U.S. concerns about China's human rights record interfere with cooperation "on the global economic crisis [and] the global climate change crisis."
Free and fair trade is another key part of the G.O.P. platform, and Mr. Romney and the party said they would allow China into a proposed free-trading "Reagan Economic Zone" that "could knit together the whole region." 
But the party also singles out China as the principal foreign thief of American patents, brands, technology and intellectual property. From its platform:
The chief offender is China, which has built up its economy in part by piggybacking onto Western technological advances, manipulates its currency to the disadvantage of American exporters, excludes American products from government purchases, subsidizes Chinese companies to give them a commercial advantage, and invents regulations and standards designed to keep out foreign competition. The current Administration's way of dealing with all these violations of world trade standards has been a virtual surrender.
The platform also threatens to invoke "countervailing duties if China fails to amend its currency policies," and "punitive measures will be imposed on foreign firms that misappropriate American technology and intellectual property." If China fails to abide by W.T.O. protocols, the platform says, "the United States government will end procurement of Chinese goods and services."
Another China Daily commentary said this kind of tough talk is being employed "to differentiate his China policies from Obama's and curry favor with hard right-wing elements in the Republican Party." The commentary acknowledged Mr. Romney's promise to brand China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, but said China is "inured to such campaign talk from American politicians."
Evan A. Feigenbaum, an Asia-Pacific co-chair on the Romney foreign policy advisory team, said in a November interview with the Council on Foreign Relations that countries in Asia are now so deeply integrated with China that their growth is virtually dependent on Beijing. 
"But China scares them silly," Mr. Feigenbaum said, "so those [same] countries are tacking toward the United States for closer security partnerships."
He downplayed the so-called "pivot" of U.S. military assets toward the Asia-Pacific region. American diplomats have more recently spurned "pivot" for the term "rebalancing." An excerpt from Mr. Feigenbaum's C.F.R. interview with Bernard Gwertzman:
There's no question that the United States is paying a lot of attention to what's happening in Asia, but this notion of some gigantic pivot obscures the degree to which there are some really central pillars of American policy in the Pacific that have roots that go back decades.
It isn't as if the United States suddenly woke up in the last year or two and discovered that it ought to play an important role in security in Asia. The notion of some gigantic pivot isn't helpful because it suggests that the United States is kind of a herky-jerky super power that swings wildly from focusing on one thing to focusing on another thing. 
Firstly, that doesn't really describe reality, and second, it's not very reassuring to Asian countries and particularly to U.S. allies to see the United States described that way.

What's your take on the Romney/Republican approach toward Asia in general and toward China more specifically? Do you favor a harder line with Beijing on human rights - and more challenges on its trade practices? Better weapons for Taiwan? Do you agree with China Daily that Mr. Romney's proposed policies are too "pugnacious" and smack of a return to "a Cold War mentality"?

HEADLINE: Republican Platform Opposes Agenda 21

BYLINE: LESLIE KAUFMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican Party platform, approved this week, includes a resolution condemning a 40-year-old United Nations resolution the encourages sustainable development. 

 BODY:
The G.O.P. platform approved Tuesday in Florida included tough language on many expected issues like abortion, but also takes a stand on an issue that has historically been out of the party's mainstream: Agenda 21.
"We strongly reject the U.N. Agenda 21 as erosive of American sovereignty, and we oppose any form of U.N. Global Tax," thereads.
Agenda 21 is a 1992 United Nations resolution that encourages sustainable development globally. Although it is nonbinding and has no force of law in the United States, it has increasingly become a point of passionate concern to a circle of Republican activists who argue that the resolution is part of a United Nations plot to deny Americans their property rights.
In a New York Times article in February written with my colleague, Kate Zernike, we reported about activists aligned with the Tea Party disrupting local city and state land use planning meetings nationwide to denounce sustainable efforts to reduce energy use -- including bike lanes on public streets and smart meters on home appliances. The activists see such community projects as the first steps in a plan to limit individual rights.
Since that article, land use officials in many parts of the country have complained of anti-Agenda 21 disruptions, most recently in Notasulga, Ala.
Most of those pushing the Agenda 21 theory have been largely on the margins of their own party. But the inclusion of language for Agenda 21 in the Republican Party platform could mark a turning point, said Tom Madrecki, a spokesman for Smart Growth America, an advocacy group that works to limit sprawl.
"Though the actual language of the platform does not say anything besides 'we oppose Agenda 21,' the fact that it's in the platform gives credence to something that just shouldn't get any," he said.
He said he's concerned that formalizing opposition to Agenda 21 will bring more disruption and will "continue halting beneficial conversations about community planning."
Mitt Romney's campaign did not return e-mails asking whether the nominee supports the inclusion of formal opposition to Agenda 21 in the platform.

HEADLINE: Gay Republicans Try to Join the Party

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: GOProud, which advocates for gay conservatives, says it is bringing unusual levels of gay support to Mitt Romney, but discordant notes rang through the dance music at a party near the Republican convention. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- The go-go dancers at the party for gay Republicans on Tuesday night were, by go-go dancer standards, modestly dressed in T-shirts and jeans, baring only their midriffs and arms. Their choreography, set to dance remixes of "Call Me Maybe" and other Top 40 hits, conveyed enthusiasm more than sexual enticement. 
"This is the largest event hosted by a gay group at a Republican convention," Jimmy LaSalvia, a co-founder of GOProud, an advocacy group for gay conservatives, said from the stage at a club called the Honey Pot. "Not that size matters."
The convention's Homocon 2012 party did manage to smoothly blend straight-laced Republican mores with the lowbrow decadence that characterizes Ybor City, Tampa's nightclub district. Several hundred people listened to Mr. LaSalvia talk about the tax code and free market capitalism while standing under silky blue and magenta fabric that dangled from the ceiling, interspersed with white paper globe lanterns. "Booze," offered up in Mr. LaSalvia's Southern drawl, was served in clear plastic cups to the relatively young crowd, consisting mostly of neatly groomed men still in their convention-appropriate button-downs and blazers.
But, despite the triumphant speeches, the event highlighted that gay people have yet to be smoothly incorporated into a party that is still dominated by social conservatives. 
As Mr. LaSalvia noted, GOProud was the only gay group to endorse the Romney-Ryan ticket (the right's other prominent gay group, the Log Cabin Republicans, has yet to sign off on a presidential candidate). However, what he did not say was that half of the gay men and lesbians on the board dissented, according to MetroWeekly. 
Mr. LaSalvia said that gay marriage, the group's central disagreement with Mr. Romney, is not as important as economic issues in 2012.
"Before you can get married, you have to have a date," he said. "And everyone knows you can't get a date without a job."
There were other reminders that while gay people might be embracing the G.O.P., the affinity is not mutual. The hosts acknowledged Richard Grenell, a conservative foreign policy expert who was at the party. But in May, objections from social conservatives to his sexual orientation contributed tohis decision to resign from the Romney campaign as a foreign policy spokesman. And GOProud itself was barred from participating in the most recent Conservative Political Action Conference.
And many in the crowd were not Republicans or Romney backers. The founders' remarks were sometimes drowned out by jeers from supporters of Representative Ron Paul and President Obama who were gathered at the back bar.
But some of the Democrats there said they would be open to the Republican Party if it changed its stance on same-sex marriage. Michael Smith and Steve G. Barthelemy have been together for 17 years and were invited to Homocon by a friend on the convention host committee. Mr. Smith is a Democrat and Mr. Barthelemy is a Republican, but their political views are not that much different. It's a matter of priorities.
"Would a marriage license change anything?" wondered Mr. Barthelemy, 50, a small-business owner and an accountant who likes the Republicans' economic policies. 
"As a centrist Democrat," Mr. Smith, 51, said, "the Republican Party posture on morality and gay civil rights is the only things standing between" him and the party.
"I've really got to make a decision in November," added Mr. Smith, who works at the Home Shopping Network. 
While GOProud is hoping to expand the Republican Party, it doesn't seem likely to help close the gender gap. Women were a stark minority at Homocon, and after weeding out the journalists, straight guests and gay supporters of Mr. Paul and Mr. Obama, it was difficult to find any gay Republican women.

HEADLINE: Romney Tells Veterans That Obama 'Dodged the Tough Choices'

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney spoke to the American Legion in Indianapolis on Wednesday as his party focused on national security, an area that has received little attention in a campaign dominated by the economy. 

 BODY:
INDIANAPOLIS - Mitt Romney promised veterans at a convention on Wednesday that he would stop "reckless defense cuts" set for the end of the year and slammed President Obama as a commander in chief who has "failed to lead" and has "dodged the tough choices."
Mr. Romney broke away from the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., to fly to the American Legion convention here as his party focused on national security, an area that has received little attention in a campaign dominated by the economy. Mr. Romney planned to return to Tampa in time to watch Wednesday night's speeches, including some by the party's national security leaders.
The speech here, his last one scheduled until he formally accepts the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday night, drew a sharp contrast with Mr. Obama on issues that have been a political strength for the president. Having ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden as well as scores of drone strikes that took out other terrorists, Mr. Obama has led Mr. Romney on his handling of international affairs in many polls.
But Mr. Romney complained that Mr. Obama remains too reticent about America's role in the world, expanding on a theme that has flavored the Republican nominee's speeches and a book he wrote called "No Apology: The Case for American Greatness," which is being distributed to delegates in Tampa.
"For the last four years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to diminish," Mr. Romney told thousands of veterans gathered here. "In dealings with other nations, he has given trust where it's not earned, insult where it's not deserved and apology where it's not due."
The candidate concentrated in particular on automatic budget cuts that will take effect at the end of the year unless Mr. Obama and Congress agree on an alternative plan. Half of the cuts, or nearly $500 billion, are due to come from national security agencies, including the armed forces, over the next 10 years on top of a roughly similar amount already to be cut over a decade.
"The Obama administration is set to cut defense spending by nearly a trillion dollars. My administration will not," Mr. Romney said. "I'll make reductions in other areas and install pro-growth policies to make sure that our country remains safe and secure."
He also accused Mr. Obama of not doing enough to help veterans who seek help from the government.
Mr. Obama's campaign has rejected the Romney criticism, pointing to successes in dismantling terrorist groups over the last three and a half years. Independent analysts have called the notion that Mr. Obama apologizes for his country overstated or even false.
And the automatic budget cuts that Mr. Romney vowed to stop were part of legislation passed with the support of Republican leaders, including his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, as a motivation to the two parties to come together on a more agreeable budget-cutting alternative. Mr. Obama, like Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan, does not want them to go into effect.
The Obama campaign fired back on Wednesday by saying that Mr. Romney should support higher taxes on the wealthy to shield the armed forces from deeper cuts. 
"Throughout this campaign, Mitt Romney has offered a lot of reckless bluster and vague platitudes, but zero specific national security policies - and that continued at the American Legion today," said Lis Smith, an Obama spokeswoman. "Lost in his speech was the fact that the only thing standing in the way of preventing the automatic defense cuts he decried is his refusal to ask for another dime from millionaires and billionaires."
But Mr. Romney has made military spending a higher priority in his campaign speeches, vowing to protect it from the sort of cuts that he would impose on other government programs. And he has suggested that he would be less willing to let allies lead in situations like the Libya war, when Mr. Obama encouraged NATO countries in Europe to step forward.
"Our foreign policy should take a page from the U.S. Marine Corps - no better friend, no worse enemy," he said. "A just, peaceful world depends on our strength and our confidence. Our foreign policy must demonstrate confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose and resolve in our might."
As Mr. Romney's motorcade arrived at the site of the convention here, the American Legion was deeply involved in the sorts of social issues that he has tried to avoid this campaign season, advancing resolutions promoting school prayer, a ban on flag burning, tougher crackdowns on illegal immigration and the adoption of English as the official language. Mr. Romney made no mention of such issues in his speech.
Mr. Romney's appearance before the veterans here reinforced a historical oddity: For the first time in 80 years, none of the presidential or vice-presidential nominees of the two major parties served in uniform. 
National security has been largely a secondary campaign topic at a time of high unemployment and rising national debt. But the Romney campaign has concluded that it needs to make sure that the candidate comes across as a plausible commander in chief to make sure voters are comfortable casting ballots for him.
To that end, the campaign will roll out two of the best-known voices on foreign policy at the convention on Wednesday night, Senator John McCain, at 8 p.m., and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, at 10 p.m.
"The No. 1 issue on people's minds is the economy," said Kevin Madden, a Romney adviser, "but national security, leadership abroad, America's place, American power around the globe is part of the course of consideration that many voters go through."

HEADLINE: Ryan Medicare Plan Is Already Shaking Up House Races

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Paul D. Ryan's presence on the Republican ticket is having an impact on Congressional races. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. - Paul D. Ryan will take the stage at the Republican National Convention here on Wednesday to accept his party's nomination for vice president, but around the country, his plan for a sweeping remake of Medicare is shaking up Congressional campaigns, in some cases allowing Democrats to make inroads in races in which they were once seen as dead in the water.
Republican and Democratic pollsters and strategists say a curious split is developing around the Ryan plan. The top of the Republican ticket - Mitt Romney and Mr. Ryan - is holding its own with the issue in a presidential contest that has shown little movement in polls for months. But down the ticket, Medicare attacks are taking a serious toll on Republicans.
"It's a down-ballot disaster, across the board," boasted Representative Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "We left for recess in a fairly neutral environment, where nearly a month later we have a good stiff wind at our backs. That wind is mostly propelled by Paul Ryan and his budget."
Officials at the National Republican Congressional Committee said the attacks were not working. Guy Harrison, the committee's executive director, predicted that within two weeks, frustrated Democrats will move on to other issues.
But other Republicans - privately and publicly - say Democrats are not about to let up. Tom Cotton, a rising Republican star running for the Arkansas seat of Representative Mike Ross, a Democrat who is retiring, said that the attacks were not working on him in a district that is trending strongly Republican, but that other candidates were struggling.
Still, he said, most candidates are ready to fight for Mr. Ryan's plan.
"They recognize, as the House members already there recognize, we have to have this debate, and we have to win this debate," he said, recalling ambush training he had in the Army when soldiers were drilled to face an attack head-on. "This is the most predictable ambush in politics. You don't duck and cover. You turn and face it."
In Mr. Ryan's Wednesday night speech, Republicans are not expecting him to delve into the details of his "Path to Prosperity," the budget plan he wrote and the House passed earlier this year. Under the Ryan proposal, those who are now under 55 would no longer receive a government-guaranteed, fee-for-service health plan when they reach 65. Instead, at 67, they would receive a fixed amount each year that they would use to purchase private health insurance or buy into the existing Medicare program. That check would increase each year slightly faster than the growth of the economy, regardless of the rate of health care cost inflation.
Democrats are pointing to a raft of polling - most of it from Democratic pollsters - showing their candidates building significant leads in districts Republicans think they should win. A late July poll showed Representative Jim Matheson of Utah 18 percentage points ahead of the Republican candidate, Mia Love, who is getting star treatment in Tampa. In a poll by the Democratic firm Lake Research Partners, Ricky Gill, another Republican candidate granted a speaking slot at the convention on Tuesday, was 16 points behind Representative Jerry McNerney, a California Democrat in a redrawn Republican-leaning district.
Representative Mike McIntyre, Democrat of North Carolina, was all but left for dead after his district was redrawn to skew heavily Republican. But in late July, he was up on the Republican candidate, David Rouzer, 53 percent to 34 percent.
Since then, Democrats have poured on the Medicare attack, especially since Mr. Ryan was named to the ticket. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's first independent expenditures advertisement on the freshman representative Dan Benishek of Michigan, saying he had voted to "essentially end Medicare and raise costs on seniors by over $6,000 a year."
The same line of attack ison the air in North Carolina against Mr. Rouzer, coupled with the charge that his Ryan budget vote would also cut taxes for millionaires, "definitely not North Carolina values." 
President Obama's campaign came to Tampa on Wednesday to keep the heat on, introducing Carole Nenninger, a 71-year-old from just outside Tampa, to tell her story of her husband, Bill, whose battle with cancer has cost endless heartaches and more than $1 million - all paid by Medicare.
"If there's a voucher, I'm a little skeptical about turning over medical insurance to a private insurance company," said the Obama campaign volunteer.
Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the National Republican Congressional Committee's recruitment chairman, expressed no concern about the attacks and confidence that Republicans will actually pick up seats in November. Mr. Harrison added that the Medicare attacks were no more potent with Mr. Ryan on the ticket than they were when the first wave of them hit in a 2010 special election in upstate New York, when the Democratic candidate, Kathy Hochul, won a Republican seat.
"There is not going to be an additional House ad because of Paul Ryan," said Mr. Harrison, the N.R.C.C.'s executive director. "There were going to run on him anyway."

HEADLINE: A Republican Platform Line Friendly to Immigrants

BYLINE: JULIA PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: A Texas business owner has been campaigning to have Republicans soften their stance on immigration. 

 BODY:
It was no surprise that the Republicans declared their intention to strictly crack down on illegal immigration in their platform, which was released last week. 
But one line was added to the text that went counter to the calls for strict verification and expanded by states: It called for "a legal and reliable source of foreign labor where needed through a new guest worker program." 
And Brad Bailey, a Texas Republican who owns two seafood restaurants in suburbs of Houston, was satisfied to see it there.
Mr. Bailey, 39, is not a delegate at the convention in Tampa, Fla., but he has been roaming the hallways there since last week, striding up to delegates to convince them that the party should be on record supporting new access for employers to legal foreign labor. He is a nonstop advocate for the immigration plank that Texas Republicans wrote into their state platform after contentious meetings in June, which includes a temporary foreign worker program.
"We are a border state and we have the same problem as Arizona, but we addressed it totally differently than Arizona," Mr. Bailey said, referring to polarizing enforcement laws passed in that state. 
Mr. Bailey admits he is rowing against his party's tide this year. But he is among a number of Republicans, many of them farmers or small-business owners, who are urging party leaders to recognize that some employers still have a hard time filling low-paying jobs despite high unemployment. 
He also wants the party to take the edge off its rhetoric against illegal immigrants. "Jan Brewer and Joe Arpaio are hijacking the issue and damaging the Republican party brand," Mr. Bailey said, referring to Arizona's governor and the hard-line sheriff of Maricopa County. "We need to stop the hatred language and fix this problem."
Mr. Bailey said he started his personal campaign to change the party's approach after Latino workers in one of his restaurants -- longtime legal employees -- asked him last year why he was a Republican. "They don't like Hispanics," the workers said of the party.
He said Kris Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas who wrote several enforcement amendments that were added to the convention platform, did not understand the needs of employers in labor-intensive businesses. 
"I sign the front of the paychecks, he signs the back," Mr. Bailey said. 
In Tampa, Mr. Bailey found a sympathetic hearing from several delegates, including Sue Sharkey, a Colorado state official, who came to the meetings with her own proposal for a guest worker program run entirely by the private sector. Ms. Sharkey said she offered the language that was eventually adopted in the final text of the platform. 
The party's candidate, Mitt Romney, has said little recently on immigration, generally avoiding an issue that divides the party and has distanced it from Latino voters. Mr. Bailey said he was hoping for leadership on the issue from Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney's running mate, who co-sponsored a Democratic proposal in Congress two years ago to give legal status to immigrant farmworkers.

11:38 P.M. | That's a Wrap
That's a wrap for Wednesday at the Republican National Convention. Come back tomorrow for more live coverage.

11:18 P.M. | No, Not That Greek Archbishop
 Not that many non-Greeks will care, but that was not Archbishop Demetrios giving the closing benediction, as the Republican convention schedule stated. It was Metropolitan Methodios of Boston.
Archbishop Demetrios, the head of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, has frequently appeared at Republican political gatherings, but a Greek-American news site said he was out of the country. Metropolitan Methodios has been associated with Mitt Romney in Massachusetts, the site said.

11:16 P.M. | Fact-Checking Some of Ryan's Statements
In his convention speech, Representative Paul D. Ryan criticized President Obama for seeking Medicare cuts that he once sought as well, and for failing to act on a deficit-reduction plan that he too opposed.
Mr. Ryan, whose own plan to reshape Medicare has proved unpopular with voters, criticized Mr. Obama for moving to cut $716 billion from the expected future growth of Medicare - cuts that Mr. Ryan himself once counted on in his budget plan, but which his running mate, Mitt Romney, says he would restore.
Mr. Ryan also criticized the president for failing to act on the recommendations of the bipartisan debt commission that Mr. Obama had created. 
"They came back with an urgent report," he said. "He thanked them, sent them on their way, and then did exactly nothing."
That appeared to be a reference to the Simpson-Bowles commission - which Mr. Ryan served on, but whose plan he ultimately opposed, saying it would raise taxes and not cut enough from health programs.
And in an extended critique of the president's stimulus plan, Mr. Ryan said: "What did taxpayers get out of the Obama stimulus? More debt." 
He did not mention that a third of the stimulus was in the form of tax cuts.
- 
10:49 P.M. | Hecklers Interrupt Ryan
A yell rang out from near stage left in the middle of Paul D. Ryan's speech.
Two women from the left-wing group Code Pink: Women for Peace interrupted Mr. Ryan's speech with chants of "hands off my body."
They were quickly drowned out by chants of "U.S.A., U.S.A." as security escorted them out. One women identified herself as Ann Wright, an Army colonel. The other carried a pink banner reading "Vagina: Can't say it. Don't legislate it."
Visibly shaken, a man who refused give his name ran out of Section 24 while stuffing some neon pink fabric in his pocket. He said he grabbed it out of the woman's hand, incredulous that someone hadn't taken it earlier.
He refused to show what was written on it.
"I'm gonna burn it!" he said as he rushed toward the forum's exit.
 An earlier version of this post split the name of the left-wing group Code Pink: Women for Peace. It is one group, not two.
- 
10:45 P.M. | Ryan in the Spotlight
Paul D. Ryan offered a mix of folksy charm, family biography and biting criticism of President Obama's administration, earning huge applause from the delegates gathered in the convention hall on Wednesday.
He did not shy away from his proposals on Medicare, accusing Mr. Obama's administration of taking $700 billion away from the program to finance the president's health care reforms.
"An obligation we have to our parents and grandparents is being sacrificed, all to pay for a new entitlement we didn't even ask for," he said as the crowd booed. "The greatest threat to Medicare is Obamacare, and we're going to stop it."
In the face of attacks by Mr. Obama and Democrats to paint Republicans as foes of Medicare, Mr. Ryan said, essentially: Bring it on.
"Our opponents can consider themselves on notice," he said. "In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the Left isn't going to work. Mitt Romney and I know the difference between protecting a program, and raiding it. Ladies and gentlemen, our nation needs this debate. We want this debate. We will win this debate."
Earlier in the speech, Mr. Ryan talked about his father, "a small-town lawyer" and "a gentle presence" in his life, until he died when Mr. Ryan was 16.
"I live on the same block where I grew up," he told a hushed crowd. "We belong to the same parish where I was baptized. Janesville is that kind of place."
But he quickly shifted to an effort to take apart Mr. Obama's policies, including the stimulus spending, health care reform and tax policy.
"What did the taxpayers get out of the Obama stimulus?" Mr. Ryan asked. "More debt. That money wasn't just spent and wasted, it was borrowed, spent, and wasted."
He was interrupted briefly by a protester who yelled "health care, not warfare" as Mr. Ryan started to talk about Mr. Obama's health care plan.
He paused as the crowd chanted "U.S.A.! U.S.A.!" Then he proceeded to describe the health care plan as "more than 2,000 pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees and fines that have no place in a free country."

10:32 P.M. | Raves for Rice
Condoleezza Rice's speech drew raves not just in the hall, but on Twitter - even from some liberal pundits. Here's a sampling of the reactions:
"Condi's speech was presidential," wrote Chris Matthews, the liberal MSNBC talk show host. "Best address of the convention."
His MSNBC colleague, Chris Hayes, agreed, saying, "This is by far the best speech given so far."
"Condi is stealing the show," wrote Charles Lane, the Washington Post editorial writer.
"A memorable speech," said Stuart Rothenberg, the political handicapper. "Wow."
"By any measure the best speech of the week," wrote Neil King of The Wall Street Journal. "Condi storms Tampa."
A few dissenters pointed out that Ms. Rice skirted right past the controversies of her own administration.
"It's just appalling that Rice doesn't even feel the need to acknowledge the Iraq war," wrote Peter Beinart of The Daily Beast and New America Foundation.
- 
10:28 P.M. | Walker and Wisconsin Delegation Celebrate Native Son
The Wisconsin delegation, in a premier position on the convention floor, is at the center of attention here on Wednesday night as Representative Paul D. Ryan prepares to take the stage.
Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who has become a hero of the conservative movement after thwarting a recall attempt in June, had a line of admirers waiting for an autograph, a picture or a few moments of his time. In a brief interview, he shared a bit of his private conversation with Mr. Ryan from earlier in the day.
"I just told him that today I just felt an overwhelming sense - since I pray for him every day - that God had really called him not just to do well tonight, but to be a servant for a time such as this," Mr. Walker said. "I think he's got an incredible responsibility. Knowing Paul, I think he's up for it."
The selection of Mr. Ryan electrified the Republican contingent from Wisconsin. The party activists said the prospect of carrying the state's 10 electoral votes in November has increased considerably with Mr. Ryan on the ticket.
"By Paul being on the ticket, it not only makes him look bigger, but it makes Mitt Romney look bigger because independent voters say, 'This guy has courage,' " Mr. Walker said. Asked whether Mr. Paul, 42, was anxious in the hours leading up to the biggest political speech of his life, Mr. Walker smiled.
"Anybody who says they're not a little bit nervous is lying to you," he said.
- 
10:19 P.M. | Condoleezza Rice: An Invited Guest From the Bush Years
Condoleezza Rice's nationally televised appearance at the convention on Wednesday night seals her status as the one major figure from the Bush-Cheney administration to emerge as a welcome force in today's Republican politics.
While the convention included a tribute video to both President Bushes earlier Wednesday night, Ms. Rice is the only veteran of the Bush years given a speaking slot in the prime-time hour carried live by the broadcast networks. She has been at Mitt Romney's side on several occasions in recent months and was highlighted as a possible vice-presidential choice.
Her return to the political spotlight is intriguing because while she was at the center of many of the foreign policy decisions that were so controversial under President George W. Bush, particularly the Iraq war, she has not been blamed as intensely as Mr. Bush, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. Even admirers from the administration marvel at how unscathed she has been politically.
That may stem in part from the perception that she spent Mr. Bush's second term - when she moved from the White House to the State Department - fighting Mr. Cheney to emphasize diplomacy more with Iran, North Korea and the Middle East. Some conservatives, including John R. Bolton, the former United Nations ambassador who has been hailed by Mr. Romney, remain bitter at what they see as Ms. Rice's betrayal of the more muscular foreign policy of Mr. Bush's first term.
But while Mr. Romney was not eager to have Mr. Bush or Mr. Cheney attend the convention, and both opted to stay away, he was eager to have Ms. Rice speak for him. It does not hurt that she is an African-American woman of great poise and personal charisma. But she also provided Mr. Romney an important validation as a plausible commander in chief. 
Along the way, she has become perhaps the most eloquent and effective defender of the Bush legacy, at least as she defines it, espousing as she did Wednesday night the virtues of his support for democracy and freedom around the world. Her forceful assertion of the need for more accountability in education, the civil rights issue of our times, as she put it, also echoes Mr. Bush's centerpiece domestic policy, the No Child Left Behind law.
Whether she takes that stature and seeks political office remains a subject of much speculation. She has long discounted such ambitions and friends take her at her word on that. But while Mr. Bush stays out of the fray down in Dallas, Ms. Rice may play an important role once again advising a president, even from the outside.
- 
10:17 P.M. | Veterans Weigh In on the G.O.P. Ticket
Veterans have long been an important force in Republican politics, and with Mitt Romney speaking to the American Legion in Indianapolis, and Senator John McCain, the former prisoner of war, addressing the convention, they are particularly prominent today. But, for the first time, no veterans hold the most prominent place in either party: the presidential ticket.
"I'm concerned about it," said Tom Pauken, a member of the Texas delegation and a Vietnam veteran. "It concerns me when too many of our policymakers who pontificate about sending our troops abroad have no military experience or experience serving in war."
In an interview on the convention floor as Mr. McCain, the party's 2008 nominee, was on the stage, Mr. Pauken said he was troubled by the "neoconservative" influence of Mr. Romney's advisers. He is the author of "Bringing America Home," a book that advocates against long-term interventions like those in the Middle East.
But for another delegate who served, Mr. Romney's lack of military experience, in a way, justified his own.
"If you listen to Ann Romney, they had a child," said William A. Ward, a Vietnam veteran and California delegate. "And that's what we're supposed to be protecting, is a man and wife and his family."
Mr. Ward said President Obama had steered veterans "a lot of money through the V.A. system." But he sees cynical motives in the Veterans Administration appropriation: "You could say he's trying to buy the votes with government and tax money."
After serving for 20 years in the Florida National Guard, including two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, Ronald Renuart is now a Republican state legislator in Florida. While he said Mr. Romney has not offered many specific policies to help veterans, he is confident that the former Massachusetts governor will make Congress reach an agreement to prevent deep Pentagon cuts that are set to kick in without a budget agreement.
"Sequestration is a huge threat to our national defense," said Mr. Renuart, a physician and retired colonel. "We need a leader."
 An earlier version of this post misstated the name of the group Mitt Romney spoke to in Indianapolis. It is the American Legion, not the Foreign Legion.

10:10 P.M. | The Man With the Plan
To many conservatives eagerly awaiting the moment Representative Paul D. Ryan addresses the convention, the No. 2 on the ticket is the man with the plan.
But some Republicans in Congress have a different message: Mitt Romney would be president in a Republican administration. And his plan is not Mr. Ryan's.
"The plan is the Romney plan," said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota. "He's the one that's going to drive the agenda." 
"I think I know Paul Ryan very well," said Representative Mary Bono Mack, a moderate Republican from California. "Paul Ryan was bold enough to put a plan out there. But Paul is confident enough to kick the tires on any plan that's put out there."
Conservatives, like the antitax crusader Grover Norquist, have said the party knows where it wants to go. Mr. Ryan's "Path to Prosperity" - the budget approved this year by the House - is not a starting point for negotiations. It's the marching orders.
But Democrats are attacking Republicans hard for their votes for that budget, especially its proposed overhaul of Medicare. Ms. Bono Mack, a target of those attacks, said they would not work.
"For the first time, the American people understand what's at stake," she said.
But with a Republican sweep her goal, she's not so sure Mr. Ryan's Medicare plan is just right.
Mr. Hoeven was blunt. It is Mr. Romney that has the "track record of bringing people in to work together," he said. 
"We have to break the gridlock."
- 
10:08 P.M. | Rice Captivates Convention Crowd
Condoleezza Rice surprised the Republican National Convention, walking out onstage several minutes before 10 p.m., when the main part of the evening was scheduled to start. By any measure, she drew the biggest and most excited applause of the night.
Indeed, as the speech goes on, the hall - which was shimmering with talk and bored-looking delegates - turned silent and rapt, interrupted by repeated bursts of applause and the occasional standing ovation and cheers. Ms. Rice is intense and serious, almost searing, and so far, she seems to be engaging what had to date been a notably low-key convention. Ms. Rice has repeatedly said she has no interest in running for national office herself, though it's a fair bet that the calls for her to consider a political career will be heard again in the hours ahead.
- 
10:07 P.M. | Huckabee Takes a Shot at Biden
Mike Huckabee took a highly personal shot at Vice President Joseph R. Biden, accusing him of being miserly in giving personally to charity.
"Speaking of budgets, Joe Biden's budget shows that while he wants to be generous with your money through higher taxes and government spending, for years, he gave less than two-tenths of 1 percent of his money to charity," Mr. Huckabee said. 
Mr. Biden is hardly a wealthy man. His 2011 tax returns showed an income of $379,035. The returns show that the Bidens paid $87,900 in total federal tax for 2011 and contributed $5,540 to charity.
But Mr. Huckabee compared Mr. Biden directly with Mitt Romney, who is said to be worth more than $250 million. 
Mr. Huckabee said that the vice president "just wants you to give the government more, so he and the Democrats can feel better about themselves." 
"Mitt Romney has given over 16 percent of his income to his church and charity, and I'd feel better about having a leader who gives more of his own money instead of mine."
Mr. Romney has frequently cited his own charitable giving as a defense against criticism that he has paid too little in taxes, using loopholes available only to the rich.
- 
9:52 P.M. | In Attacking Obama, Pawlenty Turns to Comedy
Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, spoke at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday in the latest entry of a parade of also-rans in Mr. Romney's vice-presidential choice - part consolation prize and part, perhaps, demonstrating to delegates why Mr. Romney chose Paul D. Ryan as his running mate.
"Welcome to the Barack Obama retirement party," Mr. Pawlenty said, speaking over a restive crowd that seemed to be pretty much ignoring what was taking place on the podium.
Mr. Pawlenty turned to humor as he sought to win over his crowd, sounding more like a Catskill comedian than the earnest former governor of a Midwest state.
"You have to give Barack Obama credit for creating jobs for the last four years," Mr. Pawlenty said, pausing with borscht belt timing. "For golf caddies."
And this:
"Barack Obama is the tattoo president," Mr. Pawlenty said. "Like a big tattoo, it seemed really cool when you were young. But later on, that decision didn't look so good. And you wonder, 'What was I thinking?'"
But the worst part? "You have to explain it to our kids."
- 
9:47 P.M. | Huckabee Gives Religious Stamp of Approval to Romney
Mitt Romney spent much of this year battling his rivals for support among evangelical Christians, struggling in part because of suspicions about his Mormon faith.
But Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and a one-time evangelical rival to Mr. Romney, sought to lay the issue to rest.
"I care far less as to where Mitt Romney takes his family to church than I do about where he takes this country," Mr. Huckabee said in remarks to the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night.
Mr. Huckabee, the politician-turned-Fox News host, is a hero among evangelical Christians. He considered, and rejected, making a second bid for the presidency this year.
In his remarks, Mr. Huckabee noted that "four years ago, Mitt Romney and I were opponents."
"We still are," he said, adding: "but we're not opposing each other. We are mutual opponents of the miserably failed experiments that have put this country in a downward spiral."
For Mr. Romney - whose commitment to the causes of social conservatives has been questioned - Mr. Huckabee offered some much-appreciated support on issues of abortion, faith, contraception and marriage.
"Let me clear the air about whether guys like me, an evangelical, would only support another evangelical," Mr. Huckabee said. "Of the four people on the two tickets, the only self-professed evangelical is Barack Obama, and he supports changing the definition of marriage, believes that human life is disposable and expendable at any time in the womb or even beyond the womb."
Mr. Huckabee's highest value to Mr. Romney may be in helping to fire up the conservative base on social issues. But he's no slouch when it comes to putting together an overall attack on President Obama.
He called Democrats "the liberty-limiting, radical left-wing, anti-business, reckless-spending, tax-hiking party of Barack Obama, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi."

9:32 P.M. | A Bush and Rice Revival
Two subjects have not been particularly prevalent in the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee: Foreign policy and former President George. W. Bush.
The second session of the Republican convention was emerging as something of a "check the box" night for Mr. Romney's campaign. Mr. Bush and foreign policy issues were on the agenda here.
Mr. Bush (and his father) appeared in a video tribute to Mr. Romney. It was not quite the triumphant in-person return of a former president, but it was a reminder, for those who have forgotten, that there was a Republican president before Barack Obama.
As for foreign policy, it was the main topic of two of the most prominent speakers of the night: Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was Mr. Obama's Republican opponent in 2008, and Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state.
 Mr. McCain's speech was decidedly out of prime time, reflecting the calculation of Republican strategists that foreign policy is unlikely to be the issue that carries Mr. Romney to victory. Ms. Rice was set to speak in prime time. In addition to being one of the nation's most prominent foreign diplomats, she is the highest ranking African-American woman in the Republican Party.

9:20 P.M. | Portman Addresses the Crowd
What would Senator Rob Portman of Ohio been like as Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate?
We got a peek tonight. 
Speaking at 9 p.m., Mr. Portman mixed wonkish policy with a few sharp-edged criticisms of President Obama.
"Where's the president's economic plan? Blaming others does not qualify as a plan," Mr. Portman said. "Folks, we cannot afford four more years. How about no more years?"
The crowd in the hall started chanting: "No more years! No more years!"
Mr. Portman praised Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the man who beat him out for the second place on the ticket. And he sang the praises of Mr. Romney.
"Yes, he made money," Mr. Portman said. "He made it the old-fashioned way, folks. He earned it."

9:05 P.M. | The Texas Delegation Watches the Bushes
No one seemed as rapt by the video greeting from the two former Presidents George Bush as the 155-member Texas delegation in their cowboy hats and blue shirts. They were among the only delegates to stand and applaud, and afterward, Melinda Fredricks, vice chairwoman of the Texas Republican Party, said, "It tugged at my heart to watch that." 
But even among Texans, none said they were disappointed that the most recent Republican president was giving this convention a pass. 
No one believed that their party might have snubbed the man the Romney-Ryan campaign regards like Voldemort - He Who Must Not Be Named.
"That's your interpretation,'' Ms. Fredricks said. "We know it was by their own decision" not to attend. "The family has given so much to their country. It's a lot of strain to be at a convention."
"I think it's a decision both made in favor of letting Mitt Romney take over," said Gary Inmon, from San Antonio, adding, "I'm comfortable with that."
To the Romney-Ryan campaign, the legacy of Bush 43 is one it has no desire wish to revisit. President George W. Bush's policies on tax cuts and two foreign wars created a large share of the current debt, the No. 1 issue of its vice-presidential nominee, Representative Paul D. Ryan. 
These days, it is President Obama who regularly invokes Mr. Bush's legacy. The Romney-Ryan campaign wants to drive home the message that that it is high time for Mr. Obama to own the poor economy, and not pass on the blame to his predecessor. 
Even Gov. Rick Perry of Texas expressed no regret that his party was not honoring its most famous living native sons. The focus this week must be on Mr. Romney, Mr. Perry said during a drop-by visit to his delegation. "If we were to mention everyone who came before him, we wouldn't have time to discuss the future," he said.
- 
8:49 P.M. | Paul Supporters Mount Protest in Convention Hall
The Romney campaign owns the convention floor, but at times, Ron Paul's supporters seem to own the corridors of the Tampa Bay Times Forum.
A horde of Paul supporters walked circles around the convention floor, growing with each pass and chanting, "As goes Maine, so goes the nation."
It's a quaint phrase, harking back to the 19th century when Maine was considered a political bellwether for the nation. It hasn't been that for some time, but the Maine Republican delegation of 2012 - taken over by Paul supporters - was not seated at the convention.
Other Paul supporters joined their Maine brethren for the march.
Regina Imburgia, a Ron Paul leader in Dallas, said the chant was "made up on the fly" after a video tribute to Mr. Paul and a speech by his son, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.
"We decided we were going to watch Ron Paul, cheer for Rand, then walk out en masse," she said.
The group was still aggrieved over a rules change adopted by the Republican National Convention on Tuesday over loud Paulite protests that they say will limit the voices of insurgents in the future.
"It was pretty shocking," said Nancy McKiernan, a Tea Party leader and Santorum delegate from Colorado who was cheering on the marchers. "I was absolutely shocked yesterday."
The question is, will such people set aside those grievances in November and go out to rally support for Mitt Romney?
"At this point, I'm not sure what I'm going to do" on Election Day, Ms. Imburgia said.
Ms. McKiernan, who abstained in the delegate voting, was similarly uncommitted.
"Who knows?" she said.

Smoking in the bathroom?
Well, yes. Smoking may be illegal in public places in Tampa, but the smell of smoke (um, cigarette smoke, people) has for the past two nights been wafting out of men's room stalls in the convention center where the Republican National Convention is taking place. The attendants in the hall, and various security officers roaming around, have apparently decided to ignore it.
Can you really blame frustrated smokers? The halls are teeming with delegates, guests, hangers-on and members of the news media, and it's a long trip from the air-conditioned comfort of the Tampa Bay Times Forum to the sultry evening air on the sidewalk outside.
- 
8:40 P.M. | Hey Everyone, It's John McCain
This is how you treat your party's standard-bearer of 2008?
Senator John S. McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate, appeared at the convention to offer strong words of Mr. Romney, and a strong attack (though not by name) on Mr. Obama's foreign policy record.
But for much of the 15-minute speech, the delegates mingled about, chatting with our delegates on the floor, visiting friends or checking their iPhones. The producers of the convention displayed real-time messages, scrolling around the hall, paying tribute to Mr. McCain's service in the Senate and the military.
It's not that Mr. McCain's appearance here did not have some political significance. After making a customary introductory joke - "I had hoped once of addressing you under different circumstances" - Mr. McCain offered an endorsement of Mr. Romney that came quicker, and seemed more enthusiastic, than the one offered on Tuesday by the convention's keynote speaker, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Considering their decidedly unfriendly contest for the presidential nomination of 2008, that was certainly noteworthy.
Mr. McCain, who turned 76 on Wednesday, attacked Mr. Obama's foreign policy, saying that the president had overseen the decline of global leadership. "The president has discouraged our friends and emboldened our enemies," he said.
- 
8:13 P.M. | Unlike His Father, Rand Paul Lines Up Behind Romney
Senator Rand Paul's father may have been the skunk at Mitt Romney's party. But the crowd chanted "Paul '16!" when the younger Mr. Paul spoke on Wednesday.
The elder Mr. Paul was Mr. Romney's rival. He has refused to endorse Mr. Romney and did not get a chance to speak at the convention. His supporters created a bit of a stink over rules changes that Mr. Romney's team proposed.
But his son, the senator, was given a chance to offer his message of small government to the crowd.
Many of them ate it up.
"We have nothing to fear except our own unwillingness to defend what is naturally ours, our God-given rights," Mr. Paul said. "We have nothing to fear that should cause us to forget or relinquish our rights as free men and women."
Mr. Paul's participation in the convention - backing the man who beat his father - is a signal that he intends to pursue a career inside the Republican Party, not as a rabble-rouser outside it.
That could, as the crowd urged, lead to a presidential campaign in the future. 
But for now, Mr. Paul showed a willingness to do what his father would not: proclaim that Americans should vote for Mr. Romney for president.
"It will take someone who believes in America's greatness, who believes in and can articulate the American dream, someone who has created jobs, someone who understands and appreciates what makes America great, someone who will lead our party and our nation forward," he said. 
He added: "I believe that someone is our nominee: Governor Mitt Romney."

7:49 P.M. | Change in Theme
With the second night of the Republican National Convention comes a new theme. "We Can Change It," reads the motto of the night, painted along the wall. The reference, in case anyone missed it, is to President Obama's campaign promising change in 2008.
It replaced the phrase "We Built It," which was emblazoned on the walls and sprinkled through pretty much every speech on Tuesday. The motto seized upon - with some editorial liberty - a remark Mr. Obama made this year suggesting that government investment was necessary to provide the roads, bridges, sewers and other public works structures businesses need.
One of the first speakers of the night, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, might not have noticed the new writing on the wall. "For most of our history, no one dared tell Americans: 'You didn't build that,' " he said, repeatedly, in his speech.
Of course, in Mr. Paul's defense, "We Can Change It" doesn't lend itself to the kind of rhetorical riffing that "We Built It" did.
 An earlier version of this post misstated Tuesday night's theme. It was "We Built It," not "We Can Build It."
- 
7:50 P.M. | George W. Bush Makes an Appearance - by Video
One of President Obama's most consistent critiques of Mitt Romney has been to accuse the Republican of wanting to return to the economic policies of George W. Bush.
Mr. Romney's campaign has done what it can to deflect that attack. But national conventions have certain imperatives, and so Mr. Bush appeared - by video - on Wednesday night.
The video offered a gauzy portrait of the Bush dynasty, showing funny and touching conversations between Mr. Bush; his father, George H. W. Bush; his wife, Laura; and his mother, Barbara.
"Our dog did bite a reporter," Laura Bush recalls in the video. "He thought that reporter was with The New York Times."
Later in the video, Mr. Bush repeats the endorsement that he has already given to Mr. Romney. 
"Dad and I both know what it takes to be president," he says, sitting next to his father. "And there's no doubt in our mind that he will be a great president."
Mr. Bush will be followed later by Condoleezza Rice, his former secretary of state. 
Democrats are certain to use the pair's appearance to bolster Mr. Romney's ties to the past. One of Mr. Obama's favorite lines on the campaign trail has been to say that the Republicans want to drive the car back into the economic ditch created by Mr. Bush's administration.
But the rhetorical power of that argument is somewhat less than it was in 2008, when Mr. Obama routinely sought to morph his rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, into Mr. Bush.
In that year, Mr. Bush was supposed to address the convention in person, but ended up speaking remotely, by videolink, after the threat of a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico forced the cancellation of the convention's first day.

6:49 P.M. | McConnell Opens Second Night by Criticizing Obama
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, will open the second evening session of the Republican National Convention with a broadside against President Obama, painting him as an unserious man more concerned with his golf game and his iPod than solving the problems of a nation in agony.
Mr. McConnell is not known for his forceful delivery, but his speeches in recent months have taken on near-apocalyptic tones. He plans to say "America is suffering through an economic calamity of truly historic dimensions," presided over by an administration intent on "leveling out" the nation into a European-style malaise, according to speech excerpts.
In the meantime, the man at the helm "hasn't been working to earn re-election," he plans to say. "He's been working to earn a spot on the P.G.A. tour."
And he will invoke the looming "fiscal cliff" in January, when all the Bush-era tax cuts expire at the same moment $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade come into force. So far, nothing has been done in Washington to avert that scenario, which independent economists say will send the nation back into recession. But both Mr. Obama and Republicans say they have plans to avert it, just very different plans.
 "We know what the president's got on his iPod, but we don't know what he plans to do about a looming tax hike that could trigger yet another serious recession that would result in even more Americans losing their jobs," Mr. McConnell will say, according to the excerpts. "Ladies and gentlemen: America cannot afford another four years of this."
- 
6:45 P.M. | In Speech, Ryan Will Criticize Obama and Offer Alternative
Representative Paul D. Ryan will accuse President Obama of giving Americans "the runaround" in his speech Wednesday night and will present the Republican ticket as best capable of fixing the nation's struggling economy.
In excerpts from his remarks released by Mitt Romney's campaign, Mr. Ryan takes particular aim at the president's health care plan, saying that the debate over its future is far from over.
"Obamacare comes to more than 2,000 pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees and fines that have no place in a free country," Mr. Ryan plans to say Wednesday night.
Mr. Ryan plans to heap praise on Mr. Romney as someone whose life "has prepared him for this moment - to meet serious challenges in a serious way, without excuses and idle words."
For Mr. Ryan, the speech - in front of tens of millions of people watching on television - will be his first real opportunity to introduce himself without being filtered by the news media.
But his biggest task may be to justify and explain the Medicare proposals embedded in the budgets that he has championed over the last two years.
Democrats have assailed his proposal to turn Medicare into a voucher program. They say it will increase costs for the elderly by providing a government voucher that will not keep pace with the cost of private health insurance.
In the remarks released Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Ryan does not directly address Medicare, though he likely will when he presents his entire speech in prime time.
But in the excerpts, he does hint that he and Mr. Romney are not planning to run away from his proposals.
"Here is our pledge," Mr. Ryan says. "We will not duck the tough issues - we will lead. We will not spend four years blaming others - we will take responsibility. We will not try to replace our founding principles, we will reapply our founding principles. The work ahead will be hard."
- 
6:40 P.M. | Focus on Ryan Extends to His Budget Plan
Representative Paul D. Ryan, framing the presidential election as the "clearest choice possible," intends to use his prime-time moment at the Republican National Convention Wednesday night to assure Americans that he and Mitt Romney can oversee a strong economic recovery. Read more

HEADLINE: Illinois: State's Credit Rating Drops

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Pension problems and government gridlock earned Illinois another reduction in its credit rating on Wednesday. Standard & Poor's said it lowered the rating a notch because of ''weak pension funding levels and lack of action on reform measures.'' The firm also said the financial outlook for Illinois is negative, in part because the state's temporary income tax is scheduled to expire in 2015. Lower ratings can raise the interest rate a state must pay to borrow money. The downgrade, from A+ to A, leaves Illinois with the nation's second-lowest rating from S&P. California is rated A-, but it has earned a ''positive outlook'' from the firm. Gov. Pat Quinn said that the downgrade was no surprise but that it served as evidence that state leaders must fix public pension systems. Illinois's retirement systems have a roughly $85 billion gap between money available and what they will eventually pay out in pensions. The shortfall is the largest in the country.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Settles Lawsuit Over Subprime Securities

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Citigroup said on Wednesday that it had agreed to pay $590 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by shareholders who contended that they had been misled about the bank's exposure to subprime mortgage debt on the eve of the financial crisis.
The shareholder lawsuit, originally filed in November 2007, contended that the bank and some of its former senior executives and directors had failed to disclose the bank's huge holdings in securities known as collateralized debt obligations that were tied to mortgage securities until November 2007, when it took a multibillion-dollar write-down on them. Citigroup later wrote down the C.D.O.'s by tens of billions of dollars more. 
The bank had previously tried to conceal the deteriorating value of its holdings by improper accounting practices, the shareholders contended in an amended complaint filed in December 2008. "Citigroup used inflated, unreliable and unsupportable marks to keep its C.D.O.-related quasi-Ponzi scheme alive and to give the appearance of a healthy asset base," the complaint said.
Problems with its C.D.O. business have dogged Citi. Wednesday's settlement is on top of the $360 million that the bank has agreed to pay to resolve civil mortgage securities cases brought by federal regulators. In a statement on Wednesday, Citigroup, which denied the allegations, said: "Citi will be pleased to put this matter behind us. This settlement is a significant step toward resolving our exposure to claims arising from the period of the financial crisis."
It added, "Citi is fundamentally a different company today than at the beginning of the financial crisis."
The plaintiffs included pension funds in Colorado, Ohio and Illinois and were led by former employees and directors of Automated Trading Desk who received Citigroup shares when they sold the electronic trading firm to the bank in July 2007. The proposed settlement, which was given preliminary approval by Judge Sidney H. Stein of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, covers investors who bought Citi shares from Feb. 26, 2007, through April 18, 2008. Shares of Citigroup traded as high as $55 in the summer of 2007. By spring of 2008, its stock price had tumbled by half.
A hearing on the settlement was set for Jan. 15.
The nation's third-largest bank by assets, Citi teetered on the brink of collapse in 2008 and was bailed out by the United States government. The bank has repaid the $45 billion in federal assistance that it received.
The shareholders' accusations centered on its collateralized debt obligations. The plaintiffs claimed Citi assured them that it had sold billions of dollars in C.D.O.'s, thus averting risk to investors. But the plaintiffs argue the bank didn't inform shareholders that it had guaranteed the securities against any losses, according to court documents. To further disguise the risks to investors, the plaintiffs said, Citigroup moved the guarantees to separate entities.
In a court filing on Wednesday, lawyers for the shareholders from the law firm Kirby McInerney acknowledged the difficulty of proving that the bank knowingly perpetrated fraud on its clients: "Rarely is there concrete direct evidence of fraudulent intent."
For Citigroup, as well as other Wall Street firms, the business of slicing apart and packaging mortgages and other loans into complex securities had been a lucrative and fast-growing business before the financial crisis. The bank underwrote some $70 billion in collateralized debt obligations from 2004 to 2008.
The bank paid $75 million in 2010 to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint that the bank made misleading public statements about the extent of its subprime exposure. In a statement at the time, the agency said that "between July and mid-October 2007, Citigroup represented that subprime exposure in its investment banking unit was $13 billion or less, when in fact it was more than $50 billion."
In a separate, more recent case involving C.D.O.'s, the bank had agreed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay $285 million over allegations that it had misled investors by not disclosing that it was helping select the mortgage securities that underpinned the C.D.O. and that it was betting against it. That settlement was initially rejected by a federal judge, but an appeals court found that the judge may have overstepped his authority.
On Monday, the bank agreed to pay $25 million to another group of investors, who claimed that the bank misinformed them about the quality of securities backed by mortgages, which took big losses after the housing market collapsed during the crisis.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Leaving Home, but None of Its Comforts

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
I DON'T remember everything I took with me when I went to college, but do I know it all fit easily into the back seat of our family car. The twin-size sheets were new; nearly everything else (pillow, stereo, ugly green rug) had been scavenged from home or a thrift store.
As for electronics, that summer my well-meaning parents went to a garage sale and were talked into buying an Apple Macintosh with a drive that accepted only large floppy disks. My suspicion that it was embarrassingly out of date, even by 1994 standards, was confirmed by my roommate's look of disbelief when I tried to boot up.
Altogether, furnishing my dorm room cost maybe $50. 
These memories came back as I stood inside a Target store in South Philadelphia one night last week at midnight, watching 1,200 students from Temple University swarming the aisles like amped-up contestants on a shopping-spree game show.
Target had bused the students from campus and rearranged the store for the after-hours event. A D.J. played dance music in what was normally the baby department; mini-fridges and cases of Red Bull were stacked along a central corridor. Students' carts were filling with hanging mirrors, garbage cans in bright colors, shower caddies and bed-in-a-bag sheet sets.
Gina D'Annunzio, director of student activities at Temple, said she had resisted Target's previous overtures to host an after-hours event. But this year the timing had worked out, and Ms. D'Annunzio remembered that as a little girl she had dreamed of getting ''locked in a mall'' -- a common fantasy, judging by the scene at Target.
Jordyn Richman, an 18-year-old freshman, had come for a mattress pad, a body pillow, a night light and push pins. Before arriving at Temple, Ms. Richman had already spent $300 on dorm décor at Target and Ikea stores near her home in Boca Raton, Fla. The additional items she was buying would ''round out'' her room, she said.
In recent years, the Target run -- or a shopping trip to a similar big-box store -- has become a new college tradition, right up there with spring break and sleeping through class. This time of year it's common to see students and parents roaming the aisles, checking off items from an ever-growing list of essentials. The goal, it seems, is to turn the dorm room into a plush home away from home.
Derek Jackson, director of housing and dining services at Kansas State, is among those who have observed a growing influx of comforts like coffee makers and the rise of color-coordinated rooms.
''We get requests saying, 'Can you give us dimensions for the windows, because we want to hang curtains?' '' he said. ''Back in the old days, students were just trying to make their rooms purposeful.''
And of the 72-inch TVs he has lately been seeing students lug into residence halls, Mr. Jackson said, ''If they can fit it into their room: that's the mind-set.''
Norb Dunkel, associate vice president for student affairs at the University of Florida, who is busy overseeing the current crop of arrivals, has also noticed the maximalist shift. He cited the overloaded family car as a ubiquitous image during move-in week.
''When they back their vehicle up, if it goes beep-beep-beep, they're bringing too much stuff,'' Mr. Dunkel said. ''And you can hear the beep-beep-beeps now.''
Both men say big-box retailers have played a big role in fueling students' desire to make their dorm rooms more than just drab boxes along a double-loaded corridor. Retailers are now marketing so heavily to students during the back-to-college season, Mr. Dunkel said, that they would probably like to ''put a flier in every student's room.''
Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation, an industry group, said hard goods for back-to-college, which includes school supplies, laptop computers and dorm décor, are a $50 billion annual business. Which is why retailers as diverse as Apple, Kate Spade, Krups, Roux Maison detergents and Sure Fit slipcovers are all promoting deals.
Despite the recession, Ms. Grannis expects to see growth in this sector, because in an annual survey conducted by her organization, she said, this year more people responded that their children will live in dorms on campus, rather than commuting from home to save money as they have in previous years.
Surely there are students whose families can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars outfitting a dorm room. But ''the kid with two suitcases flies under the radar,'' said Patrick Love, associate vice president for student affairs at Rutgers, which also holds an after-hours sale with Target. ''What draws your eye are the students bringing the flat-screen TVs.''
Not surprisingly, Target is a leader in the market. Its after-hours sales for Temple and Rutgers students are just 2 of 69 similar events the retailer is holding in partnership with colleges across the country, an effort that began 11 years ago with the University of Minnesota. This year, Target also introduced uStyler, an online program that allows students to see how its products look in a virtual dorm room. After talking with students about their cooking habits, the retailer created a line of back-to-college dinner and drinkware in colorful patterns, made of microwaveable polypropylene.
''The students also told us they eat on the go,'' said Michelle Mesenburg, the company's vice president for style marketing. ''So we added a little rim to prevent food from spilling.''
Ms. Mesenburg said the company begins debriefing sessions to plan its annual back-to-school strategy as early as September of the previous year.
Bed Bath & Beyond also markets heavily to college students, offering programs like a college registry and Shop Here, Pick Up There, which allows students to buy items locally or online and retrieve them at a store near their college. The retailer's Campus & Beyond Checklist, a sacred text among students and parents, numbers over 90 items: from basics like hangers and laundry hampers to things of more questionable necessity (particularly during a recession), like a tool kit, blackout panels and iPod speakers.
''The business just continues to grow,'' Ms. Grannis said. ''There's so many different ways to get in on this.''
DESPITE my short campus checklist, I wasn't averse to decorating my dorm room. My mother is an antiques dealer, and I remember the kitschy red-tin Chesterfield cigarettes sign I found among her stuff and hung on the wall in my dorm. The ugly green rug really tied the room together.
Still, it wouldn't have occurred to me to buy curtains or an air-conditioner or a coffee maker. I wasn't planning to spend much time in my room, and I was living on a student's budget, as they say.
Or used to say. Watching the shopping frenzy at Target in Philadelphia, I wondered if the phrase still applied. When I asked one girl pushing a loaded cart if her parents had set a spending limit for her, she looked at me blankly.
What has changed since I graduated not all that long ago?
Chris Seman, president of Caring Transitions, a Cincinnati-based company that handles logistics when people make a big life change, said the closer ties between children and parents have redefined the move to college. Students are ''so connected to their family and home they don't see moving to college as a new stage,'' he said. ''They want to bring home with them.''
At the same time, he added, helicopter parenting doesn't stop when the child goes off to school: ''Now parents think their kids have to have everything they had at home or it's going to be too traumatic for them.''
Jess Smith, an 18-year-old freshman at Temple who came to the Target event to buy a mirror, said her parents ''took over decorating'' the lounge-style room she is sharing with two roommates. ''They were a huge help,'' Ms. Smith said. ''My dad came today and installed a shower caddy.''
Mr. Seman, who attended Eastern Michigan University in the mid-1980s, said he recalls taking little more than clothes and a Led Zeppelin poster. But when he sent his oldest son off to college two years ago, he admitted to overdoing it at Target, where he spent $350.
''I probably ended up returning $100 worth of stuff,'' Mr. Seman said. ''He had roommates. It was duplicates of everything. How many spatulas do you need?''
If the volume of moving boxes has increased, however, so has students' desire to live in a well-designed space. Reality shows focused on design and Web sites like Pinterest have made students savvier about decorating.
Roommates connect on Facebook months before college begins, Mr. Jackson said, to plan their décor: ''They pick out carpet and start accessorizing. The bedspreads match. It's a more coordinated effort.''
At the University of Florida, there is even an annual competition for the best decorated room. The winner two years ago, Kent Stephan, used shells and weathered furniture to create a nautical effect.
''I've stayed at a lot of hotels, and my inspiration came from having that chic, luxury feel,'' said Mr. Stephan, who graduated last year and is considering starting a design business geared to students. ''I wanted to break from that dorm-room look.''
Indeed, for a number of students, the bed-in-a-bag just doesn't cut it.
Last year, Sarah Calle, a 21-year-old junior at Laguna College of Art and Design in Laguna Beach, Calif., started Dormdesign.tumblr.com, a blog that showcases tricked-out dorm rooms. ''I wanted to see people who took it beyond the basics,'' Ms. Calle said. ''Some inspirational design.''
Amanda Zuckerman went one step further. Before she went off to Washington University in St. Louis as a freshman three years ago, she went shopping for dorm furnishings and found the offerings at big-box stores ''very childish,'' she said. ''No one had Twin XL bedding that was very stylish,'' she said, referring to the irregular bed size native to residence halls.
So Ms. Zuckerman and her mother, Karen, an advertising executive in Washington, started Dormify.com, an e-commerce site that sells stylish (and generally more expensive) bedding sets, wall decals and sorority-themed items like posters and Greek prints.
''If you care about what you're wearing, you'll care about what your room is like,'' Ms. Zuckerman said. ''It's a form of self-expression.''
Her freshman dorm room had a cream-and-green color scheme with ''pops of orange,'' she said, and a chandelier wall decal. It was known among her friends as the ''hotel suite.''
AS I was leaving the Target event, I ran into a 19-year-old Temple student with frosted hair named Alec Santiago Hooper. His cart was loaded with a Mr. Coffee machine, a 10-speed blender, pillows and burgundy curtains, among other items.
Like many students I spoke to, he had already done most of his shopping, buying bedding at Ikea and a used dresser on Craigslist, and was picking up extras for his off-campus apartment.
''I didn't know my room was so plain,'' he said. ''So I got the curtains.''
His purchases also included a ClosetMaid combination bench-and-storage unit, which he planned to customize by swapping out the plain beige drawers and substituting some wicker baskets he found a few aisles over. This would enhance what he described as the ''international'' look of his room (he travels a lot, he explained).
Mr. Hooper held up the baskets, pleased with his find, then his eyes narrowed on a small discrepancy: one basket was slightly darker than the other.
''I'm about to go get a new one,'' he said, excusing himself. ''These baskets are not the same.''

HEADLINE: Tapping the Market for Start-Ups, a Fund Falters

BYLINE: By RANDALL SMITH

 BODY:
Few investors have ridden the recent Internet boomlet like GSV Capital Corporation.
After GSV announced in June 2011 that it was buying a stake in the privately held Facebook, the closed-end mutual fund surged 42 percent that day. Capitalizing on the euphoria, GSV sold another $247 million of its shares, using the money to expand its portfolio of hot start-ups like Groupon and Zynga.
Now, GSV is feeling the Facebook blues.
When the public offering of the social network flopped, GSV fell hard, and it still has not recovered. Shares of GSV, which were sold for an average of $15.35, are trading at $8.54. 
"We probably benefited from our stake in Facebook more than we deserved on the way up," said GSV's chief executive, Michael T. Moe, "and were certainly punished more than we deserved on the way down."
GSV, short for Global Silicon Valley, is the largest of several closed-end mutual funds that offer ordinary investors a chance to own stakes in privately held companies, at least indirectly. Closed-end funds like GSV typically sell a set number of shares, and their managers invest the proceeds. In essence, such portfolios operate like mini venture capital funds, taking stakes in start-ups and betting they will turn a profit if the companies are sold or go public.
"I think GSV was really innovative in creating a kind of publicly traded venture capital fund," said Jason Jones, founder of HighStep Capital, which also invests in private companies.
But the shares of closed-end funds trade on investor demand - and can go significantly higher or lower than the value of the underlying portfolios. The entire category has been hit by Facebook's troubles, with GSV trading at a 38 percent discount to its so-called net asset value.
Mr. Moe, 49, has previously experienced the wild ups and downs of popular stocks.
A backup quarterback at the University of Minnesota, he started out as a stockbroker at the Minneapolis-based Dain Bosworth, where he wrote a stock-market newsletter called "Mike Moe's Market Minutes." He met the chief executive of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, on a visit to Seattle in 1992, and he began covering the coffee chain after its initial public offering.
"I left believing I had just met the next Ray Kroc," Mr. Moe wrote in his 2006 book, "Finding the Next Starbucks," referring to the executive who built the McDonald's empire.
After stints at two other brokerage firms, Mr. Moe became the director of global growth research in San Francisco at Merrill Lynch in 1998. There he ran a group of a dozen analysts at a time when mere business models "were going public at billion-dollar valuations," he said.
Shortly after the dot-com bubble burst, he founded a banking boutique now called ThinkEquity. At the time, he expected the I.P.O. market to shrug off the weakness and recover in a couple of years. Instead, it went into a decade-long slump.
"Market timing is not my best skill," Mr. Moe said. In 2007, he sold ThinkEquity.
The next year, he started a new firm to provide research on private companies, NeXt Up Research. He later expanded into asset management, eventually changing the name to GSV. Within two months of starting his own fund, he bought the shares in Facebook through SecondMarket, a marketplace for private shares.
GSV soon raised additional funds from investors and put the money into start-ups in education, cloud computing, Internet commerce, social media and clean technology. Along with Groupon and Zynga, he bought Twitter, Gilt Groupe and Spotify Technology. The goal is finding "the fastest-growing companies in the world," he said.
But Mr. Moe has paid a high price, picking up several start-ups at high values on the private market. He bought Facebook at $29.92 a share. That stock is now trading at $19.10. He purchased Groupon in August 2011 for $26.61 a share, well above its eventual public offering price of $20. It currently sells at $4.31.
Max Wolff, who tracks pre-I.P.O. stocks at GreenCrest Capital Management, said GSV sometimes bought "popular names to please investors." "This is such a sentiment-sensitive space, the stocks don't trade on fundamentals," Mr. Wolff said, adding: "If there's a loss of faith, they fall without a net."
GSV's peers have similarly struggled. Firsthand Technology Value Fund, which owns stakes in Facebook and solar-power businesses like SolarCity and Intevac, is off 65 percent from its peak in April. "We paid too much" for Facebook, said Firsthand's chief executive, Kevin Landis.
Two other funds with similar strategies have sidestepped the bulk of the pain. Harris & Harris Group owns 32 companies in micro-scale technology. Keating Capital, with $75 million in assets, owns pieces of 20 venture-backed companies. But neither Harris nor Keating owns Facebook, Groupon or Zynga, so shares in those companies have not fallen as steeply.
GSV is now dealing with the fallout.
In a conference call in August, Mr. Moe was confronted by one investor who said, "the recent public positions have been a disaster," according to a transcript on Seeking Alpha, a stock market news Web site. While Mr. Moe expressed similar disappointment, he emphasized the companies' fundamentals. Collectively, he said, their revenue was growing by more than 100 percent.
"We have been around this for quite some time, and we are going to be wrong from time to time," Mr. Moe said in the call. "But we are focused on the batting average."
In the same call, Mr. Moe remained enthusiastic - if not hyperbolic - about the group's prospects. Many of GSV's 40 holdings are in "game-changing companies" with the potential to drive outsize growth, he told the investors. Twitter, the largest, "continues to just be a rocket ship in terms of growth, and we think value creation," he said. The data analysis provider Palantir Technologies helps the Central Intelligence Agency "track terrorists and bad guys all over the world." The flash memory maker Violin Memory "is experiencing hyper-growth," he wrote in an e-mail.
But Mr. Moe was a bit more muted in recent interviews. While he says he still believes in giving public investors access to private company stocks, he recognizes the cloud over GSV. "We unfortunately have a social media segment that got tainted. I completely get why our stock is where it is. It's going to be a show-me situation for a while."
Acknowledging some regrets, Mr. Moe said he was angriest about overpaying for Groupon, saying, "Yeah, I blew Groupon." He said that he also did not anticipate what he called a "deceleration" in Facebook's growth rate, and that it was "kind of infuriating" that some of its early investors were allowed to exit before others. GSV often must hold its shares until six months after a public offering.
But the downturn in pre-I.P.O. shares has a silver lining, Mr. Moe said. Since the Facebook public offering, he has been able to put money to work "at better prices." He recently bought shares of Spotify at a valuation of about $3 billion, roughly 25 percent below the target in its latest round of financing.
The I.P.O. market is also showing signs of life, he said, with the strong debuts of Palo Alto Networks and Kayak Software. And he still has faith in Facebook. Whatever its current stock price, at least it is a "real company" with revenue and profits, Mr. Moe said. "It's not being valued off eyeballs and fairy dust."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Witness to a Fading Lifestyle on the Anatolian Plain

BYLINE: By SUSANNE FOWLER

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Hailed as one of the last great travelers of Anatolia, the American photographer Josephine Powell was witness to the lives of nomads in ways that most Westerners could merely imagine, collecting artifacts and tens of thousands of images along the way.
Some of her work documenting that fading cultural legacy during the 1970s and '80s is on display in ''What Josephine Saw,'' the opening exhibit at Koc University's Research Center for Anatolian Civilizations, an oasis of calm on Istanbul's busy Istiklal Caddesi.
The show runs through Oct. 21, and was curated by Kimberly Hart, a social-cultural anthropologist who is an assistant professor at SUNY Buffalo State College in Buffalo, New York.
''It was an era of much political upheaval in Turkey,'' Ms. Hart said recently by telephone. ''There was a lot of economic development, of mass migration from rural areas to the cities, but Josephine Powell did not show these things. She didn't show factories, buses and Turks migrating to Germany. Instead she shows us lives of nomads and villagers in an almost timeless fashion.'' 
Often traveling on her own, sometimes on horseback and with a dog or a bird, Ms. Powell shot 35-millimeter slides that focused on the men and women on the open range or in small villages and the handicrafts they produced.
In the exhibit, more than 70 strikingly colorful images are organized loosely by subject, the curator said, including ''nomads working in pastures with animals, preparing tents, nomads in migration, women and men working on textiles, weaving, spinning, making felt, preparing fibers,'' and women displaying the intricate grain sacks and kilims they had created.
There are also portraits of Ms. Powell, in younger and later years, gripping an ever-present cigarette.
The exhibit also includes rare video footage of Ms. Powell, being interviewed by the Istanbul-based journalist Andrew Finkel on behalf of the Textile Museum in Washington in 2006.
To symbolize Ms. Powell's fascination with weaving, Ms. Hart said, the show also includes a kirmen, or Turkish spindle, used for spinning carpet wool.
Ms. Powell, who was born in New York in 1919, came from a well-to-do family, Ms. Hart said. She managed to carve an unexpected path for herself, trading what could have been an easy life of privilege for one tramping around in the dust amid livestock and uncertain or nonexistent plumbing.
She had worked in Tanganyika in the 1940s, resettling Polish refugees in other countries. Later, as a resettlement officer in Germany, she bought a Leica and a Rolleiflex at the PX but set them on her mantle as works of art and did not learn to use them for another two years.
In the 1950s, she began working as a freelance photographer, finding buyers for her shots of art and architecture and setting up a base in Rome. Her first trip to Turkey came in 1955, when she was asked to photograph Byzantine mosaics. After receiving rare permission from the government in Ankara to travel to more remote areas, she headed east. What followed were trips to Lake Van, near Armenia, across the border to Iran, to Afghanistan to photograph Bamyan, to Pakistan to shoot historic shrines in Peshawar, and -- on an assignment -- to Naples to capture the erotic images at Pompeii.
In the 1960s, she added India, Armenia, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, Morocco and Russia to her itineraries. In 1973, she rented an apartment in Istanbul. Two years later, her photo essay on Pakistani village life was shown at the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam.
In 2002, she donated about 20,000 of her early pictures to the Fine Arts Library at Harvard. Toward the end of her life, her apartment and storeroom in the Cihangir neighborhood of Istanbul were packed with a huge collection of textiles and slides. She gave the Vehbi Koc Foundation approximately 28,000 of her slides and 30 books of field notes on Anatolian kilims and nomadic and rural life, her textiles and an extensive collection of agricultural and weaving tools. The notes and photos have been digitized by the Suna Kirac Library at Koc University and made available to researchers and the public.
Ms. Powell died at her desk, three months later, in January 2007, at age 87. According to the exhibit's companion catalog, edited by Ms. Hart, Ms. Powell had been tracing the migration routes of nomadic groups on a hand-drawn map of Anatolia.
''She was interested in those people,'' Ms. Hart said. ''I don't think she was interested in political information or economic change. She was not really a salvage ethnographer, collecting information on disappearing societies.''
It is clear that she directed her lens toward ''the daily craftsmanship and artisanal activities of rural people,'' the curator said.
Her window onto their world, Ms. Hart said, was ''not one constructed with nostalgia or overblown sentiment as its aim.''
''I think it's really good not to have that nostalgic point of view, so we can look at the past more objectively,'' she said. ''In curating the exhibit, I tended to select photos that showed how the people were self-consciously presenting themselves to her camera. I chose them because it shows people representing themselves with dignity, often posing with animals.
''I found that especially interesting as an anthropologist. In rural Turkey, people's relationship to animals is very different from that of Americans, in that though they also have cats and dogs, their closest emotions are for their sheep and cows. In Josephine's archive, it's not cows, it's camels.''
Ms. Hart said she first met Ms. Powell in the late 1980s ''when I was a college student'' at Bennington in Vermont.
''She was telling stories constantly and always working,'' the curator said. ''If I look at her life over all -- I did not know her in her youth or during her travels -- she seems to have been really restless, really adventurous and a loner in some ways.''
''She was a photographer who didn't leave a lot of written traces or descriptions of what she saw,'' Ms. Hart said. ''And when I look at what she saw in Antatolia during the 1960s and '70s, I see that her vision was really almost exclusively focused on rural people.''
She worked with Harald Böhmer, known for his work on Turkish rug dyes, to establish a women's carpet cooperative, part of the Dobag natural-dye research and development project, for hand-woven and plant-dyed wool carpets. The project continues even now, with carpets being sold by dealers in Norway and Ireland and each December at the Anglican church in Istanbul.
Her enthusiasm for helping the weavers might have stemmed from a belief that women should be able to exercise some control over money.
''It was an issue that all women face and understand, and it was a personal issue for her as well,'' Ms. Hart said. ''She inherited money which allowed her to begin life as traveler and explorer and she lost of lot of money along the way.''
''She once described to me how she would go to the bank in New York and there would be a special ladies' section where the banker would write the check for you. At the time she accepted that as normal, though she realized later that it was ridiculous and asked, 'Why aren't I taking control of my money?'
''Then she saw these women who wove beautiful pieces of textile art but had no idea how they were being sold and what their value was because the men did all the selling. The women and their families got very little, so that was really the impetus for founding the women's cooperative: to help them understand the considerable value of their artistic works.''
Ms. Hart's own hope for the exhibit, she said, was ''that young people shopping and having fun on Istiklal would go into an exhibit like this, that is free and open to everyone, and become interested in the people they see in the photos.''
''That's really the main aim for me,'' she said, ''to present the more or less forgotten rural Anatolia to young people who may become curious about travel and adventure in their own country, and present these people who rarely are represented.''
The exhibit, Ms. Hart said, ''also presents Josephine as an individual. In that regard, it memorializes her but also shows an interesting American woman who traveled, photographed, and made a life in Istanbul.''

HEADLINE: Prosecutors Link Money From China To Iran

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Prosecutors say they have unearthed evidence in recent international money-transfer investigations that Chinese banks may have flouted United States sanctions against Iran.
Now, as they investigate global banks suspected of funneling billions of dollars through their American branches to Iran and other sanctioned nations, the prosecutors are looking for transactions that could offer more information on the banks' dealings with Iran.
Information on how Chinese banks may have routed money on behalf of Iranian banks and corporations is more valuable than any monetary settlement the authorities could win from the global banks, law enforcement officials with knowledge of the cases said, because the United States could use the information to strengthen its efforts to choke off economic dealings with Iran. 
The United States has been ratcheting up its sanctions as Iran's nuclear ambitions raise the risk of military action from Israel and shocks to the global economy. The investigations of two London-based banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered, could prove especially fruitful, said the law enforcement officials, who declined to be identified because the cases are continuing.
As part of their broader investigations, prosecutors are examining whether any money transfers originated from Chinese banks and moved through the British banks before being routed through their American branches.
HSBC and Standard Chartered have extensive branches and business throughout Asia. Prosecutors hope that the banks' executives, as part of settlements, will shed more light on Chinese banks' independent relationships with Iran.
Despite clues gleaned from the prior cases, officials in the Justice Department and the Manhattan district attorney's office have not yet accumulated enough evidence to open a formal investigation into the Chinese banks, the officials said. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.
The prosecutors are in the early stages of examining a handful of Chinese banks with operations in New York. They are concerned that the banks may allow clients suspected of financing weapons development to open accounts in China, and then get access to dollars through money transfers from a foreign bank by way of its American subsidiary.
The investigations are playing out as United States officials work to stanch the flow of money to Iran -- part of an effort to hobble the nation's ability to develop its nuclear program. China has openly supplied Iran with nuclear materials and was a major economic partner to the nation from 1985 to 1997, when pressure from the Clinton administration hampered the business.
Last month, the White House announced sanctions against Bank of Kunlun, part of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corp., saying that the bank had ''facilitated transactions worth millions of dollars on behalf of Iranian banks.''
There has been widespread frustration that American sanctions are undercut by nations, including China, that continue to do business with Iran. ''The Chinese business community has not shown any sign that they accept U.S. sanctions against Iran,'' said John Moscow, a New York lawyer who investigated international bank fraud and money laundering with the Manhattan district attorney's office from 1988 to 2004.
Law enforcement officials worry that Chinese banks ''will attempt to structure their legal affairs so that they can do business with America and Iran, which means keeping secrets from the U.S.,'' Mr. Moscow said.
Since 2009, as part of a broad-based crackdown, the Justice Department, the Treasury Department and the district attorney's office have brought cases against five European banks, contending that they moved billions of dollars through their American subsidiaries on behalf of Iran, Cuba, North Korea and other sanctioned nations.
Some of the cases against the banks -- ABN Amro, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Lloyds and, most recently, ING -- yielded valuable information about Chinese banks' relationships with Iran, law enforcement officials said.
An investigation into one bank can help prosecutors reach their next target. In the Credit Suisse case, for example, prosecutors discovered an e-mail that named other European banks with Iranian business, according to law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation. The Swiss bank settled with United States authorities in late 2009 for $536 million and a deferred prosecution agreement.
Standard Chartered entered the public spotlight this month when Benjamin M. Lawsky, superintendent of the New York Financial Services Department, broke with federal and local prosecutors to accuse the bank of scheming with Iran for nearly a decade to hide from regulators 60,000 transactions worth $250 billion. The British bank, which reached a $340 million settlement with New York's top banking regulator, is still under investigation by federal and state prosecutors.
In July, a Senate panel issued a report that accused HSBC of being used by Mexican drug cartels that wanted to funnel cash back into the United States, by Saudi Arabian banks with terrorist ties that needed access to dollars, and by Iranians who wanted to circumvent United States sanctions. The bank is in talks with the Justice Department and other authorities about a settlement and could face $1 billion in penalties, law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation said.
Part of the problem with Chinese banks, the officials said, is that unlike their European counterparts, the banks and their regulators have largely ignored American authorities' requests for information.
Standard Chartered officials, by contrast, voluntarily turned over reams of documents in 2010 to American authorities, including the Federal Reserve, detailing the bank's transactions with Iran.
Concerns about China's connections to Iran's weapons program came into focus in 2009 when the Manhattan district attorney's office charged a Chinese businessman and his company with conspiring to sell tungsten, high-strength steel and exotic metals, which can be used to develop long-range missiles and nuclear weapons, to an arm of the Iranian military from 2006 to 2008. Some of the transactions were routed through Manhattan, according to court documents. At the time, prosecutors were investigating two Chinese banks to determine their roles in the scheme.
Until 2008, foreign banks were permitted to transfer money for Iran through their American subsidiaries to separate offshore institutions. Such transactions were banned in 2008 amid escalating suspicions that Iran was using its banks to finance its nuclear weapon and missile programs.

HEADLINE: Reprieve for New York Fed In House Inquiry of Libor

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Congress has eased demands that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York turn over thousands of documents that detail interest rate manipulation at big banks, whittling down the request and granting the regulator more time. 
The reprieve will afford the New York Fed an additional month to comply, according to people briefed on the matter. The agency had been under pressure to meet a deadline on Saturday.
The original request for documents came in July, when the oversight panel of the House Financial Services Committee sought volumes of records about the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which affects the cost of trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans. The interest rate is at the center of an investigation that has ensnared more than a dozen banks.
In a letter in July, the oversight panel asked the New York Fed to detail its correspondence with employees from the banks that help set Libor. The oversight panel, led by Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas, also ordered the New York Fed to turn over its internal Libor-related documents and any communication with other government authorities.
In addition to the one-month extension, the subcommittee is narrowing the scope of its request. Lawmakers are now seeking communications among government authorities and documents circulated internally at the New York Fed, the people briefed on the matter said.
By steering clear of e-mails from bankers, the Congressional inquiry could avoid complicating a wide-ranging criminal investigation. Once the initial documents are received, Congress may still ramp up its request to include some information from the banks, one of the people briefed on the matter said.
The New York Fed already produced reams of transcripts this summer related to phone calls officials had with Barclays employees. Barclays was the first bank to settle accusations that it tried to manipulate Libor for its own benefit. It reached a $450 million settlement with the Justice Department as well as regulators in the United States and Britain.
Regulators and criminal authorities around the world are investigating more than a dozen other big banks, including HSBC and Deutsche Bank, in the manipulation of Libor, a measure of how much banks charge one another for loans. Banks are suspected of reporting false rates during the financial crisis to bolster profits and shore up their image.
The scandal has consumed the banking industry and called into question the New York Fed's oversight powers. In the case of Barclays, the New York Fed learned in 2008 that the British bank had been submitting false rates.
During the crisis, when high borrowing costs were a sign of poor financial health, banks were artificially depressing the rates to project a stronger image.
Rather than push for a civil or criminal crackdown, the New York Fed advocated policy changes to the rate-setting process, some of which were adopted. But with the crisis in full swing, the New York Fed moved on to more pressing concerns, and Barclays continued to submit false rates.
The regulator's approach has drawn sharp scrutiny from the oversight panel.
''As you know, the role of government is to ensure that our markets are run with the highest standards of honesty, integrity and transparency,'' Mr. Neugebauer wrote in a letter to the New York Fed dated July 23. ''Therefore, any admission of market manipulation -- regardless of the degree -- should be swiftly and vigorously investigated.''

HEADLINE: Japanese and North Korean Officials Meet for Their First Talks in 4 Years

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Government officials from Japan and North Korea held their first talks in four years on Wednesday, amid hopes that the North's new leader could be trying to reduce tensions with Japan and, by extension, the United States. 
The meeting at the Japanese Embassy in Beijing between midlevel diplomats was described by Japanese officials as a working-level discussion aimed at shaping an agenda for future higher-level talks. However, Japanese analysts have speculated that the talks could actually be a feeler from North Korea's new leader, Kim Jong-un, and that he might want improved economic ties with the outside world.
The two nations have no diplomatic relations. Official communications were broken off in 2008 amid acrimony over the North's nuclear program and the North's failure to fully address Japan's concerns about abductions of Japanese citizens in decades past. Tokyo believes that the North kidnapped dozens of Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s, forcing them to train the North's spies. North Korea returned five abductees in 2002 and insists that the issue has been resolved.
Wednesday's meeting ended without conclusion, with the diplomats expected to meet again on Thursday.
Japanese officials said the main topic was whether Japan would be allowed to retrieve the remains of what Tokyo counts as 21,000 Japanese who died at the end of World War II in the North, when it was a Japanese colony. They said North Korea initially suggested holding the government-level talks earlier this month at a meeting between Red Cross officials from both nations on the retrieval of Japanese remains.
But Japan's negotiator, Keiichi Ono, director of the Foreign Ministry's Northeast Asia Division, stressed the importance of the abductions, which remain a highly emotional issue among the Japanese public. And the top Japanese government spokesman, Osamu Fujimura, told reporters that future talks would proceed only ''with the understanding that the abduction issue will of course be part'' of them.
Japan will also raise the issue of repatriation of Japanese spouses of North Korean citizens who want to return, and the turning over of Japanese citizens in North Korea wanted for the hijacking of a Japanese airliner in 1970, Japanese news media said.

HEADLINE: 2nd Restaurant: Following Up

BYLINE: By IAN MOUNT

 BODY:
A year ago, we told you about a dilemma facing Red Iguana, a family-owned Mexican restaurant in Salt Lake City. Its owners, Lucy Cardenas and Bill Coker, were facing a two-pronged problem with their first location. First, a happy problem: their restaurant had gotten so popular after appearing on the Food Network's "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives" that customers regularly had to wait an hour to be seated. At the same time, the city was about to build a light rail line down the middle of the restaurant's street, a project that had the potential to force the business to close for several weeks.
To ease the customer wait and protect themselves from downtime, there was little doubt that Red Iguana's owners needed a second location. But the way they decided to expand was somewhat surprising. Ms. Cardenas and Mr. Coker decided to open a second location with the same name and menu just two blocks from their first, a plan that went against conventional wisdom and was rejected by most of the experts we consulted at the time of our original article. 
But the strategy quickly found success. During its first full year, 2010, the new restaurant had revenue of $2.1 million. Still, that was only a little more than half of the original restaurant's annual take of $3.9 million, which itself was down from $4.2 million in 2009. So, would the new location be able to build on its early success (without cannibalizing the original business)? And what would happen when the construction project shut down the first location?
We recently checked in with Mr. Coker, and the new location seems to have built on its strong start. The original location is on track to bring in $4.2 million during 2012, he said, which would match its income from the height of its popularity in 2009 (when it was the only restaurant). And the new location should pull in about $3.2 million, he said.
"What we've seen is that there are a substantial number of our clientele who prefer location No. 2 to No. 1 because when the patio is open, there are more seats, and we have a counter and indoor waiting area and valet parking in the evenings," Mr. Coker said. "It's more spacious and quieter than the original, and some people prefer that atmosphere. Others prefer the original. It's actually turned out to be to our advantage that it's not a cookie-cutter of the original; we're able to accommodate two different types of clients. Also in terms of operational ease, it's a tremendous advantage to our kitchen managers to be able to stabilize food flow by running two blocks to the other restaurant."
Almost as important, the second location saved the company from what could have been major economic damage caused by construction of the rail line. As a member of a community board advising the city on the construction, Mr. Coker negotiated a deal whereby the street in front of the original Red Iguana would be rebuilt last, so that the construction company could concentrate all of its efforts on the site - thereby turning a three-to-five week job into a weeklong project.
And then, to best use the week during which the original restaurant would be closed, Ms. Cardenas and Mr. Coker -- after employing announcement cards, banners, Facebook and Twitter to point their customers to the new restaurant -- laid out a seven-day plan to renovate the original location using restaurant workers as labor.
At 9 p.m. on July 8, when the original location turned on its "closed" sign, the city began tearing up the street, and Red Iguana's staff started dismantling their restaurant. Directed by paid trade contractors, a third of the staff from the original location (including a professional painter and plumber) took part in a $250,000 renovation. Working 24 hours a day, alternating crews of from 30 to 50 people moved the restaurant's furnishings outside into a circus tent set up for the occasion; laid an epoxy floor; installed $25,000 of stainless steel equipment in the kitchen; and repaved the parking lot.
"Normally I don't think a restaurant could pull off a $250,000 renovation in seven days, but that's the kind of experience I have from the entertainment business, coordinating multiple crews simultaneously," said Mr. Coker, who in the early 1980s had worked as an assistant director and production manager on a series of Burt Reynolds buddy comedies, including "The Cannonball Run."
At the new restaurant, the owners added 28 outdoor seats, increased staff with another third of the employees from the first location (the final third took vacation), and began offering valet parking at lunch and dinner every day.
And on Monday July 16, one week after it closed, the original location reopened. According to Mr. Coker, even without the seven days of income, the first location took in $282,000 in July, barely $300 less than in July 2011.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 'Discriminatory Purpose' in Texas

 BODY:
Hispanic and black voters in Texas were vindicated on Tuesday when a federal three-judge panel rejected the state's new redistricting plans for Congressional and state legislative seats. A panel of the United States District Court in the District of Columbia properly found that the maps, based on the 2010 census, had a discriminatory purpose and effect in reducing the ability of minority voters to elect candidates they favor. 
The evidence of the discrimination was stark. Almost 90 percent of the 4.3 million growth in the state's population in the last decade came from minority residents. That growth qualified Texas for four additional Congressional seats, and it required the state to create new voting districts. Yet instead of adding districts in which minority voters could elect candidates of their choice, the Republican-controlled Legislature drew the districts in a way that reduced the number represented by members of minority groups. About some districts, the panel said, the plans maintained ''the semblance of Hispanic voting power,'' but the mapmakers actually diluted it.
Texas is covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act for its history of voting discrimination. It was in court because it had to get prior approval for any changes to its voting procedures from a federal court or the Justice Department -- and it could receive permission only if it could prove that the changes would not have a discriminatory effect. The judges, sensibly, said no.
As the court's majority opinion noted, no major surgery was performed by the lawmakers on the Congressional districts of white incumbents. But there was ''unchallenged evidence'' that in four minority districts, the Legislature performed surgery to cut out ''economic engines'' and harm the districts. In a couple of cases, the Republicans cut out the district offices of the members of Congress.
From one district in Houston, what got cut were the Astrodome, the Medical Center, Houston Baptist University and the rail line. From another in Dallas, it was the American Center where the Dallas Mavericks play basketball and the arts district, not to mention the Congressional member's home. From a third in San Antonio, it was the Alamo and the Convention Center, which, as the court said, was ''named after the incumbent's father.''
Another federal court, in San Antonio, Tex., must decide what effect the three-judge panel's ruling will have on this fall's elections. Earlier this year, that court put in place interim district maps while legal challenges were being heard. It would be very difficult to alter the interim plans, which modestly improved on the Legislature's plans, in time for the November elections.
Texas has announced that it plans to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. If the court takes the case, a critical question will be the continuing relevance and need for Section 5 preclearance for Texas, eight other states and some counties and towns with histories of severe discrimination. This case demonstrates, clearly and powerfully, that Section 5 remains essential in protecting voting rights.

HEADLINE: Touring Streets, Highlighting Gutters

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- ''Who here likes hookers?''
The 10 people on the TMZ Hollywood Tour van looked at one another uneasily. But Adrienne Camille, their highly caffeinated guide on this late August day, didn't wait for an answer. ''Well, we know Hugh Grant does, and right here on this corner is where he got caught in his car with one,'' Ms. Camille said brightly.
One passenger, a lawyer from Australia, craned his neck for a better view. The others, including a 10-year-old girl, stared in silence. With that, the cherry-red TMZ van lurched into traffic and drove on -- to the hotel where Paris Hilton filmed a sex tape, the spot where a drunken Halle Berry crashed her car (into a liquor store) and the mental ward where Britney Spears was held.
Maps to the stars' homes? How quaint. Having supercharged celebrity gossip and news, first on the Web and then on television, TMZ is now doing the same thing to the venerable sightseeing tour. TMZ's open-air vans and snarky guides popped up here last year and have become hotter than a paparazzo's flash bulb. More than 6,000 people took the tour in July, up from about 2,000 in the same month a year earlier, according to a spokeswoman. 
Now TMZ is bringing its tours to New York. ''That's exclusive news, nobody else knows that yet,'' said Harvey Levin, TMZ's scoop-obsessed founder. Test runs are under way, and Mr. Levin expects the tours to be up and running early next year.
You can still see the celebrity sights in Los Angeles the old-fashioned way, paying $6 for a foldout map. You can also book a relatively staid Starline bus tour, operating more or less in the same fashion since 1935. But there aren't as many megawatt stars as there used to be, and the ones who do remain have gotten better at hiding. These days you're lucky to see celebrity concrete -- a curb and the lip of a driveway, ending at a towering gate.
So TMZ simply goes straight for the gutter and stays there, seven days a week, up to 11 times a day. The 24-seat vans are equipped with four 26-inch screens, which at various locations play videos using material from TMZ's television show. Tours last about two hours, depending on traffic. An adult ticket costs $49; children ride for $39.
''We're going to show you things you actually want to see,'' Ms. Camille shouted as a tour began last Thursday afternoon. Using a headset microphone, she proceeded to point out where the singer Avril Lavigne ''got beaten up in a street fight'' (the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel), where Jennifer Lopez supposedly goes for margaritas (a sad country bar on the Sunset Strip) and Chateau Marmont, identified as the hotel where Josh Hartnett was staying when he called 911 to complain of severe diarrhea.
''Now you know how we felt after watching 'Pearl Harbor,' Josh,'' the narrator of a video segment intoned as the van idled outside.
TMZ, which consistently beats its celebrity-news competitors (its scoops include the news of Michael Jackson's death and, this month, the publishing of nude photos of Prince Harry), has made its tawdry debut on Hollywood's tourism scene at a time when tours here are mushrooming. Thomas J. LaBonge, a Los Angeles councilman who is the chairman of the city's Trade, Commerce and Tourism Committee, estimates that there are now 30 tour operators plying their services along Hollywood Boulevard near Grauman's Chinese Theater; he said that a decade ago there were fewer than 10.
Leron Gubler, the chief executive of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said competition for customers is so intense that as many as 70 different sales agents wander the area's star-emblazoned sidewalks armed with brochures. ''This is not the image we want to project,'' Mr. Gubler said. ''Tourists have been complaining.'' (Mr. Gubler added, however, that the TMZ tours, which are operated in partnership with Starline, are among the best.)
Last week Mr. LaBonge hosted a meeting with tour operators and community members to discuss ideas including rewriting municipal codes to prohibit sidewalk salespeople, forcing tour vans and buses to drive specific routes, and limiting the use of audio equipment. ''There has to be greater regulation, at the very least a code of conduct,'' he said, noting that some tour vans stop in the middle of intersections to allow riders to snap photos. ''It's an accident waiting to happen.''
Officials theorize that tours are increasingly popular here because of recent efforts to turn Hollywood from a sketchy neighborhood to a shopping and night life district, an uptick in tourists to Southern California and a down economy that has prompted unemployed workers from other industries to go into the tour business.
Mr. Levin said that younger people have rediscovered the venerable Hollywood tour because his option offers information about the current crop of famous people, even if it is Snooki or Lindsay. His tours are also geared to the attention-deficit generation. Instead of sitting passively on a bus, patrons on one of TMZ's tours are asked to pretend that they are members of the paparazzi, and guides are equipped with cameras. If anyone spots a famous person -- and the bar is low (a Real Housewife here, a Pawn Star there) -- the group stages an ambush.
''I wanted to have not just a tour but a show,'' Mr. Levin said. ''It's also very good for us to have all of those eyes on the street.'' Footage shot on the tours ''can be on our site by the time the group is back to home base.''
TMZ's style was readily apparent at one stop on the Sunset Strip. On the left side of the van was the Sunset Tower, where legend holds that John Wayne kept a cow on his terrace and Vanity Fair hosts its annual Oscar bacchanal. But nobody looked in that direction, and Ms. Camille didn't mention the hotel. She was too busy pointing out Saddle Ranch across the street, a bar with a mechanical bull where Fred Durst, the Limp Bizkit lead singer who had his own sex tape scandal, once gave a waitress a $2,000 tip.
''Cool,'' said Luke Cohen, 16.
Not just any bad behavior makes TMZ's cut. The spot where Sharon Osbourne lobbed a baked ham into her noisy neighbor's yard? Skipped. But passengers were quizzed about which celebrity has frequented Larry Flynt's Hustler store, which includes something called the Porn Star Walk of Fame.
''Fergie?'' guessed Amber Mahoney, a 10-year-old from Yorba Linda, Calif., referring to the Black Eyed Peas singer. Ms. Camille said that was correct.
''That's my kid,'' said Selena Mahoney, her mother.
TMZ did include one or two sights tied to Hollywood's more golden years. The Roosevelt Hotel, for instance, was noted as the place ''where J.F.K. would allegedly sneak through the laundry room to hook up with Marilyn Monroe.'' It happened, according to the video, ''back in ancient times.''

HEADLINE: The Importance of Dads

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Two recent opinion articles cite my research to support their claims that fathers aren't necessary for a thriving household (''In Defense of Single Motherhood,'' by Katie Roiphe, Aug. 12, and ''Men, Who Needs Them?,'' by Greg Hampikian, Aug. 25). That does not fairly describe my work. 
Income security is very important. But fathers in most cases are critical contributors to family income. And income security is only half the story.
Emotional security -- which children develop from living in stable families where they can form lasting relationships with adults who stick around for the long run -- is also important. Stable homes with one parent are rare. More often in single-mother households, children meet, attach and then say goodbye to men who are only temporarily connected to the family.
Two parents committed to each other and to raising a child together are more likely to provide the economic and emotional security children need. That large numbers of fathers cannot provide economic and emotional security constitutes a serious social problem.

HEADLINE: Back to School: Were We Ever Away?

BYLINE: By PAMELA PAUL

 BODY:
REMEMBER the big pre-Labor Day shopping excursion, the reunion with beloved classmates, the specter of newly minted bullies and the scent of pencils in the air? There was drama, emotion and heightened energy to the moment.
Now that moment lasts three months.
''I feel like I've been thinking about back-to-school ever since school ended -- it doesn't go away,'' said Kim McCormack, who works in pharmaceutical marketing in Maplewood, N.J., where her two children attend parochial school. ''My kids came home with math workbooks, a reading list, suggested activities and a list of school supplies that we'd need to get before the next school year begins. Everything has gotten longer and more complicated than it needs to be.''
Parents are now in the protracted throes of back-to-school season. What was once a day (typically the Tuesday after Labor Day) has metastasized, like Halloween, into an undertaking requiring months. Shopping circulars start arriving in midsummer, preseason varsity sports begin in August and school itself can start anywhere from July 30 in the South to late September in New York City private schools.
By the time it's all over, it's practically Halloween anyway. 
''There's this blasted Target ad, 'We Got the Beat!' constantly running on TV,'' said Amy Wilson, an actress and writer who was vacationing on Long Island before returning to New York City, where her three children attend school. ''Got to get your jeans and underwear!''
Ms. Wilson was not in the mood.
''I don't want to hear about it,'' she said. ''It's like Christmas creeping back to October.'' (Target uploaded the commercial to YouTube on July 9.)
But in one of those global-warming paradoxes, schools across the country are turning on the air-conditioners earlier this year, when it feels more like summer than ever. In Baton Rouge, La., children traipsed back to campus on Aug. 8 in 90-degree-plus heat, the same day school opened in sunny Palm Bay, Fla. Parents in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles are still lamenting the lopping off of summer vacation after the Los Angeles Unified School District decided to reel children in three weeks early, on Aug. 14.
''Just about all the systems in east Tennessee start in early to mid-August now,'' said Charles West, a father of three in Maryville, Tenn., where he owns a Chevrolet dealership and serves on the local school board. One neighboring system started in late July, which made his children's new school start date of Aug. 1 seem relatively belated.
''By July, we're already assembling packets with teachers,'' Mr. West said. To ease the pain, the State of Tennessee offered a tax-free holiday for back-to-school shoppers the first week of August.
For retailers, back-to-school season starts, one industry newsletter coldly noted, ''immediately after leftover patriotic merchandise is cleared away.'' Total sales for the back-to-school weeks, which run into October, rank second only to Christmas, according to the National Retail Federation, a trade organization.
''There are two parts to the season: back to school and back in school,'' said Andrew Stein, the interim chief marketing officer at Kmart. ''Because the weather is getting warmer nowadays, kids are still wearing shorts through September, which means apparel purchasing continues well into the fall.''
Extending the season on the opposite end is an increase in layaway purchases, with an eight-week pay period starting in July. Moreover, the sluggish economy means more parents are stretching out their shopping days rather than stocking up in one big, expensive excursion.
This dragging out of the shopping season is not limited to discount stores. According to research by the National Retail Federation, one-fourth of back-to-school shoppers say they plan to begin buying supplies more than two months before the first day of classes. Nearly half plan to make their retail rounds three to four weeks ahead. And despite lingering economic woes, parents with children in grades K-12 are expected to spend an average of $688 this year, up from $603 in 2011.
''The whole back-to-school industry is built on anxiety,'' said Molly Jong-Fast, a novelist and mother of three in Manhattan. ''The Internet has gotten rid of the whole concept of seasonality and shortages, but there's still the primitive fear that you'll wake up on the first day of school and your kids won't have a clean pair of socks.''
But what some people (store owners) see as a steady bonanza, others (parents) see as a logistical nightmare. Because school start dates in the United States are determined locally, school begins anywhere from late July to the end of September. Whereas in France, home of the steely French maman and a highly centralized academic system, the nation's education minister made headlines this year when he dared nudge the date of the return to class from Sept. 4, a Tuesday, to Sept. 3 because it was more logical.
Here, individual schools and systems claim varying reasons for their far-flung start dates. Classes at the Williston Northampton School, a private boarding and day school in Easthampton, Mass., do not start until Sept. 10, in part to allow its increasing population of international students to get over jet lag. Meanwhile, at the Catholic school Lisa Lawrence's two children attend in Austin, Tex., classes started in mid-August this year to give families a week off at Easter. For Ms. Lawrence, this was a relief.
''We're tired of the heat,'' she said. ''It's painfully hard to be outside at this time of year in Texas, so having kids inside is a good thing.''
Elsewhere, the temperature seems to clash with the chilly notion of study hall. ''Isn't August supposed to be summer?'' parents in Los Angeles have been heard to wail. ''Must we come back from the beach so early?'' The decision by the city to close 33 public pools the week of Aug. 13, a cost-saving measure timed to the new Aug. 14 start date for schools, met with an outcry among residents sweltering in a heat wave and not especially feeling that back-to-school spirit.
Then there's the opposite problem: parents trapped in the yawning hollow between the last day of camp in mid-August and the first day of school in mid-September. Preschools and private schools tend to start weeks after their public school neighbors. With playgrounds empty, camp counselors back at college, pools shuttered and parents' slapdash child care arrangements crumbling in the heat, this fourth and final month of summer, parents and children agree, is no fun.
At the school Ms. McCormack's children attend in New Jersey, classes do not get going until the Wednesday after Labor Day, and the first three days are half-days. The schedule is so erratic, Ms. McCormack needs an au pair to cover child care.
Ms. Wilson of New York said that by early August, parents are already e-mailing, trying to coordinate extracurricular activities. ''Who's doing flag football Tuesday night?'' she said by example. Meanwhile, she said, there was a ''total disconnect'' between the planning and the shopping and the actual moment her children are all back: Sept. 10.
By the time the ''stupid-looking'' lunchbox under consideration is replaced by something cooler, the class lists assembled, curriculum night attended and the first parent-teacher conference dissected, everybody has settled into a routine. Trick or treat!

HEADLINE: Getting Bolder With Age

BYLINE: By BEE-SHYUAN CHANG

 BODY:
ONE morning this month, three women, all over 40, were perched in the cushy gray chairs at the Yves Durif hair salon, on 76th Street off Madison Avenue in the Carlyle hotel.
Given the address, you might have expected the mood to be reverent. Instead, the room rang with one-liners, while the salon owner Mr. Durif, an energetic Frenchman, and David Johnstone, the unflappable, bespectacled color director, assessed each client.
''Don't you dare give me that boring Upper East Side hair,'' Dawn Bennett, 61, told Mr. Johnstone. ''I want it rude and I want it rock 'n' roll.''
Ms. Bennett, an arts administrator at the Brooklyn nonprofit organization Urban Glass, once had long dark strands down to the small of her back. Now she does what she pleases, including on this day, magenta streaks, three blunt tiers of bangs and an undershave that could turn her short hairdo into a mohawk if she willed it with strong gel. 
''Some of the young artists in the program have said, 'We have the coolest art administrator around,' '' Ms. Bennett said proudly.
A chair over, Sunny Bates, an entrepreneur (her age was ''somewhere between 49 and 100,'' she said) started the morning with the sedate above-the-shoulder bob in a cool blond she had had for the last six years. Mr. Durif snipped the ends until a sleeker look emerged. He also gave her a fine undershave, albeit on one side.
''It's like playing hide and seek if she runs her fingers through her hair,'' Mr. Durif said. Mr. Johnstone then brushed on a gingery tint and the finishing touch: chunky white-blond highlights befitting a comic book heroine. ''I don't ever want to be plain,'' Ms. Bates said of the change. ''The worst thing is to look too suburban.''
But perhaps her friend Linda Holliday, chief executive of Citia, a book-digest company, was the boldest of the bunch. She chose semi-permanent, swimming-pool-blue streaks that gave her usual sunny hue a punkish cast. ''It's like my last summer fling,'' said Ms. Holliday, who is in her 50s, though she was slightly in shock after she emerged from the color room.
''I was at my stepdaughter's high school graduation a few months ago and every one of those girls had the same straight long hair with the $30 blow-dry,'' she said. ''It's oppressive. I know a lot of it is about attracting men, but if you're cookie-cutter, what kind of man are you going to attract?''
Wild colors and innovative hairstyles have resonated with a subset of the young and carefree, but in the salons of major cities like New York, London and Los Angeles, women in their 40s, 50s, 60s and up have adopted the trend. Often, they are ditching their classic Bergdorf-blond coifs (a k a Park Avenue blond or Madison Avenue blond) in favor of loud and dramatic statements.
Michael Van Clarke, a stylist in London who has tended to several royal families at his salon, has had requests for ''crazy color flashes around the hairline, dip-dying or unusual temporary color tones,'' he said. ''It wasn't us suggesting this. It was these very vibrant 50- and 60-year-olds who still want to compete, in a sense, with trendy young women.''
He often uses temporary color (he particularly likes Wella Perfecton, a newish technology that won't stain blond manes, he said) in wide streaks or all-over washes. It's best on well-dressed, well-groomed women, Mr. Van Clarke said, ''because only if the rest of the package is quite refined and confident does it work.''
''It's about the contrast of elegance with this shock of hair,'' he added.
Edward Tricomi, a partner in the chain of Warren-Tricomi salons, has been performing what he calls ''hair pollination'' at the Plaza hotel location. The free-form method ditches the coloring brush in favor of hand-splattering strands with hair dye, perhaps, as he showcased, in light aqua.
''Our older New York clientele is very progressive,'' Mr. Tricomi said, pointing to the intersection of art, fashion and music in the city. ''Besides that, you have these 60-year-olds -- my generation -- who are healthy, going to the gym and feeling young. I certainly don't look like my uncles and aunts when they were that age. These women are living full and wonderful lives.''
Even in Southern California, the land of long locks and sun streaks, women are edging to edgier. ''It's not being driven by celebrities,'' said the colorist George Papanikolas of the Andy Lecompte salon on North Almont Drive in West Hollywood, Calif. Most of his famous clients, including the model Miranda Kerr, have natural-colored strands, he said.
''The Hunger Games,'' with characters sporting a rainbow of hues, may have influenced a wider audience, he said.
But in and around Los Angeles, ''the cuts are still classic,'' Mr. Papanikolas said. ''And it's a temporary color accent like an ombré effect with the ends dipped.''
For example, he has doused the ends of Gela Nash-Taylor, a Juicy Couture founder, in mint green. Wives of rich show-business executives have also asked for the look. ''It's more of a 'I don't care' or 'I'm having fun' energy,'' he said.
Yet according to the stylists, this is not a case of mothers imitating their daughters. ''Actually, the young women are all requesting the same boring long cut,'' said Mr. Durif at the Carlyle.
''It's probably the economy,'' Mr. Johnstone added. ''Young people are feeling vulnerable in their jobs, and so they go conservative with their look.''
Certainly having the kind of high-maintenance blond hair that seems to broadcast its pricey upkeep feels less current today.
''That kind of blond really only identifies with one demographic,'' Mr. Johnstone said. ''There's a lot of general tumult going on right now, politically and ideologically, and many of these ladies want to broaden their appeal. So maybe they'll do something outré to their color, something that's unconventional to their peers.''
Such ladies might look to the heiress Daphne Guinness, who strays far from beauty conventions. For the last few years, Mr. Johnstone has colored and collaborated on her trademark coif (very light, nearly platinum blond marked with jet black stripes and styled in an updo.
''I haven't seen my natural color since I was 11,'' Ms. Guinness, 44, said from Cannes, France. In her 30s, Ms. Guinness said, she had ''been rather impetuous with hair color'' and ''toyed with burgundy and brown streaks,'' but it had also been a straightforward buttery blond.
''The plain blond wasn't really saying anything,'' Mr. Johnstone said of his client's former color. ''It was a nebulous cloud.''
Ms. Guinness's current style, on the other hand, says so much that it has become inseparable from her inimitable style. Once, for a photo shoot, the stylist on set dyed her hair black. ''It didn't look bad but it didn't feel like myself anymore,'' Ms. Guinness said, adding,
''I'm not going to fiddle around with my look on other people's advice anymore. It is just hair, but when you look in the mirror, it shouldn't be somebody else's vision. You should see you.''

HEADLINE: Ryan to Reassure Middle Class and Renew Attack on 'Obamacare'

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Representative Paul D. Ryan, framing the presidential election as the ''clearest choice possible,'' intends to use his prime-time moment at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night to assure Americans that he and Mitt Romney can oversee a strong economic recovery.
''We have a plan for a stronger middle class, with the goal of generating 12 million new jobs over the next four years,'' Mr. Ryan, who has become the party's leader on economic policy, will say, according to excerpts provided by the campaign.
In the excerpts, Mr. Ryan takes some strong shots at President Obama, noting that a new Republican administration would ''not spend four years blaming others -- we will take responsibility.'' 
''After four years of getting the runaround, America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is Gov. Mitt Romney,'' Mr. Ryan will say in his speech, which presents a major opportunity for him to make the case for denying Mr. Obama a second term.
In a reference to Mr. Ryan's budget plan and the partisan division over his plans to overhaul Medicare and cut spending, Mr. Ryan's remarks say: ''We will not duck the tough issues -- we will lead.''
In accepting his party's vice-presidential nomination, Mr. Ryan will also renew the Republican push to repeal the new health care law -- a pledge certain to meet with a strong response in the convention hall.
'' 'Obamacare' comes to more than 2,000-pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees and fines that have no place in a free country,'' he says in the excerpts. ''The president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over. That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal 'Obamacare.' ''
As the storm-shortened convention headed into its second full day of activities, Mr. Ryan, the Wisconsin lawmaker who leads the House Budget Committee, was the unequivocal star attraction in a lineup of speakers that was heavy on Mr. Ryan's Congressional colleagues, including Senator John McCain, the party's unsuccessful 2008 presidential nominee.
Mr. Ryan's speech was to provide the biggest opportunity yet for the 42-year-old conservative to make the case for his vision -- embraced by Congressional Republicans and much of the party's intelligentsia -- of how to rein in soaring entitlement spending, shrink the size of government and alter federal spending priorities. His admirers were expecting him to shine.
''Tonight, the American people -- millions who may not know a lot about Paul Ryan other than the headlines that they've read -- are going to get to know Paul Ryan the way many of us know him; as a serious policy thinker,'' Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on ABC's ''Good Morning America.'' He called Mr. Ryan someone who ''brings a unique life experience and a unique perspective on some of the issues that we face because of his age, because of our generation but, at the same time, someone who is as deep and serious a thinker about our issues as ever before.''
Democrats were just as eager as Republicans to focus public attention on Mr. Ryan and his plans. A group of top Democrats arrived in Tampa to slice and dice Mr. Ryan's budget. The Democratic National Committee took out a full-page ad in The Tampa Tribune to accuse Mr. Ryan of trying to ''end Medicare as we know it'' through his proposal to provide federal health insurance subsidies for future retirees so they can buy private insurance rather than enroll in Medicare. The party also has two billboards with similar themes in the vicinity of the convention hall and plans to have a plane pull a banner Wednesday night with the message: ''Romney-Ryan: Wrong for the Middle Class.''
Even as the political sniping went on, the convention managers and the Romney campaign were closely monitoring events unfolding along the Gulf Coast just a few hundred miles away as Hurricane Isaac pummeled Louisiana with rain and wind, causing flooding and providing a stark televised contrast to the convention festivities.
Besides Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCain, the speakers were to include Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, John Thune of South Dakota and Rob Portman of Ohio; Mr. Portman was among the top contenders for the vice-presidential slot that went to Mr. Ryan.
Mr. Ryan's speech is unlikely to focus too heavily on the wonkier details of his budget plan, which has twice passed the House. The Romney campaign has been distancing itself from the proposal, seeking to make clear that the presidential nominee will be the one responsible for setting economic policy.
Mr. Ryan also needs to introduce himself to the many Americans who will be listening to him for the first time. But the budget and his economic proposals are such an indelible part of his identity that discussion of the contentious policy plans and their implications will be unavoidable.
Republicans say they believe that the American public is ready to engage in a serious debate over how to get a handle on entitlement costs and that they can persuade voters that their plans will help keep Medicare solvent and show them as the party willing to make tough decisions. They see Mr. Ryan's budget as a formidable political weapon.
''It does distinguish what we are about as Republicans versus what the president has been about,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, a close ally and friend of Mr. Ryan.
''What the budget that Paul offered does is say that we Republicans want to solve a problem,'' said Mr. Cantor, the House majority leader.
Democrats argue that Mr. Ryan's approach would instead cause problems by driving up the costs of health care for older Americans and shaking the foundations of Medicare, the popular health insurance program.
Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Mr. Ryan's Democratic counterpart on the Budget Committee, accused Mr. Ryan on Wednesday of a ''calculated, cynical effort to confuse seniors and to hide from seniors just how bad the Romney-Ryan plan would be.''
Joining other Democrats at a news conference, Mr. Van Hollen also said that Mr. Ryan's presence on the national ticket and the emphasis on his budget were boosting Democrats in Congressional races around the country.
Aides to Mr. Ryan sought to push back forcefully against Mr. Van Hollen.
''Having already saddled the country with $5 trillion in new debt while cutting Medicare by $716 billion to pay for 'Obamacare,' President Obama cannot defend his broken promises, so he and his campaign are resorting to tired and misleading attacks,'' said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan. ''Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have a plan to strengthen the middle class by cutting the deficit, preserving and protecting Medicare, and lowering taxes for all American so we can create 12 million new jobs.''
Mr. Romney, who is scheduled to deliver his acceptance speech Thursday night as the convention concludes, left Tampa on Wednesday and flew to Indianapolis for a campaign appearance.
In a change of schedule, aides said that Mr. Romney was not expected to stay overnight in Indiana but instead would return to Tampa to watch the convention speeches from his hotel room with his wife, Ann.

HEADLINE: Economy Still Stuck In Low Gear

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Government data released Wednesday suggested the economy continued to muddle along at a subdued pace, highlighting the pressure on Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, to come up with bolder policy prescriptions Friday when he delivers a widely anticipated speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
With the economy looming as the leading issue in the presidential race, Mr. Bernanke faces a delicate decision. Though economic growth remained weak by historical standards, fears that the United States is slipping back into a recession have abated. In any event, previous rounds of monetary easing have generated only modest benefits. 
More aggressive steps to stimulate the economy will also draw criticism from Republicans, who have demanded that Mr. Bernanke forswear additional monetary moves for now. Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, said last week that he was opposed to a third round of easing, which is intended to put downward pressure on interest rates and encourage businesses and consumers to borrow and spend.
Economic growth remains too anemic to bring down the nation's stubbornly high levels of unemployment, leading to some calls for action by the Fed. Most economists expect Mr. Bernanke to wait until after Federal Reserve policy makers meet on Sept. 12-13 to announce major actions, but the latest reports underscore just how tepid economic growth remains.
The Commerce Department revised upward its estimate of economic growth in the second quarter to an annual rate of 1.7 percent, from an earlier estimate of 1.5 percent. That growth still represents a deceleration from the 2 percent pace in the first quarter. The economy needs to grow at 2.5 percent to 3 percent a year to substantially reduce unemployment, which is at 8.3 percent.
The revision was driven by stronger export growth, along with fewer imports than originally estimated and a slight uptick in personal consumer spending. Inventory growth cooled, highlighting continued caution by businesses about the overall outlook.
''It's not disastrous, but it is one reason the Federal Reserve is on high alert,'' said Julia Lynn Coronado, chief economist for North America at BNP Paribas. She said she expected economic growth to slow to 1.3 percent in the third quarter and improve slightly to 1.8 percent in the fourth.
In another sign of tepid economic conditions, a Federal Reserve report issued Wednesday afternoon found that the economy continued to expand gradually across the country in July and early August, with slower growth in parts of the East Coast.
The Fed survey of 12 regional bank districts, known as the beige book, also found that employment held steady or grew slightly nationwide, with weaker-than-expected results in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Richmond districts.
The manufacturing sector was ''mixed,'' according to the report, with six districts reporting that demand for manufactured goods had decreased. On the other hand, the Fed said retail spending had risen in most areas since July's beige book report.
Rising uncertainty about the presidential election in November and fiscal policy in the United States are crimping growth, Ms. Coronado said, along with continuing fears about Europe's debt problems and a slowdown in China's once-booming economy.
Many companies are holding off on expansion moves as they await the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts in January, along with budget reductions that are set to go into effect unless Congress comes up with a deal to cut the deficit.
There are some brighter spots in the economy, including the housing sector, which until recently had shown few signs of life.
Pending home sales in July rose to their highest level in more than two years, according to data released on Wednesday by the National Association of Realtors. The Pending Home Sales Index, reflecting contracts but not closings, rose 2.4 percent from the previous month.
On Tuesday, the latest figures from the S.& P./Case-Shiller Home Price Index showed that home prices rose 1.2 percent nationally in June from a year ago. Home prices remain down almost a third from their peak in 2006, but a firming market is welcome relief in a cloudy picture.
The annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, organized by the Federal Reserve of Kansas City, has become something of a Woodstock for Fed followers. Mr. Bernanke's speeches are not necessarily road maps for future actions, but are closely watched for clues about his thinking.
''Fed officials don't view Jackson Hole as a great opportunity to signal a policy change,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''They'd rather wait for a formal meeting to send out signals.''

HEADLINE: Shares Creep Higher Ahead of Bernanke Speech

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks edged higher on Wednesday in the lightest trading of the year as investors waited for an important speech by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Friday.
Daily volume this week has been low, even for a seasonally slow period, with the market recording three of the four lowest volume full sessions of 2012. The low volume reflected investors' reluctance to place big bets before Mr. Bernanke's speech. 
What little excitement there was came from data showing that pending home sales rose 2.4 percent in July, more than expected, according to the National Association of Realtors. A housing shares index was up 0.5 percent.
''We're seeing consistently good numbers out of the housing market,'' said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of Multi-Asset Strategies at ING Investment Management in New York. ''It's hard to get too negative on the U.S. economy with the housing market doing better than expected.''
''I think the U.S. is doing pretty well today, given what the rest of the world has done,'' Mr. Zemsky said. The Shanghai Composite index hit its lowest close since February 2009, for example, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was trading near a four-year high.
The Dow Jones industrial average inched up 4.49 points, or 0.03 percent, to 13,107.48. The S.& P. rose 1.19 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,410.49. The Nasdaq composite index gained 4.04 points, or 0.13 percent, to 3,081.19.
The S.& P. dipped in the last two sessions, but the decline was less than 0.1 percent on both days. It has not closed with a 1 percent move in either direction since Aug. 3.
Mr. Bernanke is scheduled to address a conference of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and could announce new moves to stimulate economic growth. He said to be likely to stoke expectations for a third round of quantitative easing, though he may not disclose the timing of the Fed's possible action.
Investors were also focusing on a European Central Bank meeting on Sept. 6 and a range of data on the United States economy to be released next week, including the Labor Department's payrolls report for August.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that the gross domestic product of the United States grew 1.7 percent in the second quarter. The government figure was in line with economists' expectations and an increase over last month's government estimate of a 1.5 percent gain.
Also Wednesday, the Fed said in its beige book that the nation's economy grew gradually in July and early August but that manufacturing activity was softening.
Interest rates were up slightly. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32, to 99 24/32, and the yield rose to 1.65 percent from 1.64 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Defeat, Introspection, Reinvention, Nomination

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Julie Bosman and Jo Craven McGinty contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Not long after Mitt Romney dropped out of the presidential race in early 2008, a titan of New York finance, Julian H. Robertson, flew to Utah to deliver an eye-popping offer.
He asked Mr. Romney to become chief executive of his hedge fund, Tiger Management, for an annual salary of about $30 million, plus investment profits, according to two people told of the discussions.
For Mr. Romney, who had spent the previous decade in public life forgoing any paychecks, the position promised to catapult him back to the pinnacle of American business and into the ranks of the stratospherically rich. Several friends and relatives urged him to accept. ''Let's put it this way,'' said Mr. Robertson. ''He could have made a lot of money.''
But Mr. Romney was uninterested. His mind -- and his heart -- were elsewhere, still trained in the raw days after his political defeat not on Wall Street but on the White House and an urgent quest: to be understood by an electorate that had eluded him. 
From the moment that Mr. Romney ended his first bid for the Republican nomination, he complained to friends, advisers and family that he had felt cheated out of a chance to explain himself to the country. He had emerged from his debut on the national political stage, he told them, as a caricature he did not recognize: emotionally uncaring, intellectually inauthentic, ideologically malleable.
Over the next three years, a little-examined period in his life, he sought to reclaim his public identity with the self-critical eye, marketing savvy and systematic rigor of the corporate consultant that he once was.
When Willard Mitt Romney, 65, delivers his acceptance speech Thursday night in Tampa, Fla., reveling in his success at winning over a fractious party and endeavoring to sell himself anew to Americans, he will owe the moment in no small measure to what he did during this time.
It was a restless period when he labored to persuade voters to see him as he saw himself: a man of deep convictions and big ideas, a credible party leader and inevitable presidential nominee.
He coolly assessed the failings of his 2008 campaign and undertook an intensive yearlong tutorial on everything from the tax code to global jihadism. He wrote a book laying out his vision and values to answer conservative doubters and counter charges of flip-flopping, elbowing aside a ghost writer who he felt could not accurately channel his voice. He bought good will in his party by crisscrossing the country to raise money for hundreds of candidates, even cutting a check for one lawmaker's portrait in the New Hampshire State House.
Mr. Romney returned as a far stronger candidate -- a crisper debater, a more decisive manager, a better strategist and a stick-to-his-message campaigner whose chief selling point this time around, his business expertise, was well suited to the political moment. But he also ran up against the limits of his own overhaul.
''This is who I am,'' he told a publisher while pitching his book. ''And I want the book to reveal it.'' But instinctively uncomfortable with public introspection and averse to exposing his private life, he offered no personal narrative for people to feel they really knew him.
His exhaustive campaigning between presidential races did little to diminish his awkwardness with voters. And for all his preparedness on foreign policy -- he had traveled to Afghanistan and the Mideast -- he managed to offend his hosts and inspire unfortunate headlines on his first overseas trip as his party's presumptive nominee.
Mr. Romney's quick reimmersion into politics after his 2008 loss was revealing for a man who, at 60, had already conquered high finance and state government but who still needed to set ambitious goals and yearned to fulfill the grandest of them. Suddenly rudderless for the first time in his adult life, he recoiled at the prospect of an unstructured existence, telling an adviser: ''I'm not just going to meet with people. I need a plan.''
This 1,211-day stretch shows much of what still animates Mr. Romney: an abiding belief that corporate methods can be applied to the political sphere, a longing to be accepted by the world beyond his close-knit community, and a relentless drive for self-improvement.
''He felt he had been -- he knew that he had been -- unable to connect with the voters,'' said Peter Matson, Mr. Romney's book agent. ''In his mind,'' Mr. Matson said, ''he had to do better.''
'The Message Wasn't There'
Mitt Romney was unsparing on Valentine's Day in 2008 when he summoned a dozen top aides into a conference room overlooking the Charles River in Boston.
He handed out copies of a single-page document on which he evaluated his bid for the nomination, breaking it into two categories, the candidate and the campaign. What had worked: his strategy for raising money and collecting delegates. What had not: his relative lack of foreign policy experience and muddled positions on social issues.
Participants recalled the exercise in self-analysis as both eerie and impressive, saying that it seemed as if Mr. Romney were talking about someone other than himself. His diagnosis: ''The message was not there,'' according to several aides, who said he accepted much of the blame.
With a book, Mr. Romney reasoned, he could avoid any ambiguity about what he stood for, circumventing the news media and the political enemies who he felt had misrepresented him in 2008. ''I can write what I want to write. I can say what I want to say,'' his son Tagg recalled his father explaining.
So in the fall of 2008, at the suggestion of a top political adviser, Stuart Stevens, Mr. Romney signed on with an unlikely writing partner -- an Obama fan from California named Russell Martin, who helped write a PBS documentary that won an award for combating homophobia.
It was an uneasy collaboration from the start: Mr. Romney soon rejected an agreed-upon system of tape recording his thoughts, which Mr. Martin would massage into prose. Mr. Romney insisted on drafting every chapter -- a hunt-and-peck typist, he banged the pages out on the patio of his house in La Jolla, Calif. -- then letting Mr. Martin edit.
''The roles were effectively reversed,'' said Mr. Matson, the book agent. ''The Romney experience of 2008 was that the people who wrote speeches for him were not good enough. He said that if he had been able to write his speeches on his own, he would have been better off.''
Mr. Romney, a voracious reader and avid student of history, relished what he began to treat as a crash course on the United States military, Russian-American relations, public education reform and federal regulation.
With Robert Kagan, the historian and foreign policy expert, he reverse-engineered America's relationship with Iran, searching for opportunities to avert the current standoff over its nuclear program through diplomacy, alliances and economics. ''It was quite an impressive, extemporaneous discussion about how you go about dealing with problems before they get out of hand,'' Mr. Kagan recalled.
Mr. Romney's book, ''No Apology,'' published in March 2010, was a forceful conservative manifesto: an argument for preserving America's military supremacy, free-market economic edge and energy independence. ''He wanted his vision for American to be pretty black and white, which was probably inspired by people calling him a flip-flopper,'' said Kirk Jowers, a family friend.
Mr. Romney had rejected suggestions that he write a tell-all memoir. But delving into his biography even in a cursory way did not come naturally. His book agent, ghost writer and editor urged him to apply his personal experience to his policy prescriptions, which unfurled in sometimes dense passages about ''purchase power parity exchange rates'' and ''dynamic regulation.''
''The constant refrain was, 'This needs more of you,' '' said one person familiar with the process.
In the end, though, he offered only glimpses of himself in the book, which even Mr. Romney's agent acknowledged is not a page turner. (''Not fully revelatory,'' The New York Times said in its review, noting, not unkindly, that it lacked the ''treacly intimate anecdotes meant to reveal the politician's softer side.'')
Mr. Romney excelled, though, in one facet of publishing: marketing. Competitive about sales and delivering his message, he kept tabs on the book of a potential Republican rival, Sarah Palin, whose memoir hit stores a few months before his did, making its debut at No. 1 on The New York Times best-seller list.
His team left little to chance, requiring venues on his book tour to place large orders for ''No Apology.'' By March 2010, it topped the best-seller list, with an asterisk -- bulk orders had most likely skewed its performance.
Constructing a Leader
In December 2008, the phone rang in Mr. Romney's house in Utah. It was the president-elect, Barack Obama.
Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, had just been given a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer. Mr. Obama wished Mrs. Romney a speedy recovery, saying that he and his wife, Michelle, would pray for the family.
''Ann and I have you in our prayers,'' Mr. Romney replied, according to aides to both men.
His warm feelings did not last long. Less than 90 days into the new presidency, Mr. Romney assailed Mr. Obama in an op-ed article, accusing him of ''deepening and lengthening this recession'' and warning that his policies risked ''wiping out the middle class.''
It was the start of a carefully planned period of partisan activity intended to build momentum for a second campaign and cement the perception of him as the Republican establishment's candidate.
Publicly, Mr. Romney was coy about his aspirations, telling those who asked that he would not make any decisions about a run until late 2010. Privately, he prepared for the race, one Iowa breakfast round table, Nevada barbecue and Virginia state party dinner at a time.
The Romney playbook remained unchanged from his days at Harvard, at Bain Capital, at the Olympic Games and the governor's office: He out-hustled those around him. In 2009 alone, he attended 53 events for Republican candidates and causes, made 44 television appearances, gave 11 newspaper interviews and held 8 news conferences, records show.
He kept in close contact with his 2008 campaign staff through e-mails and reunions. And his political action committees employed his four top aides from the first race and made payments to at least three dozen others who would eventually join his 2012 campaign.
Perhaps most crucially, Mr. Romney raised hundreds of thousand of dollars from longtime friends, which he used to saturate state and federal candidates with campaign donations. By setting up a network of political action committees in Alabama, New Hampshire and Iowa, he tiptoed around donation limits to local officials. From 2008 through 2011, he gave nearly $600,000 to more than 200 officials and party organizations in at least 27 states.
Some recipients became Mr. Romney's loudest cheerleaders this year, including Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina ($63,000) and Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa ($30,000).
In New Hampshire, which holds the first Republican primary, the word went out: Republican groups looking for money should reach out to Mr. Romney and his PACs. ''There is nothing better than a check,'' said Donna Sytek, a former speaker of the state's House of Representatives whose portrait was subsidized by Mr. Romney.
''He was nonstop,'' Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee in 2008, said in an interview. He called the aggressive outreach essential to Mr. Romney's success. ''He literally had the whole political establishment behind him in a crucial state,'' he said.
Watching His Bottom Line
In the summer of 2010, over crab salad and barbecue chicken at his house in Wolfeboro, N.H., Mr. Romney told his biggest campaign fund-raisers that the Bank of Romney was closed.
His short-lived 2008 primary race had cost $107 million, a figure widely mocked as excessive and, worst of all for a man who wore his M.B.A. as a badge of honor, a sign of inefficiency.
''He told us he wanted to do more with less,'' recalled Anthony Scaramucci, a New York financier. ''In 2008, he was throwing money around. He knew that was a mistake.''
He made clear that this time around he wanted to rely on donors, not himself. Mr. Romney remained phenomenally well off, earning nearly $500,000 after the last race just from speaking fees and as a director of the Marriott Hotel chain. But it was a time of financial flux for him: after a huge outlay of cash -- he had spent almost $45 million of his own money on his first presidential run, then $12 million on the California beach house -- the stock market crashed in the fall of 2008.
On paper, Mr. Romney lost tens of millions of dollars on investments, according to a person close to him speaking only on condition of anonymity, who described it as a ''huge hit.''
Even during his rare down time, the personal and political became intertwined. Mr. Romney and his wife vacationed in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean with three other wealthy couples, including John Miller, the meatpacking magnate who is one of his biggest donors, and his wife, Victoria, and Mike Leavitt, the former Utah governor who is planning Mr. Romney's transition if he makes it to the White House, and his wife, Jacalyn.
During a January 2010 boating trip in the Caribbean, Mr. Romney requested regular updates on the status of Scott P. Brown's campaign for the Senate from Massachusetts. When Mr. Brown, a Republican, won the seat long held by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Democrat who trounced Mr. Romney in his first political race, Mr. Romney interrupted his vacation to join the victory party.
Last-Minute Jitters
Inside Mr. Romney's living room in La Jolla in December 2010, his top advisers switched on a PowerPoint presentation sketching out a possible 2012 campaign. It included two worrisome names as likely opponents: Ms. Palin and Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor. Darlings of the conservative movement, both posed the same far-right threat that had undone Mr. Romney in 2008.
The Tea Party movement was suddenly ascendant, and Mr. Romney, who had governed as a moderate and championed a state-sponsored health care overhaul in a Democratic state, hardly embodied the angry ethos of the new movement. But his advisers counseled calm. They envisioned a campaign with a single-minded focus on the economy, an issue they believed would transcend intramural Republican squabbling, and took comfort in their record of fund-raising for Tea Party candidates.
They saw a path to victory -- not a resounding win, they cautioned, but a win nonetheless. But Mr. Romney did not share their optimism.
A few weeks later, Mitt, Ann, and their five sons and daughters-in-law convened at the beach house for a quadrennial ritual: a family vote on a presidential run. The decision had been unanimous in 2006, but this time around, the enthusiasm was gone. There was a good chance he might not make it through the primaries, Mr. Romney warned, anticipating scrutiny of his Massachusetts health care plan and his Mormon faith. ''Why go through the process just to lose again?'' he asked, one relative recalled.
The vote was 10 to 2, with only Ann and Tagg favoring a run.
Over the next few months, Mr. Romney told his family three times that he had decided against a race. After all the planning, he had flinched.
In Mr. Romney's retellings of this period, it was his wife who made the most compelling case for running. But she had crucial allies: trusted aides who argued that he was uniquely qualified to run in 2012 and owed it to himself, and the country, to try.
During a conference call in the spring of 2011, they made their final pitch, asking Mr. Romney if he believed, as they did, that he could fix the economy. He said that he did.
There was nothing left to discuss.

HEADLINE: Precise Foreign Policy Intentions Can Be Tough to Gauge

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Bill Clinton said he would crack down on China. George W. Bush said he would stay away from nation building. Barack Obama said he would restore civil liberties in the war on terror and sit down with rogue leaders.
In foreign policy, the relationship between what presidential candidates say on the campaign trail and what they do once elected can be tenuous. If Mitt Romney wins in November, he may be in this respect no different from the men who preceded him, despite his tough talk on China, Iran and Russia.
But if recent presidents have kept more of their predecessor's foreign policy than expected, Mr. Romney may also put his own stamp on international affairs in ways both surprising and not. If his policy prescriptions at this point do not vary radically from Mr. Obama's -- they both want to exit Afghanistan by 2014 -- his outlook and emphasis, and the pressures that will bear on him, may push him in different directions. 
National security surfaced in the Republican presidential campaign on Wednesday in a way that it rarely had so far in this election season. Mr. Romney broke off from the Republican National Convention to fly to Indianapolis, where he told the American Legion that he would stop ''reckless defense cuts'' and said that Mr. Obama ''has failed to lead.'' Senator John McCain and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice later reinforced that message in their speeches to the convention.
The challenge is figuring out when the speeches are just words intended to highlight or even invent differences for political purposes and when they genuinely signal a change in America's relationship with the world. Listening to Mr. Romney and taking note of the advisers around him, it is hard to decide if he is more George Bush the relationship-managing internationalist or George W. Bush the change-the-world evangelist.
As a former governor and businessman, Mr. Romney may not really know himself yet. Though he lived overseas as a young man, he has no real experience on the geopolitical stage. Briefings on the campaign bus between rallies in Iowa cannot fully capture the complexities of the shadow war in Yemen or rising tension in the South China Sea.
Some of Mr. Romney's most provocative language -- calling Russia the nation's pre-eminent foe, promising a virtual trade war with China and rattling sabers for a possible strike on Iran -- seems calculated at least in part to appeal to conservatives eager for a more muscular policy. Mr. Romney will surely feel compelled by his own campaign language to enact tougher policies than Mr. Obama in those areas once in office, and conservatives have made clear they will hold him to his words.
''I take Governor Romney very seriously when he talks about the Obama administration's neglect of allies and turning a blind eye to Russian foreign and domestic policies which undermine our interests and our values,'' said Randy Scheunemann, a former foreign policy adviser to Mr. McCain.
David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state who now heads Freedom House, a democracy advocacy group, said already-chilling relations with Russia, China and Iran might free Mr. Romney to be more assertive without worrying about sacrificing cooperation that no longer seems as apparent.
''In other words, he's less likely to feel less constrained than Obama has been by other considerations,'' Mr. Kramer said, like nuclear negotiations with Iran ''and economic ties with Beijing when it comes to their egregious treatment of their citizens.''
And yet, the pragmatic dealmaker in Mr. Romney may find that even if he does not want to sign a nuclear arms treaty with Moscow as Mr. Obama did, it is useful to be able to move supplies through Russian territory to Afghanistan.
Likewise, Mr. Romney may want trade restrictions on China, but Beijing has been an important creditor for the United States and is a potentially critical partner in containing a nuclear-armed North Korea. And his more hard-line talk about a military option to stop Iran's nuclear program may be useful leverage, even if an actual attack may be unattractive for the same reasons that made George W. Bush never seriously consider it.
''There is a saying: campaign in poetry, govern in prose,'' said Robert S. Litwak of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ''In foreign policy, Mr. Romney's campaign rhetoric to accentuate differences with Mr. Obama would run up against hard strategic and economic realities on a host of issues, from Iran to China.''
The poetry of Mr. Romney's foreign policy pronouncements has been more about the nature of leadership, and this may be where he would strike a difference with Mr. Obama. While he criticizes Mr. Obama for alienating allies, meaning primarily Israel, Mr. Romney also emphasizes the importance of the United States' exerting leadership without letting international criticism get in the way.
''President Obama has allowed our leadership to diminish,'' Mr. Romney told veterans at the American Legion in Indianapolis. ''In dealings with other nations, he has given trust where it's not earned, insult where it's not deserved and apology where it's not due.''
Mr. Obama disputes those assertions, but they reflect the seriously held views of many around Mr. Romney. Mr. Obama's efforts at outreach, whether in his 2009 speech in Cairo or on other occasions, struck many Republicans as soft, and they consider his responses to what they see as gathering threats or crises like Syria to have been too often passive.
The phrase ''leading from behind,'' attributed to an unnamed Obama aide in a New Yorker article but later disavowed by the White House, sums up how Mr. Romney views Mr. Obama's leadership. Even if he pursues similar policies, he promises to do so in a different, more assertive manner.
His surrogates on Wednesday night hammered home that point.
''We cannot be reluctant to lead, and one cannot lead from behind,'' Ms. Rice said.
''We must return to our best traditions of American leadership,'' Mr. McCain said.
There are some areas where it is possible to forecast differences. Mr. Romney would presumably pursue free-trade agreements more vigorously than has Mr. Obama, who modified an agreement with South Korea negotiated by George W. Bush and has pushed to normalize trade ties with Russia but otherwise has initiated no major trade deals.
Military spending also seems an area where Mr. Romney would differ. In Indianapolis, Mr. Romney vowed to stop ''reckless defense cuts'' taking effect at year's end. The nearly $500 billion in cuts over 10 years were mandated by legislation supported last year by lawmakers in both parties, including Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, to force the White House and Congress to develop a deficit reduction plan more palatable to both sides.
These issues may not be decisive in the election, but Mr. Romney's campaign believes it needs to draw distinctions to present the candidate as a plausible commander in chief.
''The No. 1 issue on people's minds is the economy,'' said Kevin Madden, a Romney adviser, ''but national security, leadership abroad, America's place, American power around the globe is part of the course of consideration that many voters go through.''

HEADLINE: As the Republicans Make Their Pitch

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Romney Secures G.O.P. Nomination After Long Quest'' (front page, Aug. 29): Underlying the attacks from Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan, reiterated Tuesday night by Ann Romney and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, is the premise that President Obama has failed the country. Yet this premise is false. 
Given an economy teetering on the brink of another depression, Mr. Obama avoided that imminent collapse: turning job losses to gains, saving the banking and auto industries, halting the foreclosure crisis, presiding over a fully restored stock market. He also signed into law tough regulations that may prevent a similar financial crisis in the future.
Given a nation at war in two countries, Mr. Obama ended one war, put us on the path to ending the other and killed the instigator of the greatest attack on the American mainland in history.
Given a health care system with 50 million uninsured, Mr. Obama put the country on a path toward universal health care coverage.
''Obama has failed the country'' makes for a simple banner, but it is not a true statement. To look for failure, one need only look to Congressional Republicans and their concerted plan to destroy Mr. Obama even if it meant destroying the country.
JOHN E. COLBERT Chicago, Aug. 29, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''Stepping Out of Husband's Shadow, and Perhaps Overshadowing Him'' (The TV Watch, Aug. 29) and ''How the Republicans Built It'' (editorial, Aug. 29):
Ann Romney's attempt to paint Mitt Romney as an Everyman with a heart can't hide the bitter impacts of his rhetoric and actions. It was another smoke and mirrors moment by Mr. Romney and the Republican Party to sell a platform skewed to the wealthy as good for women and the average citizen.
It was especially ironic that Mrs. Romney, able to afford all the health care that money can buy, used her illnesses as examples of the couple's struggles. Her outcomes will most likely be different than those of people with fewer resources, who would be hurt by Mr. Romney's plan to repeal the new health law.
All the convention hoopla couldn't hide the message that floated out from behind it: that the Republicans care little about most of us, while they strive to enhance an already powerful conservative force. For the tired, the poor, the huddled masses, people of color and women, there is no place but the curb in the Romney-Ryan ticket's harsh and gilded world.
NANCY DICKEMAN Seattle, Aug. 29, 2012
To the Editor:
''The Secret Weapon: All of Us,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Aug. 29), made my blood boil. I am a small-business owner and, yes, my clients get to the store on roads built by everyone, and we use public services paid for by everyone.
Yet, none of these workers had to use their houses as collateral and none of them had to worry about paying for the health benefits of their employees, and not everyone is taking advantage of tax loopholes. This unrealistic view of the average business owner by the media drains my spirit.

HEADLINE: Rousing G.O.P., Ryan Faults 'Missing' Leadership

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Jonathan Weisman and Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, whose budget plans have come to define conservative opposition to President Obama's governing philosophy, accepted the Republican vice-presidential nomination on Wednesday as his party embraced the gamble that the small-government principles he represents have more political payoff than peril.
Before an audience of party faithful that he brought to life with his address, Mr. Ryan, 42, sought to turn his relative youth to his advantage, saying he would stand with Mitt Romney in embarking on a generational struggle to protect the very social program -- Medicare -- that Democrats accuse him of trying to dismantle.
''Ladies and gentlemen, our nation needs this debate. We want this debate. We will win this debate,'' Mr. Ryan said to thunderous applause from the Republican National Convention, making it clear that he and Mr. Romney have no intention of backing off in the face of withering Democratic attacks and unease among some Republican Congressional candidates fearful of a backlash from voters. 
The crowd came to hear an indictment of Mr. Obama, and as he gave the highest-profile speech of his career, Mr. Ryan delivered one, fully adopting the vice-presidential nominee's traditional role of leading the charge against the other party. Welcomed to sustained applause of a full minute, he delivered his address with a mix of searing takedowns of Mr. Obama (''a ship trying to sail on yesterday's wind''), a gentle joke about the songs Mr. Romney favors (''which I've heard on the campaign bus and on many hotel elevators''), and appeals to undecided voters to leave behind whatever lingering hopes they had that Mr. Obama could bring the economy back to full strength.
''Ladies and gentlemen, these past four years we have suffered no shortage of words in the White House,'' Mr. Ryan said, drawing a roar of approval. ''What's missing is leadership in the White House.''
Mr. Ryan even at one point appeared to flirt with accusations of socialism as he recounted his own work history, starting with his days as a waiter. ''That's the American dream,'' he said. ''That's freedom, and I'll take it any day over the supervision and sanctimony of the central planners.''
If his vigorous support for shrinking the size and role of government has left the party exposed to withering attacks from Mr. Obama and the Democrats, it did not seem to cause concern. Rather, Mr. Ryan ran headlong into the fire he expects to draw.
Mr. Ryan made it clear that he would portray the Romney-Ryan ticket as protecting Medicare, not ''raiding it,'' as he said Democrats would, saying his own mother's reliance on the program should be proof of his commitment to it.
''A Romney-Ryan administration will protect and strengthen Medicare, for my mom's generation, for my generation, and for my kids and yours,'' he said. ''So our opponents can consider themselves on notice. In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the left isn't going to work. Mitt Romney and I know the difference between protecting a program and raiding it.'' Mr. Ryan's final line -- which included the declaration ''We can make the safety net safe again'' -- brought a cheer resembling something like a last-minute goal in overtime of a championship game.
The night gave the first real answer about what sort of wingman Mr. Ryan will be for Mr. Romney. He showed that he was more than willing to go after Mr. Obama, using a mocking tone often laced with humor.
''College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life,'' he said midway through his speech, eliciting laughter and delighted applause.
But he also showed that he would serve as a steadfast advocate for Mr. Romney, pivoting between the two messages.
''He helped start businesses and turn around failing ones,'' Mr. Ryan said of Mr. Romney. ''By the way, being successful in business -- that's a good thing.''
Mr. Ryan playfully referred to the generational gap between him and Mr. Romney, who watched the speech with his family at a nearby Marriott. But when it came to what the new ticket has cast as the most pressing issue facing the nation, reining in the surging costs of social programs, Mr. Ryan portrayed their approach as a politically brave effort ''to meet serious challenges in a serious way, without excuses and idle words.''
Mr. Romney's aides have said they believe that antipathy for Mr. Obama's health care overhaul has upended the political dynamic of Medicare in way that tilts the presumed advantage away from the Democrats. Mr. Ryan's speech reflected that thinking.
''Obamacare comes to more than two thousand pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees and fines that have no place in a free country,'' he said. ''And the biggest, coldest power play of all in Obamacare came at the expense of the elderly.''
Mr. Ryan was referring to a provision of the health law that cuts more than $700 billion in projected spending from the Medicare program. Mr. Ryan's budget assumes similar reductions, a point Democrats will be certain to continue making in the weeks ahead.
Likewise, Mr. Ryan, whose deep budget-cutting plans drew intense criticism from Mr. Obama long before the Republican ticket was completed, accused the president of failing to act on the recommendations of his own bipartisan debt commission. Mr. Ryan did not mention that he had served on that commission and dissented from its policy proposals, which included specific steps to reduce budget deficits.
But that was of no concern to the audience, whose raucous reception of Mr. Ryan was a resounding affirmation of his popularity with conservatives who have at times shown less enthusiasm for Mr. Romney.
It was Mr. Ryan's first turn on a truly national stage, and in many ways he was a marked contrast to his party's vice-presidential nominee of four years ago, Sarah Palin of Alaska. Mr. Ryan formally took his place on the ticket with a well-established reputation as a policy expert, with years of experience in Washington and with few surprises lurking in his past.
But in other ways he is a bigger risk for Mr. Romney than Ms. Palin was for Senator John McCain in 2008 because he represents a set of substantive policy positions that even his own party shied away from until the last year or two.
Mr. McCain addressed the convention earlier Wednesday and got a somewhat subdued reaction as he declared, ''Our president is not being true to our values,'' adding, ''I trust Mitt Romney to lead us.''
But two hours later, Condoleezza Rice, national security adviser and secretary of state under President George W. Bush, brought the crowd to its feet several times in a rare foray into electoral politics, even reprising Republican accusations that Mr. Obama has failed to project American strength, saying, ''We cannot be reluctant to lead -- and one cannot lead from behind.''
Mr. Bush did not come to the convention, appearing in an emotional video that was part tribute to his father, the 41st president, with whom he reminisced while at the family vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me., and part endorsement of Mr. Romney.
In some respects, though, the party continued to reject the domestic legacy of the Bush years. The younger Mr. Bush has fallen out of favor with the party's fiscally hawkish base, which now views many of his policies as irresponsibly costly.
Mr. Ryan gave a nod to that. ''In a clean break from the Obama years, and frankly from the years before this president, we will keep federal spending at 20 percent of G.D.P., or less,'' he said. ''That is enough.''

HEADLINE: In College Town, Obama Jokes at G.O.P.'s Expense

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Jenna Wortham contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- President Obama on Wednesday provided counterprogramming for a second day to the Republican National Convention, mocking its proceedings and contrasting his agenda with what he called the ''backward'' positions of Mitt Romney.
''Pay a little attention to what's happening in Tampa this week,'' Mr. Obama told a boisterous crowd estimated at 6,500, many of them students at the University of Virginia here. When the audience loudly booed at the reference to the Republicans' gathering, he said: ''Don't boo. Vote!'' 
While aides have said that Mr. Obama has not watched television coverage of the convention, in his speech he called it ''a pretty entertaining show'' with ''wonderful things to say about me.'' Citing a widely debunked Republican television ad claiming that Mr. Obama gutted work requirements for welfare recipients, the president said to laughter and applause, ''Sometimes they just make things up.''
It was a repeat of the playful exchanges Mr. Obama had on Tuesday in similar rallies at college campuses in two other battleground states, Iowa and Colorado, as he campaigned for the support of young voters, a group that was crucial to his 2008 election. But the White House was quick to point out that in between his appearances, the president was receiving updates from federal officials on Hurricane Isaac, he and his advisers mindful especially on the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina of the political perils of seeming insensitive to a natural disaster.
Interrupted a few times by hecklers protesting the war in Afghanistan, Mr. Obama in his speech counted the winding down of that war, the end of the war in Iraq and the killing of Osama bin Laden among his promises kept as he made his case for re-election.
He cited other achievements of his administration, focusing on policies popular with young voters and the Democratic base, and in each case telling his supporters the success was ''because of you'' -- and at odds with Mr. Romney's policy position.
Mr. Obama spoke of a tax credit of up to $10,000 over four years for college tuition; increased tuition grants, made possible by cutting out banks as the government's middlemen; and extension of a cap on interest rates for federal student loans.
''Or you could just take my opponent's advice and just let your parents lend you money,'' Mr. Obama said.
He said administration policies had helped double both the production of renewable energy and the fuel-efficiency standards for cars. ''And by the way, my opponent's against that,'' he said.
Mr. Obama said that Mr. Romney's proposal for a 10-year tax cut of $5 trillion would add to the debt and mostly benefit wealthy taxpayers like him and Mr. Romney. ''He needs it even less than I do,'' the president added.
Some of the biggest applause was in response to Mr. Obama's statements on social issues. Speaking of Mr. Romney, the president said, ''I tell you, on almost any issue he wants to go backward, sometimes to the last century.''
He cited his own support for same-sex marriage, the right of openly gay Americans to serve in the military, abortion rights and contraception policies for women, and protections against deportation for young people brought to the United States as children.
Telling supporters that Mr. Romney has vowed to repeal Obamacare on his first day in office -- Mr. Obama said he had ''affectionately'' adopted the Republicans' term for the health care law -- the president said that by doing so, ''with the stroke of a pen'' Mr. Romney would end insurance coverage for young people who, under the law, are covered until age 26 on their parents' insurance policies.
''I call his plan Romney Doesn't Care,'' Mr. Obama said.
''The law is here to stay,'' he added. ''The Supreme Court has spoken. We're moving forward. That's what's at stake in this election.''
After his speech, the president made a guest appearance on Reddit, the popular Web site, taking questions submitted by site members in a popular format known as Ask Me Anything, or A.M.A.
In advance of the president's arrival on the site, members posted questions including ''Is Internet freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform?'' and ''Who's your favorite basketball player?''
The president answered several questions, including one about his administration's position on Internet rights and one on the importance of space exploration. In response to a question about the most difficult decision he had had to make in office, he wrote a lengthy answer that began: ''The decision to surge our forces in Afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you.''
At one point, a counter on the Reddit A.M.A. site said that there were more than 30,000 people visiting the page. The site seemed to buckle under the load, with many people complaining on Twitter that they were unable to access it.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 5, 2012 

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about President Obama's comments on the Republican convention and his opponent, Mitt Romney, referred imprecisely to the president's responses to user-submitted questions on the Web site Reddit the same day. While the president answered several questions, he answered only one question about Internet rights and only one about space exploration; he did not answer several questions on those two subjects.

HEADLINE: The Slow Reveal on Globalization

BYLINE: CHRYSTIA FREELAND


HIGHLIGHT: In the real and welcome clash of ideas about our economic future, two percussive factors have been often overlooked: globalization and the technology revolution. 

 BODY:
NEW YORK - In my column this week, I complain that the economic debate in the United States - and, for that matter, in Europe, too - is being fought in the 20th century. My point is that today's clash of ideas - which is real, and welcome - is being waged without enough regard for the changed facts on the ground in the 21st century.
Those facts are globalization and the technology revolution. If you agree with me, you may be further enraged by one natural next observation: This political oversight is particularly troubling since the impact of globalization and the technology revolution on the Western middle class is hardly a surprise.
True enough. But if you read the economic literature you just may have a little more sympathy - I know this is hard to accept! - for the politicians. That is because, as my friend Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations has tweeted and then observed at greater length, it wasn't until quite recently that academic economists in the United States admitted that globalization, which Main Street usually describes as outsourcing, was hollowing out middle class jobs in the United States.
There are many possible explanations for this slow reveal. One is that being American inevitably inspires a certain parochialism: It is no accident that one of the first pedigreed economists to make a strong case for the impact of globalization on the middle class was my fellow Canadian, the brilliant Nobel laureate Michael Spence. 
Another reason is that globalization at scale is a relatively new phenomenon. 
A final possibility is that data is sometimes a trailing indicator: We may feel something before the numbers prove it. That idea is a heresy in our quantitative age - but it may still be true.

HEADLINE: East Coast National Parks at Risk From Sea Level's Rise

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: A new report on popular coastal retreats say these areas are some of the most susceptible to the effects of climate change and may look very different, very soon. 

 BODY:
Labor Day is summer's last hurrah, and families from across the country will be flocking to the beach this weekend to soak in some final rays.
Beachgoers on the East Coast making their way to Cape Cod or one of six other National Seashores, however, might want to pause and take an extra look around at the wind-tossed dunes and sloping sands. Not just because summer is coming to an end, but because these areas are some of the most susceptible to the effects of climate change and may look very different, very soon.
There are nearly 300 miles of Atlantic shoreline protected as part of the National Park system. This includes Cape Cod, Fire Island, Assateague Island, Cape Hatteras, Cape Lookout, Cumberland Island and Canaveral. The beaches attract 11 million visitors each year, putting nearly half a billion dollars into local economies.
But a new report from the Natural Resource Defense Council and the Rocky Mountain Climate Organization outlines how these places Americans have pledged to preserve are changing as the planet warms.
One of the biggest threats to the Atlantic National Seashores comes from rising sea levels. The new report includes detailed maps which illustrate how a one-meter rise in sea level - predicted to occur in the next century - would completely submerge the vast majority of land in five of the seven protected coastal areas. Forecasts for stronger storm surges on top of higher sea levels is also bad news for these areas, many of which are fragile barrier islands already prone to erosion.
More directly, projections of temperature increases predict that by century's end, if the beaches are still above water, they may not be places where people can cool off. Cape Hatteras in the summer will be as hot as Galveston, Tex., Assateague Island will feel like Key West, Fla., Canaveral will be as scorching as Desert Rock, Nev.
In the immediate future, just getting to the parks may become much more difficult. Instead of constantly repairing the roads, bridges and parking lots that will be routinely damaged by stronger storms, park officials are considering new options for visitor access. At Assateague, for example, there are plans to abandon the network of bridges and roads altogether, relying instead entirely on ferries for visitor transportation.
"We hope that this report will Illustrate how climate change is affecting and will affect even more in the future, the special places that we know and love," said Stephen Saunders, President of the Rocky Mountain Climate Organization. "This is not just about polar ice caps and polar bears and things that are distant from people's lives. This is about beaches people are taking their families to this Labor Day weekend. We certainly want and hope and expect that this kind of information will get more people interested in protecting the climate and getting their members of Congress involved in taking serious action as well."
Theo Spencer, senior advocate for the Climate and Clean Air Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: "Massive and preventable damage to national seashores is too high a price to pay for failing to act on climate change. This report makes clear that if we don't cut the amount of heat-trapping pollution we spew into the air, these special places that Americans love will never be the same."

HEADLINE: Clinton to Visit China Amid Diplomatic Storms

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: It has been a diplomatically heated summer in the Asia-Pacific region, at times overheated, with tensions between China and Japan particularly stormy. The latest incident came when a man in Beijing tore the Japanese flag off the Tokyo ambassador's limousine. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is due to visit Beijing next week during a six-nation trip. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - As U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton prepared to leave Thursday for a visit to Asia, China's state-run news agency Xinhua published a commentary saying "Washington has resorted to diplomatic, economic and strategic means, which Clinton has dubbed 'smart power,' to create disturbances in the Asia-Pacific region."
The baleful Xinhua piece asserts that Washington "intends to benefit from stirring up disputes among nations" in the region, while cautioning that "history has repeatedly proven that outside intervention in resolving territorial or maritime disputes is doomed to be in tragedy." 
"To be frank," says Wu Liming, the author of the commentary, "U.S. power is declining and it hasn't enough economic strength or resources to dominate the Asia-Pacific region."
Xinhua said Mrs. Clinton would be in China on Saturday and Sunday as part of her six-nation trip across the region. It was not immediately clear which Chinese leaders she would meet. 
Maritime and territorial disputes have been flaring all summer in the region with nations pressing their overlapping claims, inflaming nationalistic passions in the process. Japan, in particular, has found itself at odds with South Korea, Russia and China, as we have recently explored on Rendezvous. 
"The Chinese public has boundless antipathy toward Japan," said a commentary this week in the newspaper Global Times about the Diayou islands, which Japan calls the Senkakus. Global Times is affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party and the party's main paper, People's Daily. 
The story, headlined "Diayou slowly drifting into crosshairs," actually mentions the possibility of "a new war" between China and Japan, saying such a conflict "may well take on an aspect of revenge." Conservative Japanese politicians, the paper correctly says, have been helping to fuel the conflict over the islands, thereby "inviting the participation of the Chinese navy."
"The wise strategy for Japan is to keep the conflict under control," the paper added. "Japan will pay a huge price if it continues."
On Monday in Beijing, a man approached a limousine belonging to the Japanese Embassy and tore the small Japanese flag off the hood of the car. The ambassador, Uichiro Niwa, and his wife were inside. 
It was a potentially incendiary incident, although it did not escalate at the scene. Later, Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba of Japan called it "very regrettable - the national flag shows a country's dignity and it is a principle of international law that you must respect it."
Japan demanded an investigation, and Beijing, offering no details, says it has made an arrest. 
The day after the incident, an editorial in Global Times said, "Even if the man is confirmed as Chinese, it remains unclear if he suffers from some mental condition. Either way, his action is not representative of the Chinese people." 
The paper added: "Competition between China and Japan is akin to a game of chess. The impulse to attack diplomatic cars will be of no help."
An account from the Asahi Shimbun in Japan is here.
In a new blog post, Evan Osnos of The New Yorker deconstructs the flagnapping, the news of which rocketed across China through the helter-skelter of Twitter-like microblogs. A slightly condensed excerpt from Mr. Osnos's post:
There is some debate about whether the limo was blocked in a coördinated effort by two cars, or if it was simply stopped by traffic. The distinction only matters because it could contain a hint of whether this was a crime of passion or premeditation - an opportunistic move by an overzealous patriot, or something closer to the first physical manifestation of an ugly period in Sino-Japanese relations.
The flag kerfuffle begins to look like a precursor to something far more significant. Imagine, for a moment, if a jumpy security guard had regarded the approaching figure as a threat and responded with serious force? We could have had a Japanese-embassy security guard wounding a Chinese nationalist on the streets of Beijing, recorded and shared by every phone in sight. 
Or imagine that instead that the scenario had unfolded in reverse, on the streets of Tokyo, with the Chinese ambassador's car assaulted by a Japanese nationalist. How would that have sounded on Chinese state television - especially when repeated a few hundred million times over?
Mr. Osnos suggest that the flag incident might serve as a storm flag for both countries, and notes that "under slightly different circumstances, the United States might well find itself in the equivalent of a limo-flag situation."
In addition to China, Mrs. Clinton's trip will include stops in the Cook Islands, Indonesia, East Timor, Brunei and Russia. Her Beijing agenda was not immediately clear beyond what the State Department called "our efforts to build a cooperative partnership." 
Flags and islands would seem to be worthy topics.

HEADLINE: Aug. 29: So Much Depends Upon Ohio

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Among the surveys that came out on Wednesday, one in Ohio had encouraging news for Barack Obama, and another, in Nevada, was slightly favorable for Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
Polls that are published during the party conventions can be anticlimactic, representing old news since they won't fully reflect the effects of the convention bounce. And none of the surveys that came out on Wednesday were that newsworthy to begin with - although there was one, in Ohio, that had encouraging news for Barack Obama, and another, in Nevada, that was slightly favorable for Mitt Romney.
The Ohio survey was conducted by the automated-polling firm Gravis Marketing, which had Mr. Obama ahead of Mr. Romney by less than 1 full percentage point. 
A one-point lead isn't much, and Mr. Obama has gotten some better numbers than that in Ohio. So why does this qualify as good news for him? Because this firm has had Republican-leaning results in the other states that it has polled, putting Mr. Romney up by 2 points in Florida, 1 point in Colorado and 17 points in Missouri, making it several points more Republican-leaning than the consensus of surveys in those states. Once the model adjusts for the firm's "house effect," it treats Mr. Obama's nominal 1-point lead as being the equivalent of a 4- or 5-point lead instead. Thus, Mr. Obama's chances of winning Ohio rose somewhat based on the survey.
The broader point is simply that Ohio is so important to the electoral calculus that it's good news for a candidate when a polling firm shows him doing relatively well there compared with the other states that it polls. Ohio has a 30 percent chance of being the tipping-point state, meaning that it would cast the decisive votes in the Electoral College. That's as much as the next two states on the list, Florida and Virginia, combined. It's also as much as Colorado, Nevada, Iowa, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Michigan and North Carolina combined. 
All of these states are competitive. But really, they exist along a continuum of electoral power rather than falling into binary categories of "important" and "unimportant." Ohio is at the extreme end of that continuum.
The reason our tipping-point calculus rates Ohio so highly is because it would usually suffice to provide Mr. Obama with a winning map, even if he lost many of those other states. If you give Ohio to Mr. Obama, plus all the states where the forecast model now estimates that he has at least 75 percent chance of winning, he's up to 265 electoral votes. That means he could win any one of Colorado, Virginia, Iowa, Wisconsin, Florida or North Carolina to put him over the top. 
Mr. Romney is fortunate in this sense to have put Wisconsin squarely into play with his selection of Paul D. Ryan as his running mate; it gives him a few more ways to win without Ohio, although it would still be a daunting task.
...But Don't Forget Nevada
Another state that could be critical to an Ohio-less winning path for Mr. Romney is Nevada. I did not mention it in the list above since the model gives Mr. Obama exactly a 75 percent chance of winning there. But Mr. Romney's numbers have been a bit better in Nevada lately, including in a Public Policy Polling survey, released on Wednesday, that put him behind Mr. Obama by 3 points there. 
Obviously, Mr. Romney would prefer to be ahead in Nevada than behind by any margin. But that is a better result for him than the previous Public Policy Polling survey of Nevada, which put him down by 6 points instead. The firm's surveys are also somewhat Democratic-leaning, although they have been moving closer to the consensus recently.
The pessimistic case for Mr. Romney in Nevada is that the polling spread has been narrow there compared with other states. In the 12 Nevada surveys in our database, Mr. Obama has never trailed - but nor has he led in any survey by more than 8 points. A tighter spread in the polls makes a smaller lead more robust, as does the fact that there are very few undecided voters in the Nevada polls.
Still, Nevada is a state that has produced some poor polling in the past, and between a potentially strong Mormon turnout and the state's dilapidated economy, Mr. Romney has some angles to work there.

HEADLINE: Why Are the Big Banks Suddenly Afraid?

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Across the political spectrum, more voices are calling for limits on banks' size, and no persuasive evidence demonstrates that this would be a bad thing, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Top executives from global megabanks are usually very careful about how they defend both the continued existence, at current scale, of their organizations and the implicit subsidies they receive. They are willing to appear on television shows - and did so earlier this summer, pushing back against Sanford I. Weill, the former chief executive of Citigroup, after he said big banks should be broken up.
Typically, however, since the financial crisis of 2008 the heavyweights of the banking industry have stayed relatively silent on the key issue of whether there should be a hard cap on bank size.
This pattern has shifted in recent weeks, with moves on at least three fronts.
William B. Harrison Jr., the former chairman of JPMorgan Chase, was the first to stick out his neck, with an Op-Ed published in The New York Times. The Financial Services Roundtable has circulated two related e-mails "Myth: Some U.S. banks are too big" and "Myth: Breaking up banks is the only way to deal with 'Too Big To Fail'" (these links are to versions on the Web site of Partnership for a Secure Financial Future, a group that also includes the Consumer Bankers Association, the Mortgage Bankers Association and the Financial Services Institute).

Now Wayne Abernathy, executive vice president of the American Bankers Association, is weighing in - with a commentary on the American Banker Web site.
These views notwithstanding, mainstream Republican opinion is starting to shift against the megabanks, as former Treasury secretary Nicholas Brady makes clear in a strong opinion piece published in The Financial Times.
Mr. Brady was Treasury secretary under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and to the best of my knowledge, no one has ever accused him of being any kind of leftist.
Yet Mr. Brady's thinking in his Financial Times commentary is strikingly similar to the reasoning that motivated the Brown-Kaufman amendment (supported by 30 Democrats and three Republicans) in 2010, which would have put a hard cap on the size and leverage of our largest banks, i.e., how much an individual institution could borrow relative to the size of the economy. (See this analysis by Jeff Connaughton, who was chief of staff to Senator Ted Kaufman; Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, is still pushing hard on this same approach.)
Mr. Brady also stresses that we should make our regulations simpler, not more complex. Senator Kaufman made the same point repeatedly - and capping leverage per bank (Mr. Brady's preferred approach) would be one way to do this.
Mr. Brady is not alone on the Republican side of the political spectrum. A growing number of serious-minded politicians are starting to support the point made by Jon Huntsman, the former governor of Utah and a Republican presidential candidate in the recent primaries: global megabanks have become government-sponsored enterprises; their scale does not result from any kind of market process, but is rather the result of a vast state subsidy scheme.
As Paul Singer, a hedge fund manager and influential Republican donor, says of the big banks, "Private reward and public risk is not what conservatives should want."
A second problem for the bankers is that their arguments defending big banks are very weak.
As I made clear in a point-by-point rebuttal of Mr. Harrison's Op-Ed commentary, his defense of the big banks is not based on any evidence. He primarily makes assertions about economies of scale in banking, but no one can find such efficiency enhancements for banks with more than $100 billion in total assets - and our largest banks have balance sheets, properly measured, that approach $4 trillion.
Similarly, the Financial Services Roundtable e-mail on "Some U.S. banks are too big" is based on a non sequitur. It points out that United States trade has grown significantly since 1992, and it infers that, as a result, the size of our largest banks should also grow.
But the dynamism of the American economy and its international trade after World War II was not accompanied by striking increases in the size of individual banks, and our largest banks did not then increase relative to the size of the economy, in sharp contrast to what happened since the early 1990s.
In 1995, the largest six banks in the United States had combined assets of around 15 percent of gross domestic product; they are now over 60 percent of G.D.P., bigger than they were before the crisis of 2008.
The Financial Services Roundtable is right to point out that banks in some other Group of 7 countries are larger relative to those economies. But which of these countries would you really like to emulate today: France, Italy or Britain?
The Financial Services Roundtable also asserts, in its other e-mail, that the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation and the Basel III new capital requirements have made the banking system safer. That may be true, although the evidence it presents is just about cyclical adjustment; after any big financial crisis, banks are careful about funding themselves with more equity (a synonym for capital in this context) and holding more liquid assets.
The structure of incentives in the industry hardly seems to have changed, as witnessed, for example, by the excessive risk-taking and consequent large trading losses at JPMorgan Chase recently.
We need a system with multiple fail-safes, and making the largest banks smaller and less leveraged would achieve precisely that goal.
Mr. Abernathy's article takes a much more extreme position. He contends that banks are already unduly constrained - by Dodd-Frank and Basel III - and this is holding back economic growth.
Mr. Abernathy goes so far as to say that if the banks were to raise $60 billion in additional equity capital, this "holds back $600 billion of economic activity." In other words, strengthening the equity funding of banking would cause an economic contraction on the order of 4 percent of G.D.P.
Such assertions are far-fetched, not based on any facts and have been completely discredited (see the work of Anat Admati and her colleagues on exactly this point). Mr. Abernathy was assistant secretary for financial institutions under George W. Bush. If he has any evidence to support his positions - a study, a working paper, a book? - he should put it on the table now.
To make such assertions without substantiation is irresponsible. (A document from a lobbying organization would not count for much, in my view, but let's see if he has even that.)
The big banks and their friends should be afraid. Serious people on the right and on the left are reassessing if we really need our largest banks to be so large and so highly leveraged (i.e., with so much debt relative to their equity). The arguments in favor of keeping the global megabanks and allowing them to grow are very weak or nonexistent. The arguments in favor of further strengthening the equity funding for banks grow stronger - see the recent letter by Senators Sherrod Brown and David Vitter, which I wrote about recently.
The views of sensible people like Secretary Brady, Senator Kaufman, Governor Huntsman and Senator Brown are spreading across the political spectrum.

HEADLINE: European Conservatives Steer Clear of Romney

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: In terms of votes, it doesn't matter what Europeans think of Mitt Romney and his Europe-bashing jibes. But will the campaign rhetoric affect future relations, if the Republican candidate makes it to the White House? 

 BODY:
LONDON - It is just as well for Mitt Romney that Europeans don't have a vote in November's presidential election.
Europe-bashing by the Republican candidate may go down well on the campaign trail and on the convention floor in Tampa. But the barbs he has been flinging at the old Continent are beginning to pall among Europeans, even those who should be his party's natural allies.
France's Paris Match magazine noted this week that members of the French right were staying away from the Florida convention and put their absence down to an "ideological break" with the Republicans.
The magazine's Adrien Gaboulaud said Mr. Romney's rhetoric on Europe had not helped.
Mr. Romney has been portraying Barack Obama as a Europeanizer since his victory speech at the New Hampshire primary in January at which he said of the president:
"He wants to turn America into a European-style entitlement society. We want to ensure that we remain a free and prosperous land of opportunity. This president takes his inspiration from the capitals of Europe; we look to the cities and small towns of America."
Axel Poniatowski, a legislator from France's right-of-center U.M.P. - the party created by Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president - told Paris Match: "The values of the American right and the French right have diverged considerably in the past 15 years."
Pierre Lellouche, a fellow U.M.P. conservative, said: "The Tea party is frankly ."
Relations are not much warmer with conservatives in Britain, historically the most Atlanticist of European states. David Cameron, the Conservative prime minister, appeared to strike up a close rapport with Mr. Obama during a trip to the United States in March. 
A subsequent visit to London by Mr. Romney was notable for the candidate's negative comments about Britain's preparations for the Olympic Games, which earned him a put-down from Mr. Cameron and a roasting from even the right-wing press.
Europe-bashing may be a clever campaign tactic in as far as it seeks to link Mr. Obama to European welfare and fiscal policies that many blame for the Continent's financial ills. But will it affect future relations in the longer term, if Mr. Romney reaches the White House?
Commenting before the Republican convention, Bruce Stokes of the Pew Research Center wrote that the success or failure of a president's foreign policy might depend on how it was perceived abroad. 
"So what people around the world think going into the final two months of the U.S. presidential campaign does matter, if not on November 6, then for the next four years," according to Mr. Stokes in an article for CNN.
Quoting from Pew's latest Global Attitudes project, he said: "Europeans have had a four-year love affair with Barack Obama: 87 percent of Germans, 86 percent of French and 80 percent of the British have confidence in Obama higher than public confidence in their own national leader. 
"And 92 percent of the French, 89 percent of the Germans and 73 percent of the British want Obama reelected."
Mr. Stokes did not think it mattered in the long run as Europe would soon get to know Mr. Romney as president.
There are indications from Europe, however, that concerns run deeper. My colleague Judy Dempsey quoted a high-ranking European diplomat in July as telling her: "Romney in the White House would be bad news for Europe." 
Judy explained that Europeans support the Democrats mostly for cultural and historical reasons. "The Democrats are mostly secular in outlook and believe the state has much more of a role to play in providing some basic services than the Republicans," she wrote.
Perceptions of the Republicans slid during the presidency of George W. Bush, largely because of widespread European opposition to the war in Iraq, particularly in Germany and France. That opposition led Donald Rumsfeld, then U.S. defense secretary, to refer to these countries as "Old Europe."
A research paper prepared on behalf of a British government agency noted that Mr. Obama's election in 2008 had strengthened relations between the European Union and the United States in a number of areas.
The paper, by the Outsights-Ipsos MORI Partnership, gave a positive prognosis for a resurgence of pro-Atlanticism within the Union.
But that overall outlook was tempered by a number of inhibiting factors. These included differing views on issues like defense and climate change, as well as the "popularity of the 'Tea party' movement in the US and subsequent corresponding election results."

Barclays Names C.E.O. Amid Tumult | Barclays has appointed Antony Jenkins, head of the retail and business banking unit, to be its new chief executive, as the British bank deals with fallout from an interest-rate manipulation scandal and other legal issues.
Mr. Jenkins, who will take over immediately, steps into the top spot during a period of uncertainty for the bank.
Along with the rate-rigging scandal, the bank faces questions about its capital-raising efforts in 2008. On Wednesday, Barclays disclosed that the Serious Fraud Office was looking into payments related to agreements between the bank and Qatar Holdings, an investigation that follows a similar inquiry by the Financial Services Authority.
"We have an obligation to all of those stakeholders - customers, clients, shareholders, colleagues and broader society - and a unique opportunity to restore Barclays' reputation by making it the 'go to' bank in all of our chosen markets," Mr. Jenkins said in a statement. DealBook »

HEADLINE: Fact-Checking Ryan's Convention Speech

BYLINE: MICHAEL COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: A closer look at Representative Paul D. Ryan's speech at the Republican National Convention. 

 BODY:
1:41 p.m. | Updated 
 When Representative Paul D. Ryan fired up the party faithful with his speech Wednesday night at the Republican National Convention, he made several statements that were incorrect, incomplete or incompatible with his own record in Congress. 
 Mr. Ryan chided President Obama for dismissing the recommendations of a deficit-reduction commission that Mr. Ryan served on and whose plans he opposed, and for seeking Medicare cuts that he too once sought. He seemed to criticize the president for the closing of an auto plant in his hometown, Janesville, Wis., even though General Motors made the decision to shut the plant down in 2008, before Mr. Obama was elected. And he made misleading statements on a number of issues, including the president's health care law and Mitt Romney's record in Massachusetts.
"The people of Wisconsin, like so many Americans, are still waiting for the president's imaginary recovery," said a spokesman for Mr. Ryan, Brendan Buck. 
Mr. Obama did bail out the auto industry, and included money in the stimulus for "green" energy products, but the Janesville plant did not benefit.
 One of Mr. Ryan's most pointed attacks on Mr. Obama was on the deficit. "He created a new bipartisan debt commission,'' Mr. Ryan noted. "They came back with an urgent report. He thanks them, sent them on their way, and then did exactly nothing."
 Left unsaid: Mr. Ryan served on that debt commission, and his opposition to its final proposals helped to seal its fate. The commission, known as the Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction commission, made a number of recommendations that Mr. Ryan ultimately opposed on the grounds that they would have raised some taxes and failed to cut enough from health programs. His dismissal of the plan was seen as an important blow to its chances of success, since it soured other House Republicans on it.
In his critique of the president's fiscal stewardship, Mr. Ryan said: "It began with a perfect AAA credit rating for the United States. It ends with the downgraded America."
When Standard & Poor's lowered the nation's credit rating, it was in large part because of the standoff last year over raising the debt ceiling - which had to be raised to pay for spending Congress had already approved. The White House had asked Congress to simply raise the debt ceiling; Mr. Ryan and House Republicans balked at doing so without a deal on significant spending cuts, leading to a prolonged standoff that took the nation to the brink of default.
In its statement explaining the downgrade, Standard & Poor's wrote that "the political brinksmanship of recent months highlights what we see as America's governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed. The statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy."
 Mr. Ryan spoke out forcefully Wednesday night against the "$716 billion funneled out of Medicare by President Obama" without noting that his own past budget plans had counted on the same savings, and pledged to protect Medicare without explaining how the Romney-Ryan plan would change it. 
The Medicare debate is shaping up as central to the election: Democrats say that the Romney-Ryan plan to reshape Medicare would force future beneficiaries to pay more for their health care, while Republicans fault Mr. Obama for the $716 billion cut in future growth. 
Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney have proposed limiting the government's current open-ended financial commitment to Medicare. Under their plan, the government would contribute a fixed amount of money on behalf of each beneficiary, and future beneficiaries could use that money to buy private insurance or to help pay for coverage under the traditional Medicare program. It would apply only to people under 55. 
Mr. Ryan's earlier budget plans called for capping the rate at which Medicare spending would grow - which analysts from groups including the Kaiser Family Foundation have said would lead to higher out of pocket costs for future beneficiaries. The Romney campaign now says that its plan would work differently from Mr. Ryan's original plan, and that it would have the flexibility to raise the proposed cap on spending if it does not keep up with costs.
The $716 billion cut to Medicare that President Obama made would reduce payments to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and many other health care providers. 
 And Mr. Ryan's remarks about the auto plant in Janesville ricocheted around the Internet almost as soon as he uttered them.
 He appeared to fault Mr. Obama for the closing of the plant - a decision made before Mr. Obama was elected, and before his bailout of the auto industry, which was credited with saving a number of other auto plants. He noted in his speech that Mr. Obama had visited the plant in 2008 and told people that "I believe that if our government is there to support you, this plant will be here for another hundred years."
"Well, as it turned out," Mr. Ryan said, "that plant didn't last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day."
 As a candidate, Mr. Obama spoke at the Janesville plant in February 2008, a day after General Motors had posted a $38 billion loss. He on economic policy. By that October - a month before the election - General Motors had already made plans to begin closing the Janesville plant because of the steep falloff in the sale of sport utility vehicles.
An article in The New York Times that October said: "On Oct. 13, G.M. announced that its 90-year-old plant there, the company's oldest factory in the United States, would build its last S.U.V. just before the Christmas holidays." It took some time for the plant to shut down, and some work continuedthere into Mr. Obama's term in office. But the decision to close the plant had been made earlier - as can be seen by this June 2008 letter from Mr. Ryan urging G.M. to reconsider.
The Ryan campaign said Thursday that the issue was not when the plant stopped production, but the fact that it has not restarted - and pointed to accounts of an Obama campaign statement from the fall of 2008 in which he said, "I will lead an effort to retool plants like the G.M. facility in Janesville so we can build the fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow and create good-paying jobs in Wisconsin and all across America."
 There were other areas in which Mr. Ryan made incomplete or misleading statements. 
 "What did taxpayers get out of the Obama stimulus?" he asked. "More debt." Left unmentioned: the fact that roughly a third of the stimulus came in the form of tax cuts.
 Mr. Ryan referred to "government-controlled health care," though the new health care law relies heavily on private insurance, did not nationalize the health care system as other countries have done, and did not ultimately include the "public option" that many Democrats had wanted. 
 And when he spoke of Mr. Romney's record as the governor of Massachusetts, he said: "He was the Republican governor of a state where almost 9 in 10 legislators are Democrats and yet he balanced the budget without raising taxes." Mr. Romney did raise more revenue to balance those budgets, though: as governor he closed a number of tax loopholes in ways requiring business to pay hundreds of millions of dollars more in taxes.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Platform Seeks to Weaken Powers of Unions

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican platform takes rhetorical aim at collective bargaining while calling for the nationwide adoption of a Right-to-Work law. 

 BODY:
Unlike in the past, this year's Republican platform in Tampa, Fla., does not contain any sympathetic nods to the nation's labor unions, which have become among the Republicans' most formidable political foes. Instead, the platform calls for numerous steps that could significantly weaken America's labor unions - public-sector and private-sector ones - and help speed organized labor's overall decline.
The 2012 platform urges elected officials across the country to change their laws regarding public-sector unions and follow the lead of Wisconsin's governor, Scott Walker, who spearheaded an effort to curb the ability of his state's public employees to bargain collectively. The platform states, "We salute Republican governors and state legislators who have saved their states from fiscal disaster by reforming their laws governing public employee unions." Mr. Walker said that that legislation was needed to weaken overly powerful unions and balance Wisconsin's budget, while labor leaders said the legislation aimed to destroy public-sector unions and cripple them politically. 
The platform - saying it would promote "greater economic liberty" - calls for enacting a nationwide "right-to-work" law. Such a law would prohibit union contracts at private-sector workplaces from requiring employees to pay any dues or other fees to a union. In states without such laws, workers at unionized workplaces generally have to pay such dues or fees. Right-to-work laws exist in 23 states, and labor leaders say these laws undermine unions' strength by reducing the flow of dues money. 
The platform said a Republican president would protect public employees by proposing legislation to bar mandatory members' dues for political purposes. Such a move would likely weaken government employees' unions politically by prohibiting them from using any dues money for politics unless the member first gives individual authorization for his dues money to be used for political campaigns or legislative work. 
In a move that would further deplete the coffers of public-sector unions, the platform says "no government at any level should act as the dues collector for unions." Nowadays many states, counties and cities do public-sector unions a big favor by collecting members' dues through a deduction from workers' paychecks. This proposal would force unions to make individual arrangements with each worker to collect dues. 
The Republican platform also calls for barring the use of "card check" anywhere in the United States as a way for workers to unionize. Ever since the 1930s, the National Labor Relations Board has allowed, but not required, employers to grant union recognition once a majority of workers sign cards saying they want to to join a union. 
Nowadays, unions often pressure employers to grant recognition through card check, and President Obama and Democrats in Congress supported, but failed to enact a law that would have given unions the right to insist on using card check, instead of a traditional secret ballot vote, to gain recognition. Employer groups argue that card check is far less trustworthy than secret ballot elections, asserting that union organizers pressure workers to sign pro-union cards. But labor leaders complain that election campaigns often turn into an unfair exercise in which companies intimidate workers and have far greater access and ability to persuade workers than the union has. Specifically, the platform calls for enacting a "Secret Ballot Protection Act."
The platform calls for repealing the Davis-Bacon Act, a law that Congress passed in 1931 requiring that all federal construction projects pay a prevailing wage, usually equal to or not far below union wage levels. The platform says this law "costs the taxpayers billions of dollars annually in artificially high wages on government projects."
The platform attacks the Obama administration, saying it has clung "to antiquated notions of confrontation and concentrating power in the Washington offices of union elites." The platform also attacks the National Labor Relations Board, saying that under President Obama the board has become "a partisan advocate for Big Labor, using threats and coercion outside the law to attack business."
In a move that teacher unions will no doubt oppose, the platform calls for getting rid of teacher tenure. It states, "Rigid tenure systems based on the 'last in-first-out' policy should be replaced with a merit-based approach that can attract fresh talent and dedication in the classroom."
Labor leaders, convinced and fearing that Republicans are intent on weakening the nation's unions, have vowed to mount their biggest political effort ever this year to help re-elect President Obama. On its Web site, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the nation's main labor federation, condemns the Romney-Ryan ticket and vision, saying it "may be the dream of the extreme right, Tea Party Republican base and the wealthy, corporate financiers fueling the Romney campaign, but it is a nightmare for America's working families."

HIGHLIGHT: Sergio Marchionne, the chief of Chrysler and Fiat, said the new CAFE standards would make big Hemi V-8 engines as "rare as white flies." 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler and Fiat, told The Detroit Free Press that the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards announced by the Obama administration on Tuesday would make big V-8 engines as "rare as white flies." Chrysler's supercharged Hemi V-8 power plants are found in the 300, Dodge Charger, Challenger and Durango, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram pickups. The standards mandate corporate fleet fuel-economy averages of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. (The Detroit Free Press)
 Having sustained multiple injuries during a qualifying-run crash before the Indianapolis MotoGP, a race in which he ultimately finished in fourth place, Casey Stoner underwent surgery on Thursday to repair a broken ankle. Stoner, who announced in May that he would retire at the end of the season, said he was optimistic that he would rejoin the tour in October. He is ranked third over all in 2012, behind Dani Pedrosa and Jorge Lorenzo, respectively. (BBC)
 The 2013 Volvo V40 hatchback earned the highest overall safety score ever issued by Euro NCAP, the foremost vehicle safety testing organization in Europe. The hatchback, which is not sold in the United States, also set a record high score for adult protection, one of four categories in which passenger vehicles are issued test scores. (Volvo, via Car magazine)
 On Wednesday night, in his speech accepting the Republican nomination for vice president at the Republican National Convention, Representative Paul D. Ryan suggested that President Obama had a role in the shuttering of a plant operated by General Motors in Mr. Ryan's hometown of Janesville, Wis. As our colleagues at The Caucus noted, however, the plant built its last vehicle in December 2008, before Mr. Obama's inauguration. (The Caucus)

HEADLINE: In Tampa, the Obama Campaign Has Its Own War Room

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Welcome to the Obama campaign's mobile war room, a 30-person pop-up shop in a storefront one block beyond the security perimeter of convention. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. - The awning over the door says "American Institute of Architects."
But inside the message on a lectern and a backdrop reads "Romney Economics: Wrong for the Middle Class."
Welcome to the Obama campaign's mobile war room, a 30-person pop-up shop in a storefront one block beyond the security perimeter of the Tampa Bay Times Forum, where the Republican National Convention is being held, and dedicated to pushing back against the hurricane-strength messaging of the Republicans.
"There are now 70 days left until the election, and we're not going to cede any one of them," said Stephanie Cutter, the president's deputy campaign manager, who has relocated to Tampa from Chicago along with Ben LaBolt, the campaign press secretary, and a rapid-response team. As Republican luminaries command the attention of millions in prime time, the war room wages its guerrilla counteroffensive, dumping into reporters' e-mail in-boxes messages like "FACT CHECK: Factory Closing Ryan Cited Happened Under President Bush."
And on Thursday morning, the folding tables were cleared away, and the cramped storefront turned over to a news conference to try to dismantle Representative Paul D. Ryan's convention-rocking speech accepting the vice-presidential nomination the night before.
Mr. Ryan was hypocritical for criticizing Mr. Obama for doing "exactly nothing" when a debt reduction panel he appointed "came back with an urgent report," said Senator Richard J. Durbin, a co-chairman of the president's campaign.
Mr. Durbin sat with Mr. Ryan on the bipartisan panel, the Simpson-Bowles committee, whose final report Mr. Ryan and the other House Republicans rejected because it included tax increases along with spending cuts.
"So they can stand there with their deficit clock ticking in the background," Mr. Durbin said, referring to a convention-hall prop, "but they've got to explain why their candidate for vice president voted against President Obama's deficit reduction plan," and "now criticizes the president for it."
Mr. Ryan said at the time he voted against the plan because it relied too much on tax increases and didn't address what he considered the key driver of the deficit, the growth of health care entitlements. He worked with Alice Rivlin, a Clinton administration official, to include a voucherlike reform of Medicare, but the plan was voted down.
Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, who serves on the budget committee with Mr. Ryan, said his image as "Mr. Fiscal Responsibility" omits the fact "he voted for every single policy proposal by President Bush that exploded our deficit," including expanding Medicare drug benefits, tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. "To suggest that Paul Ryan is fiscally responsible," she said, "is ludicrous."
A spokesman for Mr. Ryan said the attacks were trying to shift the focus from Mr. Obama's record on the economy. 
"Instead of admitting that his policies have led to record unemployment, debt that puts our economy at risk and programs that have grown government at the expense of the private sector, President Obama continues to double down on the same false attacks and policies that have done nothing to fix our economy," the spokesman, Brendan Buck, said in a statement.
Looking to Mitt Romney's acceptance speech Thursday evening, the war room flew in a former Democratic mayor of North Adams, Mass., John Barrett. With about 30 reporters in the room, he castigated Mr. Romney's one term as governor. Mr. Romney's claim not to have raised taxes while balancing budgets omits that he raised $700 million in fees, Mr. Barrett said, while cutting state aid to cities that led to higher property taxes to pay for schools and public safety.
"School districts were forced to charge fees for everything from sports programs to riding the bus," Mr. Barrett said. "If you looked at the record, you'd know this guy is a fake."
Ms. Cutter said the Democrats' real response to the Republican convention would come next week in North Carolina, when the president is renominated with, his campaign hopes, the same gale-force blast of publicity for his message.

HEADLINE: Speech, Lies and Apathy

BYLINE: JASON STANLEY


HIGHLIGHT: Blatant falsehoods like those of the Romney-Ryan campaign are only possible because Americans no longer expect to hear the truth. 

 BODY:
We are all familiar with the "fact checkers" of the presidential campaign. Proud to be part of the fourth estate, these well-intentioned wonks uncover and unpack the various claims made by candidates, determining their veracity. But what if these efforts are in vain? And what if the campaigns themselves are not to be blamed? Is it possible that we are all culprits perpetuating this culture of "truthiness" on the political stage?
In previous columns for The Stone, I argued that the public's trust in public speech, whether by politicians or in the media, has disintegrated, and to such a degree that it has undermined the possibility of straightforward communication in the public sphere. The expectation is that any statement made either by a politician or by a media outlet is a false ideological distortion. As a result, no one blames politicians for making false statements or statements that obviously contradict that politician's beliefs. I believe that the unfolding presidential campaign provides a compelling demonstration of my previous claims.
Consider Paul Ryan's speech at the Republican National Convention last night. Ryan took President Obama to task for allegedly having "funneled out of Medicare" $716 billion dollars. It is simple for anyone with a computer to discover that the claim is problematic. As PolitiFact explains, the health care law involves anticipated reductions in future increases to private insurers. The distinction between "funneling money out" of a program and reducing expected future increases in payments to private insurance companies is subtle. However, the reason that Ryan's claim is decidedly odd is that his own budget plans included similar anticipated savings from Medicare. Furthermore, every one of the thousands of people cheering that line, as well as the millions watching, knew perfectly well that Ryan has made his career by arguing for funneling large amounts of money out of Medicare. Since Ryan's charge so manifestly contradicts his own beliefs, it is clear that the campaign assumes the thesis for which I have been arguing - that Americans no longer expect or care about candidates making honest assertions in the public sphere. They no longer expect consistency and honesty from politicians, and the savvy political campaigner recognizes that there is no cost to making statements that contradict even their most well-known beliefs.
Another argument for the thesis can be found in the Romney campaign's recent attacks on Obama's handling of welfare. These attacks have been much discussed, but it is worthwhile to look at the campaign strategy in detail to see how good campaign strategists exploit this relatively novel political environment.
Romney has broadcast advertisements that accuse the president of attempting to weaken the work requirements on welfare. The Romney campaign's strategy makes no sense as part of an overall case emphasizing the economic failings of the current administration. Emphasizing the weakening of work on welfare at least suggests that unemployment is the fault of the individual, rather than the administration's failed economic policies. At minimum, it is irrelevant to any claim about the president's job creation policies. Moreover, it is simple to discover that the charges are false.
As Glenn Kessler, the fact checker for The Washington Post, has explained, the Department of Health and Human Services is considering "issuing waivers to states concerning worker participation targets." Among the governors requesting waivers were two Republicans, including the Republican governor of Utah. No waiver has yet been granted, and such waivers come with demanding conditions. Why elevate an obscure issue that has as much to do with state's rights as it does with anything else to a centerpiece of a campaign that is supposedly focused on the weak economic record of the president, especially when the theme could even be construed as suggesting that the president has been in job creation?
An assertion is an attempt to transfer one's knowledge to one's audience. It is clearly not true that Obama is seeking to undermine work requirements on welfare. Everyone either knows that it's not true or can easily find it out by reading what independent fact checkers have said in easily available articles on the Internet. Furthermore, the Romney campaign knows this. So the Romney campaign is not intending to make an assertion. Given this, it's unfair to accuse the campaign of . As I have argued before, it may not be to assert or lie anymore in a presidential campaign. The trust required to support the existence of such speech acts is absent. The blatant falsehoods in Romney's campaign are possible only under conditions in which the target audience will not hold Romney accountable for false statements. Since the intended audience is not expected to believe the falsehoods, there is some other function of the Romney campaign's ad.
The purpose of Romney's ad campaign is to win over white working class voters, by connecting with what his campaign perceives as their values. That much is uncontroversial. How does the expression of obvious falsehoods about Obama and welfare manage to communicate to working class white voters that Romney shares their values? And which values does the Romney campaign thereby impute to working class white voters?
The available social science seems to support Thomas Edsall's recent analysis that white working class voters have at least in the past been motivated to go to the polls when race is made an issue via invocation of welfare. For example, for the 1991 National Race and Politics survey, conducted by the Survey Research Center at the University of California at Berkeley, the median response to the question "What percentage of all the poor people in America would you say are black?" the median response was 50 percent (the actual rate at the time was 29 percent). Subsequent studies found similar misperceptions. In his 1996 paper "Race and Poverty in America: Public Misperceptions and the American News Media," the Princeton political scientist Martin Gilens showed that the media, in stories principally about poverty rather than race, vastly over-represents African-Americans in photographs. These misperceptions affect their attitude towards welfare. As Gilens noted: "The public's exaggerated association of race and poverty increases white Americans opposition to welfare. Whites who think the poor are mostly black are more likely to blame welfare recipients for their situation and less likely to support welfare than are those with more accurate perceptions of poverty." The Harvard sociologist Lawrence Bobo reports in a 2004 paper that fully 24 percent of whites in his study agreed with the claim that "Blacks prefer to live on welfare." One can safely assume that the well-funded Romney campaign found similar results in their own studies.
It seems likely that the architects of the ad campaign want to communicate to working class white voters the message that Romney shares their opposition to certain kinds of welfare programs, ones connected in their minds to African-Americans. Given public misperceptions about the connection between race, poverty and willingness to work, and given the race of the president, it also suggests that it is the president who is out of touch with this constituency. Much of this message would be awkward to communicate by means of speech acts governed by a norm of truth: in other words, they would be embarrassing to say.
How would the Romney campaign deliver this message by making only true statements? The strategy of the campaign is evidence for the claims I have made in previous columns about the erosion of trust, because the strategy of this ad campaign takes these points for granted. The Romney campaign knows that there is no cost at all to making obviously false statements in order to convey an alternative message. Claims in the public domain are now routinely treated as intentional distortions of facts to promote ideologies; distortions or misrepresentations justified by the need to "counterbalance" false claims from the other side. The Romney campaign is not at fault for making false statements. They are just astutely taking advantage of the political environment in which all campaigning now takes place.

HEADLINE: Fear-of-China Syndrome

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A refreshing moment of macroeconomic error. 

 BODY:
Ah. Let's give thanks to Rob Portman, who offered a nice break from all the lies in Tampa, and instead offered us some good old-fashioned bad macroeconomics.
In his speech, Portman castigated the Obama administration for not taking a tougher line on China -- which is actually something I've complained about too -- then offered a completely wrong explanation. Obama won't take on China, Portman said, because 
Obama could not run up his record trillion dollar deficits if the Chinese did not buy our bonds to finance them
OK, let's ask the question: how much overseas financing does the United States as a whole need?
The answer is that it's determined by an accounting identity: capital inflows = the current account deficit, a broad measure of the trade balance including income on investments. (Trade can adjust to capital flows instead of the other way around, but that's a longer story).
So what has happened to the current account deficit as a share of GDP in the Obama era? Um, it's way down:
(I multiplied by 400 because the current account data are quarterly, while GDP is stated at an annual rate)
How is it possible that we're borrowing much less from foreigners when the government deficit has gone up so much? The answer is that the private sector is deleveraging, having moved into massive surplus as consumers try to pay down debt and corporations hold back on investment in the face of weak consumer demand. All those government deficits have only partly offset this move, so that overall national borrowing from overseas is down, not up.
But what would happen if the private sector stopped deleveraging? The answer is, , which would among other things greatly reduce the budget deficit. A side implication of this point, of course, is that for the time being that deficit is a good thing, helping to support the economy while the private sector unwinds its excessive leverage. 
So who's actually financing the US budget deficit? The US private sector. We don't need Chinese bond purchases, and if anything we're the ones with the power, since we don't need their money and they have a lot to lose. In fact, we don't want them to buy our bonds; better to have a weaker dollar (a point that the Japanese actually get.)
To make excuses for Portman, lots of people keep getting this wrong, even after all these years. But really, truly, the last thing we need to worry about is whether the Chinese love our bonds.

HEADLINE: Before Romney's Big Speech, a Focus on Bain

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Hours before Mitt Romney's speech at the Republican National Convention, his campaign introduced a Web site on Thursday -- business.mittromney.com -- devoted almost entirely on his years at the investment firm Bain Capital. 

 BODY:
As Mitt Romney prepares to take the stage at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night to make his case for the presidency, his record at Bain Capital continues to be a focus -- some might say the focus -- of both his supporters and detractors.
Just hours before Mr. Romney's speech, his campaign started a Web site on Thursday -- business.mittromney.com -- devoted almost entirely on his years at the investment firm Bain Capital. "Governor Romney's work at Bain Capital was about fixing companies that were broken and giving new companies a shot at success," reads the Web site's home page. 
The site features nine one- to two-minute videos, each highlighting a successful Bain deal. Two videos focus on the office-supplies retailer Staples, one of Mr. Romney's most successful investments during his tenure at Bain. Both show Mr. Romney roaming the aisles at a Staples store wearing that a blue dress shirt with a contrasting white collar, a de rigueur uniform of 1980s Wall Street.
The Staples videos are featured under the "building businesses" category. Two other categories -- "fixing businesses" and "growing business" -- highlight other money-making Bain deals, including a revival of the gadget chain Brookstone and a venture investment in the mountain bike maker GT Bicycles. There is also a clip chronicling Mr. Romney's rescue of Bain & Company, the management consulting firm where he started his career. Mr. Romney came back to the firm and led a turnaround. (Bain & Company spun off the private equity arm, Bain Capital, in 1984.)
But outside of Bain's New York headquarters on Thursday, no one was focused on the private equity firm's successes. Instead, all of the attention was on Bane, an imposing 10-foot-tall monster who lurched around the sun-kissed Manhattan sidewalks lambasting Bain's business practices. Bane is the villain who faced off against Batman in this summer's blockbuster movie "The Dark Knight Rises." It will be "a long dark night you'll be facing if Romney gets elected," said Bane, according to a Bloomberg News report. 
The protest was organized by United NY, a coalition of labor unions and community organizations that has staged a number of demonstrations against Bain. Accompanying Bane was a woman from the Bronx who was recently laid off from her job at Burlington Coat Factory, a Bain-owned company. 
Cara Noel, a United NY spokeswoman, said that it staged the protest because "we wanted to send a clear message that a Romney economy would not work for the middle class and for low-wage earners."
Media outlets also continue to center on Mr. Romney's Bain years. Matt Taibbi, a writer who has made headlines for his screeds against Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street players, has now taken aim at Bain. In a new Rolling Stone article, Mr. Taibbi calls Mr. Romney "the hard-charging, chameleonic champion of a disgraced-yet-defiant Wall Street."

HEADLINE: A To-Do List for Romney's Speech

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The list of things Mitt Romney has to do in his address to the Republican National Convention Thursday night is a long one. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- The list of things Mitt Romney has to do in his address to the Republican National Convention on Thursday night is a long one. 
He must go on the offensive against a well-liked sitting president; offer a subtle defense of his own background and record; unveil a personal biography that voters can relate to; reach out to women, minorities and independents; and fire up his party's conservative activists.
The challenge for Mr. Romney and his speechwriters is to craft remarks that hang together and do not appear to be the poll-tested handiwork of a campaign committee.
Mr. Romney has not always demonstrated the ability to use soaring language. His speeches on the campaign trail have tended to be workaday: he delivers his message in a disciplined but not passionate way.
But there is no stage like the one he will step onto tonight. Candidates in the past -- including his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan -- have accepted the challenge and found within themselves the kind of speech that they have never before delivered.
"I think you'll enjoy the speech," Eric Fehrnstrom, a top aide to Mr. Romney, said Thursday afternoon. "He's very happy with it, and one thing we know about Mitt Romney is that he always rises to the occasion."
Here's a more detailed look at the tasks that Mr. Romney must accomplish: 
1. GO ON THE OFFENSIVE. Mr. Romney will never again have the same opportunity to crystalize his critique of President Obama in front of such a large audience. 
Viewers should expect to hear the sharp-edged attacks about Mr. Obama's economic policies that Mr. Romney has honed for more than a year during hundreds of campaign appearances. If the recent past is a guide, he will continue to criticize Mr. Obama for his "build it" comments and accuse Democrats of taking billions from Medicare.
But he will also attack the administration's handling of foreign policy. And he is likely to seek to undermine the president's character, largely by focusing on what he calls an unfair and intensely negative campaign waged by Mr. Obama and his aides.
2. PLAY DEFENSE. This part is tricky. Mr. Romney cannot afford to be seen as overly defensive, or to fall into a trap by reacting to Mr. Obama's campaign playbook. And yet he must find subtle ways to push back against Mr. Obama's attacks.
The list of those attacks is long: Bain Capital, tax returns, the offshore bank accounts; his Massachusetts record. Mr. Romney must find a way to set aside Mr. Obama's critique without drawing new attention to it.
Mr. Ryan found simple ways to do that on Wednesday night, and that could be a model for Mr. Romney. In an effort to address Mr. Romney's wealth and his time at Bain Capital, Mr. Ryan said simply: "By the way, being successful in business - that's a good thing," to which the audience responded with enthusiastic applause.
Mr. Romney will seek a similar way to highlight his business record. A new Web site unveiled by the campaign on Thursday -- www.sterlingbusinesscareer.com -- offers clues to how he might do that.
3. BIOGRAPHY. Mr. Romney does not have an up-from-the-bootstraps story to tell, though he sometimes leans on the stories of his father, a self-made businessman who became the governor of Michigan, and of his wife's grandfather, a coal miner. But he needs to find a way to connect with voters on a personal level.
His likely path: through his wife, Ann, and their children. His wife's struggles with multiple sclerosis and breast cancer, he has said, were moments that tested him. And the images of Mr. Romney and his five sons have frequently been part of the campaign's message. 
Mr. Romney's faith has not been front and center. But he recently has been more open in discussing his faith, and he may conclude that he needs to offer voters more of a window into his beliefs. 
4. WOMEN AND MINORITIES. Much of the Republican convention has been dedicated to reaching out to crucial voter groups who may hold the key to the election: women, minorities and independents. Mr. Romney's speech will be aimed, in part, at them.
The effort to win over those voters will no doubt involve an attempt by Mr. Romney to offer softer language on issues of importance to them. For Hispanics, Mr. Romney may talk about immigration reform; for women, he will stress kitchen-table economic issues like college tuition.
5. THE BASE VOTERS. But even as he moderates his language in some part of the speech, look for Mr. Romney to offer red meat to the thousands of activists gathered in the convention hall and watching on television.
For them, the speech is likely to serve up some biting comments about Mr. Obama; attacks about "Obamacare" are always crowd-pleasers for Mr. Romney. And there will be mentions of abortion, protecting marriage and the fight by churches to avoid paying for contraception for their employees.

And with that, we have come to the end of the Republican National Convention. Join us next week in Charlotte, N.C., as Democrats take their turn.
- 
11:25 P.M. | Fact-Checking Romney
Mitt Romney said in his convention speech that President Obama's "policies have not helped create jobs, they have depressed them," repeated claims that the president had gone on an "apology tour" for America, and warned that his Medicare cuts would "hurt today's seniors" - assertions that have already been labeled false or misleading during the campaign.
With his statement about Mr. Obama's jobs record, Mr. Romney joined other Republicans who have taken a dim view of the president's stimulus law - but ignored the findings of many economists. Just this week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that when the impact of the stimulus peaked in 2010, it was responsible for creating between 900,000 and 4.7 million jobs and for lowering the unemployment rate by between .4 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points. The stimulus bolstered the nation's economic output by between .7 percent and 4.1 percent, the budget office found. 
Mr. Romney also made his oft-repeated, widely debunked charge that Mr. Obama had gone on an "apology tour" about America, an accusation Mr. Romney feels so strongly about that he titled a 2010 book in which he laid out his own worldview "No Apology." 
But independent fact-checkers have called the charge a distortion, and it is hard to find evidence that Mr. Obama ever said that he was "sorry" for the United States. Even in his speeches after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr. Obama offered a strong defense of American policies, including the war in Afghanistan, which was growing increasingly unpopular in the rest of the world.
And Mr. Romney's claim that Mr. Obama's $716 billion in Medicare cuts would "hurt today's seniors" is not accurate. The cuts, which are part of the 2010 health care law, would actually cut reimbursements to hospitals and insurers, not benefits for older Americans, by $716 billion over the coming decade.
- 
11:20 P.M. | Romney Says Obama Raised Taxes on Middle Class
Mitt Romney said in his speech that unlike the president, he would not raise taxes on the middle class. 
But President Obama has signed into law a succession of tax cuts benefiting middle-income Americans, including the "Making Work Pay" credit, which was part of the stimulus package, in his first two years, and the two-percentage-point cut in workers' payroll taxes for this year and last year. 
Additional tax cuts have been created or expanded for middle-income taxpayers to offset the costs of college and children, and for small-business owners. Also Mr. Obama has called for extending the Bush-era income tax rates, which otherwise expire Dec. 31, for incomes up to $250,000 for couples, $200,000 for individuals. Mr. Romney and Republicans insist the rates for all income be extended.
- 
10:53 P.M. | Protesters Disrupt Romney's Speech
For the second day in a row, the Republican National Convention was interrupted by female protesters, this time just as Mitt Romney was beginning his address to accept the nomination of his political party.
The two protesters held pink cloth banners and were quickly drowned out by the delegates' chants of "U.S.A." They were tackled and hustled roughly out of the arena by security, while Mr. Romney slowed his speech, then paused. As they left, another heckler shouted from the rafters directly across the Tampa Bay Times Forum arena from the nominee.
The disruption was over in seconds, but it provided another distraction for Mr. Romney and his campaign.
Alli McCracken, a CodePink spokeswoman, said the group of four protesters held up two banners, reading "Democracy Is Not a Business" and "People Over Profits."
On Wednesday night, CodePink protesters gained access to the arena using credentials from disgruntled Ron Paul supporters. Asked how they pulled it off this time, Ms. McCracken would only say, "We have our ways."
- 
10:40 P.M. | Romney Makes an Entrance and Accepts Nomination
The room inside the Tampa Bay Times Forum may be the warmest Mitt Romney will encounter all campaign, and he made a point of working it.
Mr. Romney made his way to the stage slowly, seeming to savor every meeting. He hugged Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, and kissed the wives of delegates.
"Born Free" by Kid Rock, his campaign theme song, blared through the room: a slower, more-muted version.
But Mr. Romney didn't waste any time after taking the stage.
His first words?
"Mr. Chairman and delegates, I accept your nomination for president of the United States."
- 
10:32 P.M. | Rubio Focuses on Romney Family's Modest Origins 
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida described Mitt Romney on Thursday as someone whose family came from poverty, saying he was part of America's story of "everyday people" who do extraordinary things.
Mr. Rubio drew the honor of introducing Mr. Romney at the Republican convention. In doing so, he sought to write a new personal narrative for one of the wealthiest-ever presidential candidates: one who has struggled to connect with middle-class voters.
In Mr. Rubio's telling, Mr. Romney's wealth - he is worth more than $250 million - is not the central part of his life's story.
Instead, Mr. Rubio focused on Mr. Romney's father, noting that he was an immigrant whose family came to America to escape revolution. 
"They struggled through poverty and the Great Depression. And yet, he rose to be an admired businessman, and public servant," Mr. Rubio said of George Romney, Mr. Romney's father. "And in November, his son, Mitt Romney, will be elected president of the United States."
Mr. Rubio's introduction provided one of the most high-profile platforms for the first-term senator, who was considered as a potential vice-presidential choice for Mr. Romney this year.
The senator used his time to tell his own story, too, saying his family immigrated to America from Cuba for the hope of a better life. 
"My dad was a bartender," he said. "My mom was a cashier, a maid and a stock clerk at Kmart. They never made it big. They were never rich. And yet they were successful. Because just a few decades removed from hopelessness, they made possible for us all the things that had been impossible for them."
He said the "essence of the American miracle" is that "we're exceptional not because we have more rich people here."
But the primary goal in the remarks was to provide Mr. Romney with a prime-time introduction that would help close the gap with President Obama among those who say they think the candidates empathize with them.
"He's a devoted husband, father and grandfather, a generous member of his community and church," Mr. Rubio said. "Everywhere he's been, he's volunteered his time and talent to make things better for those around him."
- 
10:25 P.M. | In the CNN Control Room
The political conventions run for hours each day, much of the time filled with speeches from politicians trying to rise from obscurity: state legislators, mayors, lieutenant governors.
But most people sitting at home would never know it because the networks carefully select which portions to broadcast.
But how do they make the call of when to cut away from the convention program, which campaigns spend months scripting, staging and producing?
Inside the CNN control room on Thursday night, a team of producers sat in front of a half-dozen television monitors. A switchboard lighted up with the names and initials of various correspondents and anchors spread out across the convention hall: AC for Anderson Cooper, Wolf for Wolf Blitzer and Erin for Erin Burnett.
From that room, they made game-time calls about what to broadcast and what to ignore and substitute with programming and analysis of their own.
A speech by the Staples chief executive, who testified to Mitt Romney's financial acumen? Cut.
A speech by the former Massachusetts lieutenant governor? Cut.
Remarks from a Mormon pastor who worked with Mr. Romney when he served as a bishop? In.
A musical performance by Taylor Hicks of "American Idol" fame? In.
Sam Feist, CNN's Washington bureau chief, explained.
"We want to put together the most compelling program," he said, "and help people learn something about Mitt Romney."

10:21 P.M. | From the Morgue: Balloon Drop for Nixon, 1960
- 
10:16 P.M. | Clint and the Empty Chair
Do you feel lucky, punk? 
Clint Eastwood, the actor, offered an odd, rambling endorsement of Mitt Romney, pretending to have an off-color conversation with an imaginary President Obama sitting by his side.
"We own this country," he said. "Politicians are employees of ours. When somebody doesn't do the job, we gotta let em go."
Just after 10 p.m., there he was onstage, Dirty Harry himself.
"Mr. President, how do you handle promises that you made when you were running for election?" he said, jokingly talking to an empty chair next to his podium.
He asked the invisible Mr. Obama why he didn't close the terrorist detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.
"What do you mean shut up?" he said, continuing to talk to his imaginary friend.
A moment later, he stopped again, saying, "What do you want me to tell Mr. Romney?"
"I can't tell him that. He can't do that to himself," Mr. Eastwood said, apparently referring to a sexual act.
"You're getting as bad as Biden," Mr. Eastwood said.
Mr. Eastwood had not been announced in advance, listed instead as a mystery speaker.
All day long, convention organizers had refused to confirm rumors that the "to be announced" speaker on the schedule would be the gravely-voiced Republican star. Aides to Mr. Romney joked that would spoil the surprise.
After going much longer than expected - as indicated by the urgently flashing red light at the back of the room - Mr. Eastwood gave in to urging from the crowd to say his famous line.
"Go ahead," he said, and the crowd chanted, "Make my day!"
- 
9:53 P.M. | Olympians Offer Support
Thunderous chants of "U.S.A., U.S.A." greeted the parade of Olympic athletes who came to the stage at the Republican National Convention to hail the leader of the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, Mitt Romney. But the testimonials offered by the athletes and an earlier address by Kerry Healey, the former Massachusetts lieutenant governor, were notably incomplete.
Mike Eruzione, captain of the 1980 "Miracle on Ice" Olympic hockey team, said the scandals and budgetary problems that preceded Mr. Romney's arrival in Salt Lake City had put the Olympics, "not just those games, but the Olympics as an institution," in peril.
Mr. Romney "drew a line in the sand and said the 2002 Games would have highest standard of ethics and integrity," he said, offering a rousing endorsement of the Republican nominee for president.
"We need new leadership, and we need it now," said Kim Rhode, an Olympic trap shooter.
Ms. Healey spoke glowingly of how Mr. Romney had "quickly assembled a cabinet of the best and the brightest," and went on to four successful years of Massachusetts governor.
Left unspoken was one of the critical ways Mr. Romney turned around the Olympics, a quick but sharp ramping up of the Salt Lake City Olympic Committee's lobbying presence in Washington and a resulting flood of federal dollars into the games, which dwarfed the government contributions given to any prior games.
Ms. Healey did not tell the assembled Republicans that among the best and brightest were some of the most progressive voices in the state, including Douglas Foy, one of the most prominent environmental lawyers in New England.
Nor did she mention Mr. Romney's most notable achievement as governor: the Massachusetts health care law.
- 
9:45 P.M. | Scott Romney in the Spotlight 
The Romney family has chosen its spokesman for the night: Scott Romney, Mitt's older brother.
Scott has dashed from network to network on the convention floor here. He just finished an interview with Fox News. Now, he is talking to CNN.
"I couldn't sleep last night," he told Dana Bash of CNN, about his excitement.
He is not shying from the personal, recalling how his brother called him "every night offering advice on how to solve my problems."
The rest of the Romney family remains in an elevated seating box, their every move carefully watched, but their words unheard.
- 
9:42 P.M. | From the Morgue: Support for Reagan, 1968
- 
9:36 P.M. | 'We're a Good Bunch of People'
Mitt Romney plans to discuss his faith in his speech tonight, and conventiongoers got a preview Thursday night, when a member of Mr. Romney's church delivered the invocation, and another friend and church member shared stories from Mr. Romney's time as a lay leader and stake president.
Shirley Taylor, a delegate from Idaho, could not be more delighted - or surprised.
"I was so excited," said Ms. Taylor, a Mormon, from the convention floor. "I didn't think they would do that because he's been so persecuted for being a Mormon. I never expected that. I was amazed."
She added, eagerly: "Maybe someday people will understand that we're a good bunch of people and not a cult. And a fun bunch of people. We have good clean fun, without any drugs, alcohol, coffee or tea."

9:35 P.M. | Delegates Mix and Mingle on Convention Floor
Hey! Quiet! Shhhh, can't you see Newt and Callista Gingrich are speaking?
Yeah, but there's Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. Governor! Please pose for a picture. 
And so Timothy Roth, a delegate from El Paso, Texas, tuned out the speeches a few dozen yards away to loop an arm around Mr. Perry. 
"From my perspective, the networking is important," said Mr. Roth, an economic adviser in the Reagan administration. "I just spoke with someone who also worked in the Reagan administration" representing a different state, he said, whom he had never met.
Whoa! Isn't that Phyllis Schlafly, the tireless anti-abortion campaigner? Never mind that Craig Romney is speaking onstage. 
"Phyllis, I got your note, so wonderful to see you here,'' said Donald Ely, an alternate delegate from Sunbury, Pa., thrusting out a hand. 
Ms. Schlafly, who said she was at her 16th Republican convention, said it was more fun to circulate the floor, greeting old friends and meeting new ones than to sit glued to a seat through hours of speeches. 
"I like to walk around and see my friends from other states," she said. "I just talked to Kris Kobach," the Kansas secretary of state.
In the crowded aisle where the South Carolina delegation was seated close to the stage, Jennifer Nassour, a former chairwoman of the Massachusetts Republican Party, got a hug from Gov. Nikki Haley. 
Jeb Bush's words from the stage fell, at least for a while, on deaf ears. "As someone in the same age group, it's so wonderful to have you in the position you're in," Ms. Nassour, 40, told Ms. Haley, also 40.
"Thank you very much," Ms. Haley said. "It's great to have women your age." 
"If we can do anything for you, just let us know," Ms. Nassour told her. 
Much of the Colorado delegation seemed to be glued to their iPhones and BlackBerrys as someone was speaking about something. 
"It's a scripted show,'' said John Warnick, a delegate from Breckenridge, Colo. "You can see the teleprompter. Everyone knows that.''
From his line of sight, the large text read from the stage was easily visible, the big words scrolling up like the tiny text on his handheld screen.

9:17 P.M. | 'You Didn't Build That' - Front and Center
Fact-checkers have repeatedly criticized Mitt Romney's campaign for making an ad that spliced President Obama's words so that it sounded as though he was bashing small businesses.
On Thursday, with tens of millions of people watching, the campaign once again played the ad.
At a rally this summer, Mr. Obama said: "Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business - you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen." Independent analysts have said he was clearly saying that "somebody else" made the "roads and bridges" that he referred to.
But in the ad - played on the big screen in the forum here - the roads and bridges line was gone.
The resulting line - "If you've got a business - you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen" - makes it sound as if Mr. Obama was suggesting that "somebody else" built a business.
Democrats have long cried foul, but Mr. Romney's campaign has always refused to concede. In fact, the phrase has become perhaps the centerpiece of Mr. Romney's campaign.
On Thursday, it was no different.
- 
9:14 P.M. | Romney Friend Puts Bain in Positive Light
Bob White, Mitt Romney's Bain Capital business partner and self-described wing man, took to the stage to testify that the soon-to-be presidential nominee was not a rapacious vulture capitalist, but a decisive leader and conscientious investor.
The contrasts to Republican views of President Obama were left unspoken - but they seemed plain as day.
"When things went wrong, we would not blame others," Mr. White said. "He took decisive action. Mitt never hesitated. He made the tough decisions, coalesced the team and moved forward."
Critics of Mr. Romney's days at Bain might latch onto Mr. White's story of how his friend was called back to Bain when the parent, Bain & Company, was teetering.
"I will never forget when he said: 'Bob, 1,000 employees and their families depend on us. We can't let them down,'" he said.
The convention turned to Tom Stemberg, founder of the office supply company Staples, to really stick it to the Bain critics, and Mr. Obama specifically, whom he said had leveled "fiction, half-truths and downright lies."
"Why would an administration who can't create any jobs demonize someone who did?" Mr. Stemberg asked.
- 
9:09 P.M. | A Portrait of Compassion, Without Much Audience
A procession of people who Mitt Romney helped as a lay pastor with the Mormon Church took the stage to offer moving testimonials to Mr. Romney's charity and compassion. It is part of a long-promised effort by the campaign to present something besides the political and business side of Mr. Romney at the convention, a personal side that has been largely absent in this campaign. 
That said, these speakers appeared early in the evening, hours before Mr. Romney was to take the stage. There was a time when these moments would, at least in theory, be seen in millions of Americans homes. But networks have cut back their coverage to an hour a night, and that opening hour is still many moments away. Complicating things for Mr. Romney: The convention was shortened one night because of Isaac, the tropical storm-hurricane-tropical storm. All of which raises a question: How many people outside the hall were really watching?
- 
8:59 P.M. | Terrible Towels With a Twist
What's a delegate got to do to stand out these days?
Come equipped with a colorful and state-appropriate costume, for starters.
To wit:
The Michigan delegation rocked their front and center perch with oversize blue foam mittens in the shape of their state. ("Don't Mess With 'The Mitt'!" the slogan read.)
The Hawaiian delegation brought purple and white leis, and decorated its sign with real Anthurium flowers, which are native to the state's Big Island.
And the Pennsylvania delegation waved red "Romney/Ryan" towels - just like the Pittsburgh Steelers' "Terrible Towels." But these are red, rather than the traditional black and gold to appease fans of the state's other major team.
"We had to compromise for all of the Phillies fans," said Mike Barley, the executive director of the Pennsylvania Republican Party.
- 
8:50 P.M. | Church Members Describe Romney's Role as Pastor
Grant Bennett, a friend of Mitt Romney's, testified to Mr. Romney's role as pastor of his Mormon church.
The detailed testimonial is one of the rare peeks inside Mr. Romney's religious life, as described in this story by the Times reporter Jodi Kantor.
"I was Mitt's assistant when he was our pastor," Mr. Bennett said during remarks at the convention. "I had a front row seat, and it was marvelous to behold."
Mr. Bennett described Mr. Romney's tending to people who requested his help.
"Pure religion is to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction," Mr. Bennett said. "Unemployment, sickness, financial distress, loneliness. Mitt prayed and counseled with church members seeking direction."
Mr. Bennett then introduced Ted and Pat Oparowsky, a couple whose dying son was befriended by Mr. Romney when he was a church pastor.
"The true measure of a man is revealed in his actions during times of trouble - the quiet hospital room of a dying boy, with no camera and no reporters," Mr. Oparowsky said. "This is the time to make that assessment."
Pat Oparowsky described Mr. Romney's visits with her son, who died of cancer. "We will be ever grateful to Mitt for his love and concern," she said.

8:36 P.M. | Jeb Bush Presses Education Agenda
Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, turned a policy spotlight on an issue that has played almost no role in the presidential election so far: education.
Pressing for public school choice, Mr. Bush joked that there are dozens of kinds of milk, low-fat milk, no-fat milk, fruit-flavored milk. 
"They even make milk for people who can't drink milk," he joked, but parents in the public school system largely have no choice in the school their children can attend.
The speech was meant to appeal to minority voters, who are often the ones most frustrated with the public school system. But it also highlighted how little attention bread-and-butter domestic policy issues have taken beyond the grand themes of taxes, budgets and entitlement programs like Medicare.
"Because he is a former governor, Mitt Romney understands that states must lead this national movement," Mr. Bush said.
The campaign has had its education moments. During an awkward moment in Philadelphia, Mr. Romney squared off with parents and staff pressing for smaller class sizes, an expensive proposition Mr. Romney did not embrace. President Obama has pressed for - but failed to attain - educational aid for state and local governments.
The one off-key moment may have come from the Florida teacher Mr. Bush brought with him onstage.
"I've seen too many good teachers come and go, mainly due to poor working conditions and little pay," Sean Duffy said.
In Campaign 2012, President Obama pressed for federal funds to build and renovate schools and help struggling local governments with teacher salaries.

8:13 P.M. | Jeb Bush to Obama: 'Stop Blaming Your Predecessor'
Very rarely do convention speakers go off script. When they do, it's always interesting.
For Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida and the brother of former President George W. Bush, the prepared remarks were all about education policy.
But when he came up on the stage, he began by coming to the defense of his brother, who is often blamed by President Obama for having run the economy into the ground.
"It is time to stop blaming your predecessor for your failed economic policies," Mr. Bush said, speaking to Mr. Obama.
"You were dealt a tough hand. You were dealt a tough hand. But your policies have not worked," Mr. Bush said. "In your fourth year of your presidency, a real leader would accept responsibility for his actions, and you haven't done that."
The crowd applauded, and Mr. Bush paused before saying, "Now that I've gotten that off my chest," and he continued to his prepared remarks.
- 
8:12 P.M. | Hispanic Outreach
Craig Romney played the one-Romney-man Hispanic outreach arm, after a video montage of elected Republican Hispanics with an extended opening passage in Spanish.
His English address was not much longer, speaking on his father's behalf and pledging his family's help to get back on track.
The Republican National Convention has featured several Hispanic speakers, including Gov. Luis G. Fortuño of Puerto Rico; Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico; Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada; and tonight, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. 
The question remains, will the imagery work to eat into President Obama's overwhelming lead in the polls with Latino voters? Mel Martinez, the former Florida senator, is sanguine.
"They've done a phenomenal job, and you know why? It's real," he said. "It isn't just sticking a few Hispanics on the floor and trying to get the camera to notice them. It's about the people on the podium."
But Matthew Dowd, the strategist that mapped out President George W. Bush's successful efforts to win over Hispanic voters, said Mitt Romney will have to do more than show Hispanic faces. He needs tonight to offer them tangible policies that appeal to them and will counter the anti-immigration sentiments sometimes expressed by his party.
"You can't win Latino votes with imagery," he said. "All I have seen is imagery without substantive outreach."

7:56 P.M. | The Gingriches' Tag Team Speech
Republicans love to bash Jimmy Carter almost as much as they love to bash President Obama.
Newt Gingrich - a fierce rival of Mitt Romney's for the nomination - and his wife, Callista, did both Thursday night.
Assigned to the task of honoring the memory of Ronald Reagan, the Gingriches chose to do so by lumping Mr. Obama with Mr. Carter, saying both "took our nation down a path that in four years weakened America's confidence in itself and our hope for a better future."
In ping-pong fashion, Mr. Gingrich and his wife offered thoughts about Mr. Reagan's legacy, concluding that he should be remembered for overcoming the mess that Mr. Carter left him.
Likewise, they said, Mr. Romney will be charged with fixing the economy after Mr. Obama leaves.
"Governor Romney will return America to work, and to the principles that are at the core of President Reagan's legacy," Callista Gingrich said.
Her husband added: "Each of us must do our part now to ensure that America remains, in the tradition of President Reagan, a land of freedom, hope and opportunity."
- 
7:51 P.M. | Highlighting Bain 
If the Democrats thought the Republicans would avoid mentioning Bain Capital at their convention, they were wrong.
The final night of the convention will feature two videos highlighting the success of Bain, the private equity firm that is at the center of President Obama's attacks on Mitt Romney's business record.
In addition, employees of companies bought by Bain will testify to its successes. One of those companies is Wesley Jessen, a manufacturer of contact lenses.
"Because of Bain Capital's attention and management, Wesley Jessen roared back," Ray Fernandez, a former employee, will say, according to prepared remarks. "Workers like me were inspired by what we saw - and our careers thrived."
Mr. Obama and his allies have condemned Mr. Romney's work at Bain Capital, accusing him of moving jobs overseas and of profiting off the misery of others when companies were shut down.
Speakers at the Republican convention beg to differ. Among them is Tom Stemberg, the founder of Staples, an office supply company that received help from Bain.
"You can imagine my dismay, when I see this White House and their campaign demonizing Mitt Romney. Demonizing Bain Capital. Demonizing the private equity industry that created so many new jobs," Mr. Stemberg says. "Over and over again: Fiction. Half-truths. Downright lies."
The debate will no doubt continue as the Democrats attack Mr. Romney's experience at Bain Capital in the weeks to come. But Thursday night, Bain's supporters fought back.
- 
7:41 P.M. | Tim Pawlenty, the Man Who Wasn't There
Tim Pawlenty came close to being the star of the last two Republican conventions.
Close, but not close enough.
On Thursday evening, as Mitt Romney prepared to formally accept his party's nomination for president, Mr. Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, walked through the convention hall, largely unnoticed.
"Who is that guy?" one Republican delegate asked as he walked by. Another woman asked to take her picture next to him. Another man said he liked what he heard when Mr. Pawlenty visited Alabama as a candidate.
Asked what he would do on behalf of Mr. Romney in the next few weeks, Mr. Pawlenty seemed surprised at the question.
"I'm just a volunteer," he said, "so I've got other stuff I've got to do. So as my schedule allows, I'll go out and do surrogate speaking."
That's a far cry from what might have been if Mr. Romney had picked him, instead of Representative Paul D. Ryan, to be his running mate this year. Senator John McCain of Arizona also passed over Mr. Pawlenty in 2008.
The fact that he did not get picked allows Mr. Pawlenty to be a bit more honest with questions. Asked the chances that Mr. Romney might win Minnesota, he shrugged.
"It remains a state that tilts toward Democrats, but it's not inconceivable that a Republican could win there," he said. "We have in the past. Not in the presidential recently."
A few minutes later, a nearby crowd surged around Mr. Ryan as he made his way into a television booth for an evening interview. Mr. Pawlenty answered one more question - and shook another hand - and he was off, into the crowd, largely unnoticed.
- 
7:28 P.M. | Campaigns Hit the Road Over Long Weekend
So where to from here? 
Labor Day weekend fills the lull between the end of the Republican National Convention on Thursday and the start of its Democratic counterpart on Tuesday in Charlotte, N.C., but neither campaign is pausing for breath. 
Labor Day might once have been the unofficial kickoff of presidential campaigns, but in the era of the yearlong primary fight, that schedule is as quaint as marching in parades to get voters' attention.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan will spend Friday together, starting with a send-off rally in Lakeland, Fla., east of Tampa along the Interstate 4 corridor, a swing region in a battleground state. From there, they hop to Richmond, Va., for another joint appearance. 
President Obama, in the meantime, is beginning his own itinerary of battleground states on Saturday, rolling out what he calls a "Road to Charlotte" tour. First stop is outside Des Moines, a continuation of Mr. Obama's saturation campaigning in Iowa, which included a three-day bus tour this month. He visits Sioux City, Iowa, later in the day. 
On Saturday, Mr. Ryan has a public event in Columbus, Ohio (the site of the big game between Ohio State University and his alma mater, Miami of Ohio), while Mr. Romney appears in Cincinnati. The Republican ticket returns to Florida later that day for a rally in Jacksonville.
Mr. Obama will campaign Sunday morning on the quad at the University of Colorado in the liberal city of Boulder. He flies to Toledo, Ohio, that afternoon. 
If it seems as though the two presidential campaigns are dancing around each other, shuffling and dodging in a tight ring defined by a handful of states, that is likely to be the status quo until they put on the real gloves at a series of debates in October.
- 
6:57 P.M. | Hatch Discusses Romney's Reticence to Talk Religion
Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah believes he knows why Mitt Romney has been so reticent to talk about his faith and work in the Mormon Church, and Mr. Hatch, Mr. Romney's fellow Mormon, is opening up about it.
"Mitt was a bishop," Mr. Hatch said in an interview. "One reason why he's been so reticent to talk about it, you put in usually 30 hours a week as a bishop to help people with a myriad of problems, everything from personal problems to economic problems, psychological problems, to spiritual problems, and you do that voluntarily without disclosing how you're helping people. There's a reticence to breach any confidentiality, and it's hard to talk about it because of that."
Later, Mr. Romney became a stake president, leading other congregations, approving "temple recommends," which allow Mormons in good standing to take part in Mormon temple spiritual activities, "and a whole raft of other things," Mr. Hatch said.
Members and leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have held their pride in check as the first Mormon to rise this high in United States politics continues his ascent. But the anti-Mormonism that church officials feared as the presidential campaign began has largely failed to materialize, and Mr. Hatch allowed himself a moment of reflection. He credited their religion for Mr. Romney's leadership skills and successes.
"We bring up our young kids to be independent, self-reliant, to live good lives, to serve their fellow men and women," he said.

Mitt Romney will call upon disappointed and disaffected Americans to turn President Obama out of office in November, arguing in his convention speech that the president has failed to deliver the hope that he promised four years ago.
In excerpts of remarks he will deliver Thursday night, Mr. Romney expresses sadness in what he says was Mr. Obama's inability to confront the nation's economic problems. And he urges voters to reflect on whether they remain as excited by Mr. Obama's election as they did four years ago. Read more

HEADLINE: Mitt Romney Is Disappointed

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: In his convention speech, he admonished the president as if he were a wayward child. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. - A slightly different Mitt Romney took the podium tonight to accept the Republican nomination, though not a more compassionate one, or a more forthcoming one, or a more authentic one. This was the sorrowful incarnation of Mr. Romney, who set aside the ice pick of the pre-convention campaign to announce his profound "disappointment" in President Obama.
He had such high hopes for Mr. Obama, Mr. Romney said, as if admonishing a wayward child, and so did the entire country. "Four years ago, I know that many Americans felt a fresh excitement about the possibilities of a new president," he said, because that's just the way optimistic Americans are. "I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed," he added. (Even Clint Eastwood, in one of the most bizarre interludes in convention history, said he cried after Mr. Obama was elected.)
But there was only so long Mr. Romney could sustain the fiction that he or any Republican leader actually wanted Mr. Obama to succeed, or felt the slightest flush of excitement at his election. Because it simply isn't true.

"That president was not the choice of our party but Americans always come together after elections," he said. They do? When, for one second, did Republicans "come together" with Democrats after Mr. Obama's election? (And neither were Democrats particularly eager to embrace George W. Bush after the disputed election of 2000.) From the moment of Mr. Obama's inauguration, Republicans fought against his policies and sneered at his background, caring nothing for the cost to the economy or the resulting divisions in the national unity Mr. Romney pretends they wanted. 
Mr. Romney set up his ostensibly more gentle critique of the Obama years by describing a set of national expectations for the president ludicrously higher than they really were. Beginning in 2009, he said, every family thought they would be able to put aside some money, save for college, help their elderly parents. Every small business hoped the election would lead to "their best years ever." The nation would start paying down its deficits.
"Every new college graduate thought they'd have a good job by now," he said, "a place of their own, and that they could start paying back some of their loans and build for the future."
Who were these Americans who thought that a raging recession would magically disappear with the election of a new president? There were undoubtedly some extreme idealists who thought Mr. Obama was some kind of miracle worker, but the month he was inaugurated, the country lost nearly 600,000 jobs, the worst drop in 35 years. To suggest that every college graduate thought they would get a good job under those circumstances is ridiculous.
Mr. Romney even said Mr. Obama promised to "slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet."
For Romney, Ronald Reagan's classic question wasn't pointed enough. Instead of "are you better off than you were four years ago," the standard Mr. Romney set in his speech was much higher:
"How many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in America?" he asked. He went on: "If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama?"
Coming from one of the least exciting presidential candidates in modern times, it's amusing to hear Mr. Romney declare that Americans should throw Mr. Obama out of office if every day isn't special or exciting. Even as he delivered the speech, the crowd looked desperate for moments that could rouse them, and didn't find many. But Mr. Romney knows that while his opponent may be a diminished emotional force, the president is better at connecting with ordinary Americans than he is.
The only way to unseat Mr. Obama, he seems to have decided, is turn mere disappointment into electoral fury. For that, he will need a better argument.

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. A searchable guide to these and many other art shows is at nytimes.com/events.
Museums
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Art of Another Kind: International Abstraction and the Guggenheim, 1949 -- 1960' (through Sept. 12) The excellent collection show ''Art of Another Kind'' finds the Guggenheim tunneling back in time to the 1950s. It's a great-looking period piece, with confident, dynamic examples of postwar abstraction (many by lesser-known artists) that look very much at home in architecture of the same vintage. But it's also living history. The 1950s was the time of the rise of a global avant-garde and the resurgence of abstract painting, two phenomena that define the art world of right this minute. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Karen Rosenberg) 
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Rineke Dijkstra: A Retrospective' (through Oct. 8) More mid-career survey than retrospective, a selection of some 70 large color photographs and five videos reflect this 53-year-old Dutch artist's faith in the power of two things: youth and the camera. Her ability to coax out the emotional subtleties and raw energy that are special to children, adolescents and young adults, with grave, revelatory and sometimes ecstatic results, is reflected in works that at their best effortlessly balance the formality of traditional portrait painting with the immediacy of real life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
Jewish Museum: 'Édouard Vuillard: A Painter and His Muses, 1890-1940' (through Sept. 23) In the 1890s, Vuillard made some of the most beguiling paintings of fin de siècle Paris: intimate, compact, brushy pictures of his mother and sister in the apartment he shared with them and the dressmaking shop they worked in. Then he reverted to a more traditionally realistic style and produced many portraits of his wealthy friends and benefactors until he died in 1940. This incisive show, sampling works from his more than four-decade career, invites reassessment of the later, heretofore less appreciated paintings. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Naked Before the Camera' (through Sept. 9) This resonant, illuminating if sometimes fraught exhibition traces the progress of the naked, mostly female body through photography from its early years nearly to the present with some 90 images, all owned by the Met. In works variously artistic, erotic, scientific, ethnographic, forensic and experimental, we see a medium stretched by human use and imagination. The male gaze is often relentless, but as time passes, individual faces, personalities and relationships come into focus on all sides; consciousness rises and oppressiveness decreases, which is a relief. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Tomás Saraceno on the Roof: Cloud City' (through Nov. 4) This climbable 28-foot-high aggregate of 16 interconnected polyhedrons made of reflective steel and clear plexiglass creates a kind of Piranesian, walk-in Cubism that is briefly disorienting, but ultimately decorative. The none-too-high standards of participatory fun-house formalism are met; those of conventional plop art are barely exceeded. In the fusion of architecture, art and science, art is the loser, but the views of Central Park's ocean of greenness thrill, providing an immense and calming relief to the work's forced and busy artifice. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Gardens: Pavilions, Studios, Retreats' (through Jan. 6) To anyone strolling through the Chinese painting galleries at the Met this summer, the whole world will look like a garden of infinite expansion. That's the impression given by the 80 paintings and objects that make up this fragrant exhibition, drawn entirely from the museum's deep holdings, about paradises lost and found; about nature blooming and fading; about cosmological events transpiring in backyard bamboo groves.

MoMA PS1: 'Lara Favaretto: Just Knocked Out' (through Sept. 10) Ms. Favaretto lives in Turin and has been included in the 53rd Venice Biennale and in this summer's Documenta 13. This show of sculptures and installations from the past 15 years reveals her trying with uneven success to rejuvenate the once-fertile acreage of international Conceptualism and Postminimalist formalism and, closer to home, that of Italian Arte Povera. Her work is smart, sometimes funny but emotionally stifled and calculated to the point of lifelessness. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Renaissance Venice: Drawings From the Morgan' (through Sept. 23) As in Venice, getting lost is inevitable in this show of Venetian works from the Morgan's sizable Italian drawings collection. All roads lead to Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese, but detours to lesser-known figures (like Palma Giovane and Giulio Campagnola) are to be expected. Along with drawings, the show includes rare maps and books that reflect Venice's status as Europe's printing and shipping capital. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Josef Albers in America: Painting on Paper' (through Oct. 14) Yoga was probably far from Josef Albers's mind when he was working on the series of color-saturated paintings he called ''Homage to the Square.'' But deep meditation, in the form of hard work, was built into the project, which went on for a quarter of a century. And the bliss of hard work is the subject of this beautiful show about an artist's hands-on research and learning-as-you go experimentation. Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Biblical Arts: 'The Adoration of the Magi by Bartolo di Fredi: A Masterpiece Reconstructed' (through Sept. 9) An astonishing 14th-century Italian painting has, if by miracle, left its home in Siena for the first time and landed at the Museum of Biblical Art in Manhattan as the main attraction of this tiny, perfect exhibition, where it is reunited with two other small paintings. All three were once part of a large multi-panel altarpiece, of which the show has three other exquisite examples. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Alighiero Boetti: Game Plan' (through Oct. 1) The Italian artist Alighiero Boetti (1940-1994) was associated with the sculptural movement known as Arte Povera, but soon went his own political-mystical, time-obsessed way. An early Conceptualist, a precursor of today's global-minded nomad-artist, and a practitioner of relational aesthetics before the fact, he made art from cake doilies and cement and opened an artists' hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, where he also commissioned local women to weave brilliantly colored, no-two-alike tapestries depicting maps of the changing world. This magical retrospective stretches from MoMA's sixth floor, to its atrium, and into its Sculpture Garden. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist's Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets' (through Jan. 7) The first major museum retrospective devoted to the strange puppet-haunted universe unleashed in the Quay Brothers' stop-action film animations includes their magical miniature stage sets, a sizable sampling of drawings, prints, collages and early illustration designs as well as works by artists who influenced them. More than 30 years of animated and live-action shorts, television commercials, music videos and imaginative documentaries in particular allow devotees and neophytes alike to grasp the essence of Timothy and Stephen Quay's achievement and its evolution, strengths and weaknesses all. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Century of the Child: Growing by Design, 1900 -- 2000' (through Nov. 5) This big, wonderful show at the Museum of Modern Art examines the intersection of modern design and modern thinking about children. A richly thought-provoking study of a great subject, it is loaded with intriguing things to look at -- some 500 items, including furniture, toys, games, posters, books and much more. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of the City of New York: 'London Street Photography' (through Dec. 2) Arriving from the Museum of London, which presented it in 2010 and owns the more than 150 works on view, this exhibition affords those of us watching the Olympics on TV a glimpse of an older, more eccentric city. It covers the Victorian era to the present, and is particularly rich in images from the mid-20th century. A smaller companion exhibition, ''City Scenes: Highlights of New York Street Photography,'' provides an opportunity to compare and contrast two very different modern cities as they grappled with war, the postindustrial era and various forms of social tension. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'Ghosts in the Machine (through Sept. 30) This ambitious, multitasking if over-thought exhibition delves into our relationship with machines through eclectic groupings of often unfamiliar art, quasi-art and non-art from the last half-century or so. Op Art, Kinetic Art and computer-made films and drawings are revisited as are the efforts of machine-obsessed outsider artists. Fascinating environmental works by Stan VanDerBeek, Richard Hamilton and Gianni Colombo are resurrected. Some things are merely period pieces, but generally the theme-show format takes on a new sense of poetry, psychological depth and history. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Queens Museum of Art: 'Her Stories: Fifteen Years of the South Asian Women's Creative Collective' (through Oct. 7) The South Asian Women's Creative Collective was founded by the artist Jaishri Abichandani in New York City in 1997, when identity politics had been in the air for a while, but artists from much of the Asian diaspora were still being given the cold shoulder by the mainstream art world. By providing strength-in-numbers support and access to resources, the collective helped move a generation of artists ahead, as this tightly packed power generator of an anniversary survey demonstrates. Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Candid: The Lens and Life of Homai Vyarawalla' (through Jan. 14) The Indian photojournalist Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012) was on the spot time and again to record the history of modern South Asia being made. This small, evocative, event-filled retrospective catches highlights of her career, including her coverage of Mohandas Gandhi's funeral; important events in the career of the charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru; and visits from Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Jacqueline Kennedy. As one of the few female photographers in the Indian press corps in her day, Ms. Vyarawalla was a pioneer; in 1970 she abruptly put down her camera and disappeared until her recent rediscovery by younger peers. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
Rubin Museum of Art: 'Modernist Art From India: Approaching Abstraction' (through Oct. 16) This show, the second in a series of three more or less consecutive exhibitions on Indian modernism of the postcolonial period, finds Indian painters gradually and selectively moving away from the figure -- both on canvas and, sometimes, in experiments with film. ''Abstraction,'' here, isn't always formal; it can mean breaking with narrative, as in Tyeb Mehta's film ''Koodal,'' which combines images of cows headed for slaughter, crowds massing at Gandhi's funeral, and the gyrations of a self-flagellating dancer. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; South Street Seaport Museum: 'Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions' (through Oct. 7) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan -- seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather -- but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city's great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Caribbean: Crossroads of the World' (through Oct. 21) In size, cultural scope and freshness of material, the three-museum exhibition ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World'' is the big art event of the summer season in New York City, itself one of the largest Caribbean cities in the world. Be warned: the thematically arranged show throws you into history at the deep end. Almost all the information is strictly visual; there are very few explanatory labels anywhere. But the visuals are so rich, and interact so provocatively, that you may well be inspired to go out and do some homework and come back for a second look. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. Also on display: through Jan. 6 at El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; and through Jan. 6 at Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Primary Sources: Artists in Residence 2011-2012' (through Oct. 21) The accent is on Africa in the Studio Museum's latest artist-in-residence showcase. Two of the three participants were born there -- Njideka Akunyili in Nigeria in 1983, Meleko Mokgosi in Botswana in 1981 -- and their experience of it is a wellspring for very different and accomplished kinds of painting. The show's third artist, Xaviera Simmons, born in New York City in 1974, plays audacious photographic games with the African in African-American, and proves herself once again, as she has in the past, a thinker's artist. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Sharon Hayes: There's so much I want to say to you' (through Sept. 9) In her performances and sound installations, Sharon Hayes -- the subject of this mid-career Whitney solo -- mashes up soapbox rants and romantic monologues, diatribes and cris de coeur, all delivered in her own bell-clear, strident voice. That voice, and the sophisticated rhetorical ear that supplies it with material, are Ms. Hayes's strongest assets. When she uses them, she is entrancing and original. But when she veers into conceptual photography and installation -- a grid of fliers tacked to the wall, for instance -- she is at risk of losing her audience. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Yayoi Kusama: Fireflies on the Water' (through Oct. 28) Although it was during a decade-plus stay in the United States in the 1960s that the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, now 83, produced her best-known work -- eyelet-patterned abstract paintings, furniture bristling with soft-sculpture phalluses, and polka-dot designs suitable to any and every surface -- some of her most complex and personal art appeared before she left Japan and immediately after she returned there permanently in the early 1970s. The Whitney gives a synoptic, transcultural look at her career in a retrospective that originated at the Tate Modern in London. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Oskar Fischinger: Space Light Art -- A Film Environment' (through Oct. 28) Projected on three adjoining screens, ''Light Space Art'' floods your retinas with intensely colorful, pulsating circles, flowing lines and blinking rectangles. A found film clip shows a spinning globe and the momentary, cartoon apparition of a young girl in a hooded, fur-trimmed coat. Oskar Fischinger created the original film footage in Weimar-era Germany. Newly restored and digitized, it still generates an exhilarating phantasmagoria of abstraction and metaphor. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Signs & Symbols' (through Oct. 28) In the 1950s, Americans were running out of ways to keep their works new and responsive to a world shaken to the core by World War II. For some the solution was passive-aggressive withdrawal into archaic myth, oracular symbolism and private language. Sampling this trend with works from the Whitney's permanent collection, this show presents lugubriously portentous paintings by hall of famers like Rothko and Pollock and by many journeyman players like Mark Tobey and Forrest Bess. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson)
Galleries: Uptown
Frank Stella: 'New Work' (through Sept. 27) Around 50 years ago, this erstwhile Minimalist changed the history of art, but kept on moving, to the dismay of many. Whatever you think of his latest polychrome reliefs -- which seem overly refined and a bit mechanical -- they continue a line of reasoning that began with his influential stripe paintings, bespeak a fervent faith in abstraction as a vibrant life force and suggest that the main basis for artistic development lies in the evolution of some kind of form. FreedmanArt, 25 East 73rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 249-2040, freedmanart.com. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
Julika Rudelius: 'Rituals of Capitalism' (through Sept. 8) Julika Rudelius shows young adults in moments of self-consciousness and vulnerability that are less personal than they are symptomatic of larger cultural growing pains. Her latest solo show centers on ''Rituals'' (2012), a beguiling but intermittently troubling video shot in Guangzhou, China. In it pixieish young men preen for the camera in the middle of bustling streets and loll around on rolls of fabric in busy market stalls. Sex and commerce intertwine in ways that are sometimes familiar to Western viewers and sometimes totally alien. Leo Koenig, 541 and 545 West 23rd Street, (212) 334-9255, leokoenig.com. (Rosenberg)
Galleries: Other
'Inside the Banana' (through Sept. 22) The meaning of this curiously diverse group show's title is anyone's guess, but the exhibition's most attention-grabbing thing is a different species of fruit: a giant bunch of green grapes hanging from the ceiling. Conceived by Adriana Lara, it is made of inflated balloons attached to a found tree branch. Also, Tabor Robak's five-minute video ''Vatican Vibes,'' a sci-fi joy ride resembling an elaborate commercial for a video game revolving around mysteries of the Roman Catholic Church, is a knockout. Algus Greenspon, 71 Morton Street, (212) 255-7872, algusgreenspon.com. (Johnson)
'Monet's Garden' (through Oct. 21) From 1883 to the end of his life in 1926, Claude Monet presided over his estate in Giverny, working at flower gardening with as much industry and creativity as he did on his paintings. The main attraction here is a living abbreviated approximation of the two major gardens that he designed and planted: one in traditional, orderly French style, the other a Japanese-inspired fantasia of water, blooming water lilies and weeping willows. It is far from the real thing, but there are moments of astounding beauty. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway (Exit 7W) and Fordham Road, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700, nybg.org. (Johnson)
'The Murder of Crows' (through Sept. 9) With its violent dream sequences, dark symbolism and references to fascism, this 29-minute sound installation from 2008 explores the nightmarish repercussions of Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller's spatial-aural illusionism. Visitors hear the chanting of Tibetan nuns, an aria, a lullaby and a Russian war anthem commissioned by Stalin, as well as Ms. Cardiff's murmuring voice (which emanates from a gramophone). Though the piece has an excellent setting in the armory's enormous darkened Drill Hall, it's not quite the ''requiem for our age'' that the artists envisioned. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 616-3930, armoryonpark.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; 'A Poet's Circle' and 'Bettissima: Treasures From the Elizabeth Kray Archive' (through Oct. 9) Poets House, a quarter-century old this year, is celebrating with small shows dedicated to its founders, the poet Stanley Kunitz (1905-2006) and the arts administrator Elizabeth Kray (1916-87). Many of Mr. Kunitz's friends were artists, and his exhibition, organized by Jason Andrew, consists of work by several of them, including Jack Tworkov, Saul Steinberg and Philip Guston, who works Kunitz's words into his art. Poets House, 10 River Terrace, at Murray Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 431-7920, poetshouse.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
Public Art
'Common Ground' (through Nov. 30) Located on a site known in the 17th century as the Commons -- which also served as the site of Bloombergville, the precursor to Occupy Wall Street one year ago -- this show offers some incendiary critiques. Ian Hamilton Finlay's group of stone slabs arranged on a patch of grass includes inscriptions from the writings of Louis de Saint-Just (1767-94), a French Revolutionary leader. Paul McCarthy's ''Daddies Ketchup'' (2001), a huge inflatable bottle of ketchup makes a Neo-Pop-psychoanalytic connection between patriarchy and power, and Elmgreen & Dragset's aluminum bullhorn housed in a slick, industrial vitrine evokes protesters in Zuccotti Park, who were forbidden from using any amplification devices, developed a signature form of analogue augmentation, the ''people's microphone.'' City Hall Park, Public Art Fund, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Out of Town
'Anti-Establishment' (through Dec. 21) Contrary to this muddled exhibition's title, the artists it presents are not uncompromising rebels. The show's curator, Johanna Burton, avers that they imagine ''novel collective relationships and emergent models of engaged citizenship,'' but much of the work is more self-reflexively preoccupied with art than with worldly affairs. Best of all is a room full of Abstract Expressionist-style paintings made with Day-Glo paints by Jacqueline Humphries displayed under ultra violet light. It is a lushly visual trip. Hessel Museum of Art, Bard College Center for Curatorial Studies, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
Bowdoin College Museum of Art: William Wegman: 'Hello Nature' (through Oct. 21) As its title implies, this beguiling show surveys the erstwhile Conceptual pioneer's lifelong attachment to nature, especially as evidenced in his characteristically witty, offhand works of the past two decades. Included are drawings, collages, photographs and altered photographs, as well as photographs and a 25-minute movie featuring his signature, endlessly cooperative Weimaraners. Also on hand are numerous examples of his efforts in painting, which he took up again in 1985, made with and without postcards. Bowdoin College Museum of Art, 9400 College Station, Brunswick, Me., (207) 725-3275, bowdoin.edu/art-museum. (Smith)
'From 199A to 199B: Liam Gillick' (through Dec. 21) Mr. Gillick is a nearly ubiquitous figure on the international art scene as a conceptual artist, speaker, writer and collaborator with other luminaries like Rirkrit Tiravanija and Pierre Huyghe. He designs shiny, quasi-architectural sculptures for sale in commercial galleries, but here the focus is on politically motivated conceptual projects from the 1990s. If sociology and ideology are your things, this show is for you. Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
Mike Kelley: '1954 -- 2012' (through Sept. 16) During the last decade of his life, Mike Kelley was working on an ambitious project revolving around Kandor, a city on Krypton that was miniaturized and bottled by the evil Brainiac and recovered by Superman, who kept it in his Fortress of Solitude. This illuminating exhibition includes videos and sculptures from that series as well as a selection of exuberantly anarchic videos that Mr. Kelley made early in his career in collaboration with Paul McCarthy, Tony Oursler and other artists. Watermill Center, 39 Watermill Towd Road, Water Mill, N.Y., (631) 726-4628, watermillcenter.org. (Johnson)
National Gallery of Art: 'Elegance and Refinement: The Still-Life Paintings of Willem van Aelst' (through Oct. 14) Still-life painting bloomed like never before in the Netherlands in the 17th century, and among its most coveted blossoms were those of Willem van Aelst (1627-83), the subject of this small, intense exhibition of 28 paintings. Van Aelst painted the sorts of objects customary among his fellow still-life producers -- flowers in ornate, precious vases; ripe fruit; dead game animals; and hunting gear -- achieving at best a nearly hallucinatory realism. Constitution Avenue NW, between Third and Ninth Streets, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)
Last Chance
&#x2605; American Folk Art Museum: 'Jubilation | Rumination: Life, Real and Imagined' (closes on Sunday) Having escaped the ugly, West 53rd Street tomb of a building it inhabited from 2001 to 2011, the American Folk Art Museum has reoccupied its old space on Lincoln Square. This wonderful show of about 100 works from the permanent collection samples all the varieties of artistic expression under the museum's purview, from portraits and quilts by anonymous craftspeople to otherworldly fantasies envisioned by so-called Outsiders like Henry Darger and Martin Ramírez. The revival of this irreplaceable institution is cause for rejoicing. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Johnson)
'Creature From the Blue Lagoon' (closes on Monday) The campy-but-relaxed vibe of the Martos Gallery's annual summer group show, now in its third edition, hasn't changed much from one summer to the next. Nor has the artist list, which includes Davina Semo, Darren Bader, Virginia Overton and Ryan Foerster among the repeat participants. But this version (organized, as in previous years, by the independent curator and critic Bob Nickas) is the most ambitious, with large-scale installations in the attic and pool house joining the usual smattering of smaller, site-specific works. Martos Gallery Summer Location, 112 Sagaponack Road, Bridgehampton, N.Y., (631) 613-6698, martosgallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Alex Gingrow: 'All the money IS in the label' (closes on Saturday) With deadpan wit, Ms. Gingrow nips the hands that feed her. Each of her paintings copies a different provenance label from familiar Chelsea dealers. All identify Ms. Gingrow herself as the artist. The twist comes in the improbable titles, many of which seem to be quoting inane, gossipy conversations overheard at exhibition openings. One referring to a well-known dealer and his successful artist reads, ''Betcha Zach Pays Dana on Time.'' Mike Weiss, 520 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6899, mikeweissgallery.com. (Johnson)
'Graphic Design -- Now in Production' (closes on Monday) This exhibition of posters, books, magazines, typography, branding and film and television graphics created since 2000, and organized by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, vacillates between design made for industry and design that critiques it. The catalog was inspired by ''The Last Whole Earth Catalog'' and includes essays riffing on Walter Benjamin and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's post-Marxist anti-globalization epic, ''Empire'' (2000). Avant-garde practices inform posters by the Amsterdam design firm Experimental Jetset, David Pearson and Angus Hyland's book designs, and a series of eco-conscious Green Patriot Posters that dovetail with the concerns of the Occupy movement -- which, oddly, has barely tapped the radical power of graphic design. Building 110 on Governors Island, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Schwendener)
International Center of Photography: 'Christer StrOmholm: Les Amies de Place Blanche' (closes on Sunday) In Paris in the mid-1950s the Swedish photographer Christer Stromholm (1918-2002) gravitated to the red-light district around the Place Blanche, where he was drawn to a subculture of cross-dressing young men, many of whom worked as prostitutes to earn enough money for sex-change operations. He hung out with them for more than a decade and photographed them on the street at night and in bars and hotel rooms with a coolly affectionate eye. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'Weegee: Murder Is My Business' (closes on Sunday) From the home of Weegee's voluminous archive, the latest exhibition about this great documentary photographer (1899-1968) revisits his frenetic, formative first decade of work, starting in 1935, when his often sensational images of murder and mayhem appeared in New York's daily newspapers. His penchant for self-promotion, the work of his competitors and peers, the evolution of tabloid journalism and the great city that was both his subject and his audience are emphasized, with fresh curatorial precision and deftly used touch screens. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Bellini, Titian, and Lotto: North Italian Paintings From the Accademia Carrara, Bergamo' (closes on Monday) The title of this selection of 15 paintings on loan from an Italian museum is misleading: only one of the paintings is a Bellini -- a pieta -- and the attribution to a young Titian of a weird small landscape illustrating the story of Orpheus and Eurydice remains uncertain. What is interesting over all is the trend from Christian metaphysics to empirical realism, from Vincenzo Foppa's nearly surrealistic Crucifixion scene from the mid-15th century to Giovanni Battista Moroni's amazingly sensitive, almost photographic portrait of a little girl from 1570. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ellsworth Kelly Plant Drawings' (closes on Monday) This is the first museum show to focus on Ellsworth Kelly's plant drawings, which he has called ''a kind of bridge to a way of seeing that was the basis of the very first abstract paintings.'' These works are, for the most part, contour drawings of leaves, stems and flowers done in clean strokes of pencil or pen and centered on the page. They reveal an almost mystical appreciation of abstraction in the natural world, one shared by other American artists like Georgia O'Keeffe and Charles Burchfield. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Dürer and Beyond: Central European Drawings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1400 -- 1700' (closes on Monday) How do we get beyond Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528), the ne plus ultra draftsman and all-around Northern Renaissance master, an artist so secure in his greatness that he painted himself as Jesus? We don't, at least not often in this show, which surveys the Met's holdings of drawings made before 1700 by artists working in the Holy Roman Empire. But the offerings should nevertheless entice viewers to look more closely at the art of Central Europe, which absorbed diverse religious and stylistic influences from Italian, Dutch and Flemish art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Bruce Nauman: 'One Hundred Fish Fountain' (closes on Friday) The single room-filling work here is an actual working fountain. Bronze casts of real fish -- catfish, bass, whitefish and other species -- are suspended by wires from the ceiling at different heights. Each is a hollow container from which water spurts in slender streams through multiple little perforations, falling like rain into a broad, shallow basin below. Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com. (Johnson)
New Museum: 'The Parade: Nathalie Djurberg with Music by Hans Berg' (closes on Sunday) Working with colored clay and all kinds of other sculptural materials, Ms. Djurberg confects short, stop-action movies involving sexual weirdness and grotesque violence. They are funny and disturbing. The 80 bird sculptures made of fabric, paint and other materials filling the gallery's floor space add more color than substance. 231 Bowery, (212) 219-1222, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Gauguin, Cézanne, Matisse: Visions of Arcadia' (closes on Monday) At the center of this otherwise disappointing exhibition a lively conversation about pastoral bliss is going on between three major works by the titular artists: Gauguin's ''Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?''; Cézanne's ''Large Bathers''; and Matisse's ''Bathers by a River.'' Henri Rousseau's ''Dream'' has a say, too.

HEADLINE: Race for Gas by Cypriot Rivals Adds to Tensions

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
SINIRUSTU, Cyprus -- The island of Cyprus, split by one of Europe's most intractable ethnic conflicts, is now the focus of another contest, over who will control the significant natural gas wealth found in nearby waters. The question is whether the gas discovery will become an incentive for the two sides to cooperate, or yet another obstacle to reunification of the island.
The early indications are not promising. The two halves of the island -- the mainly Turkish-speaking north, occupied by Turkey since an invasion 38 years ago, and the internationally recognized, mainly Greek-speaking Republic of Cyprus in the south -- are racing this summer to see who can tap the gas first.
This competition adds a new layer of potential instability along Europe's southern fringe, where the euro crisis has sown political and economic turmoil and relations between Greece and Turkey, and Turkey and Israel, are already fraught with tensions. 
A lot of energy is at stake. Beneath the seabed of the Levant Basin near Cyprus is an estimated 122 trillion cubic feet of gas, about as much as the world consumes in a year, according to the United States Geological Survey. The northern part of the basin lies in Cypriot waters, with much of the rest in Israeli or Lebanese waters.
An American company, Noble Energy, based in Houston, is leading the offshore drilling in the region and has announced finds of 35 trillion cubic feet, with about 20 percent of it in Cypriot waters. Noble is working with Israeli partners under license from Greek Cypriot leaders, many of whom regard the undersea area as theirs to exploit as they please, at least for now.
But the northern Cypriots say the drilling is illegal because it does not take into account their competing claims to the island and its surrounding waters. They have called on energy companies to halt drilling, and on Cyprus to stop issuing licenses.
Turkey, too, is unhappy with the drilling and has threatened to send its navy if necessary. To underscore their displeasure, the Turks have erected a large oil and gas exploration rig on a hill above Sinirustu, a village near the north coast of Cyprus, and have festooned it with flags.
''Maybe war could explode again here,'' said Fikret Akan, 29, a Turkish-speaking resident of the village who works at a fuel depot in a nearby town. ''Turkey, Israel and the United States all could start fighting over these resources.''
The United Nations, which supervises a buffer zone between the north and south, has hailed the gas discoveries as a way of generating wealth that could finance a reunification of Cyprus. But Mr. Akan's fears about a greater conflict may not be entirely unfounded.
Even before any gas has been produced, the discoveries have created ''risks, big risks, as well as a myriad of legal issues,'' Richard L. Morningstar said in March when he was the United States special envoy for Eurasian energy, adding that the issues ''go beyond Cyprus, they go beyond Israel, they go beyond Greece -- they affect the whole region.''
This year, the United States established its first regional headquarters for a new Bureau of Energy Resources in Cyprus. Although it, too, has urged a fair distribution of resources between the halves, Washington has strongly supported the right of the recognized government of Cyprus, a member of the European Union, to drill in its waters.
That forceful backing may have reinforced the Greek Cypriot leaders' unwillingness to divide oil and gas wealth with the Turkish Cypriots, at least for now. ''Don't speak about sharing,'' Neoklis Sylikiotis, the Cypriot commerce minister, said during a recent interview. Only after the division of the island is resolved can the revenue be shared, he said.
As attitudes harden, the northerners have mapped out blocks of the eastern Mediterranean for licensing that roughly overlap waters claimed by the Cyprus government. The Turkish government has acknowledged that one vessel chartered by the Turkish Petroleum Corporation had made seismic surveys on behalf of northern Cyprus in waters that overlap Cypriot claims. And the northerners have begun their own onshore explorations, starting in Sinirustu.
Greek Cypriot officials like Mr. Sylikiotis dismiss the exploratory drilling in Sinirustu -- which they call by its Greek name, Syngrasis -- as nothing more than a theatrical stunt. But the drilling work has gone ahead at full speed this summer. A heady, sulfurous odor created by the mixture of drilling fluids and mud hung in the air over the village despite a warm breeze.
Clad in red overalls bearing the logo of Turkish Petroleum, Ekrem Akyuz, 29, one of the Turkish engineers overseeing the site, shared a watermelon with colleagues in one of the dozens of air-conditioned trailers that surround the drilling rig. Mr. Akyuz said the geological data from the site were being kept unusually secure, making it hard to judge whether the area was promising. But he said the project was technically similar to wells he had drilled in other parts of the world.
''Maybe Turkey can produce first, or maybe Cyprus can produce first,'' Mr. Akyuz said. ''We just don't know yet.''
Cyprus could produce enough gas to earn $2.2 billion to $3.1 billion a year at current prices by the early 2020s, according to Sohbet Karbuz, the director of hydrocarbons at the Observatoire Méditerranéen de l'Energie, an association of Mediterranean energy companies. The closest natural customer is Turkey, which imports most of its oil and gas.
Despite the saber rattling by the Turkish government over the Cypriots' offshore exploration, 15 companies and consortia, including Marathon Oil of the United States and Enel of Italy, submitted bids this year on nine additional blocks of seabed. Turkey has since warned those bidders they ''will in no way be allowed to take part in Turkey's future energy projects.'' It also pledged to ''give every support'' to maritime territorial claims by northern Cyprus, which it alone recognizes as an independent state.
The drilling has also become entangled in the rupture between Turkey and Israel, whose friendly relations soured after Israeli commandos raided a ship in 2010 when it was sailing to Gaza in defiance of the Israeli naval blockade; nine activists, most of them Turkish citizens, died in the raid.
Israel has since turned to Cyprus as a regional partner, signing defense and cooperation agreements this year partly aimed at protecting their neighboring gas fields.
In May the tensions between Turkey and Israel spread to the skies above the island, when the Turkish Army command said its fighter jets chased an Israeli plane out of northern Cypriot airspace. That same month, Cyprus denied a report that Israel planned to deploy 20,000 troops in Cyprus to protect Israelis working on energy projects.
The fickle politics of the Middle East are another potential obstacle for Cypriot ambitions.
''What if Turkey and Israel find some face-saving way for Israel to apologize for the Marmara incident, and Israel pipes gas direct to Turkey?'' asked Fiona Mullen, an analyst at Sapienta Economics in Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, referring to the raided ship. ''Cyprus could be left high and dry.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Rises as Jobless Claims Hold Steady

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Consumer spending got off to a firm start in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, rising by the most in five months and offering hope that economic growth will pick up this quarter. 
Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits held steady last week.
The reports were consistent with only moderate economic and job growth, however, and they kept alive the prospect of additional monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve.
''The economy does not seem to be faltering or going into reverse,'' said Chris Rupkey, the chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. ''For a Fed that thinks the economy is not good enough, the data today is not consistent with 3 percent-plus growth or a falling unemployment rate.''
Officials at the central bank are debating whether a third round of bond purchases is warranted to spur a stronger recovery. Investors will look to a speech on Friday by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, for clues on the Fed's next step.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending increased 0.4 percent in July after a flat reading in June. The rise was in line with economists' expectations.
With a gauge of prices holding steady, spending was also up 0.4 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis, which was also the largest increase since February.
While separate reports from retailers indicated some of the spending momentum carried into August, economists expect spending to cool a bit in the months ahead because of sluggish income growth and a recent rise in gasoline prices.
A range of retail outlets, including Costco and Limited Brands, posted better-than-expected sales gains.
''There was some pent-up demand after soft spending through the second quarter,'' said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica in Dallas. ''What we are going to need to see is consumer confidence holding its own and moderate job growth for that to continue through the third quarter. Those two key issues are still in doubt.''
The Labor Department said first-time applications for state unemployment benefits were unchanged last week at 374,000. The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of trends, rose 1,500, to 370,250, a level economists view as consistent with sluggish hiring.
The level of new claims last week was 10,000 above where it stood at the beginning of the month, suggesting that job growth moderated. In July employers added 163,000 workers, which was a step up from June, when the economy created only 64,000 new jobs.
Even though data on consumer spending and housing suggests economic activity picked up early in the third quarter, business spending is weakening and inflation is slowing.

HEADLINE: The Tall Man

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
Strange and sneaky and driven by a fury that only slowly reveals itself, ''The Tall Man'' opens like a ghost story and closes with its feet firmly in the real world. Until then, Pascal Laugier's chilly little thriller manhandles our sympathies and gladdens our eyes in almost equal measure. 
For years children have been disappearing from Cold Rock, a depressed mining town. Jumpy residents whisper about a mysterious stranger who snatches little ones in the dead of night, while Julia (a deglamorized Jessica Biel), the town's widowed nurse, ministers to those who remain. Then, in one breathtakingly creepy sequence, Julia's own toddler is taken, and the story appears to lose its mind. It will eventually return, though probably not in the way you expect.
Like an early Stephen King novella, ''The Tall Man'' buzzes with small-town secrets and downtrodden paranoia. Here the unemployed gather in conspiratorial huddles, and a single mother (an exceptional Samantha Ferris) refuses to fire the handyman who threatens both her daughters.
Filling the screen with dense pine forests and panicky strings, Mr. Laugier stirs apprehension, flirting with ''Jeepers Creepers''-style horror and murder mystery psychodrama. But ultimately his story draws more energy from class than from criminality: awash in sludgy browns and rotting greens -- the colors of poverty and decomposition -- this unpredictable oddity is a little bonkers but a lot original.
''The Tall Man'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Twisted morals and straight-up scares.
Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Pascal Laugier 1 hour 46 minutes

HEADLINE: Shulamith Firestone, 67, Feminist Writer, Is Dead

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Shulamith Firestone, a widely quoted feminist writer who published her arresting first book, ''The Dialectic of Sex,'' at 25, only to withdraw from public life soon afterward, was found dead on Tuesday in her apartment in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan. She was 67.
Ms. Firestone apparently died of natural causes, her sister Laya Firestone Seghi said. 
Subtitled ''The Case for Feminist Revolution,'' ''The Dialectic of Sex'' was published by William Morrow & Company in 1970. In it, Ms. Firestone extended Marxist theories of class oppression to offer a radical analysis of the oppression of women, arguing that sexual inequity springs from the onus of childbearing, which devolves on women by pure biological happenstance.
''Just as the end goal of socialist revolution was not only the elimination of the economic class privilege but of the economic class distinction itself,'' Ms. Firestone wrote, ''so the end goal of feminist revolution must be ... not just the elimination of male privilege but of the sex distinction itself: genital differences between human beings would no longer matter culturally.''
In the utopian future Ms. Firestone envisioned, reproduction would be utterly divorced from sex: conception would be accomplished through artificial insemination, with gestation taking place outside the body in an artificial womb. While some critics found her proposals visionary, others deemed them quixotic at best.
Reviewing ''The Dialectic of Sex'' in The New York Times, John Leonard wrote, ''A sharp and often brilliant mind is at work here.'' But, he added, ''Miss Firestone is preposterous in asserting that 'men can't love.' ''
The book, which was translated into several languages, hurtled Ms. Firestone into the front ranks of second-wave feminists, alongside women like Betty Friedan, Kate Millett and Germaine Greer. It remains widely taught in college women's-studies courses.
A painter by training, Ms. Firestone never anticipated a high-profile career as a writer; she had come to writing through preparing manifestoes for several feminist organizations she had helped found.
The crush of attention, positive and negative, that her book engendered soon proved unbearable, her sister said. In the years that followed, Ms. Firestone retreated into a quiet, largely solitary life of painting and writing, though she published little.
Her only other book, ''Airless Spaces,'' was issued in 1998 by the experimental publisher Semiotext(e). A memoir-in-stories that employs fictional forms to recount real-life events, it describes Ms. Firestone's hospitalization with schizophrenia, which by the 1980s had overtaken her.
The second of six children of Orthodox Jewish parents, Shulamith Bath Shmuel Ben Ari Feuerstein was born in Ottawa on Jan. 7, 1945, and reared in Kansas City, Mo., and St. Louis.
The family Americanized its surname to Firestone when Shulamith was a child; Ms. Firestone pronounced her first name shoo-LAH-mith but was familiarly known as Shuley or Shulie.
After attending Washington University in St. Louis, Ms. Firestone earned a bachelor of fine arts degree from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1967. Around that time she helped found the Westside Group, a Chicago feminist organization, before moving to New York.
There, she was a founder of three feminist organizations -- New York Radical Women, the Redstockings and New York Radical Feminists -- begun as alternatives to mainstream groups like the National Organization for Women.
Ms. Firestone came to renewed attention in 1997 with the release of ''Shulie,'' an independent film by Elisabeth Subrin. Ms. Subrin's 37-minute film is a shot-for-shot remake of an earlier, little-seen documentary, also titled ''Shulie,'' made in 1967 by four male graduate students at Northwestern University.
The 1967 film, part of a documentary series on the younger generation, profiles Ms. Firestone, then an unknown art student, as she paints, talks about her life as a young woman and undergoes a grueling review of her work by a panel of male professors.
In the 1997 remake, conceived as a backward look at a social landscape that seemed to have changed strikingly little in 30 years, Ms. Firestone is portrayed by an actress, Kim Soss. Her dialogue is uttered verbatim from the original documentary.
Ms. Subrin's film, which was shown at the New York Film Festival, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Biennial and elsewhere, was well received by critics. But it distressed Ms. Firestone, who said she was upset that she had not been consulted in the course of its creation, her sister said this week.
In an interview on Thursday, Ms. Subrin said that she had sent Ms. Firestone a rough cut of her film through an intermediary. The intermediary later told her, she said, that Ms. Firestone ''could appreciate it as a labor of love, but she hated the original film and didn't see how my film was different.''
Besides her sister Laya, Ms. Firestone is survived by her mother, Kate Firestone Shiftan; two brothers, Ezra and Nechemia; and another sister, Miriam Tirzah Firestone.
In ''Airless Spaces,'' Ms. Firestone writes of life after hospitalization, on psychiatric medication. The account is in the third person, but the story is her own:
''She had been reading Dante's 'Inferno' when first she went into the hospital, she remembered, and at quite a good clip too, but when she came out she couldn't even get down a fashion rag. ... That left getting through the blank days as comfortably as possible, trying not to sink under the boredom and total loss of hope.''
The story continues: ''She was lucid, yes, at what price. She sometimes recognized on the faces of others joy and ambition and other emotions she could recall having had once, long ago. But her life was ruined, and she had no salvage plan.''

HEADLINE: British Treasures

BYLINE: By ELEANOR STANFORD

 BODY:
The fertile Thames valley soil of our childhood garden would occasionally yield small treasures. For many years my brothers and I would run unsteadily to our mother with a broken clay pipe or shard of willow-patterned china clasped in our grubby palms. We would ask eagerly about their original owners: Who were they, these shadowy ''Tudors'' who had originally lived in the house we knew so well? Who would have eaten from those complete blue-and-white plates? The echoes of previous generations of residents became interwoven with our own lives in the rambling family home.
This was never more true than when my grandfather found a small coin in our flower bed nearly 20 years ago. Soft and dark from the touch of many hands, its markings were slightly off center. My grandfather is a lifelong teacher of history, raconteur and observer of patterns and connections. He immediately saw the secrets and fragmentations of the past contained in this small coin. 
The coin is a copper farthing, he explained to us all, minted in 1672 and evidence of attempts to resolve a financial crisis in the 17th century. Following the restoration of the British monarchy in 1660, coins of small monetary value were in short supply. People began hoarding newly issued silver pennies and two pences, the coins' intrinsic value being greater than their stated worth. As a final straw, in August 1672 a royal proclamation announced the introduction of copper half pennies and farthings (quarter pennies) made from comparatively cheap copper. The coin found in our garden is such an example.
The copper farthing was the first coin to sport a seated woman as Britannia, the Roman personification of the British Isles. The ''Merrie Monarch,'' King Charles II, my grandfather told me with a smile, was famous for his enthusiastic pursuit of women and entertainment. He chose the beautiful Duchess of Richmond as the model for Britannia.
Although then known for her virtue, she is nonetheless thought to have mothered an illegitimate child by the king. A variation on her likeness remained on coins for some 300 years. A king's mistress passing through thousands upon thousands of hands. A king's mistress embodying the ideals of the British nations for centuries.
The coin was found not long after my parents had returned from living in Greenwich, Connecticut, with two small children in tow. The Duchess of Richmond seemed to welcome them back to their native England, a tiny personality from the rich roll call of hidden stories that make up our shared cultural past.
This summer it was my turn to return to England from a life in foreign lands. I found we were choosing personifications of Britain based on rather different physical pursuits. The London Olympics saw both the British media and public turn away from actresses' bikini bodies and footballers' bedrooms to erupt in rare patriotic fever. Eighty-eight percent of the public watched Olympic coverage on television. Thousands of people volunteered. Thousands took to the streets to welcome medal winners back to their local towns.
These Olympians represent disparate backgrounds, telling of very different experiences that are finally starting to be accepted as equally and gloriously British. Jessica Ennis, the golden girl born to a social worker mother and Jamaican father. The diver Tom Daly, who spoke publicly at 13 about how he was bullied for his precocious talent. Mo Farah emigrated from Somalia at the age of eight, barely speaking English, and today represents Britain as the world's fastest long-distance runner. Their faces continue to burst from the covers of newspapers and magazines, as well as from commemorative Olympic stamps.
As the Paralympic Games get under way in London, with the most extensive television coverage of these games Britain has ever known, even more athletes will emerge to represent our ever-diverse nation.
These faces are as representative of Britain in our time as the Duchess of Richmond was in hers. They, too, will provide cultural relics for later generations, shadows of a past that is our present. Perhaps they will even excite the imagination of a future young girl and her grandfather.

HEADLINE: Burnishing British Brands

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Gu Huini contributed reporting from Shanghai and Neha Thirani from Mumbai.

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- This summer, Jaguar Land Rover cranked up production to 24 hours at its plant near Liverpool, England, adding 1,000 jobs to help meet demand for its hot-selling and acclaimed Range Rover Evoque. Now, the company is readying the release of its much-anticipated Jaguar F-Type roadster.
Four years after being bought by an Indian company, the well-known but somewhat faded British brands are regaining some of their lost luster, racking up big sales from Shanghai to London.
The success has stunned analysts and investors, many of whom had said that Tata Motors, the Indian auto company, was making an expensive mistake when it acquired Jaguar Land Rover from Ford Motor for $2.3 billion in June 2008. At the time, Ford was raising money to ensure its own survival, and it sold the brands for several billion dollars less than it had paid to acquire them years earlier. 
Analysts say Tata has done what few companies from emerging markets have been able to do -- turn around and successfully run a troubled Western company. Many others, including Tata Motor's sister company Tata Steel, which paid $11.3 billion for Corus Steel in 2007, have struggled with acquisitions made in Europe and the United States in the era of cheap money before the financial crisis.
Tata Motors appears to have succeeded in large part because it did not seek to run Jaguar Land Rover from Tata headquarters here. Instead, it has left day-to-day management in the hands of executives in England. It also benefited from projects started under Ford ownership, including the Evoque, which has won fans, including the exacting hosts of the BBC show ''Top Gear'' and the Chinese nouveau riche.
In its last fiscal year, which ended in March, Jaguar Land Rover posted a 27 percent jump in retail sales, to 306,000 vehicles, and became the primary driver of growth and profit for Tata Motors. The Indian car and truck business of Tata has stagnated in the same time because of a slowing domestic economy and a weak product lineup that includes about a dozen passenger cars. Sales of Tata cars were up an anemic 4 percent in the previous fiscal year.
Analysts said that barring a global economic recession, they expected Jaguar Land Rover to continue to do well because it was about to release several new models, including a redesigned version of its flagship Range Rover and the F-Type.
''I think people were a bit skeptical and snobbish and maybe had some old colonial hangover,'' Tim Urquhart, a senior analyst at IHS Automotive in London, said about the initial doubts about the acquisition. But he added, ''If you look at Land Rover and Jaguar now, they probably have the strongest product line in their recent history if not ever.''
Tata's takeover of Jaguar Land Rover did not always look promising. The financial crisis hit soon after the deal closed, and demand for luxury cars tumbled in Europe and North America -- its two biggest markets. Struggling with a $3 billion debt it took on to pay for the deal, Tata Motors was forced to put more money into the company after it failed to secure financial aid from Britain.
Many analysts questioned whether the company paid too much and extended itself too far, speculating that its chairman, Ratan Tata, a car buff and scion of the family that built the Tata group of companies, had become too enamored of buying global brands. Over the years, the group has acquired Tetley Tea, the Pierre Hotel in New York and Daewoo Commercial Vehicles in South Korea.
''The acquisition has worked because the investment has been carefully targeted and effective,'' Phil Popham, global operations director for Jaguar Land Rover, said in a written response to questions. ''Our growth is supported by a disciplined financial plan involving tight cost controls and targeted investments.''
Analysts and competitors credit the turnaround to Tata's financial reserves, which helped it weather tough times, and its wisdom in granting autonomy to managers in England.
''What has helped is that Tata had staying power,'' said an executive at another auto company who asked not to be named because he did not want to speak publicly about a rival. ''And Tata adopted a hands-off policy.''
The Ford effect extends beyond its past investments in the brands and the design and engineering for the Evoque. Most engines in Jaguar Land Rover cars still come from Ford, though the company is building its own engine factory in England.
Led by a former BMW executive, Ralf Speth, who took over as chief executive in early 2010, Jaguar Land Rover makes all of its cars, which range from $36,000 for an entry level S.U.V. to $140,000 for a convertible, in factories in England, though it is now starting assembly operations in other countries. The company reported this month that its latest quarterly profit was up 7.5 percent from a year ago to £235.9 million, or $372 million.
In North America, the company's sales were up 15 percent, to 58,003 cars, in the fiscal year that ended in March. J. D. Power recently rated Jaguar as the ''most improved'' car brand in its quality rankings.
Much of the success has come in China, a country that provided just 1 percent of Jaguar Land Rover's sales as recently as 2005 and is projected to generate sales in the double digits this year. The company made a big effort to expand dealerships in the country, where luxury car sales have been much stronger than in Western markets. Executives expect China to become the company's largest market soon, and last year they announced that Jaguar Land Rover would begin building and assembling cars there.
High-end car buyers in China appear to be drawn to Jaguars and Land Rovers in part because they are considered a novelty.
Liu Gang, a 33-year-old finance executive in Shanghai who confessed to not knowing much about cars, recently bought a Jaguar XF sports sedan, for which he paid 700,000 yuan, or $110,000. He considered and dismissed comparable models from BMW and Mercedes-Benz as passé. ''Let me be honest, it's just a symbol of status,'' he said. ''Anybody in China can have a Mercedes-Benz.''
But analysts say the Jaguar Land Rover's growing reliance on China suggests that a sharp slowdown there and another euro-related shock in Europe could derail its growth. Another concern is whether the company has enough models beside the Evoque to power future sales. The Evoque accounted for 85 percent of sales growth in the last fiscal year even though it was only on sale for the last seven months of the year. By contrast, sales of Jaguars have been relatively muted, increasing just 5 percent in the last fiscal year. More recently, Jaguar posted a 16.3 percent increase in global sales in the first seven months of this year compared with the same period last year.
Mr. Popham said the company expected sales of Jaguars to pick up with the introduction of the F-Type, a long-awaited sequel to its well-known E-Type roadster, which was introduced in 1961 and is considered by many car aficionados as one of the most beautiful sports cars ever made. A production version of the F-Type will make its debut at the Paris Motor Show on Sept. 27.
''A lot is riding on the F-Type roadster,'' said Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of AutoCar India, a Mumbai-based car magazine, adding that Jaguar has made big strides but still has a ''fair amount to do.''
Still, analysts say that for Tata Motors, which recently hired a senior executive from General Motors to help revive its flagging Indian auto business, Jaguar Land Rover is likely to remain a driving force for the near future.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
&#x2605; 'Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry' (R, 1:31, in English and Mandarin) In December 2008 a 24-year-old American, Alison Klayman, as a favor to a friend, started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times. (Manohla Dargis)
'The Amazing Spider-Man' (PG-13, 2:16) Five years after Sam Rami directed his third ''Spider-Man'' installment, Marc Webb returns this lucrative franchise to its origins with Andrew Garfield as the spider-teenager and Emma Stone as the girl. Painless but unnecessary. (Dargis)
'The Apparition' (PG-13, 1:22) Todd Lincoln's horror movie -- about two college grads minding a house overtaken by a specter newly escaped from an afterlife dimension -- is so slight it has an almost wraithlike nontexture itself. Blink and you'll miss it. But no great loss. (Andy Webster) 
&#x2605; 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' (PG-13, 1:33) A blast of joyful, chaotic emotion from the bayou, Benh Zeitlin's dazzling film is a homegrown magic-realist fable of defiance in the face of hardship. A community in a stretch of coastal Louisiana called the Bathtub is menaced by storms and government benevolence. Their ordeal is narrated by a young girl named Hushpuppy (Quvenzhané Wallis ), who lives with her father, Wink (Dwight Henry), and who belongs in the tradition of Huck Finn, Scout Finch, Eloise and other indomitable American child heroes. (A. O. Scott)
'Beloved' (No rating, 2:15, in French) Christophe Honoré's musical melodrama follows, over four decades, the complicated love lives of Madeleine (Ludivine Sagnier in the 1960s and '70s, Catherine Deneuve later) and her daughter, Vera (Chiara Mastroianni). Alex Beaupain's clever pop songs offer more commentary than emotion, but the long, meandering story is full of pathos, comedy and surprise. (Scott)
'The Bourne Legacy' (PG-13, 2:05) Less a thrilling franchise reboot than a solid salvage mission, the fourth installment of the ''Bourne'' spy series replaces Matt Damon with a sympathetic Jeremy Renner, who handles the action persuasively even if the fight sequences lack a sense of regret or even sorrow. As viewers are whisked from location to location, it feels as if the director, Tony Gilroy, is trying too hard to match the accelerated tempo of the previous films. (Dargis)
'Brave' (PG, 1:33) After 17 years of feature filmmaking, Pixar has -- ta-da! -- its first female protagonist, Merida, a brave, ginger-mopped princess who wants to chart her own fate. The animation, as might be expected, is beautiful, but the story is filled with dreary gender clichés. Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman directed and helped write the script. (Dargis)
'The Campaign' (R, 1:25) Two nincompoops run against each other for a seat in Congress. It's not a documentary, but a silly, not very outrageous comedy starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis. (Scott)
'Celeste and Jesse Forever' (R, 1:31) This wistful romantic comedy about love, marriage and never wanting to say you're sorry stars the appealing Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg as a couple who've split up without moving on or out. Written by Ms. Jones and Will McCormack, it was directed by Lee Toland Krieger. (Dargis)
'Chicken With Plums' (PG-13, 1:33, in French) Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud follow ''Persepolis,'' their animated adaptation of Ms. Satrapi's autobiographical graphic novel, with a live-action rendering of a piece of her family's history. Mathieu Amalric plays Nasser Ali, a melancholy violinist in mid-20th-century Tehran whose romantic and artistic torment fuels an oddly gentle and contemplative melodrama. The large French-speaking cast includes Maria de Medeiros as Nasser's wife and Golshifteh Farahani as the great lost love of his youth. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Compliance' (R, 1:30) Raising troubling questions about the influence of class and education on our response to authority, Craig Zobel's squirmy psychological horror movie, based on a series of hoaxes at fast-food restaurants nationwide, is a slow-motion punch to the groin. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
'Cosmopolis' (R, 1:48) David Cronenberg directs this cold, funny adaptation of the 2003 Don DeLillo novel starring Robert Pattinson as a zomboid billionaire, one of the limo riding masters of the universe who, over the course of a long day and night, loses a great deal and, by doing so, becomes human. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Dark Knight Rises' (PG-13, 2:44) After seven years and two films that have pushed Batman (Christian Bale) ever deeper into the dark, the director Christopher Nolan has completed his postmodern, post-Sept. 11 epic of ambivalent good versus multidimensional evil with a burst of light. (Dargis)
'Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days' (PG, 1:34) This genial but not very ambitious installment of the ''Wimpy Kid'' franchise follows the young protagonist (Zachary Gordon) through a summer full of embarrassing moments involving camping, girl-chasing and more. Occasionally the predictable script finds a sweet spot, as in a scene in which some overly serious Civil War re-enactors get jolted out of their comfort zone. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Ek Tha Tiger' (No rating, 2:13, in Hindi) This Bollywood romance dressed up in espionage clothes has a ''my enemy, myself'' theme that is too tepid to resonate. Starring Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif, the movie feels most engaged during its glass-shattering, rooftop-hopping action sequences. (Rachel Saltz)
'The Expendables 2' (R, 1:43) Sylvester Stallone returns with his band of aging action stars and a ridiculous amount of ammunition and explosives, bent on avenging a comrade's death and keeping some plutonium out of evil hands. A brief appearance by Chuck Norris provides the best moment of self-parody in a movie that could have used a few more of them. (Genzlinger)
'First Position' (No rating, 1:30, in English, Spanish, French and Hebrew) The tears are often held tremulously back and the many hurts smiled away in Bess Kargman's appealing, largely upbeat documentary about young ballet dancers duking it out, sometimes on point and in tulle, for top honors at the Youth America Grand Prix. (Dargis)
'Hit & Run' (R, 1:40) In this weightless, silly car chase movie, Dax Shepard brings some charm to his role of a sweet-natured, shady goofball in the witness protection program. (Stephen Holden)
'Hope Springs' (PG-13, 1:32) While this film about a longtime marriage that's gone dry has modest charms to go with its well-matched and practiced pair of wily scene stealers -- Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones working on screen together for the first time -- the industry will have to do better if it wants to persuade boomers that there's something for them at the local multiplex other than cartoons and clichés. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Imposter' (R, 1:35) Slippery, manipulative and shamelessly entertaining, Bart Layton's bizarre true-crime documentary follows the twisty tale of a missing Texas teenager and the French-Algerian con artist who stole his identity. (Catsoulis)
'The Intouchables' (R, 1:52, in French) In this buddy movie from France, a rich white guy (François Cluzet), paralyzed from the neck down, is cared for by an African immigrant (Omar Sy) who teaches his boss to loosen up and appreciate life. The film's unabashed embrace of racial stereotypes may startle American audiences -- the movie was a huge hit in France -- but there is appealing warmth to the performances and an overall mood of friendly tolerance. It's embarrassing, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)
'Killer Joe' (NC-17, 1:43) Matthew McConaughey plays a psycho hired by the idiot son of an idiot family in this unfunny, self-indulgent violent bore. The director William Friedkin, working from the Tracy Letts play, is consistently controlled by the story's excesses rather than in control of them. (Dargis)
'Little White Lies' (No rating, 2:34, in French) Guillaume Canet's disappointing follow-up to his hit noir thriller, ''Tell No One,'' is a two-and-a-half-hour Gallic homage to ''The Big Chill'' and a protracted scolding to a group of self-absorbed overgrown yuppies. The strong ensemble cast includes François Cluzet, Jean Dujardin and Marion Cotillard. (Holden)
'Marvel's The Avengers' (PG-13, 2:22) Thor, the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and a few other mighty Marvel superheroes team up under the supervision of Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury in this franchise juggernaut, directed by Joss Whedon. The bantering and riffing among the characters provides some fun, but there is not much heart or imagination in the story or the action sequences. Which seems to satisfy the fans just fine. (Scott)
'The Matchmaker' (No rating, 1:52, in Hebrew) In Avi Nesher's film, which won several awards in Israel, a teenager's coming-of-age story of his experience working for a marital maven helps express the hopes and fears of a country awash in unsettling history. (Nicolas Rapold)
&#x2605; 'Moonrise Kingdom' (PG-13, 1:34) In Wes Anderson's latest, a wondrous storybook tale, a girl and a boy, both 12, run off to a remote inlet on an island where most of the adults seem disappointed and more than a little sad. The two are very serious -- about love, their plans, books, life itself -- and often act older than their age. You wonder what their hurry is, given that here adulthood, with its quarrels, regrets and anguished pillow talk, can feel as dangerous as the storm that's hurtling toward the island, ready to blow it all down. With Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Neighboring Sounds' (No rating, 2:11, in Portuguese) The Brazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho's debut is a densely layered look at life on a wealthy block in the northeastern city of Recife. With humor, precision and quiet suspense, Mr. Mendonça lays bare the contradictions and ancient grievances that simmer below the shiny, prosperous surface of modern Brazil. (Scott)
'The Odd Life of Timothy Green' (PG, 1:45) In this baffling exercise in maudlin, whimsical surrealism, directed by Peter Hedges, a childless couple (Jennifer Garner and a miserable-looking Joel Edgerton) are visited by a magic plant in the shape of a 10-year-old boy (CJ Adams). Tears are shed and lessons are learned, the main one being that this would have worked better as a horror movie. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'ParaNorman' (PG, 1:33) This beautiful-looking, charmingly heartfelt 3-D stop-motion animation -- from the studio that produced ''Coraline'' -- centers on an 11-year-old boy who can see ghosts and, with frights and laughter, battles a spirit. Directed by Sam Fell and the movie's screenwriter, Chris Butler. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Premium Rush' (PG-13, 1:31) The director David Koepp provides about all the late summer air-conditioned relief you could hope for in this buoyant dumb-fun, ticking-clock thriller about a bicycle messenger (the dependably appealing Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has to get from here to there without being taken out by cars or a bad cop (a terrific Michael Shannon). (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Queen of Versailles' (PG, 1:40) Lauren Greenfield's documentary follows the shifting fortunes of David and Jackie Siegel, a wealthy Florida couple who dreamed of building the biggest house in America. The movie, which starts out like smirky reality television, turns into something darker and more complex as economic troubles take a toll on the Siegels and the audience becomes better acquainted with them. It's like a Theodore Dreiser novel for our new gilded age. (Scott)
'Red Hook Summer' (R, 2:01) Spike Lee's celebration of African-American resilience in a struggling Brooklyn neighborhood is messy, meandering and bluntly polemical. But it has one crucial element: raw vitality. (Holden)
'Robot & Frank' (PG-13, 1:30) Jake Schreier directed, from a script by Christopher D. Ford, this eager-to-please story set in the near future about an elderly gent (Frank Langella), his robot (voiced by Peter Sarsgaard) and some awkwardly managed truths about old age. Susan Sarandon also stars. (Dargis)
'Samsara' (PG-13, 1:39) Ron Fricke's new film, like its predecessor, ''Baraka,'' is a free-associative tour of the world, a series of striking, sometimes surreal images of nature, work, life and death in the global economy. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
'Sleepwalk With Me' (No rating, 1:30) The surreal dream sequences in this screen adaptation of Mike Birbiglia's 2008 one-man show -- about a commitment-phobic stand-up comedian with a sleep disorder -- help make this likable movie more than a glorified stand-up act. (Holden)
'Somewhere Between' (No rating, 1:28, in English, Mandarin and Spanish) Effortlessly moving but frustratingly superficial, Linda Goldstein Knowlton's soft-focus profile of four bright Chinese girls and their adoptive American families substitutes upbeat interviews for sharp edges and contextual complexity. (Catsoulis)
'Sparkle' (PG-13, 1:56) It is impossible to watch this ramshackle remake of a 1976 movie and not relate its story to the life of Whitney Houston, who portrays the strict church-lady mother of an aspiring singer in late-1960s Detroit. (Holden)
'Step Up Revolution' (PG-13, 1:39) How to stop a greedy developer from gutting a Miami neighborhood? The power of dance, of course. The fourth film in the ''Step Up'' franchise has some dandy flash-mob-style dance numbers, though like its predecessors it is burdened by a predictable plot and unintentionally laughable dialogue. (Genzlinger)
'Ted' (R, 1:46) Seth MacFarlane, creator of ''The Family Guy,'' takes his provocative humor and his New England-accented voiceover skills to the big screen in this profane, sometimes funny comedy about a talking stuffed animal, the overgrown boy who loves him (Mark Wahlberg), and, somewhat tangentially, the boy's girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who wishes he would just grow up. (Scott)
'Teddy Bear' (No rating, 1:33, in Danish, English and Thai) Mads Matthiesen directs this low-key, sometimes funny and sweet Danish drama about a 38-year-old bodybuilder (Kim Kold), who in order to finally grow up, must learn to say hello to love and goodbye to dear old, horrible Mom. (Dargis)
'To Rome With Love' (R, 1:52) Woody Allen's latest is a mild, silly collection of tales set in the Italian capital, where love is complicated and characters -- both Italian and American -- are baffled, neurotic and always articulate. Mr. Allen plays a semi-retired opera promoter, while Jesse Eisenberg plays the younger Woody Allen type, torn between loyalty to his sensible girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) and her wayward, needy friend (Ellen Page). Alec Baldwin, Penélope Cruz and Roberto Benigni also contribute to this frothy, airy romp through some of Mr. Allen's favorite themes. (Scott)
'Total Recall' (PG-13, 1:58) Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel star in this chaotic and thoroughly unmemorable science-fiction action movie, loosely remade from a 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle and even more loosely based on a story by Philip K. Dick. (Scott)
'2016: Obama's America' (PG, 1:33) Dinesh D'Souza -- the author of the best seller ''The Roots of Obama's Rage'' and a former American Enterprise Institute fellow -- is the host and narrator of this strident documentary, in which Mr. D'Souza enlists a host of interviewees who are almost entirely critical of the president. The film is unlikely to convert supporters of President Obama to an opposite view. (Webster)
'2 Days in New York' (R, 1:36) In this sequel to ''2 Days in Paris,'' Julie Delpy, who wrote and directed, reprises the role of Marion, a French photographer now living with Mingus (Chris Rock), a journalist and radio host. Their hectic, happy bohemian household is thrown into chaos by the arrival of Marion's father (Ms. Delpy's father, Albert), her sister Rose (Alexia Landeau) and Rose's boyfriend, Manu (Alexandre Nahon). The movie is spirited and sometimes hilarious, but turns sloppy and strained when it reaches for deeper emotional insights into its nutty characters. (Scott)
'The Watch' (R, 1:41) Half unfunny potty-mouthed buddy comedy, half spoof of ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' this comic washout starring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn is larded with crude phallic jokes. (Holden)
Film Series
Baby Peggy: the Oldest Living Silent-Film Star Returns (Wednesday and Thursday, through Sept. 9) Born in 1918 and a performer from the age of 19 months, Diana Serra Cary appeared under the name Baby Peggy in a series of shorts and features released by Universal from 1919 to 1926, achieving a level of popularity equal to her male child-star counterpart, Jackie Coogan. Although she left the movie business in 1938, she has campaigned on behalf of better working conditions for child actors and has published several books, including her 1996 autobiography, ''What Ever Happened to Baby Peggy?'' She will be present on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. to introduce Vera Iwerebor's 2010 documentary, ''Baby Peggy: The Elephant in the Room,'' and participate in a discussion with Ms. Iwerebor after the screening. The documentary will be repeated daily through Sept. 9, accompanied by a sampling of her surviving films. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $12. (Dave Kehr)
'The Bridge on the River Kwai' (Saturday and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image screens a new restoration of David Lean's 1957 World War II adventure set in a Japanese prison camp in Burma, where a group of detainees -- led by Alec Guinness, as a determined colonel -- are charged with constructing a strategically important railway bridge. William Holden, Jack Hawkins and Sessue Hayakawa also star in the film, with a screenplay by the blacklisted writers Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, whose names did not appear on the film until a 1985 reissue. Presented in digital video (DCP) at 6:30 p.m., 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $12. (Kehr)
James Bond No. 1: Sean Connery's 007 (Friday through Thursday) It's been 50 years since the first James Bond film, ''Dr. No,'' was released in 1962 (No. 23, ''Skyfall,'' will come out in November), an anniversary which naturally calls for a retrospective of the seven films starring the alpha-Bond, Sean Connery. ''Dr. No'' gets things rolling at 10:55 a.m. on Friday, with a different combination of films presented each day through Thursday. All will be shown in digital video (DCP) versions, except for the noncanonical 1983 ''Never Say Never Again'' (different producers, long story), which will be shown in 35 millimeter. On Sunday all seven films will be shown in order, beginning at 10:55 a.m., with tickets for the whole megillah priced at $40.

HEADLINE: Al Jazeera, Seeking U.S. Viewers, Bets on Soccer

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Richard Sandomir and Jack Bell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Al Jazeera, once known in the United States mostly for televising videos of Americans and others taken hostage in foreign countries, but now a serious presence as a worldwide network, is betting heavily on sports to win American viewers.
This month, an Al Jazeera subsidiary, beIN Sport, bought the rights to broadcast some of the United States national soccer team's games as it seeks to qualify for the 2014 World Cup. BeIN Sport has also paid heavily to show in the United States some of Europe's best soccer from Spain, Italy, France and England.
BeIN Sport's bold entry into the American market befits its deep-pocketed owners, who appear committed to becoming a major player in soccer, the globe's most popular sport. It could make an even bigger splash if it bids in the coming months for the rights to broadcast England's Premier League in the United States, where the league has a growing and devoted following, as well as Major League Soccer, whose broadcast rights expire in 2014. 
It is unclear whether the network's buying spree is designed to make money, to raise its global brand or to perhaps provide leverage to get United States exposure for its news network. To date, Al Jazeera's English-language news service has gained only a tiny foothold in the American market, but it could use its growing prominence in sports broadcasting to compel cable providers to carry its news programming.
Al Jazeera, based in Qatar, clearly has the resources to be a player. The network receives funds from the Qatari government, which spent lavishly to win the bid to host the World Cup in 2022.
''The old dinosaurs are dying off, and the new sports fans are more than willing to accept soccer,'' said Phil Schoen, an announcer who was hired by beIN Sport after stints at ESPN and GolTV. ''It's not just the ethnics, soccer moms and urban singles. To make such a commitment really says something about how beIN Sport feels about the future of the sport in this country.''
BeIN Sport declined to make available any executives to speak on the record about its broader strategy.
Initially, beIN Sport may cause headaches for United States soccer fans. So far, the network is carried only on DirecTV and Dish, the country's two largest satellite television providers, and Comcast, the country's largest cable network. But in many cases, customers will have to pay several dollars more a month to subscribe to an extra sports package that includes beIN Sport, which only a small fraction of customers do.
While beIN Sport is rushing to sign other distribution deals, it may be months if not years before fans throughout the country can see the network in their homes. Until then, many fans will have to find a local bar to see the American national team play World Cup qualifying games on the road, including matches against Jamaica in Kingston on Sept. 7 and in Antigua on Oct. 12.
Quickly, beIN Sport has upended the sports television landscape. The network is committed to covering international sports like soccer, rugby, volleyball and track and field. In that sense, it is unlikely to rival ESPN, CBS or the other major American networks that pay billions of dollars to carry baseball, football and basketball.
But in spending heavily for the rights to Europe's top soccer leagues and some of the United States national team's games, beIN Sport threatens to dominate a fast-growing market populated by Fox Sports, ESPN and GolTV. That is bad news for those networks, but great news for soccer teams, leagues and federations.
According to one television executive, beIN paid twice as much as what GolTV had paid to broadcast La Liga, the top Spanish soccer league. BeIN Sport has reportedly paid Comcast to be carried to the cable company's 22 million television subscribers, rather than being paid by Comcast, the way ESPN and Fox are. BeIN Sport also paid well above market rates for the rights to the United States World Cup qualifiers.
''There is a maxim that a small distributor will pay more for rights than a large one because it means more to them,'' said Neal H. Pilson, a former president of CBS Sports who is a consultant. ''In a world with thousands of channels, live sports are a means of growing an existing business or launching a new business.''
Mr. Schoen, beIN Sport's new announcer, said he was unaware whether his new employer would try to acquire the United States rights to England's Premier League when they come up for bid. Industry executives expect those rights to fetch twice as much as what Fox paid for them three years ago, or far more if beIN Sport joins the bidding.
''If the soccer industry in the U.S. remains a business driven by economics, I think everyone will be successful,'' said Rodrigo Lombello, the chief operating officer of GolTV, which was outbid by beIN Sport for the United States rights to Spain's top league games. ''But if the industry is going to be a toy for the sheik from Qatar, then I don't know what will happen.''
Fox, which now broadcasts Premier League games in the United States, is eager to defend its turf, especially after spending heavily to win the rights to broadcast the World Cups in 2018 and 2022. Losing the Premier League, the world's most popular, would be a blow.
Fox argues that it is a better fit for the Premier League than beIN Sport because it can broadcast games to most homes in America, not just a few million homes that buy special sports packages. Last season, Fox set viewership records when it showed Premier League matches on Sundays while other networks were broadcasting N.F.L. games.
''Bottom line, there's always been competition in this field,'' said David Nathanson, the general manager of Fox Soccer. ''It just so happens that as the sport of soccer has grown in the U.S., you're bound to have more players interested in it. But we're the only dedicated English-language soccer network today, so it plays to our strength.''
Longer term, the question many television executives are asking is what Al Jazeera and the Qataris hope to accomplish with beIN Sport. Are they trying to tap the seemingly unending interest in soccer and sports? Are they trying to promote Qatar ahead of the World Cup in 2022? Or do they want to use beIN Sport as a wedge to get cable and satellite providers to carry Al Jazeera's news channel, which has had trouble getting carried in the United States because, some suggest, of the hostility to the network's programming?
BeIN Sport is careful to note that it operates independently of Al Jazeera's news division and, thus far, has focused only on buying sports rights. But other networks have used sports to promote their other programming. Nearly two decades ago, Fox shocked the sports world when it paid top dollar to show the N.F.L. Despite early losses, Fox gained wider coverage for its broadcast network.
Al Jazeera may be trying to pull a page from Fox's playbook. Some industry executives say that while the Qataris are perceived to have limitless resources, they may be doing what other networks have done before them: spending heavily to break into a crowded market.
''My experience is they are more economically driven than you would think and they have a very westernized philosophy,'' said Rob Tilliss, a sports consultant who advises clients in the Middle East.
The common perception that cable operators are reluctant to do business with Al Jazeera is incorrect, he said. ''It's a commercial relationship, and the more I go over there, the more I realize that,'' he said. ''At the end of the day, their objectives are basically the same.''

HEADLINE: Death Penalty Sought in Murder Trial of 3 Soldiers

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- Prosecutors will seek the death penalty against three soldiers in Georgia accused of killing a fellow soldier and his girlfriend and plotting terrorist attacks at their own military base.
District Attorney Tom Durden of Long County said on Thursday that the suspects would face charges of malice murder, felony murder and criminal gang activity. The soldiers, Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, Sgt. Anthony Peden and Pvt. Christopher Salmon, have not entered pleas.
They are accused of killing a former soldier, Michael Roark, 19, and his girlfriend, Tiffany York, 17, on Dec. 4. Prosecutors say the soldiers were all members of a small anarchist militia called FEAR, or Forever Enduring Always Ready, that plotted the overthrow of Fort Stewart, home of the Army's Third Infantry Division, about 40 miles southwest of Savannah. 
Prosecutors say the militia group comprised an unknown number of active and former members of the military. The group contemplated several attacks, including poisoning the apple crop in Washington State, attacking a dam and assassinating President Obama. The group spent at least $87,000 buying guns and bomb components.
But the militia began to unravel when one of its members, Mr. Roark, who had left the Army as a private, was caught taking money and planned to leave the group, prosecutors say. On Monday, one of the accused conspirators, Pfc. Michael Burnett, told a judge that the couple had been killed to protect the militia's secrecy. Private Burnett took a plea deal, confessing to voluntary manslaughter for a lighter sentence.
''I don't know how it got to the point where two people got murdered,'' Private Burnett told Judge Robert L. Russell III of Long County Superior Court. ''If I could have stopped this from happening, I would have.''
The plot shook the small, rural community in south Georgia that houses Fort Stewart, the largest Army installation east of the Mississippi River. The charges come just a week after two members of a different militia were sentenced in a separate terrorist scheme in north Georgia, a plot to release deadly chemicals and bomb federal buildings in Atlanta.
Those are only the latest and most visible examples of the rise in violent militia groups in recent years, said Mark Potok, an authority on the groups and the editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report. In 2011, the center identified 1,274 groups as part of the so-called patriot and militia movements, up from 824 the year before.
Mr. Potok said the rise was exacerbated by the economic recession and antagonism toward Mr. Obama.
On Monday, an Alaska couple who are members of a militia pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to kill a federal judge in what prosecutors said was a revenge plot over income-tax rulings against them.
In 2011, a man with ties to militia groups was charged with plotting to bomb a Martin Luther King Day parade in Spokane, Wash.
''It's been remarkable how these kinds of events have piled up, faster and faster,'' Mr. Potok said. ''When you listen to the details of this plot, you'd think they're all on hallucinogens. It would be easy not to take them seriously were it not for the fact that two people are dead.''
On Thursday, the courtroom in rural Long County was a scene of repeated outbursts. The stepfather of Ms. York, Wesley Thomas, lunged at one of the defendants. Later, a family member of Mr. Roark yelled curse words at another defendant.
Private Burnett testified that the couple was killed to protect the militia. On Dec. 4, he said, the soldiers lured Mr. Roark and Ms. York to a forest a short distance from the Army post by telling them that they were going target shooting. He said Sergeant Peden shot Ms. York in the head while she was trying to get out of her car. He said Private Salmon shot Mr. Roark twice in the head.
The authorities are also investigating whether one of the suspects, Private Aguigui, may have played a role in another killing. His wife was discovered dead in July 2011 in Wenatchee, Wash., and the death has not been explained.
Prosecutors say that Private Aguigui received up to $500,000 in life insurance benefits after his wife's death and that he used the money to finance the militia.

PHOTO: FARM FAIRS: (Friday through Monday) While the Labor Day holiday brings an official close to the beach season, it is just the opening weekend for farm events, which often run through the fall.

(Right, at last year's event, Dillon Pepin, then 14, with his award-winning Hereford heifer.) Also in Connecticut, the 152nd edition of the Woodstock Fair (at the fairgrounds at Routes 169 and 171 in South Woodstock) will feature tractor pulling, chili making and country karaoke. If you find a corn maze challenging, there are two to choose from that are also in Connecticut: Lyman Orchards in Middlefield, where the maze is cut into the logos for the Yankees and the Red Sox, and at Preston Farms in Preston, where the design is inspired by the Titanic. For those who prefer boulevards over barnyards, there are plenty of other outdoor events to enjoy, including free theater at the Soldiers' and Sailors'Monument on the Upper West Side, art in Greenwich Village and the West Indian American Day Carnival in Brooklyn. Details about these and other holiday events in the region are on this page. So grab the sunscreen and water and go; because not everything is free, money would also be nice.

HEADLINE: Big Plans for the Future (Including a Roof, One Day)

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
The first four days of the United States Open unfolded without public protests from the players, without damage from a hurricane, with few upsets and only one brief rain delay. The biggest news was a pair of retirements -- from Andy Roddick and Kim Clijsters -- and for a tournament in transition, that was a good thing, a knock-on-wood thing.
On Thursday, the focus remained on the tennis. Fifth-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga lost, and unseeded Jack Sock won again. Mardy Fish roared back from two sets down to defeat Nikolay Davydenko to help set an Open record, with 10 such comebacks already completed in 2012. 
For four days, complaints centered on the absence of an injured Rafael Nadal and the lack of compelling night matches, each, it seemed, shorter and less competitive than the last. Meanwhile, the grounds filled, the cash registers clanged and the tournament continued without international incident.
As the new Open tournament director, David Brewer observed all this through 18-hour workdays, his focus as much on the future as the present. He joined the United States Tennis Association in 1997, and by the conclusion of the 2011 tournament, with Tropical Storm Irene and a cracked court and another Monday men's singles final and players that lamented their lack of voice, Brewer, it seemed, had seen it all.
However, in an interview before the tournament, Brewer described this year and next year as a period of unprecedented change, the most since the U.S.T.A. built Arthur Ashe Stadium in 1997.
Courts will be moved. Louis Armstrong Stadium will be torn down and rebuilt. Capacity will be added. Amenities will be improved. A day of rest will be added between the men's semifinals and final. Officials even dared this week to say definitively that Ashe would one day have a roof. On the matter of which day, of course, they remained uncertain.
''There is nothing that compares to this,'' Brewer said. ''We need to make the tournament better. We understand that things are changing. We're doing that.''
Asked if he found the overhaul daunting, Brewer shook his head. ''Frankly, this piece of it is pretty exciting,'' he said.
As Brewer talked, his two cellphones buzzed with phone calls and text messages and e-mails, the quantity indicative of the work ahead.
His background prepared Brewer for this moment. He played at Carson-Newman (Tenn.), a big server who ''never hit more than four ground strokes in my life.''
He started as a tennis professional at Nick Bollettieri's academy, a glorified ball feeder according to Brewer's recollection. He worked in sports marketing for Adidas when Ivan Lendl was among the company's biggest endorsers.
Now, he is the director of America's most prestigious tournament. ''People don't understand how big and complex this thing is,'' Brewer said. ''We used to have a boss that said it's like running 14 straight Super Bowls. And, frankly, that's a pretty good analogy.''
The Open is about to get bigger, more complex. On Sunday, Gordon Smith, chief operating officer of the U.S.T.A., and other officials showed a small group of reporters their renovation plans. Two words adorned the first slide.
The future, it read.
While weather delays in recent years forced the focus onto the absence of a roof, the plan includes the entire grounds, of which the roof is only one part. Louis Armstrong Stadium and the accompanying grandstand, Smith noted, are both more than 50 years old and ''beyond their useful life.'' Both will be replaced, and the grandstand will be moved from the northeast corner of the grounds to the underutilized southwest.
Additional plans call for an increase in capacity for day sessions by 10,000, expanded public plazas and promenades, and more viewing areas for the practice courts. Even a roof, they insisted, when technology allows.
Officials said they commissioned a study to measure the economic impact of the Open in New York. For 2010, the impact registered at $756 million, compared with $420 million in 2001 and $145 million in 1991.
To improve, the goal is to finish those renovations, except the roof, by the end of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration, or the end of next year. To that end, the more days like Thursday, the better, for both Open officials and the thousands who attend their tournament.
Late in the afternoon, the plaza outside Ashe was so crowded that fans jockeyed for the seats that opened up. Lines snaked around the outer courts, with crowds waiting to get in. Strangers debated the star potential of Sloane Stephens, discussed the serve speed of John Isner and wondered whether an American would ever win the men's tournament again.
No one talked about rain, or Monday finals, or natural disasters headed toward New York. They talked about a mostly uneventful Open that was notable for other, more pertinent reasons.
Like, you know, the tennis.

Our quirky, discerning picks for the most interesting things to do around the state this week.
COLLEGE STATION
Gator Raid
The Texas A&M football team has had nine months to recuperate after its last regular-season game in the Big 12 -- a stunning last-second loss to Texas in what appears to be the final game in a rivalry that lasted more than a century.
On Saturday the Aggies begin a new chapter in their new conference: the perennially tough S.E.C. They will kick off conference play against the No. 23-ranked Florida Gators, coached by Will Muschamp, who helped the Longhorns beat the Aggies twice in his three years as defensive coordinator for U.T. He has since denigrated College Station, telling a group of Florida boosters: ''You ever been to College Station? It'll be the only time you go.'' 
If you can snag a ticket to the sold-out game, you're likely to witness a battle. The cadets will be in full force, 12th-man towels will be waving, and Kevin Sumlin, the new head coach, will have the troops rallied.
Kyle Field, Sept. 8, 2:30 p.m., aggieathletics.com
DALLAS
Swing Set
Damon Gray was 4 when he realized he had vocal chops. ''I was in the car, going down the road, and I was singing a Hank Sr. song, 'Your Cheatin' Heart,' '' he recalled. ''And my mom said, 'Well, you sound just like him.' ''
Fast-forward to adulthood and Mr. Gray, a resident of Nashville who grew up in the Panhandle, is singing in the Great Recession Orchestra, the Duncanville-based western-swing big band that plays its own version of songs popularized by Bob Wills and Milton Brown, Texan pioneers of the hillbilly-jazz sound. This will be the first time the entire supergroup, whose numerous members hail from across the state and beyond, have played together live since forming a couple of years ago.
They will perform songs from the albums ''Have You Ever Even Heard of Milton Brown?'' and ''Double Shot,'' with free barbecue on the side.
It will be redemption for Mr. Gray, who had a recording contract that expired a decade ago because his Nashville label thought he was ''too country.''
''Nashville has ruined real country music,'' he said. ''And Texas still loves it.''
Sons of Hermann Hall, Aug. 31, 8 p.m., newtexrecords.net
MARFA
Sunny Side Up
It is hard to ignore the reality of climate change when most of the country is gripped by a drought.
''People have come to accept that we're entering an era of extreme weather,'' said Hamilton Fish, the New York publisher and entrepreneur. ''What they haven't done on either the civic or legislative level is translate that consciousness into action.''
To change that, Mr. Fish and Fairfax Dorn, co-founder of Ballroom Marfa, will host ''Marfa Dialogues: Politics and Culture of Climate and Sustainability,'' a symposium bringing together local and international figures.
Michael Pollan and Rebecca Solnit, both socially minded authors, will speak. The artist Cynthia Hopkins will perform ''This Clement World,'' her musical about ''sailing through the burning ice and myths of the high Arctic.'' And the curator David Buckland will introduce Carbon 13, an exhibit to help audiences understand the concept of the carbon footprint.
The far-flung West Texas location, though a cultural haven, was chosen with purpose. ''We always think that we have access to these huge networks and we can operate at a much more expansive level,'' Mr. Fish said. ''And we tend to forget the importance of acting locally.''
Various locations, Aug. 31-Sept. 2, various times, ballroom marfa.org
FORT WORTH
That's Gross
Nose pickers -- partakers in the pastime of mucus excavation -- will find like-minded souls at the last weekend of ''Grossology: The (Impolite) Science of the Human Body,'' an exhibition based on the ''Grossology'' series of children's books by Sylvia Branzei, which are dedicated to the body's sometimes unpleasant functions.
But adults will have fun, too, exploring creative displays like ''Patients Please,'' a variation of the board game Operation, and ''Y U Stink,'' a challenge to visitors to match body odors with body parts.
Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, Aug. 31-Sept. 3, various times, fortworth museum.org
ALPINE
Torch Song
Seeing hot-air balloons against the West Texas mountains during the Big Bend Balloon Bash could blow you away, a nd if not, there's the Fire Concert, in which ballooners scorch the night sky by playing ''music'' with their burners.
Alpine-Casparis Airport, Sept. 1-3, 7 a.m., bigbendballoon bash.com
GALVESTON
Keg Stand
Although Texas legislators have been reluctant to loosen distribution laws in the state's booming craft-beer business, making merry at the Brew Masters Craft Beer Festival would be a show of support that might convince them otherwise.

HEADLINE: Saying It's Time to Leave, Yale President Will Retire

BYLINE: By RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA

 BODY:
Richard C. Levin, who has directed a vast expansion and modernization of Yale University while improving university finances and relations with the city of New Haven, announced on Thursday that he would retire as president at the end of the school year, after 20 years. Dr. Levin is currently the most senior president in the Ivy League and one of the longest-serving in Yale's history. The university is expected to undertake a nationwide search for a successor, who will take the helm next summer at an elite institution with a global reputation and a $3 billion annual operating budget.
Dr. Levin, 65, said in an interview that he simply felt it was time to move on, that he planned to take a yearlong sabbatical to write a book and that he did not know what he would do after that. He noted that the university faced several big, potentially expensive, strategic choices, including how to pursue online education and whether to resume building projects that were delayed during the recession. 
''It makes sense to let someone who's got a horizon of 7 to 10 years, at least, to take those over,'' he said.
When Dr. Levin took office, Yale was being described as a university whose perch among the world's top educational institutions had grown shaky. The administration often battled the faculty and the troubled surrounding city, there were budget shortfalls and staff cuts, applications were down and facilities badly needed renovation and repair.
A search committee repeatedly postponed the deadline for naming a new president, reportedly settling unenthusiastically on the low-key Dr. Levin after being unable to find a more famous and charismatic leader. Almost two decades later, Yale's reputation and its finances are more secure, and Dr. Levin, commonly called Rick, is among the most admired university leaders in the country.
Under his presidency, the university has greatly expanded its academic facilities, including new quarters for science and medicine and a new business school campus; has overhauled its buildings, including all 12 undergraduate residential colleges; has started construction of two residential colleges to make room for the first major expansion in undergraduate enrollment in decades; and has embarked on new programs overseas.
''Rick's presidency hasn't been revolutionary,'' said Anthony Kronman, a former law school dean. ''It's been a steady, persistent accumulation that, I would say, add up to a massive set of achievements.''
Dr. Levin's administration has increased Yale's endowment faster than those of its peers, despite heavy capital spending; as of mid-2011, it stood at $19.4 billion, second only to Harvard's. His base salary of more than $1 million, and total compensation of more than $1.6 million, made him the highest-paid Ivy League president and one of the highest in the country.
After decades of discord, Dr. Levin set out to improve relations with New Haven -- he said his first act as president would be to shake the mayor's hand. The university gave financial assistance to employees who bought homes in New Haven, and it invested in the city's efforts to revive the commercial core.
''Yale was a campus that physically and metaphorically relied on hard edges -- hard edges around the campus and hard edges in relationships with the community,'' said John DeStefano Jr., the mayor since 1994. ''With Rick, those edges have become very soft.''
Benno C. Schmidt Jr., president from 1986 to 1992, battled faculty members over his moves to take decision-making powers away from them, over his plans to make deep cuts in their ranks and over other issues. Hired from Columbia University and maintaining his residence in New York City, Mr. Schmidt was derided as an outsider.
Faculty relations quickly improved under Dr. Levin, a familiar, well-liked and calming presence, and a longtime Yale professor and administrator whose wife, Jane, was an English professor there.
Perhaps the most serious clash with the faculty occurred this year, after Yale joined with the National University of Singapore to create a campus in Singapore. Professors protested the university's collaboration with an autocratic government and the fact that the faculty had not been consulted, but the project continues.
Yale's history of combative labor relations continued under Dr. Levin, with two strikes by clerical, maintenance and service employees in 1996 and two more in 2002 and 2003. But since then, relations have gone fairly smoothly with those employees, and Yale reached a new contract with them in June. The university has fought a longstanding effort to form a union by graduate students who teach or do research.
Dr. Levin's administration was also criticized in recent years by women's groups who said the university was slow to recognize that it needed to be tougher on sexual harassment and sexual assault. Last year, the university overhauled its procedures and suspended a fraternity that had been involved in harassment episodes.
Private universities have come under fire for their fast-rising prices; under Dr. Levin, the cost for a year of undergraduate education at Yale -- including tuition, books and room and board -- has more than doubled, to $58,600 for 2012-13. But most students receive financial aid, and Yale was among the first, in recent years, to replace student loans with grants and to extend significant aid to students from middle- and upper-middle-income families.
The top administrators that Dr. Levin has groomed have gone on to hold major posts elsewhere in academia -- presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Duke University, Swarthmore College and Colgate University, and vice chancellors at Cambridge and Oxford Universities.

HEADLINE: Quietly Ferocious Requiem for the Land

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN -- A prophet in the wilderness of modernity, the photographer Robert Adams has devoted almost five decades to decrying what fecklessly industrious humans have done to the landscape of the American West.
''Robert Adams: The Place We Live,'' a splendid retrospective exhibition of more than 250 prints dating from the 1960s to 2009 at the Yale University Art Gallery here, surveys an oeuvre that is as compelling for its understated style as for its moral ferocity. Accompanied by a beautiful three-volume catalog produced by Yale University Press in collaboration with Mr. Adams, the exhibition was organized by Joshua Chuang, the gallery's assistant curator of photographs, and Jock Reynolds, its director. 
The work that put Mr. Adams on the map of modern photography in the '60s and helped start the movement known as the New Topographics may not look like that of a fire-breathing scourge. His sharply focused black-and-white imagery documenting housing construction in Colorado appears dispassionately objective, as if made by an insurance adjuster. But it is animated by spiritual exasperation. Where buffalo and Indians used to roam, there is suburban sprawl; where forests of majestic, centuries-old trees once grew, giant machines process scientifically engineered plantings into lumber for more tract housing. Where there was nature of abundance and fertility, there is a culture of banality, exploitation and waste. That is the big picture conjured by nearly all of Mr. Adams's efforts.
What may have seemed aesthetically indifferent in his work -- compared to that of, say, Ansel Adams (no relation) -- was actually the product of a Shaker-like sensibility acutely attuned to economies of form and metaphor. One of his best-known pictures, ''Colorado Springs, Colorado'' (1968), is a straight-ahead shot of an ordinary ranch house whose front window frames the silhouette of a woman backlit by a luminous rear window. This perfect moment exudes an aching loneliness, the boxed-in isolation of the stranded suburbanite.
Mr. Adams's biography reads like that of an admirable character in a novel by Marilynne Robinson. Born in New Jersey in 1937, he moved west with his family at the age of 10, first to Wisconsin and then to the outskirts of Denver. A churchgoing Boy Scout, he considered becoming a minister before veering into English literature, in which he earned a doctorate. He was teaching English at Colorado College in the early '60s when he took up photography. He has been married since 1960 to Kerstin Mornestam, who collaborates with him in the editing of his books; they have lived in Oregon since 1997.
Mr. Adams arrived at his near-minimalist style early but explored more familiar territory at the same time. In images from the late '60s and early '70s of fast-food joints, truck stops, bleak hotel rooms, roadside litter and a garbage truck painted in stars and stripes, Mr. Adams joined photographers like Robert Frank, Ed Ruscha and Garry Winogrand among countless others in sampling the low end of American culture. One clever photograph taken by Mr. Adams in Denver shows a sign for the Orchid Beauty Academy on a bleak commercial strip in Denver. But in the long run Mr. Adams was not to be satisfied with witty pot shots.
An image of a truck-size stack of lumber wrapped in black plastic shot in Denver in the early '70s is pure Adams. It could hardly be less picturesque, yet it has a particular metaphorical resonance in light of the fact that American soldiers were continuing to return home from Vietnam in black body bags. I don't know if Mr. Adams intended that association, but it has a funereal vibe.
There are other, less painful moods in the exhibition. A series from the '70s and early '80s called ''Summer Nights'' consists of nocturnal images of quiet neighborhoods with trees silhouetted by streetlights and dark houses, as if they are asleep. The invisible photographer lurks the deserted streets like the ghost of Edward Hopper.
People are relatively rare in Mr. Adams's work, but a notable exception is a series called ''Our Parents, Our Children,'' shot in parking lots baked by remorseless sunlight. These mainly show women with babies and young children getting in and out of cars and going to and from big-box stores. They are heartbreaking in their ordinariness. In an especially touching one a beaming, impossibly tiny girl stands on the hood of a car in a long dress, reaching up with both arms to a grandfatherly man who seems gigantic next to her.
The point of that series may be lost on viewers who skip Mr. Adams's brief introductory statement in the catalog explaining that detonators for nuclear bombs were then in production at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver. He wrote, ''Armaments built at risk to Denver become part of a worldwide system so open to error and malfunction that it is reasonable to believe many of us will, at a scarcely imaginable but exact time, die from them.''
As a photographer Mr. Adams loves trees more than people, and old trees most of all. ''Cottonwoods'' (1994), one of more than 30 books of thematic photographic essays he has published, is devoted to the defense of one beloved species. ''Agribusiness now wages war on cottonwoods,'' Mr. Adams wrote, ''because the trees compete for water, and suburban developers replace them with conveniently small but ecologically disruptive species like Russian olive.''
Images in the exhibition from his book ''Turning Back'' (2005) document the effects of clearcutting by the logging industry in Oregon. Many of them suggest the aftermath of a terrific explosion.
''Is there a relationship,'' Mr. Adams asks, ''between clearcutting and war, the landscape of one being in some respects like the landscape of the other? Does clearcutting originate in disrespect? Does it teach violence? Does it contribute to nihilism?'' Elsewhere he declaims, ''All that is clear is the perfection of what we were given, the unworthiness of our response, and the certainty, in view of our current deprivation, that we are judged.''
The severity of his own judgment is relieved to a degree by one of his recurring motifs: the image of a rural road stretching from the foreground to the distant horizon. ''Sally, Weld County, Colorado'' (1984) has in it something that, curiously, occurs rarely in his pictures: an animal. Specifically, it is a dog. It pauses on a dirt road perhaps 10 yards away, looking back over its shoulder as if to invite us to follow and to wonder: ''Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?'' The end, after all, remains for all of us to determine.
''Robert Adams: The Place We Live, a Retrospective Selection of Photographs'' continues through Oct. 28 at the Yale University Art Gallery, 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven; (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu.

HEADLINE: At Some Schools, the Demographic Future Is Now

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Certain characteristics set the Laredo Independent School District apart from most other districts in the state.
Its western boundary aligns directly with the Mexican border. Nearly all its students are poor, and nearly all are Hispanic. Most rely on the school to provide two meals a day. On the first day of school this week, some showed up without shoes, or without parents accompanying them.
''It's hard to work on teaching them about reading and writing and math when they haven't eaten. It's hard to really welcome them into their class with their textbooks and their lockers when they don't have on shoes,'' said A. Marcus Nelson, the Laredo superintendent, who said the district solicited donations of shoes and dress-code-appropriate clothes all summer to prepare for the new school year. 
But geography aside, Texas public schools may increasingly find more in common with the South Texas district. In 2011, the state reached two landmarks. For the first time, Hispanics became the majority of public school students. And to cope with a historic budget deficit, the Legislature did not finance enrollment growth in the state's schools -- something that had not happened since the modernization of the Texas public school system in 1949. Though the first turning point passed quietly and the second with much political strife, they both underscore the challenges ahead as a dramatic demographic shift occurs in public school classrooms statewide.
By 2050, the number of Texas public school students is expected to swell to nine million from roughly five million now, and nearly two-thirds will be Hispanic, according to Steve Murdock, a demographer and director of Rice University's Hobby Center for the Study of Texas. The overall percentage of white students will drop by half to about 15 percent. Without an accompanying change in Hispanics' current socioeconomic status, that also means Texas students will continue to grow poorer -- and their education more expensive -- in the next four decades, Dr. Murdock added. (Rice University is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)
State population figures over the last decade show the shift is well under way in the public school system. Economically disadvantaged children in Texas classrooms make up 60 percent of all public school students, up from less than half in 2000. Students with limited English skills now make up 16 percent of them. Of about 979,000 children added to the state's under-18 population from 2000 to 2010, 931,000 were Hispanic.
''When you look at children, there is no doubt. The future of Texas -- the future of the United States -- is tied to the minority population,'' said Dr. Murdock, a former state demographer and director of the United States Census Bureau. ''It's just mathematically true.''
If current trends hold, such projections make for a bleak forecast. According to state data, Hispanic students are statistically less likely to leave high school with a diploma than their white peers. Of the Hispanic students who do graduate, a minority are prepared for college. In 2010, 42 percent met college-readiness benchmarks in both English and math, compared with 66 percent of white students.
Among economically disadvantaged students and those with limited English proficiency, the gap continues to widen. Thirty-eight percent of students who came from low-income households did well enough on their Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills or college entrance exams to qualify as ''college ready.'' Only 5 percent of those with limited English language skills did so.
The Laredo district, along with a handful of others, including the Pharr-San Juan-Alamo district, near McAllen, has had a head start in educating the kinds of students who will make up more of the state's public schools. It has had successes -- graduation rates for both districts have consistently surpassed the state average for Hispanics -- but has also had to learn to embrace the additional challenges that come with serving students from at-risk backgrounds.
The methods that Dr. Nelson said Laredo uses to reach its students range from the simple, like having days where students wear their favorite college shirts to class, to the more complicated task of familiarizing teachers with the problems their students confront outside the classroom. That can mean starting out with the basics -- defining words like ''assessment'' and ''equation'' -- so that students know how they are being evaluated.
The district has also created a partnership with Texas A&M International University to create an early college high school in which students can take courses that allow them to graduate with college credits in hand. All of the efforts revolve around the goal of changing the expectations that students had for themselves, Dr. Nelson said.
Much of that, he said, is emphasizing that ''what you were born into does not have to be your lot in life, you are just going to have to dig down and really buy into our system of teaching and learning in the 21st century.''
''We've got kids that are poor, and we've got kids that are Hispanic, but we've also got kids that are some of the best and brightest kids in the state,'' Dr. Nelson said.
That is a shift in perspective that needs to happen in the way policy makers at the state and district level think about educating Hispanic and low-income students, said Patricia Lopez, a research associate at the University of Texas at Austin's Texas Center for Education Policy. (The University of Texas at Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)
Too often, Ms. Lopez said, students, rather than the institutions that serve them, are seen as the problem. ''We don't sit back and ask is the challenge really about the capacities of the schools and the people within those schools not being up to par,'' she said. ''We have not invested in that, so that those kids aren't coming into a context where failure is seen as a function of them.''
The state budget cuts in 2011, when lawmakers reduced public education financing by more than $5 billion, have exacerbated that, Ms. Lopez said. But the issue also needs to be addressed in teacher and principal recruitment programs, which she said could help make school leaders aware of their own biases in the classroom and better understand the world their students inhabit.
''It's more common to hear things like kids take poverty into schools, kids take broken home into schools,'' she said, ''but people who are educators also take their baggage into schools.''
If Texas can adequately educate the new student majority, Dr. Murdock said, the potential reward is large. As a state with a population that is, over all, growing younger rather than older, its work force would be competitively poised to replace a generation of retiring baby boomers, he said, taking advantage of the accompanying economic opportunity and higher incomes.
There has been some improvement. Over the last decade, the gap between the academic achievement of white and Hispanic students in the state has narrowed. But even if the gap continued to close at the current rate, it would still not be enough to ensure the state's success, Dr. Murdock said.
''It says I need to run fairly quickly from here to the finish line, or maybe I wont get to the finish line,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Suitor Makes the Case for Divorce

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Through three nights of gauzy videos, sentimental testimonials and, finally, his own address to the nation Thursday, Mitt Romney worked hard to show he has a heart.
But he still needs to tackle the much harder job of convincing those Americans who so emotionally invested their hearts in President Obama four years ago that it is time to accept that his presidency did not work, let go of him and move on.
Not even Mr. Romney's own strategists are pretending that is going to be simple. And even before leaving the nominating convention here, they were beginning a delicate 10-week campaign aimed at those voters who are disappointed in Mr. Obama but just can't yet bring themselves to quit him.
After month after month of disappointing job numbers, poll after poll showing dissatisfaction in his economic performance and hundreds of millions of dollars in negative advertisements, a large portion of wavering voters maintain a personal attachment to Mr. Obama, and a tentative willingness to give him more time to get it right, top strategists with both campaigns agree. 
That is a testament, perhaps, to the power of that scene four years ago when Mr. Obama and his family crossed the threshold of the White House as its first African-American tenants, ''an inspiring moment that so many have awaited so long'' as former President George W. Bush -- the man he was so hard on in 2008 -- put it then.
Representative Paul D. Ryan may have painted a biting picture on Wednesday night when he referred to the faded Obama poster hanging above unemployed college graduates' childhood beds, but the poster was still there, after all.
Most challengers face the relatively clinical task of persuading voters to fire the incumbent. Mr. Romney faces the more fraught mission of persuading them to break up with the incumbent.
''It's going to be hard to break the bond a lot of voters feel with Obama, even if they are disappointed,'' said Mark McKinnon, a former strategist for Mr. Bush. ''It may be a bad marriage, but they still want to save it.''
It is Mr. Romney's job now to convince them that it is beyond repair; that the risks of staying in it are larger than the risks of starting anew with him, that he and Mr. Ryan represent a fresh start akin to a generational change.
But leading these voters -- many of them women -- to that conclusion takes finesse and delicacy, Republican strategists say. The sort of visceral attacks that conservative talk show hosts are calling for risk sending them into a defense posture on behalf of Mr. Obama and, more to the point, of their own decisions four years ago.
Rather, strategists say, it requires providing a path that gives them permission to make a break. They need to be told that it is O.K. to remain proud of their initial support for Mr. Obama, but that they can be equally at peace with a decision to change their minds now.
''There is no need to make people feel bad about what they've done to feel good about what they're going to do,'' said Stuart Stevens, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, as he sat in the empty convention hall Thursday afternoon in nervous anticipation of his boss's speech.
So it was that Mr. Romney went out of his way to tip his hat to the historic import of Mr. Obama's election, when he said ''many Americans felt a fresh excitement about the possibilities of a new president.''
But, in what amounted to perhaps the most forceful and effective portion of his address, Mr. Romney sought to give Mr. Obama's wavering 2008 voters a strong nudge from what he portrayed as a reverie, saying they have given the president time enough. ''Americans have been patient; Americans have supported this president in good faith,'' he said to a roar in the hall. ''Today the time has come to turn the page.''
The exhortation seemed aimed at disappointed swing voters, who, some polls show, might be inclined to give Mr. Obama more time because he inherited an economy in dire shape.
Mr. Romney's tone -- more lament than anger -- appeared to some analysts to be the most effective means of wresting away former Obama voters. ''There are signs he is making progress,'' Mr. McKinnon said, pointing to some polls that show Mr. Obama trailing Mr. Romney among independent voters.
This is not to say that there will be any going soft on Mr. Obama. Mr. Romney's campaign is running a raft of harsh advertisements against the president, including one that has been repeatedly criticized by news media ''fact checkers'' for falsely alleging he is stripping work requirements from the 1996 welfare overhaul law.
On Thursday Mr. Romney laced into Mr. Obama for bringing ''disappointment and division.'' And the evening before, Mr. Ryan gave something of a stemwinder, assailing Mr. Obama on multiple grounds, including running up the national debt.
With a newly flush bank account -- his acceptance of the nomination triggered the release of the money he collected for the general election -- Mr. Romney can afford to send out both harder-hitting and more nuanced messages at once for the first time since he emerged earlier this year as his party's presumed nominee.
And Mr. Ryan, 42, perhaps has a bit more leeway than Mr. Romney, 65, representing his own brand of change as the first vice-presidential nominee of Generation X, and his unveiling here has screamed ''new direction.'' Mr. Romney's aides have aggressively put him forward to make Mr. Obama look like the old order, turnabout for the man who took ownership of ''Change.''
And that goes to the other part of the equation here: Even if Mr. Romney's campaign continues to make inroads on the firing part, it has to make up ground on the hiring part, with polls showing him as lagging Mr. Obama on several personal ''likability'' measures.
''They see this guy as wealthy, disconnected, not like me,'' Margaret Spellings, Mr. Bush's former education secretary, said of wavering Obama voters during an interview here on Thursday. She said those voters were looking for ''the humanity side,'' of Mr. Romney, which his campaign did so much to present during this convention.
Ms. Spellings suggested that Mr. Romney had so far failed to overcome Mr. Obama decisively among undecided voters only because ''some of them haven't been paying attention.''
With some 20 million people tuning in on Wednesday night, according to Nielsen ratings, they are now. And they will have less than 10 weeks to decide whether Mr. Obama's ''hope and change'' will remain another faded poster on the wall or can become a frame-worthy heirloom with four more years.

HEADLINE: Romney's Speech to Highlight His Own Story and Frustration With Obama

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Mitt Romney will call upon disappointed and disaffected Americans to turn President Obama out of office in November, arguing in his convention speech that the president has failed to deliver the hope that he promised four years ago.
In advance excerpts from remarks that he will deliver on Thursday night, Mr. Romney expresses sadness for what he says was Mr. Obama's inability to confront the nation's economic problems. And he urges voters to reflect on whether they remain as excited by Mr. Obama's ascension to the presidency as they were when they elected him almost four years ago.
''If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama?'' Mr. Romney will ask, according to the excerpts, which were released to reporters. ''You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him.''
In the remarks, Mr. Romney repeatedly expresses optimism about America's future and says that even though he opposed Mr. Obama's election, he joined with Americans in hoping that he would succeed. 
''But his promises gave way to disappointment and division,'' Mr. Romney plans to say.
The excerpts suggest that the address will not use the kind of searing language that he has often used on the campaign trail to tear down Mr. Obama. Instead, Mr. Romney will offer a look at his own life and a focus on the policies that he would pursue as president.
As part of his campaign's effort to reach out to women, Mr. Romney will talk in more personal terms about his mother than he has before.
''When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way,'' he will say, according to the excerpts. ''I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, 'Why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation?' ''
The tone of the speech suggests that Mr. Romney is hoping to use his moment on the campaign's biggest stage to rise above the bitter political sniping that has characterized much of the 2012 presidential campaign.
''The time has come for us to put the disappointments of the last four years behind us,'' Mr. Romney will say, ''to put aside the divisiveness and the recriminations.''
But there clearly will be moments when Mr. Romney will offer an audience that could be in the tens of millions the tough critique about Mr. Obama that they have come to expect. Referring to the president's speech in 2008 when he clinched the nomination, Mr. Romney mocked Mr. Obama's celebrity.
''President Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet,'' Mr. Romney will say. ''My promise is to help you and your family.''
Polls consistently suggest that Mr. Romney remains less well liked among voters than Mr. Obama, and that he must use the speech to bring to life his own personal story.
In the convention's keynote address on Tuesday, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey argued that politicians should strive for respect rather than love. But if Americans want to love their presidents, Mr. Romney's speech on Thursday may be his best opportunity to cement that courtship.
Aides said Mr. Romney's speech would cap an evening intended to reclaim a positive story line about his life's experiences after a summer in which Mr. Obama's campaign has portrayed him as a wealthy, out-of-touch business executive who cares more for profit than people.
''What you are going to see tonight is a lot of telling Governor Romney's personal story,'' said Russ Schriefer, a top adviser to Mr. Romney's campaign who is producing the convention.
That effort will start early, with speakers from the Mormon Church testifying about Mr. Romney's character. Associates from his years at Bain Capital will counter the Democratic criticisms about the private equity firm with testimonials about his experience there. The founder of Staples will testify about the success of Mr. Romney's investments. Three Olympians will praise his leadership of the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City.
Organizers of the convention are counting on Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a popular figure in the state and among Hispanics, to inject energy into the crowd and project a diverse image to viewers. A mystery speaker is rumored to be the actor Clint Eastwood. Aides refused to confirm whether Mr. Eastwood would appear.
''It wouldn't be a mystery,'' Mr. Schriefer said. ''It seems to be driving interest this way.''
But it will ultimately fall to Mr. Romney to make the case on his own behalf, a fact that he and his advisers seem to fully understand. Advisers said he had been working on the speech on and off for most of the summer, including reviewing addresses by past nominees.
''He's been thinking about it for months, making notes and reading other speeches, reading broadly on a lot of subjects,'' Stuart Stevens, Mr. Romney's chief strategist, told reporters this week. ''He keeps a lot of notes.''
Mr. Romney has proved himself to be a disciplined -- if not often inspiring -- speaker during the last six years. His challenge Thursday night remains whether he can connect with viewers on a personal level, earning their trust and making them feel they could imagine him sitting in the Oval Office.
The bar for the speech was raised a bit on Wednesday night by his running mate, Paul D. Ryan, who delivered a well-received speech that mixed folksy charm with policy attacks to the delight of the thousands packed into the convention hall.
It also follows the address by Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, who repeatedly brought delegates to their feet with a pointed critique of America's place in the world and her personal observations about the nation's decline under Mr. Obama.
For days, organizers worried about the political reverberations of Mr. Romney's remarks coming after Hurricane Isaac slammed into the Gulf Coast, distracting the audience at a crucial time in the campaign. Throughout the week, aides continued to hold out the option of changing the schedule to avoid looking indifferent to the suffering of those in the storm's path.
The storm has produced scenes of flooding and at least one death. But it did not hit with the kind of force that Hurricane Katrina did seven years ago, persuading organizers to go ahead with the program. Mr. Obama has also continued to campaign as the storm made landfall and moved inland.
On Friday, after his speech, Mr. Romney will hold a rally in Florida before heading on to Virginia and then Ohio -- all battleground states that are crucial to his campaign's success.

HEADLINE: Facts Take a Beating In Acceptance Speeches

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Representative Paul D. Ryan used his convention speech on Wednesday to fault President Obama for failing to act on a deficit-reduction plan that he himself had helped kill. He chided Democrats for seeking $716 billion in Medicare cuts that he too had sought. And he lamented the nation's credit rating -- which was downgraded after a debt-ceiling standoff that he and other House Republicans helped instigate.
And Mitt Romney, in his acceptance speech on Thursday night, asserted that President Obama's policies had ''not helped create jobs'' and that Mr. Obama had gone on an ''apology tour'' for America. He also warned that the president's Medicare cuts would ''hurt today's seniors,'' claims that have already been labeled false or misleading.
The two speeches -- peppered with statements that were incorrect or incomplete -- seemed to signal the arrival of a new kind of presidential campaign, one in which concerns about fact-checking have been largely set aside. 
In recent weeks, the Romney campaign has broadcast television advertisements leveling the widely debunked assertion that Mr. Obama had gutted the work requirements for welfare recipients. The Obama campaign, for its part, ran a deceptive ad saying that Mitt Romney had ''backed a bill that outlaws all abortion, even in case of rape and incest,'' although he currently supports exceptions in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at risk.
The growing number of misrepresentations appear to reflect a calculation in both parties that shame is overrated, and that no independent arbiters command the stature or the platform to hold the campaigns to account in the increasingly polarized and balkanized media firmament. Any unmasking of the lies or distortions, the thinking goes, rarely seeps into the public consciousness.
But an interesting question unfolding is whether there is a tipping point at which a candidate becomes so associated with falsehoods that it becomes part of his public persona -- which hampered Vice President Al Gore during his run for president in 2000, when his misstatements on the campaign trail were used to stoke the perception that he could not be trusted in general.
In the case of Mr. Ryan's speech, the jury is still out. It was received rapturously by the Republican Party faithful, but his many questionable assertions ensured that much of the analysis on Thursday focused on his accuracy more than his acumen.
The Obama campaign fanned the flames with a Web video mocking Mr. Ryan, showing anchors from CNN and Fox News questioning some of his statements. And Stephanie Cutter, the president's deputy campaign manager, was blunt. ''There's no delicate way to say this: last night Paul Ryan lied, repeatedly, knowingly and brazenly,'' she said.
Here are some of the misleading section of their convention speeches:
Deficit Commission
One of Mr. Ryan's most pointed attacks on Mr. Obama was on the deficit. ''He created a new bipartisan debt commission,'' Mr. Ryan noted. ''They came back with an urgent report. He thanked them, sent them on their way and then did exactly nothing.''
Left unsaid: Mr. Ryan served on that commission himself, and his opposition to its final proposals helped seal its fate. The panel, known as the Simpson-Bowles deficit commission, made a number of recommendations that Mr. Ryan ultimately opposed on the grounds that they would have raised some taxes while failing to cut enough from health programs. His dismissal of the plan was seen as a significant blow to its chances of success, since it soured other House Republicans on it.
Credit Rating
In his attack on the president's time in office, Mr. Ryan said: ''It began with a perfect AAA credit rating for the United States. It ends with the downgraded America.''
When Standard & Poor's lowered the nation's credit rating, it was in large part because of the standoff last year over the debt ceiling -- which needed to be raised so the government could borrow money to pay for spending that Congress had already approved. The White House had asked Congress to simply raise the debt ceiling; Mr. Ryan and House Republicans balked at doing so without reaching a deal on significant spending cuts. The ensuing standoff took the nation to the brink of default.
In its statement explaining the downgrade, Standard & Poor's wrote that ''the political brinkmanship of recent months highlights what we see as America's governance and policy making becoming less stable, less effective and less predictable than what we previously believed. The statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy.''
Medicare
Mr. Ryan spoke out forcefully against the ''$716 billion funneled out of Medicare by President Obama,'' without noting that his own past budget plans had counted on the same savings. And he pledged to protect Medicare without explaining how the Romney-Ryan plan would change it. Mr. Romney said that the Medicare cuts would ''hurt today's seniors.'' In fact, the savings would come not from trimming benefits for current recipients, but from cutting the projected growth in reimbursements to hospitals and insurers over the next decade. The Medicare debate is shaping up as central to the election: Democrats say that the Romney-Ryan plan to reshape Medicare would force future beneficiaries to pay more for their health care, while Republicans fault Mr. Obama for cutting $716 billion in its projected growth.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have proposed limiting the government's open-ended financial commitment to Medicare. Under their plan, the government would contribute a fixed amount on behalf of each beneficiary, and future beneficiaries could use that money to buy private insurance or to help pay for coverage under the traditional Medicare program. It would apply only to people currently under 55.
Mr. Ryan's earlier plans called for capping the rate at which Medicare spending would grow -- which analysts from groups including the Kaiser Family Foundation found would lead to higher out-of-pocket costs for future beneficiaries. The Romney campaign now says that their plan would work differently from Mr. Ryan's original proposal, and would have the flexibility to raise the proposed cap on spending if it does not keep up with costs.
The $716 billion cut to Medicare that Mr. Obama made will reduce payments to health maintenance organizations and hospitals and other health care providers. Mr. Ryan initially counted on the same savings in his budget plans.
G.M.'s Janesville Plant
Mr. Ryan appeared to criticize Mr. Obama for the closing of a General Motors plant in Mr. Ryan's hometown of Janesville, Wis. -- a decision made before the president was elected and before his bailout of the auto industry, which was credited with saving a number of other factories. He noted that Mr. Obama had visited the plant in 2008 and said, ''I believe that if our government is there to support you, this plant will be here for another hundred years.''
''Well, as it turned out,'' Mr. Ryan said, ''that plant didn't last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day.''
As a candidate, Mr. Obama did give an economic policy speech at the Janesville plant in February 2008. The decision to close the plant was made several months later -- as can be seen by a June 2008 letter from Mr. Ryan urging G.M. to reconsider.
It took some time for the plant to shut down, and some work continued there after Mr. Obama was sworn in as president.
The Ryan campaign said Thursday that the issue was not when the plant stopped production, but the fact that it has not reopened -- and pointed to accounts of an Obama campaign statement from the fall of 2008 in which he said, ''I will lead an effort to retool plants like the G.M. facility in Janesville so we can build the fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow and create good-paying jobs in Wisconsin and all across America."
While Mr. Obama bailed out the auto industry, saving jobs, and included money in the stimulus for ''green'' energy jobs, the Janesville plant did not benefit from his moves.
The Apology Tour
In his floor speech, Mr. Romney repeated his widely debunked charge that Mr. Obama had gone on an ''apology tour'' on America's behalf -- an accusation he feels so strongly about that he laid out his own worldview in a 2010 book he titled ''No Apology.''
But independent fact checkers have called the accusation a distortion, and it is hard to find evidence that Mr. Obama ever said he was sorry for the United States. Even in his speeches after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr. Obama offered a strong defense of American policies, including the war in Afghanistan, which was growing increasingly unpopular in the rest of the world.

HEADLINE: Mr. Romney Reinvents History

 BODY:
Mitt Romney wrapped the most important speech of his life, for Thursday night's session of his convention, around an extraordinary reinvention of history -- that his party rallied behind President Obama when he won in 2008, hoping that he would succeed. ''That president was not the choice of our party,'' he said. ''We are a good and generous people who are united by so much more than divides us.''
The truth, rarely heard this week in Tampa, Fla., is that the Republicans charted a course of denial and obstruction from the day Mr. Obama was inaugurated, determined to deny him a second term by denying him any achievement, no matter the cost to the economy or American security -- even if it meant holding the nation's credit rating hostage to a narrow partisan agenda. 
Mr. Romney's big speech, delivered in a treacly tone with a strange misty smile on his face suggesting he was always about to burst into tears, was of a piece with the rest of the convention. Republicans have offered precious little of substance but a lot of bromides (''A free world is a more peaceful world!'') meant to convey profundity and take passive-aggressive digs at President Obama. But no subjects have received less attention, or been treated with less honesty, than foreign affairs and national security -- and Mr. Romney's banal speech was no exception.
It's easy to understand why the Republicans have steered clear of these areas. While President Obama is vulnerable on some domestic issues, the Republicans have no purchase on foreign and security policy. In a television interview on Wednesday, Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, could not name an area in which Mr. Obama had failed on foreign policy.
For decades, the Republicans were able to present themselves as the tougher party on foreign and military policy. Mr. Obama has robbed them of that by being aggressive on counterterrorism and by flexing military and diplomatic muscle repeatedly and effectively.
Mitt Romney has tried to sound tough, but it's hard to see how he would act differently from Mr. Obama except in ways that are scary -- like attacking Iran, or overspending on defense in ways that would not provide extra safety but would hurt the economy.
Before Thursday night, the big foreign policy speeches were delivered by Senator John McCain and Ms. Rice. Mr. McCain was specific on one thing: Mr. Obama's plan to start pulling out of Afghanistan at the end of 2014 is too rapid. While he does not speak for Mr. Romney, his other ideas were unnerving, like suggesting that the United States should intervene in Syria.
Mr. Romney reportedly considered Ms. Rice as a running mate, and she seems to have real influence. But Ms. Rice is a reminder of the colossal errors and deceptions of George W. Bush's administration. She was a central player in the decision to invade Iraq and the peddling of fantasies about weapons of mass destruction. She barely mentioned Iraq in her speech and spoke not at all about Afghanistan. She was particularly ludicrous when she talked about keeping America strong at home so it could be strong globally, since she was part of the team that fought two wars off the books and entirely on borrowed money.
Ms. Rice said the United States has lost its ''exceptionalism,'' but she never gave the slightest clue what she meant by that -- a return to President Bush's policy of preventive and unnecessary war?
She and Mr. McCain both invoked the idea of ''peace through strength,'' but one of the few concrete proposals Mr. Romney has made -- spending 4 percent of G.D.P. on defense -- would weaken the economy severely. Mr. McCain was not telling the truth when he said Mr. Obama wants to cut another $500 billion from military spending. That amount was imposed by the Republicans as part of the extortion they demanded to raise the debt ceiling.
Ms. Rice said American allies need to know where the United States stands and that alliances are vitally important. But the truth is that Mr. Obama has repaired those alliances and restored allies' confidence in America's position after Mr. Bush and Ms. Rice spent years tearing them apart and ruining America's reputation in the world.
The one alliance on which there is real debate between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama is with Israel. But it is not, as Mr. Romney and his supporters want Americans to believe, about whether Mr. Obama is a supporter of Israel. Every modern president has been, including Mr. Obama. Apart from outsourcing his policy to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on settlements, it's not clear what Mr. Romney would do differently.
But after watching the Republicans for three days in Florida, that comes as no surprise.

HEADLINE: A U.S. Campaign Fixated on Another Era

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- This U.S. election campaign is being billed as a battle of big ideas. That is a good thing. But it is a shame that the fight is not being waged in the 21st century.
In choosing Representative Paul D. Ryan as his running mate, Mitt Romney swapped his Massachusetts pragmatism for a proudly ideological commitment to limited government. The Democrats, by contrast, believe in the essential role government plays, and are willing to raise taxes, at least on the rich, to pay for it. 
This a clear and important battle line in the United States. But the argument over the size of the state comes with little regard for the very particular economic realities of this era. Like generals fighting the last war, U.S. politicians are solving the economic challenges of the past century.
That is a problem because we are living at a time of deep and fast economic change. The intuitive sense that the economy is becoming less predictable and less secure is right. Thanks to globalization and the technology revolution, the nature of work, the distribution of the rewards from that work and maybe even the economic cycle itself are being transformed.
But one would not know it from the U.S. political debate, whose familiar melodies of small state versus large state, higher taxes versus lower taxes and the importance, or not, of balancing the budget could have been played in any decade since World War II.
Most people in the United States are comfortable with these old songs -- everyone knows the words -- but they are an inadequate response to the new economic demands of the 21st century.
The economic reality is that, thanks to smart machines and global trade, the well-paying, middle-class jobs that were the backbone of Western democracies are vanishing. Neither Mitt Romney's smaller state nor Barack Obama's larger one will bring them back. That is because the paradoxical driver of this middle-class squeeze is not some villainous force -- it is, rather, the success of the world's best companies, many of them American.
The record profit at Caterpillar, for example, is a tribute to the company's skill at operating in a global marketplace and adopting cutting-edge technologies. But for some Caterpillar workers, that good news recently translated into a six-year wage freeze, which union employees accepted after a strike in Joliet, Illinois, failed to secure a better deal.
This is the knottiest economic problem of our time -- figuring out how to manage an economy whose engines of growth are enriching the few but squeezing the many.
Instinctively, Americans understand this is happening. That is why the Democratic ticket, despite the complaints of some of its wealthy backers, has stuck with its critique of Mr. Romney's former company, Bain Capital, as an outsourcer of jobs. The point that middle-class workers sometimes suffer from the same decisions that increase shareholder value is one that many Americans know from their own life experiences.
But what neither party likes to talk about much is that this socially malignant outcome is being driven at least in part by the forces of free-market capitalism that most people welcome. The attacks on outsourcing do not convince everyone, because they know that Mr. Obama has no intention of outlawing it -- and that if he did, the economic impact would be devastating.
The tempting answer, which I heard most recently in an interview with Glenn Hubbard, an economic adviser to Mr. Romney, is to optimistically assume that, just as the early traumas of the Industrial Revolution gave way to widespread prosperity in much of the world, the economic transformations of today will eventually work out.
''If you were to go back to 1940 and have this debate, we might worry, well, what if people are going to lose their farm jobs?'' Mr. Hubbard said. ''Then the debate was over manufacturing, then over service. And if an economist is honest with you, the best he or she can say is, what we need to do is allow those opportunities to happen, and they will.''
There are a few problems with this happy prediction. The first is that, while the Industrial Revolution did, indeed, eventually make ordinary people richer than at any other time in human history, it took two world wars and Communist revolutions in Russia and China for the world to iron out the kinks. The second is that, to make industrialization work, the West created an elaborate set of new political, social and economic institutions, including universal public education, trade unions and the social safety net.
It took more than the spinning jenny or the steam engine to transform local, agrarian, family-based communities into national, urban, individualistic ones. New political and social institutions will be needed to midwife the latest shift into global and virtual communities. Inventing those institutions is hard, and talking about them can be frightening, but that is the political conversation the Western world should be having today.

HEADLINE: Awaiting Guidance, Market Falls

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Thursday after several days of muted trading as investors took a defensive posture before a much-awaited speech by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. 
Mr. Bernanke, who will speak to central bankers Friday morning in Jackson Hole, Wyo., is expected to keep markets guessing about the timing of another round of bond purchases.
The mood was cautious in financial markets as a result of the high stakes surrounding Mr. Bernanke's speech and a meeting of the European Central Bank next Thursday that is expected to take some of the strain off highly indebted countries.
In a sign of slowing growth, shares of mining companies fell as iron ore prices dropped to the lowest level since 2009.
All 10 industry sectors of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were down, with technology, energy and materials leading the decline. The S.& P. index fell 11.01 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,399.48, closing below 1,400 for the first time since Aug. 6.
Economic data in the last two weeks has been a little stronger than expected, and Reuters surveys showed that investors and economists had grown more skeptical that the Fed would announce a new round of bond buying at its September meeting.
If Mr. Bernanke does not tip his hand, ''then the market is going down on the speech,'' said Uri Landesman, president of the hedge fund Platinum Partners. ''I don't think the market hangs in around 1,400 if he doesn't say anything substantive.''
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 106.77 points, or 0.81 percent, to 13,000.71. The Nasdaq composite index was down 32.47 points, or 1.05 percent, to 3,048.71.
Shares of Sears Holdings tumbled 7.9 percent to $52.90 after S.& P. Dow Jones Indices removed the company from the benchmark S.& P. 500 index, effective after the close of trading on Sept. 4. The chemicals maker LyondellBasell Industries, which will replace Sears on the index, rose 3.8 percent to $48.67.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 7/32, to 99 31/32, and the yield fell to 1.63 percent from 1.65 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Report On Iran Puts Israel in a Box

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN and DAVID E. SANGER; Jodi Rudoren reported from Jerusalem, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Myra Noveck contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- For Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the International Atomic Energy Agency on Thursday offered findings validating his longstanding position that while harsh economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation may have hurt Iran, they have failed to slow Tehran's nuclear program. If anything, the program is speeding up.
But the agency's report has also put Israel in a corner, documenting that Iran is close to crossing what Israel has long said is its red line: the capability to produce nuclear weapons in a location invulnerable to Israeli attack.
With the report that the country has already installed more than 2,100 centrifuges inside a virtually impenetrable underground laboratory, and that it has ramped up production of nuclear fuel, officials and experts here say the conclusions may force Israel to strike Iran or concede it is not prepared to act on its own. 
Whether that ultimately leads to a change in strategy -- or a unilateral attack -- is something that even Israel's inner circle cannot yet agree on, despite what seems to be a consensus that Iran's program may soon be beyond the reach of Israel's military capability.
''It leaves us at this dead end,'' said a senior government official here, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he is involved in the decision-making process. ''The more time elapses with no change on the ground in terms of Iranian policies, the more it becomes a zero-sum game.''
The report accentuates the tension with Washington during the hot-tempered atmosphere of a presidential election. President Obama and Mr. Netanyahu often say they have a common assessment of the intelligence about Iran's progress. What they do not agree on is the time available.
American officials have repeatedly tried to assure the Israelis that they have the country's back -- and to remind them that Israel does not have the ability, by itself, to destroy the facility, built beneath a mountain outside Qum. The United States does have weaponry that it believes can demolish the lab, but in Mr. Obama's judgment there is still what the White House calls ''time and space'' for diplomacy, sanctions and sabotage, a combination the Israelis say has been insufficient.
''They can't do it right without us,'' a former adviser to Mr. Obama said recently. ''And we're trying to persuade them that a strike that just drives the program more underground isn't a solution; it's a bigger problem.''
The report comes at a critical moment in Israel's long campaign to build Western support for stopping Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, which virtually every leader here regards as an existential threat. Military professionals concede the potential effectiveness of an Israeli strike is decreasing as Iran moves more of its operations underground. (Already, the best Israel might be able to accomplish, they say, is to close the tunnel entrances around the underground plant, called Fordow, rather than destroy what is inside.)
Politically, Israeli leaders are concerned they will lose leverage after the November presidential election -- regardless of the result -- but are also worried about a pre-election strike that angers Washington, whose support would be all the more critical in its aftermath.
A month after a blitz of visits by high-ranking American security officials, the frenzy of public discussion here over the imminence of an attack has quieted, as Israelis have returned from summer vacation and begun preparing for the High Holy Days. But several high-ranking government officials said the study, debate and lobbying in the tight circle of decision-makers has intensified, and Israel has taken steps to shore up the home front and prepare its citizens.
Many inside the government, along with independent analysts, say the status quo is not sustainable. Unless the international community finds new ways to apply diplomatic pressure, or the United States issues a clear ultimatum to Iran about its intentions to act militarily, they say, the chances of an Israeli attack this year will climb.
''If the U.S. makes it clear to the Iranians that they may go to war, there will be no need for anyone to go to war,'' one top Israeli official said.
Asked about the report, Mr. Obama's spokesman, Jay Carney, said, ''The president has made clear frequently he is determined to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.'' But he set no deadlines, and officials said Mr. Obama was not likely to specify a date or exact set of conditions that would provoke a military response.
Several leaders and analysts in Israel are pinning their hopes on a possible meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu when the prime minister travels to the United Nations General Assembly in late September.
''The tragedy is the failure of these two to get over their grudges and the bad blood and work in an intimate, serious way together,'' said Ari Shavit, a columnist for the left-leaning newspaper Haaretz. ''Rather than the great democracy and the small democracy working together, they seem to be working with deep suspicion of each other.''
The critical difference between the American and Israeli views of the situation has long been one of timing. In Jerusalem, the clocks are ticking -- and, as a senior government official put it, ''all of them are now ticking at a higher speed.''
''Every week they get closer,'' this official said of Iran, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he, too, is involved in the high-level deliberations. ''While our side can, every week, seem to be in the same place, their side every week gets closer to this target.'' (Iran contends its nuclear work is for peaceful purposes.)
Though Mr. Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak are crucial to making the final call, attention has turned to a group of 14 ministers known as the inner cabinet, or security cabinet. Yossi Melman, an author of ''Spies Against Armageddon,'' a history of Israeli intelligence, said military actions typically required ''a solid majority'' of 12 or 13 members of this group, which is currently divided.
Three or four of the ministers are believed to be opposed to an independent Israeli strike, while six seem to be in favor. Two big unknowns are Deputy Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who both declined to be interviewed.
Mr. Netanyahu has been wooing Mr. Yaalon, including him in a small dinner when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was here in July. In a recent Twitter post, Mr. Yaalon warned, ''History will judge whether the U.S. faced up to the Shiite threat in time to prevent Iran from acquiring a military nuclear capability.'' But further posts indicated some wiggle room: ''Anyone who wants to prevent the exercise of military power must see that additional biting sanctions are applied,'' he wrote.
Mr. Lieberman, who frequently diverges from Mr. Netanyahu, said on television last week, ''There is no situation in which Israel can accept a nuclear Iran.''
The divisions in the cabinet -- and more broadly in Israel -- are not along the usual left-right or hawk-dove lines. The disputes are mainly over how best to engage the United States.
''Remember, it's whether to attack now or attack later; it's not between peaceniks and warmongers,'' Mr. Melman said. ''The argument against is don't hurt the U.S. relationship, don't risk relations with the president just for the satisfaction of conducting an attack before the election.''
David Makovsky of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who spent more than a decade in Israel, said ''the center of political gravity could shift very quickly'' if the Obama administration does not do something more.
Martin S. Indyk, a former United States ambassador to Israel who is now foreign policy director of the Brookings Institution, said he was struck that Israel had in recent weeks begun to distribute gas masks, examine bomb shelters and enact a text-messaging warning system.
Uzi Arad, a former national security adviser for Israel, recalled accompanying Mr. Netanyahu -- then the leader of the opposition -- to a meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in 2007. The Israelis argued that the only thing with ''sufficient punch'' to stop Iran from developing a weapon, Mr. Arad said, was crippling sanctions, including measures against the energy sector, ''coupled with a clear and present credible military option that continuing the program would not succeed because inevitably it will bring military action.''
Five years later, those around Mr. Netanyahu are saying much the same thing, and may be growing tired of waiting.

HEADLINE: Obama Team Sharpens Attacks on Rivals' Character

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As the Obama campaign heads into its convention next week, Democrats see openings both to fill in unpopular details of Mitt Romney's agenda left unsaid by Republicans in Tampa this week and to raise new questions about Mr. Romney's character after widespread criticism of misstatements by him and his running mate, Paul D. Ryan.
''It's sort of breathtaking that Paul Ryan made a whole speech about being truthful and making hard choices and yet he never mentioned a single idea of theirs -- like turning Medicare into a voucher program, or a new $5 trillion tax cut they can't pay for,'' David Axelrod, President Obama's chief strategist, said in an interview on Thursday, hours before Mr. Romney's own acceptance speech. ''They've spent an entire week not talking about their ideas because they know their ideas are unpopular.'' 
But worse than what Republicans have not said, Mr. Axelrod added, is what Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have said: ''a compendium of demonstrable lies,'' including widely refuted claims that Mr. Obama is trying to end work requirements for welfare recipients and is ''raiding'' $716 billion from Medicare beneficiaries.
''The audacity of mendacity,'' Mr. Axelrod called it, in a play on the title of Mr. Obama's 2006 book, ''The Audacity of Hope.'' He added, ''It's lying as a campaign strategy.''
The partisan operative's critique was harsh even by the standards of the normal combat of presidential politics. But it is one that was echoed to some degree by a raft of nonpartisan fact-checking articles, commentary and editorial columns recently, especially on Thursday after Mr. Ryan, who generally has been credited as a straight-shooter throughout his career in the House of Representatives, in his prime-time convention speech on Wednesday night repeated some debunked claims by Mr. Romney and added a few widely disputed statements of his own.
The Obama campaign e-mailed collections of the criticisms and video links to reporters and supporters, and updated a ''Truth Team'' feature on its Web site. Top advisers said they would seek to make the Republican candidates' statements into a larger issue of character, one that they hoped would reinforce Mr. Romney's image among many voters as a shape-shifting politician who has reversed position on abortion and gay rights, gun control and other issues -- as his Republican rivals complained throughout their long nomination battle.
What is unclear is whether the Romney-Ryan ticket will pay a political price. In response to the criticism, a campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, said late Thursday, ''President Obama and his team are running a campaign of personal destruction to avoid talking about his failed economic record.''
Criticism from the Obama campaign could well be dismissed among voters as the usual stuff of politics, and independent fact-checkers have criticized some of Mr. Obama's statements, too. Still, the number of falsehoods and misleading statements from the Romney campaign coming in for independent criticism has reached a level not typically seen.
''The Romney campaign has, as is strikingly evident at the Tampa convention, broken new ground in its brazen and cynical disregard for the truth,'' said Thomas E. Mann, a longtime political scholar at the center-left Brookings Institution and co-author of the recent book about politics, ''It's Even Worse Than It Looks.''
Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan, he added, are ''counting on a mainstream press, fearful of being charged with partisan bias, of shrinking from their responsibility to report the truth.''
Mr. Obama this week, for the first time, entered the fray. Campaigning on Tuesday on college campuses in Iowa and Colorado, he told thousands of supporters not to believe the opposition's attacks because, ''how do I put this nicely? They will just fib.'' On Wednesday in Charlottesville, Va., he ramped up his complaint, winning applause from the estimated 6,500 people.
''Sometimes they just make things up. But they've got a bunch of folks who can write $10 million checks, and they'll just keep on running them,'' he said. ''I mean, somebody was challenging one of their ads -- they made it up -- about work and welfare. And every outlet said this is just not true. And they were asked about it and they said -- one of their campaign people said, 'We won't have the fact-checkers dictate our campaign. We will not let the truth get in the way.'''
Mr. Obama was referring, as many other critics of the Romney campaign have, to a comment that its pollster, Neil Newhouse, made to reporters at the Republican convention on Tuesday, dismissive of those faulting the campaign's television ads. What Mr. Newhouse actually said was, ''These fact-checkers come to those ads with their own sets of thoughts and beliefs. We're not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers.''
Mr. Newhouse did not say, ''We will not let the truth get in the way.''

HEADLINE: Romney Vows to Deliver Country From Economic Travails

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Michael D. Shear, Adam Nagourney and Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Mitt Romney accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday by making a direct appeal to Americans who were captivated by President Obama's hopeful promises of change, pledging that he could deliver what the president did not and move the country from its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
The speech by Mr. Romney, delivered on the closing night of the Republican convention, signaled an attempt to redefine the race around his business background, which Democrats have spent the summer attacking. He urged voters not to feel guilty about giving up on Mr. Obama, even if they were proud to support him as the nation's first black president.
''You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president,'' Mr. Romney said, ''when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him.'' 
But even as Mr. Romney delivered a pointed critique of Mr. Obama's domestic and foreign policy, saying that he had ''thrown Israel under the bus,'' he also used the marquee speech of his campaign to make a case for himself. He invited people from each chapter of his life to paint a humanizing portrait to help voters see him with a trusting eye.
''This president can tell us it was someone else's fault. This president can tell us that the next four years he'll get it right,'' Mr. Romney said. ''But this president cannot tell us that you are better off today than when he took office.''
With 67 days remaining before Election Day, the presidential race has been essentially locked in place, with each side hoping to win over a small slice of the electorate that is still undecided. The Democratic Party will offer its rebuttal at its own convention next week in North Carolina, with voters being left to judge whether either party advanced its case.
The speech loomed as Mr. Romney's most important since he began openly exploring his presidential aspirations nearly a decade ago. It was an opportunity to present himself to Americans who are just now beginning to tune in to this campaign and to make the case against Mr. Obama, particularly to the people who voted for him.
''If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama?'' Mr. Romney said.
The Republican convention, which had been delayed earlier in the week by Tropical Storm Isaac, ended in a rousing and respectful acclamation for Mr. Romney. While he has often been viewed with suspicion by conservative activists, he is now widely seen in a new light as a man who stands a strong chance of winning back the White House.
In a campaign where foreign policy has often been a side note, Mr. Romney showed that he does not intend to shy away from aggressively challenging Mr. Obama's foreign policy. He said the president had ''abandoned our friends in Poland,'' been duped by Iran and been too weak toward Russia.
''Every American was relieved the day President Obama gave the order and SEAL Team 6 took out Osama bin Laden,'' Mr. Romney said. ''But on another front, every American is less secure today because he has failed to slow Iran's nuclear threat.''
But the evening was not entirely serious, with a bizarre element of stagecraft playing out as the actor Clint Eastwood strode into the convention hall to deliver a meandering monologue that criticized the president. He used an empty bar stool sitting on stage as a prop to hold an imaginary conversation with Mr. Obama, which occupied the first 15 minutes of coverage on the broadcast television networks.
He engaged in a series of exchanges, saying at one point, ''What do you want me to tell Mr. Romney?'' He replied, ''I can't tell him that. He can't do that to himself,'' Mr. Eastwood said. Then he said, ''You're getting as bad as Biden.''
The audience inside the hall responded with curiosity to the bit of old Hollywood. From her seat on the convention floor, Ann Romney watched with a nervous look on her face.
The dynamics shaping the general election campaign, particularly the challenges facing Mr. Romney, came to life during the convention and in his 39-minute acceptance speech. Improving his standing among female voters is critical to his chances for victory, aides said, and Mr. Romney amplified a steady theme of messages aimed at women.
''When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way,'' Mr. Romney said, parceling out another piece of his biography. ''I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, 'Why should women have any less say than men, about the great decisions facing our nation?' ''
A party that has struggled to increase its appeal to female, Hispanic and black voters featured a diverse lineup of speakers throughout the week, concluding with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who introduced Mr. Romney on Thursday evening. A favorite of Tea Party activists, Mr. Rubio embraced Mr. Romney as ''a special man to lead us in a special time.''
Mr. Romney swept into the convention hall to an enthusiastic welcome, ending his long journey across two presidential election cycles to reach this moment. The applause grew louder as he took the stage and formally accepted the nomination at 10:36 p.m.
''I accept your nomination for president of the United States,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I do so with humility, deeply moved by the trust you place in me. It's a great honor and it's an even greater responsibility.''
Throughout the evening, Mr. Romney's life story unspooled before the Republican delegates inside the Tampa Bay Times Forum. Testimonials were intended to reshape perceptions about Mr. Romney that have hardened after a negative television advertising campaign from the president and his Democratic allies. Business owners, longtime friends, Olympic athletes and fellow Mormons offered personal anecdotes to help humanize Mr. Romney.
The stories were intended to help build a fuller picture of Mr. Romney, who has been reluctant to talk about some details of his private life. During his speech, he also talked about his Mormon faith, a subject he rarely raises during the campaign, saying, ''My friends cared more about what sports teams we followed than what church we went to.''
He beamed as he recalled his childhood in Michigan, where his father was governor and a Republican presidential candidate in 1968. He struck out on his own, saying: ''If I stayed around Michigan in the same business, I never would know if I got a break because of my dad.''
The speech was warmly received among Republicans who were interviewed as balloons and confetti slowly fell from the rafters and Mr. Romney was joined on stage by his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and their families.
Mike Osborne, 63, a delegate from California, said: ''His opponents have tried to define him as a rich kid from Michigan who lived off his parents. I know that's not true, but now everybody else will too. I felt an energy in the room I have not felt before.''

HEADLINE: Romney's Speech to the Republican Convention

 BODY:
Following is the full text of Mitt Romney's address to the Republican National Convention, as prepared for delivery.
Mr. Chairman, delegates. I accept your nomination for President of the United States of America.
I do so with humility, deeply moved by the trust you have placed in me. It is a great honor. It is an even greater responsibility.
Tonight I am asking you to join me to walk together to a better future. By my side, I have chosen a man with a big heart from a small town. He represents the best of America, a man who will always make us proud -- my friend and America's next Vice President, Paul Ryan.
In the days ahead, you will get to know Paul and Janna better. But last night America got to see what I saw in Paul Ryan -- a strong and caring leader who is down to earth and confident in the challenge this moment demands. 
I love the way he lights up around his kids and how he's not embarrassed to show the world how much he loves his mom.
But Paul, I still like the playlist on my iPod better than yours.
Four years ago, I know that many Americans felt a fresh excitement about the possibilities of a new president. That president was not the choice of our party but Americans always come together after elections. We are a good and generous people who are united by so much more than what divides us.
When that hard fought election was over, when the yard signs came down and the television commercials finally came off the air, Americans were eager to go back to work, to live our lives the way Americans always have -- optimistic and positive and confident in the future.
That very optimism is uniquely American.
It is what brought us to America. We are a nation of immigrants. We are the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the ones who wanted a better life, the driven ones, the ones who woke up at night hearing that voice telling them that life in that place called America could be better.
They came not just in pursuit of the riches of this world but for the richness of this life.
Freedom.
Freedom of religion.
Freedom to speak their mind.
Freedom to build a life.
And yes, freedom to build a business. With their own hands.
This is the essence of the American experience.
We Americans have always felt a special kinship with the future.
When every new wave of immigrants looked up and saw the Statue of Liberty, or knelt down and kissed the shores of freedom just ninety miles from Castro's tyranny, these new Americans surely had many questions. But none doubted that here in America they could build a better life, that in America their children would be more blessed than they.
But today, four years from the excitement of the last election, for the first time, the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future.
It is not what we were promised.
Every family in America wanted this to be a time when they could get ahead a little more, put aside a little more for college, do more for their elderly mom who's living alone now or give a little more to their church or charity.
Every small business wanted these to be their best years ever, when they could hire more, do more for those who had stuck with them through the hard times, open a new store or sponsor that Little League team.
Every new college graduate thought they'd have a good job by now, a place of their own, and that they could start paying back some of their loans and build for the future.
This is when our nation was supposed to start paying down the national debt and rolling back those massive deficits.
This was the hope and change America voted for.
It's not just what we wanted. It's not just what we expected.
It's what Americans deserved.
You deserved it because during these years, you worked harder than ever before. You deserved it because when it cost more to fill up your car, you cut out movie nights and put in longer hours. Or when you lost that job that paid $22.50 an hour with benefits, you took two jobs at 9 bucks an hour and fewer benefits. You did it because your family depended on you. You did it because you're an American and you don't quit. You did it because it was what you had to do.
But driving home late from that second job, or standing there watching the gas pump hit 50 dollars and still going, when the realtor told you that to sell your house you'd have to take a big loss, in those moments you knew that this just wasn't right.
But what could you do? Except work harder, do with less, try to stay optimistic. Hug your kids a little longer; maybe spend a little more time praying that tomorrow would be a better day.
I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed. But his promises gave way to disappointment and division. This isn't something we have to accept. Now is the moment when we CAN do something. With your help we will do something.
Now is the moment when we can stand up and say, ''I'm an American. I make my destiny. And we deserve better! My children deserve better! My family deserves better. My country deserves better!''
So here we stand. Americans have a choice. A decision.
To make that choice, you need to know more about me and about where I will lead our country.
I was born in the middle of the century in the middle of the country, a classic baby boomer. It was a time when Americans were returning from war and eager to work. To be an American was to assume that all things were possible. When President Kennedy challenged Americans to go to the moon, the question wasn't whether we'd get there, it was only when we'd get there.
The soles of Neil Armstrong's boots on the moon made permanent impressions on OUR souls and in our national psyche. Ann and I watched those steps together on her parent's sofa. Like all Americans we went to bed that night knowing we lived in the greatest country in the history of the world.
God bless Neil Armstrong.
Tonight that American flag is still there on the moon. And I don't doubt for a second that Neil Armstrong's spirit is still with us: that unique blend of optimism, humility and the utter confidence that when the world needs someone to do the really big stuff, you need an American.
That's how I was brought up.
My dad had been born in Mexico and his family had to leave during the Mexican revolution. I grew up with stories of his family being fed by the US Government as war refugees. My dad never made it through college and apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter. And he had big dreams. He convinced my mom, a beautiful young actress, to give up Hollywood to marry him. He moved to Detroit, led a great automobile company and became Governor of the Great State of Michigan.
We were Mormons and growing up in Michigan; that might have seemed unusual or out of place but I really don't remember it that way. My friends cared more about what sports teams we followed than what church we went to.
My mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all -- the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would BE, and much less about what we would DO.
Unconditional love is a gift that Ann and I have tried to pass on to our sons and now to our grandchildren. All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family -- and God's love -- this world would be a far more gentle and better place.
Mom and Dad were married 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist -- because every day Dad gave Mom a rose, which he put on her bedside table. That's how she found out what happened on the day my father died -- she went looking for him because that morning, there was no rose.
My mom and dad were true partners, a life lesson that shaped me by everyday example. When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, ''Why should women have any less say than men, about the great decisions facing our nation?''
I wish she could have been here at the convention and heard leaders like Governor Mary Fallin, Governor Nikki Haley, Governor Susana Martinez, Senator Kelly Ayotte and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
As Governor of Massachusetts, I chose a woman Lt. Governor, a woman chief of staff, half of my cabinet and senior officials were women, and in business, I mentored and supported great women leaders who went on to run great companies.
I grew up in Detroit in love with cars and wanted to be a car guy, like my dad. But by the time I was out of school, I realized that I had to go out on my own, that if I stayed around Michigan in the same business, I'd never really know if I was getting a break because of my dad. I wanted to go someplace new and prove myself.
Those weren't the easiest of days -- too many long hours and weekends working, five young sons who seemed to have this need to re-enact a different world war every night. But if you ask Ann and I what we'd give, to break up just one more fight between the boys, or wake up in the morning and discover a pile of kids asleep in our room. Well, every mom and dad knows the answer to that.
Those days were toughest on Ann, of course. She was heroic. Five boys, with our families a long way away. I had to travel a lot for my job then and I'd call and try to offer support. But every mom knows that doesn't help get the homework done or the kids out the door to school.
I knew that her job as a mom was harder than mine. And I knew without question, that her job as a mom was a lot more important than mine. And as America saw Tuesday night, Ann would have succeeded at anything she wanted to.
Like a lot of families in a new place with no family, we found kinship with a wide circle of friends through our church. When we were new to the community it was welcoming and as the years went by, it was a joy to help others who had just moved to town or just joined our church. We had remarkably vibrant and diverse congregants from all walks of life and many who were new to America. We prayed together, our kids played together and we always stood ready to help each other out in different ways.
And that's how it is in America. We look to our communities, our faiths, our families for our joy, our support, in good times and bad. It is both how we live our lives and why we live our lives. The strength and power and goodness of America has always been based on the strength and power and goodness of our communities, our families, our faiths.
That is the bedrock of what makes America, America. In our best days, we can feel the vibrancy of America's communities, large and small.
It's when we see that new business opening up downtown. It's when we go to work in the morning and see everybody else on our block doing the same.
It's when our son or daughter calls from college to talk about which job offer they should take....and you try not to choke up when you hear that the one they like is not far from home.
It's that good feeling when you have more time to volunteer to coach your kid's soccer team, or help out on school trips.
But for too many Americans, these good days are harder to come by. How many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in America?
Many of you felt that way on Election Day four years ago. Hope and Change had a powerful appeal. But tonight I'd ask a simple question: If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama? You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him.
The President hasn't disappointed you because he wanted to. The President has disappointed America because he hasn't led America in the right direction. He took office without the basic qualification that most Americans have and one that was essential to his task. He had almost no experience working in a business. Jobs to him are about government.
I learned the real lessons about how America works from experience.
When I was 37, I helped start a small company. My partners and I had been working for a company that was in the business of helping other businesses.
So some of us had this idea that if we really believed our advice was helping companies, we should invest in companies. We should bet on ourselves and on our advice.
So we started a new business called Bain Capital. The only problem was, while WE believed in ourselves, nobody else did. We were young and had never done this before and we almost didn't get off the ground. In those days, sometimes I wondered if I had made a really big mistake. I had thought about asking my church's pension fund to invest, but I didn't. I figured it was bad enough that I might lose my investors' money, but I didn't want to go to hell too. Shows what I know. Another of my partners got the Episcopal Church pension fund to invest. Today there are a lot of happy retired priests who should thank him.
That business we started with 10 people has now grown into a great American success story. Some of the companies we helped start are names you know. An office supply company called Staples -- where I'm pleased to see the Obama campaign has been shopping; The Sports Authority, which became a favorite of my sons. We started an early childhood learning center called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised. At a time when nobody thought we'd ever see a new steel mill built in America, we took a chance and built one in a corn field in Indiana. Today Steel Dynamics is one of the largest steel producers in the United States.
These are American success stories. And yet the centerpiece of the President's entire re-election campaign is attacking success. Is it any wonder that someone who attacks success has led the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression? In America, we celebrate success, we don't apologize for it.
We weren't always successful at Bain. But no one ever is in the real world of business.
That's what this President doesn't seem to understand. Business and growing jobs is about taking risk, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding, but always striving. It is about dreams. Usually, it doesn't work out exactly as you might have imagined. Steve Jobs was fired at Apple. He came back and changed the world.
It's the genius of the American free enterprise system -- to harness the extraordinary creativity and talent and industry of the American people with a system that is dedicated to creating tomorrow's prosperity rather than trying to redistribute today's.
That is why every president since the Great Depression who came before the American people asking for a second term could look back at the last four years and say with satisfaction: ''you are better off today than you were four years ago.''
Except Jimmy Carter. And except this president.
This president can ask us to be patient.
This president can tell us it was someone else's fault.
This president can tell us that the next four years he'll get it right.
But this president cannot tell us that YOU are better off today than when he took office.
America has been patient. Americans have supported this president in good faith.
But today, the time has come to turn the page.
Today the time has come for us to put the disappointments of the last four years behind us.
To put aside the divisiveness and the recriminations.
To forget about what might have been and to look ahead to what can be.
Now is the time to restore the Promise of America. Many Americans have given up on this president but they haven't ever thought about giving up. Not on themselves. Not on each other. And not on America.
What is needed in our country today is not complicated or profound. It doesn't take a special government commission to tell us what America needs.
What America needs is jobs.
Lots of jobs.
In the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher, food prices are higher, utility bills are higher, and gasoline prices have doubled. Today more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before. Nearly one out of six Americans is living in poverty. Look around you. These are not strangers. These are our brothers and sisters, our fellow Americans.
His policies have not helped create jobs, they have depressed them. And this I can tell you about where President Obama would take America:
His plan to raise taxes on small business won't add jobs, it will eliminate them;
His assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China;
His trillion dollar cuts to our military will eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, and also put our security at greater risk;
His $716 billion cut to Medicare to finance Obamacare will both hurt today's seniors, and depress innovation -- and jobs -- in medicine.
And his trillion-dollar deficits will slow our economy, restrain employment, and cause wages to stall.
To the majority of Americans who now believe that the future will not be better than the past, I can guarantee you this: if Barack Obama is re-elected, you will be right.
I am running for president to help create a better future. A future where everyone who wants a job can find one. Where no senior fears for the security of their retirement. An America where every parent knows that their child will get an education that leads them to a good job and a bright horizon.
And unlike the President, I have a plan to create 12 million new jobs. It has 5 steps.
First, by 2020, North America will be energy independent by taking full advantage of our oil and coal and gas and nuclear and renewables.
Second, we will give our fellow citizens the skills they need for the jobs of today and the careers of tomorrow. When it comes to the school your child will attend, every parent should have a choice, and every child should have a chance.
Third, we will make trade work for America by forging new trade agreements. And when nations cheat in trade, there will be unmistakable consequences.
Fourth, to assure every entrepreneur and every job creator that their investments in America will not vanish as have those in Greece, we will cut the deficit and put America on track to a balanced budget.
And fifth, we will champion SMALL businesses, America's engine of job growth. That means reducing taxes on business, not raising them. It means simplifying and modernizing the regulations that hurt small business the most. And it means that we must rein in the skyrocketing cost of healthcare by repealing and replacing Obamacare.
Today, women are more likely than men to start a business. They need a president who respects and understands what they do.
And let me make this very clear -- unlike President Obama, I will not raise taxes on the middle class.
As president, I will protect the sanctity of life. I will honor the institution of marriage. And I will guarantee America's first liberty: the freedom of religion.
President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. MY promise...is to help you and your family.
I will begin my presidency with a jobs tour. President Obama began with an apology tour. America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No Mr. President, America has freed other nations from dictators.
Every American was relieved the day President Obama gave the order, and Seal Team Six took out Osama bin Laden. But on another front, every American is less secure today because he has failed to slow Iran's nuclear threat.
In his first TV interview as president, he said we should talk to Iran. We're still talking, and Iran's centrifuges are still spinning.
President Obama has thrown allies like Israel under the bus, even as he has relaxed sanctions on Castro's Cuba. He abandoned our friends in Poland by walking away from our missile defense commitments, but is eager to give Russia's President Putin the flexibility he desires, after the election. Under my administration, our friends will see more loyalty, and Mr. Putin will see a little less flexibility and more backbone.
We will honor America's democratic ideals because a free world is a more peaceful world. This is the bipartisan foreign policy legacy of Truman and Reagan. And under my presidency we will return to it once again.
You might have asked yourself if these last years are really the America we want, the America won for us by the greatest generation.
Does the America we want borrow a trillion dollars from China? No.
Does it fail to find the jobs that are needed for 23 million people and for half the kids graduating from college? No.
Are its schools lagging behind the rest of the developed world? No.
And does the America we want succumb to resentment and division? We know the answer.
The America we all know has been a story of the many becoming one, uniting to preserve liberty, uniting to build the greatest economy in the world, uniting to save the world from unspeakable darkness.
Everywhere I go in America, there are monuments that list those who have given their lives for America. There is no mention of their race, their party affiliation, or what they did for a living. They lived and died under a single flag, fighting for a single purpose. They pledged allegiance to the UNITED States of America.
That America, that united America, can unleash an economy that will put Americans back to work, that will once again lead the world with innovation and productivity, and that will restore every father and mother's confidence that their children's future is brighter even than the past.
That America, that united America, will preserve a military that is so strong, no nation would ever dare to test it.
That America, that united America, will uphold the constellation of rights that were endowed by our Creator, and codified in our Constitution.
That united America will care for the poor and the sick, will honor and respect the elderly, and will give a helping hand to those in need.
That America is the best within each of us. That America we want for our children.
If I am elected President of these United States, I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America, to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it, our nation depends upon it, the peace and freedom of the world require it. And with your help we will deliver it. Let us begin that future together tonight.

HEADLINE: Reacting to Ryan's Acceptance Speech

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Rousing G.O.P., Ryan Faults 'Missing' Leadership'' (front page, Aug. 30):
I'm the eternal optimist and am repeatedly taken aback that people campaigning for office think they have to be nasty and say ugly things about the other candidate to win an election.
Representative Paul D. Ryan accepted the vice-presidential nomination with a rousing speech. He delivered it well, but it was a speech that did not offer solutions. Mr. Ryan pointed the finger at President Obama but didn't offer one concrete plan for how he and Mitt Romney would change things. 
It's politics as usual this week at the Republican Convention. Politician after politician has taken the podium in Tampa to glory in his or her own personal stories and then to blast the president with outright lies about his four years in office.
What are the Republicans really going to do if elected? Who knows? They don't seem to know either.
JENNIFER DORN New York, Aug. 30, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''The Vacuum Behind the Slogans'' (editorial, Aug. 30):
In Representative Paul D. Ryan's brilliant speech, he not only laid out every failure of the Obama administration clearly and boldly, but he also did not duck any issue in elaborating what has to be done to begin solving the enormous problems that face Americans. How you could proclaim that Mr. Ryan ''ducked the tough issues'' is beyond reason.
Let me cite a few examples. Perhaps most important was that he brought up the first glaring fiasco of the Obama administration -- the president's failure to concentrate on job creation as soon as he took office. Instead, he coerced the nation to deal with an expansive health care plan that no one wanted. The rules, regulations, demands, penalties, increased taxes and bureaucracies imposed were not only mind-boggling, but also contrary to the spirit of free choice.
Next, Mr. Ryan discussed the $800 billion stimulus plan by President Obama to supposedly help create jobs but which created few jobs, as attested by the continuing high unemployment rate. So where did the money go? A good deal of it went to finance many of his cronies' companies that had no chance of success and went bankrupt soon after, like Solyndra and other boondoggles.
Of course there is much, much more, but it would take an encyclopedia to enumerate them all.
WILLIAM FIRSHEIN Middletown, Conn., Aug. 30, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''Romney Seen Pulled 2 Ways Over Economy'' (front page, Aug. 28):
Many voters are anticipating the 2012 election with deep ambivalence. A significant number who supported Barack Obama in 2008 are disillusioned with his performance as president. Voting for him in 2012 is not an attractive option for them.
Similarly, many voters who might otherwise have voted Republican are not comfortable voting for the Romney-Ryan ticket; the party has veered too far to the right for them.
A way out of the dilemma for these voters is to split the ticket, choosing one party for the presidential vote and the other for Congressional seats.
As your article indicated, Mitt Romney's business and political experience pull him two ways on the economy. Resolving these opposing pulls as governor of Massachusetts with a Democratic legislature led to interesting outcomes, including statewide health insurance and the closing of budget deficits through spending cuts and increased revenues.
Mr. Romney did well as a collaborative, problem-solving Republican governor with a Democratic legislature. He might very well achieve the same level of performance as president with a Democratic Congress.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With: Constitution Expert Madhav Khosla

BYLINE: AAYUSH SONI


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Khosla has written a guide to understanding India's constitution, the lengthiest in the world 

 BODY:
Q.
Do you think Indians should be (or can be) "introduced" to the Constitution?
A.
I think it depends a lot on what you mean by introduction. I don't intend to make a flippant, semantic response, but I think what all of us ought to do is to, at some level, engage with some of the central debates in it. One of the interesting things is that in the U.S., it's amazing how much general knowledge about the Constitution is prevalent. Somebody will have some view of the First Amendment or free speech, and I think in India the basic knowledge is far less. So the aim was to make it more central to public discourse, and I think that's certainly possible. 
Q.
One striking aspect of the book is its sophisticated yet accessible prose. Was that easy to do? What was the writing process like?
A.
I was always trying to prevent two scenarios: one is that it'll just collapse into a pamphlet, a book for dummies. The second is that it will be inaccessible to people who aren't lawyers. So the aim was, at each stage, to see whether or not the point that I'm trying to make addresses a certain moment or scenario in Indian politics for people to grasp. Also, if somebody doesn't know anything about Indian politics or about Indian law, he probably won't get the book at all, and I think that's also fine. So the aim was to park it in the middle of these two.
Q.
As a doctoral student, I assume you're used to writing a lot of academic prose. Did that style ever creep into the writing process of this book?
A.
I'm sure it did, and I kept going back at it to see if there are any other matters that are technical and showed drafts to friends. A huge challenge was also to synthesize all of this into a proper story because the book is shorter than the Constitution. You're talking about cases that have developed over 60 years, which is a huge amount. The standard treatise of a constitution is about three or four volumes; the largest one is 10 volumes. Each of these is like a 1,000 pages. So that's another challenge - to pick and choose what stories might be more relevant than others.
Q.
Your book is peppered with examples of such prominent cases as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and the J.M.M. [Jharkhand Mukti Morcha] bribery case of 1993. Did you cite these to make the book relatable to your audience or was their presence naturally born out of the aspects you were discussing in the book?
A.
I think the most important factor in determining what examples to choose and what cases to emphasize is actually bench strength. The Indian Supreme Court sits across different courtrooms and the importance of a decision depends on the strength of the bench. So the most important thing was to respect the varying degrees of bench strength. So if I'm taking a case on parliamentary privileges -- the 1993 case -- my pool is typically limited to cases of five benches [where five judges of the Supreme Court decide the matter] or more, which are constitutional benches. Within it, I see whether one of them is raising particularly interesting issues, and then it's a judgment call to take a newer case or an older case.
I used the Armed Forces Special Powers Act in a very specific context of how legislative power is interpreted, and it struck me as a case that might resonate with people, which is why I used it even though it wasn't a five-bench case.
Q.
You also write about how the asymmetrical nature of our Constitution poses the risk of an identity crisis. Is there a way to avoid such a scenario?
A.
What is crucial to any asymmetry is that it must have an internal logic of its own, and I think that was present in the Constitution's founding moments. So if we decided that Dalits were to asymmetrically treated, there was a certain logic to that. It was ground in coherent argument about discrimination and unequal starting positions.
My real fear is that normative arbitrariness is creeping into constitutional amendments, and there's no logic to the asymmetry anymore. I think the most glaring and recent example of that is the current debate of promotions and quotas. The argument was that people have unequal starting positions in society and so, at the entry level, you bring them to a level playing field. Now, I disagree with how the government identifies backwardness. However rich you get, you'll still be of the same caste. I think you should use economic criterion.
On the equality doctrine, there was a clear argument for asymmetry. Now, the Constitution is amended to provide quotas and promotions on consequential seniority, which basically means you get your promotion and you then use it to say you're senior and you claim further promotions on that basis. It's like an indefinite double promotion. The court struck this down saying, look, you do what the hell you want with backwardness, we'll generously endorse your usage of caste, but it should fit into a more coherent structure. Our Constitution was routinely amended for that, and it's not clear to me now what division of equality rests on.
Q.
You seem to view the Constitution as more than just a political text. It seems you've sought to interpret it as a document that affects a much larger society than just those who are part of its political system.
A.
I think it does impact all of us. The Constitution isn't simply about what the prime minister can do or the president can't do. It's fundamentally what gives us and what sustains our membership in this community. So part of my hope has been that each of us need to engage with it far more rigorously because it affects all of our daily lives in profound ways. We see that in some ways -- like in politics you'll see a [Arvind] Kejriwal saying, How can you not let me protest?
But there's little emphasis on really what the text says. A lot of it is going at a level of generality that's unhelpful. I certainly believe that it's relevant to people more than just political actors. I think it's relevant to everybody who's in this political community.
Q.
So why do you think Indians have treated the Constitution only in terms of generalities?
A.
That's a really tough thing to say. It could be a limited emphasis on legal education. It could be the fact that we haven't tried enough. There could be a range of reasons for it, but I think that that ought to change. It's very important to realize that this is about all of us. In some sense, this is the fundamental document that gives us our identity. We are who it says we are.

HEADLINE: Health Systems and Health Costs

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Worthwhile Canadian comparison. 

 BODY:
Related to today's column: Suppose that you were really, really concerned about the long-run federal budget, and understood correctly that rising health care costs are the biggest source of rising spending. What you might do in that case is look around the world to see what kinds of health care system appear to be best at containing costs. And you wouldn't have to look far, because there's a pretty dramatic contrast just north of the border:
Data here.
So, Canada has a single-payer insurance system -- actually called Medicare. Four decades ago, Canada spent about the same share of GDP on health care as we did. Since then, however, Canadian spending has risen far more slowly than spending in the US, which relies much more on private insurance. Meanwhile, despite the scare stories opponents of reform like to tell, Canadian health care appears on average to be as good as or better than US care; polls indicate that Canadians are more satisfied with their health care than Americans.
So, given this kind of evidence, the GOP insists that the way to control health costs is ... to dismantle the single-payer part of our own system and turn the whole thing over to private insurers.

HEADLINE: The Inevitable Slow Path to New York Shale Gas

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A foe of fracking splits with allies over the urgency factor. 

 BODY:
Chip Northrup, a former oil and gas investor from Texas who now splits his time between Dallas and upstate New York, is an articulate and energetic opponent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for the natural gas locked in deep shale layers in the state. Read his output here to get his views. But he splits with many other fracking foes in the region on a critical point - urgency.
Josh Fox, the anti-fracking filmmaker, describes the "urgent crisis of drilling and fracking in New York State." A frequent talking point of other natural gas foes is the prospect of gas companies poised to deploy a forest of rigs to drill 50,000 wells.
Drilling proponents play the same time card, this week making an "urgent call to action" to press New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to swiftly release the state's package of new rules for such drilling methods.
Northrup has for many months noted that a mix of low gas prices (probably for many years to come), the costs of extracting gas in New York and inevitable litigation means that whenever the Cuomo administration finally releases new fracking rules, it will take a very long time for drilling to gain any momentum in the state. This two recent Northrup posts explain this reality:
"No NYS shale gas wells in 2012, 2013, or ?" (Aug. 22)
"Is Fracking DOA in NYS?" (Aug. 19)
Please click and read. When the most recent of these posts was published, I engaged in a short Google+ exchange with Northrup. I said that the inevitability of a slow rollout, with gaps in the rules fleshed out through the litigation that has become a normal part of how America resolves environmental disputes, justifies Cuomo's signaled decision to proceed. I wrote:
Those warning of rush to drill 50,000 wells and predatory practices will have a lot of time to focus on the few wells and deals that move ahead. I stand by what I wrote here.
Northrup responded:
Well, we look at it from slightly different angles, but the camel is the same. Slow, based on economics, and refined by the courts, not science . focused on some Potemkin Wells in Vichy, N.Y. [.]
I invited Northrup to contribute a "Your Dot" piece summarizing his views and he kindly did so via YouTube: 
Among other points, he notes as evidence against any New York gas rush that many energy companies with drilling applications in the works in New York are "trying to unload their positions in Houston, cheap." (Relevant background is in his post here.)
One big question in New York, going forward, is whether the existing energy and environmental departments of government have the capacity or interest to oversee a big expansion of gas drilling, using hydraulic fracturing or any other means. It's worth reading Northrup on this issue, as well. In a recent e-mail, reacting to renewed criticisms of Bradley J. Field, who heads the Department of Environmental Conservation's Division of Mineral Resources, Northrup said this:
When it comes to pesticides, the DEC is an effective environmental agency. When it comes to oil and gas, it is a minerals management agency -- not an environmental agency. New York is one of the few states without an autonomous environmental agency for oil and gas.
Complaints about the head of the minerals management department will not alter that fact. The DEC could fire Brad Field, and nothing would change. ]
I'd written about the need for a shakeup of the minerals division, but he's convinced me that the issues go beyond personnel.
Luckily, as Northrup has made clear, there's plenty of time to push on reform here, as well.
Sept. 1, 11:30 a.m. | Addendum |
The Green blog reports that environmental groups and others have met with state officials to discuss fresh assessments of potential health impacts from horizontal drilling and fracking.

HEADLINE: A Critique of Fed Policy

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A paper by a Columbia economics professor says that to foster growth now, the Fed must promise to tolerate higher inflation later. 

 BODY:
Many economists regard asset purchases as the most powerful tool the Federal Reserve could use to stimulate the economy. But Michael Woodford, an economics professor at Columbia University, argued Friday that a second option would actually be much more effective - both because it would have significant economic benefits, and because the benefits of asset purchases are significantly overstated.
The option favored by Professor Woodford is a modified version of the Fed's statement that it intends to keep interest rates near zero until late 2014. In a paper presented at the annual monetary policy conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., he said that the Fed should instead declare its intention to hold down interest rates until the economy meets certain benchmarks, like a specified increase in economic output. In other words, to increase growth now, the Fed must promise to tolerate higher inflation later.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has repeatedly resisted similar ideas, but in a separate speech at the conference earlier on Friday, he appeared to suggest a greater receptivity.
The core of Professor Woodford's argument is that changes in Fed policy can happen for two reasons: either its economic outlook changes, or the Fed decides to change the way that it responds to a given economic outlook - in other words, a change in strategy, or in circumstances. 
The Fed has described its forecasts as reflecting a change in circumstances, not strategy. It has said that it is simply describing the way that it is most likely to act if the economy slogs along at the pace it presently predicts. 
Professor Woodford writes that this is at best ineffective and potentially even damaging. It can be described as an effort to push down interest rates by convincing investors that the economy will remain weaker for longer than they had previously believed. But investors may not regard the Fed as having better information about the economic future. And if they do take it seriously, the implications are negative: The situation is worse than they thought, while the planned response is unchanged.
"Forward guidance of this kind would have a perverse effect, and be worse that not commenting on the outlook for future interest rates at all," he said.
What can work, he writes, is promising to behave differently. In the current situation, where the Fed would push rates below zero if it could, he argues that the proper response is to promise that it will refrain from raising interest rates above zero as quickly as circumstances would otherwise warrant.
"One wants people to understand," Professor Woodford writes, "that the central bank's policy will be history-dependent in a particular way - it will behave differently than it usually would, under the conditions prevailing later, simply because of the binding constraint in the past."
Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has embraced a version of this approach, arguing that the Fed should maintain interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate falls below 7 percent or the rate of inflation rises above 3 percent. Professor Woodford says this would be an "important improvement," but he prefers a different approach, tying Fed policy instead to a minimum rate of growth in the nominal gross domestic product (N.G.D.P.), meaning economic growth plus inflation.
Christina D. Romer, former chairwoman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, has explained the virtues of N.G.D.P. targeting.
Mr. Bernanke has generally resisted proposals for the Fed to shift its policy framework - and he has specifically branded as "reckless" ideas that would raise the Fed's inflation target, like N.G.D.P. targeting.
But he has also said that in periods of high unemployment the Fed sometimes should move more slowly to restrain rising inflation, and in his speech Friday he appeared to underscore that the Fed, at least in part, is trying to tell markets it plans to move more slowly.
He began with his usual description of the Fed's policy forecast as consistent with its standard decision-making framework. But he added that "a number of considerations also argue for planning to keep rates low for a longer time than implied by policy rules developed during more normal periods."
Mr. Bernanke then made the further claim that the Fed was already sending this signal to markets, and that it was being received.
He noted in particular that a regular survey of economic forecasters has documented a steady drop in their estimate of how low unemployment must fall before the Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, begins to withdraw its stimulus.
The evidence, he said, "appears to reflect a growing appreciation of how forceful the F.O.M.C. intends to be in supporting a sustainable recovery."

HEADLINE: Mitt's Mushy Moment

BYLINE: FRANK BRUNI


HIGHLIGHT: He got religion. He teared up. But the election won't hinge on Mitt Romney's humanity. 

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla.
Having coached a "Million Dollar Baby," Clint Eastwood helped to set the stage last night for a Multi-Million Dollar Daddy, and had he done a coherent or even audible job of it, it would have been a risky gambit. How was Mitt Romney of all politicians supposed to outshine a legend?
And how was he supposed to turn the most calculated moment of his presidential campaign into an assurance that he's less calculated-more genuine, approachable and empathetic-than many voters believe? It wasn't a speech he strode onto the stage here to deliver. It was a miracle.
And it was, in the end, almost beside the point. He won't win this election on the strength of his evanescent humanity or the wattage of his fugitive charisma or any of that lovely, squishy stuff. He'll win this election-if he does-on the numbers: the percentage of Americans who are unemployed; the percentage of Americans who think the country is on the wrong track; the percentage of Americans who can't afford the things they could four years ago, when they entrusted their welfare to Barack Obama. 
"You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as President when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him," Romney said in one of his speech's most targeted and telling lines. He wants voters to measure how they were doing in November 2008 and how they're doing now. And to make their decision based on that.
Because a convention is predominantly emotion and atmospherics, those of us who describe and analyze it tend to focus on the frippery. So do the candidate's handlers. If they can gain significant ground with spiffy one-liners, gauzy anecdotes, snazzy stagecraft and some aggressive tugging at heartstrings, they certainly want to. And they'll certainly try. They'll tug for all they're worth.
They did last night. In came Marco Rubio, speaking of his immigrant parents' struggles to give him a better life.
Up went a video in which Romney reflected on his marriage to Ann and his family life. "I can't explain love," he said. "I don't know why it happens. I don't know why it endures."
Romney's Mormonism emerged from the shadows, with testimonials from fellow churchgoers, including a woman who remembered his concern for her sick daughter.
She also remembered a day when Romney dropped by to say hello, spotted clothes that had been hung to dry, and spontaneously began to fold them. "By the time Mitt left," she said, "my laundry was done."
Romney mentioned his religion, saying that in Michigan, where he grew up, his Mormonism "might have seemed unusual or out of place." He separately mentioned the way his father gave his mother a rose every day. His eyes repeatedly welled with tears. On the stage last night, a candidate who needed to be "humanized" was wet with humanity.
But I'm not sure how much ground Romney, soggy or not, stood to gain on that front. He's probably never going to match Obama's likeability. He's definitely never going to match the historic arc and emotional resonance of Obama's political career, one that validated the American dream in a special way and suggested crucial progress in racial reconciliation. And he's unlikely to persuade Americans that he's better connected to their everyday problems, not with his offshore accounts and off-kilter way of talking about his wealth.
"Humanization" isn't Romney's path to victory. A few more disappointing jobs reports are.
In an ABC News/Washington Post poll taken over three days just before the convention began, 61 percent of registered voters said that Obama was the friendlier and more likeable candidate; only 27 percent said Romney was. That's a staggering spread.
And yet 47 percent said that they supported Romney, while 46 percent said they favored Obama. What explains that? Well, only 29 percent of registered voters said that the country was headed in the right direction, while 69 percent said it was on the wrong track.
That puts Obama in a worse position than George W. Bush in August 2004, when one survey showed a right direction/wrong track split of 36 to 50.
And it will matter more than Clint Eastwood talking to an empty chair (what was about?) or Romney talking about roses or a fellow churchgoer talking about his laundry prowess or Ann Romney, in her speech on Tuesday night, trying to tenderize him, as if he were London broil.
From the beginning of Romney's campaign, his advisers conceded that if the 2012 election turned into a popularity contest, he'd lose. But in a referendum on Americans' economic welfare, he had a solid shot at victory.
That remains the case. And the smartest and most powerful parts of Romney's speech weren't those torn from a family scrapbook or ripe for a Hallmark card.
They were the ones that took stock of the promises Obama made, the hope Americans felt, the economic reality four years ago, the economic reality now. Romney's bottom-line pitch is this: if you're better off today, then Obama may well be your man. If you're not, then stop worrying about who feels your pain and give someone new a chance to relieve it.

HEADLINE: Humanize This!

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The great mystery of who Mitt Romney is remains, even after his acceptance speech. 

 BODY:
He was going to fill in the blanks, a nowhere man no more. He was going to show his human side, to offer us a glimpse of the guy who said he "lives for laughter." Not loveable, or even very likeable, but at least a fleshed out leader with a plan.
The empty chair that a befuddled Clint Eastwood spoke to had to compete with the famous empty suit of Mitt Romney. In the speech that was supposed to seal the deal with a divided public, the man who sheltered his money in foreign lands went on about his "belief in America"; it sounded like the chords of a flat song. The substance of his speech was the rhetorical equivalent of the elevator music the nominee loves. This was President Platitude, the aspirant.
Romney is not auditioning for orator in chief, so it doesn't really matter if the speech was more Pat Boone than Winston Churchill. It was absurd, after all, to think that a strangely unknowable man who has been campaigning for president for half a decade would somehow reveal himself in a fresh launch of focus-tested words.
In these ragged times, where progress moves along on three wheels and a flat tire, most Americans do not need to fall in love with a leader. Yet trying to raise the likeability meter seemed to be the sole intent of the buildup to the Romney kicker.
From Ann Romney, we heard a tease about a love story. But the days of tuna pasta on an ironing board dining table did not pass the smell test, since it was already known that the honeymooners lived off family stock money.
From Paul Ryan, we got a blue-eyed son of the heartland, likeable and plainspoken. Many convention viewers, to cite the old country-western song, went to bed at 2 with a 10 and woke up at 10 with a 2 when they found out that Ryan's flat-voweled cadence was at odds with the many distortions and falsehoods he delivered from the podium. As for anecdotes about Mitt, the new BFF brought nothing to the authenticity potluck.
So it was up to the nominee to fill in the blanks. Guess what? He loved his parents. He loves his wife and kids, and one of them speaks Spanish. He loves women. He loves his church, and was there when fellow Mormons needed him. "We prayed together, our kids played together and we always stood ready to help each other out in different ways," he said. "And that's how it is in America."
Great. Give the man a hand and a plaque for his wall and send him on his way.
At the very least, we wanted a story - a grand narrative about the leader and about a nation stuck in a Groundhog Day economy. 
But in the same way that this convention failed to fill the shell of Romney the man, the big speech came with no telling specifics on how he would govern. Romney has provided no detailed blueprint because what is known of the limited blueprint is unpopular. Cut taxes on the rich. Prolong old wars, and even intervene in new ones, without even mentioning the service members now risking their lives in the longest of these forgotten conflicts. Put gay soldiers back in the closet, or kick them out. Ignore climate change. (The delegates laughed at the idea.) Cut or kill government aid to students, the poor, energy entrepreneurs and the arts.
"President Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet," said Romney. "My promise is to help you and your family."
How? A few specifics on the plan to create those 12 million new jobs he's promising would have helped. Corporations are sitting on piles of cash; interest rates are rock bottom; and taxes on the wealthy have not been this low since Chatsworth Osborne, Jr., was palling around with Dobie Gillis.
And his prescription is for more of the same: tax cuts, wealth concentration, corporations as people with the best rights money can buy.
Romney was lucky that he did not have to be heard above a hurricane. How would it sound to bash government while thousands of Americans looked for their salvation to a newly-built, 133-mile ring of levees, flood walls, gates and pumps paid for by taxpayers?
"I am who I am," Romney said in the runup to Thursday night's speech, a way to lower expectations that weren't that high to begin with.
Yes, we knew. Sort of. The man to bring universal health care to his state did not mention that stupendous feat; it was airbrushed out, Soviet style, from the film that introduced Romney. A man whose father walked out on the Barry Goldwater convention of 1964 because it was too extreme let the heirs to those toxic politics write a platform that would move the country backward by two generations.
At the end of the night, the great mystery remained: not just who is Mitt Romney, but how does he cut taxes, raise or maintain defense spending, save Medicare and do it all without adding to a burden of debt that may outlive Romney himself. He gave no answer, because the real substance of his campaign is a construct built on a fantasy. Now he has to sell it.

Barclays Taps an Insider to Repair Its Reputation | Barclays, which has been tarnished by scandal, appointed a new chief executive on Thursday, as the British bank looks to restore its reputation and overhaul its culture.
By selecting Antony Jenkins, Barclays seemed to steal a line from the comedy series "Monty Python": "And now for something completely different."
Mr. Jenkins, 51, an Oxford-educated Briton with a soft-spoken demeanor, started his career 30 years ago as a cashier at a local Barclays branch. Over the last three years, he has overseen the sleepy consumer retail and banking business at Barclays.
In short, he has little in common with his predecessor, Robert E. Diamond. Mr. Diamond, an American-born investment banker, brought a hard-charging ethos to the bank, transforming it into a top player on Wall Street. But the culture of risk-taking also proved problematic.

Romney Campaign Puts a Focus on Bain | Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital continues to be a focus - some might say focus - of both his supporters and detractors.
Just hours before Mr. Romney's speech Thursday night at the Republican National Convention, his campaign started a Web site - business.mittromney.com - devoted almost entirely on his years at the investment firm Bain Capital. "Governor Romney's work at Bain Capital was about fixing companies that were broken and giving new companies a shot at success," reads the Web site's home page. 
The site features nine one- to two-minute videos, each highlighting a successful Bain deal. Two videos focus on the office-supplies retailer Staples, one of Mr. Romney's most successful investments during his tenure at Bain. Both show Mr. Romney roaming the aisles at a Staples store wearing that a blue dress shirt with a contrasting white collar, a de rigueur uniform of 1980s Wall Street.

HEADLINE: One More Rally Before Ryan and Romney Leave Florida

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: With his-and-his jets in the background now wrapped with campaign slogans and logos, Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan waved goodbye to Florida on Friday morning, 

 BODY:
LAKELAND, Fla. -- With his-and-his jets in the background now wrapped with campaign slogans and logos, Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan waved goodbye to Florida on Friday morning, repeating favorite lines from their convention speeches while seeking to mobilize the 2,000 supporters who turned out to help carry this largest, most crucial of battleground states. 
"The convention was a wonderful and magnificent opportunity for us to share our message,'' Mr. Romney said. "Now we're going to need you to get out there and get your friends to vote.''
He added, "You've proved it before, Florida can be a very close election.''
Originally planning to campaign here and in Virginia with Mr. Ryan on Friday, Mr. Romney announced that he would detour to Louisiana to inspect storm damage.
"Last night you got to know me a little more,'' he said, standing atop a stage and speaking to the enthusiastic crowd in a hangar. "I was embarrassed from time to time with the nice things said.''
Speaking first, Mr. Ryan seemed to slip into the traditional vice-presidential role of the ticket's more barbed aggressor, aiming attacks at President Obama with more edge than the smiles he flashed at the convention. 
He repeated one of his most effective zingers, that college graduates in their 20s shouldn't have to return home jobless to their childhood bedrooms and look up at fading Obama posters. 
"President Obama made a whole bunch of promises when he ran for president,'' he said. "Now we see a laundry list of broken promises.''
"The record of contrast couldn't be more stark,'' he said, comparing Mr. Romney's four years as Massachusetts governor with Mr. Obama's "failed leadership.'' He mentioned the decline in the state unemployment rate under Mr. Romney, without including that the state ranked 47th in job creation over Mr. Romney's four years in office. He assailed the downgrade of the United States credit rating under Mr. Obama "for the first time in our history,'' but did not mention that the downgrade was partly because of Congressional gridlock over raising the debt ceiling driven by House Republicans' demands for spending cuts. 
The visit to Lakeland, midway between Tampa and Orlando, was no coincidence. It is hotly contested ground in the presidential race because of an explosively growing population of retirees, working-class residents and Hispanics. The housing crisis devastated the region, with the 2010 census showing that 15 percent of Lakeland households were vacant. 
Adam Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner and a chairman of Mr. Romney's state campaign, called Lakeland "the fulcrum of the I-4 corridor'' in introducing the nominees. "The eyes of the world and the hopes of Americans are on us in central Florida, and we will deliver,'' he said. 
The future of Medicare, of course, will be a major issue, and Democrats are hitting the Romney-Ryan ticket hard for proposals that will "end Medicare as we know it." Polls show a strong majority of seniors oppose the idea of transforming Medicare into an optional voucherlike plan, as Mr. Ryan proposes.
But Paul Senet, the national Republican committeeman from Florida, who sat in the stands at the rally, said he thought Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan were winning the messaging war on Medicare. 
"We've got too much good communication going with seniors,'' he said. "They are enlightened and informed. There's respect for somebody finally being honest with them and admitting we've got to get this fixed.''

HEADLINE: The Man in the Empty Chair

BYLINE: LAWRENCE DOWNES


HIGHLIGHT: Clint Eastwood's talk with an imaginary Barack Obama was the perfect distillation of the Republican campaign. 

 BODY:
Who thinks Clint Eastwood did a fine job?
I do.
Go ahead and snicker about how last night's eagerly awaited surprise convention speech by a Hollywood legend turned out to be an 11-minute ramble by a rumple-haired guy, 82 years old, talking without notes to an imaginary Barack Obama in an empty chair.
An imaginary Barack who tells Mr. Eastwood several times to shut up, then tells him and Mitt Romney to do an unspeakable thing to themselves.
Yes, it was very unexpected. But memorable! And the perfect distillation of the Republican campaign.
Mitt Romney doesn't use a chair. But he, too, is having a pretend argument with an invented friend, Imaginary Barack. Imaginary Barack who apologizes for America. Who hates business and rich people. Who robs Medicare, closes auto factories, kowtows to the Chinese. Who is the sole reason for the soaring national debt, high unemployment, the housing bust, etc., etc.
To Republicans, the president has been a mystery creature for a while. Think back to 2008: Remember the right-wing, talk-radio bafflement about Mr. Obama's rise. Who is this guy, they asked? Why don't we know anything about him? When the cipher beat John McCain, disbelief turned to fury. 
The last four years have been an extended exercise in Republican denialism: This cannot be. This isn't happening. If you're really the president, show us your papers.
Imaginary Barack was invented in Hawaii, sneaked into the Oval Office, and has no legitimate claim on the presidency. As for the real tall black guy posing in Washington, go ahead and treat him any way you want. You can jab your finger in his face, shout him down, call him a Muslim, a Kenyan, an illegal alien, you can invent all kinds of lies about him and then you can tell him - get out of that chair.
In reality, the president is a more-or-less mainstream, smarter-than-average pol, left-of-center on some things, to the right on others, like guns, disturbingly hawkish on ordering the killing of American citizens suspected of terrorism, on national security, executive secrecy and immigration. He is, too, an inveterate compromiser who used to bend over backward to make deals -- sometimes in advance! - with Republicans.
But that guy is not as scary as Imaginary Barack.

HEADLINE: Presidential Policy vs. Fed Policy on Jobs

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Who actually has the most power to create jobs today - the president, or the Fed chairman? The answer to that question tells us whether we now live in the age of democracy, or the age of the central bank. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney said Thursday night that, if elected president, he would create millions of jobs. On Friday morning, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that the Fed's policies may have helped create millions of jobs since the financial crisis.
So who actually has the most power to create jobs today - the president, or the Fed chairman? The answer to that question tells us whether we now live in the age of democracy, or the age of the central bank.
In an important speech at Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday, Mr. Bernanke explained why he thought the Fed's unorthodox policies had worked.
 Usually after an economic shock, the Fed just cuts its key interest rates to revive the economy. But after 2008, it did far more. To help credit flow in the economy, it has also purchased $2.75 trillion of bonds, in effect printing money to do most of that buying. 
The jobs impact from these may have been substantial, Mr. Bernanke said. The first two rounds of bond buying may have increased private sector employment by two million jobs, according to a study he cited. 
Sounds impressive. But it's nothing next to the 12 million jobs Mr. Romney said that he could create with a plan that includes skills training, school choice, trade agreements and lower taxes for business. "What America needs is jobs," he said. "Lots of jobs."
Mr. Bernanke, in contrast, didn't sound at all confident about the near-term ability of politicians to generate economic growth, and as a result, jobs. The big disagreements in Congress over the budget constitute a daunting economic headwind, he said. 
But Mr. Bernanke doesn't have to wait for democratic machinations to play themselves out. He said Friday that the Fed was ready to do more to support the economy and sustain job growth. 
The important point is that he doesn't have to contend with matters like legislation and Congressional votes. Not only can he act more or less at will, he also has the freedom to act with unbelievable force.
It's something he did in the depths of the financial crisis. Almost single-handedly, Mr. Bernanke was able to get an additional $1 trillion pumped into the economy, something a politician can only dream of. This is how David Wessel describes it in his book, "In Fed We Trust":
The Fed, it was increasingly clear, could and would act when the political system was frozen. Even in the face of strong political resistance to more taxpayer money to rebuild the banking system, Bernanke demonstrated that the Fed was neither paralyzed nor out of ammunition: he pressed the F.O.M.C., the committee of Fed governors and regional Fed bank presidents, to increase the cap on Fed purchases of mortgage-backed securities from $500 billion to $1.25 trillion and, for the first time in the Great Panic, to okay the purchase of $300 billion of longer-term Treasury debt securities. 
In other words, if the study he cited Friday is correct, Mr. Bernanke himself was deeply instrumental in creating over a million jobs. 
Something similar is now going on in Europe. The European Central Bank, under its president, Mario Draghi, has recently taken a more aggressive stance in its efforts to bring down the borrowing costs of nations like Spain and Italy. It has had a lot of success, perhaps more success than politicians' policies to do the same. 
Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Draghi are no doubt uncomfortable about the power they now have in relation to politicians. And they probably cannot wait for the day when they can go back to tinkering with monetary policy at the margins. The danger, however, is that the economy becomes dependent on the huge central bank stimulus. The longer it remains, the more the power of the Fed increases, perhaps at the expense of democratically elected politicians.
For 100 years, the main cohesive force in most Western countries was the government people voted for. That cohesive force now has a rival -- the central bank.

HEADLINE: Firestone Shows 'Drive' in New Ad Campaign

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Firestone plans to begin running a campaign on Sunday that urges car owners to "Drive a Firestone." 

 BODY:
Decades ago, cars made by De Soto with model names like Fireflite, Firedome and Firesweep roamed American highways. That may have been as close as anyone could have come to driving a Firestone - until now.
Firestone plans to begin running a campaign that takes a bit of poetic license by urging car owners to "Drive a Firestone." The campaign posits that although Firestone builds no cars, it is nonetheless "a car company" because of the tires it sells and the automotive repair and maintenance services it offers at Firestone Complete Auto Care shops around the country.
The campaign will, according to executives, receive a significant increase in budget from previous Firestone campaigns.
The new campaign shines a bright spotlight on a longtime Firestone brand symbol, which is red and white and depicts the letter F inside a shield. That is because the symbol looks like it would not be out of place on the hood of a car.
The campaign is to get under way on Sunday with a commercial on the NBC Sports Network that will be narrated by the country singer Trace Adkins. Plans call for radio, print and digital ads to follow.
The commercial features a fleet of cars and trucks that are older but look well taken care of - in other words, the types of older vehicles that may need new tires or repairs.
"We help trucks do more truckin'," Mr. Adkins intones. "We give muscle cars more muscle."
"No, we don't build cars," he says. "Make no mistake, we are a car company." The spot ends with Mr. Adkins saying, "Whatever you are, drive a Firestone."

The goal of the campaign is "to re-energize the Firestone brand," said Philip Dobbs, chief marketing officer for the United States and Canadian consumer tire business at Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations, part of the Bridgestone Corporation.
"The focus for us had been on Bridgestone," Mr. Dobbs said, and what Firestone advertising there was had concentrated on Firestone tires and "not the service aspects."
But executives began thinking about "combining tires and service" in one campaign rather than considering them "separate business units," he added.
"That was the genesis of the assignment" to create the campaign, Mr. Dobbs said, "to take advantage of the Firestone tire brand, our company-owned service network" and the auto care centers owned by individuals.
The campaign is being created by Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the Leo Burnett unit of the Publicis Groupe. The agency was hired in April to handle the Firestone creative assignment, which had previously been handled by the Richards Group in Dallas. (Richards continues to create campaigns for the Bridgestone brand.)
The target for the campaign is what Charley Wickman, executive vice president and executive creative director at Leo Burnett USA, calls "high-stakes drivers."
"They're the kind of drivers who don't wait for the red light to come on on the dashboard to get their cars serviced," Mr. Wickman said. "They really care about their cars."
Mr. Dobbs said he liked pursuing that audience because, according to research among drivers, there was a belief that "there's no one out there celebrating the everyday car, the average car."
That is particularly important now because the economy means more drivers are keeping their cars longer, making them potential customers for Firestone tires or services.
Between the auto services and the tires, Firestone has "kept millions of cars on the road," Mr. Wickman said. That led to the idea of presenting Firestone as "a car company," he added, because "who says you have to make cars to be a car company?"
"When we hit that breakthrough, it all fell into place," Mr. Wickman said, and playing up the shield in the ads helps sell the concept.
"Why shouldn't a great American brand like Firestone have something as powerful as a newer American brand like Target?" he asked. (Both logos are red and white.)
Mr. Dobbs said he did not believe the campaign would confuse consumers into mixing up Firestone and an actual carmaker.
"No, it'll make them pause and think," he said.
John Neilson, vice president for brand marketing at Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations, said the budget for Firestone advertising would be increased by 70 percent. He and Mr. Dobbs declined to give dollar amounts.
According to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP, Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations spent $35.6 million last year to advertise Firestone in major media, compared with $44.6 million in 2010, $27 million in 2009 and $34.6 million in 2008.

HEADLINE: Federal Judge in Ohio Restores Early Voting

BYLINE: RAY RIVERA


HIGHLIGHT: A federal judge in Ohio on Friday ordered the state to give all voters the right to cast their ballots in person on the final three days before Election Day. 

 BODY:
A federal judge in Ohio on Friday ordered the state to give all voters the right to cast their ballots in person on the final three days before Election Day.
The ruling was a victory for state Democrats andPresident Obama's campaign in a swing state and was the latest salvo in the contentious battle over the state's early voting laws before the Nov. 6 election.
The state Democratic Party and the Obama campaign had sued the state over the constitutionality of a law that ended early in-person voting on the Friday evening before the election to all but voters serving in the military or living overseas.
The judge, Peter C. Economus of Federal District Court in Columbus, issued a preliminary injunction against the law, saying that in making an exception for some, the law unconstitutionally valued some voters over others.
Judge Economus also cited statistical studies presented by Democrats showing that low-income and minority voters would be disproportionately affected by the elimination of the voting days.
In his ruling, the judge roundly rejected the state's arguments that restoring the final three days would make it difficult for county election boards to prepare for Election Day and would make it difficult for military voters to cast their ballots early.
The Ohio attorney general,Mike DeWine, above, announced that he would appeal the decision.
"With all due respect to the judge, we disagree with his ruling today," Mr. DeWine said. "We have always allowed distinction for military voters, and to say this violates equal protection is wrong."
Ohio opened early balloting to all voters - one of 32 states to do so - after the 2004 election debacle that left thousands of state residents stranded in long lines unable to cast their ballots before the polls closed.
Democrats estimated in their lawsuit that 93,000 people voted early in the final three days of the 2008 election. At least one study Democrats presented in their lawsuit showed that early voters tended to favor Democrats.
The Republican-controlled legislature eliminated the final three days in a flurry of legislation in the last year. Then last month, the secretary of state, a Republican, eliminated all weekend voting during the five-week early voting period, which begins Oct. 2.
After Friday's decision, the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio called on the state to restore all weekends during the early voting period.

HEADLINE: Facebook Plays It Safe

BYLINE: ALLISON ARIEFF


HIGHLIGHT: Frank Gehry is an unsurprising choice to design Facebook's new headquarters - and that's the problem. 

 BODY:
I read with some amusement the news that Facebook had brought on the architect Frank Gehry to design an expansion to its Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters. Or more specifically, a new warehouse for engineers at its Menlo Park headquarters. Plans for the Silicon Valley site include a 420,000-square-foot, single-story warehouse topped with a garden that will span the entire roof. A tunnel will connect "Facebook East" to the company's existing headquarters in the former space of Sun Microsystems, whose more hierarchical floor plan has been demolished to make way for Facebook's open-plan ethos. (As one British blog so delicately put it, "Facebook moves into Sun Microsystems carcass.") 
As Everett Katigbak, Facebook's environmental design manager, explains, "It will be a large, one-room building that somewhat resembles a warehouse." Katigbak describes a project that will, for all intents and purposes, not only "resemble" a warehouse but be a warehouse, as it's to be a single room housing more than 2,800 engineers who clearly don't subscribe to the research suggesting that open offices "make people less productive and more hostile and anxious." The project's budget was not disclosed but is said to be in the same ballpark as similar Silicon Valley sites - which is to say, it's significant.
Relative to architectural commissions made by other tech companies, tapping Gehry can be seen as avant-garde. Apart from Apple's Steve Jobs, who commissioned a new campus design from Foster & Partners that looks like nothing so much as a giant first generation iPod (others have called it a donut or "retrograde cocoon"), tech titans tend not to be big on architectural expression. With its modest, low-slung buildings and plentiful cafeterias, Google looks like a small liberal arts college; the networking company Cisco Systems, a traditional office park. The choice of Gehry might have been "game-changing" - to use the parlance of the start-up community - two decades ago. Today, it's a safe bet, representing Facebook's true transition from rogue start-up to the establishment (no matter how strenuously they might dispute that designation). 
And doesn't it seem odd to announce the selection of an often over-budget starchitect the same week your company has lost nearly half its market value? What message does that send to investors? But I digress, I'm supposed to be writing about design here 
In fact, I'm a huge fan of a lot of Gehry's work, from his own amazingly experimental house in Santa Monica, Calif., to the endearing Dancing House in Prague to the transformative Guggenheim Bilbao. (The Experience Music Project in Seattle? Santa Monica Place? Not so much.) Choosing him makes sense for a culture-changing company like Facebook, but it might be losing its edge. Why go for such an established icon? Why not choose a small, unknown firm as "lean and nimble" (to borrow some Valley jargon) as so many of the companies responsible for the currently exploding knowledge-worker economy in the region? Or someone established but more surprising? (They do this for interior spaces buy why not the take the same approach to the stuff visible to the outside world?) 
Earlier this week, the Golden State Warriors announced they'd tapped Snøhetta for their proposed new coliseum in San Francisco, less than an hour north of Menlo Park. Who knew a basketball franchise would be more architecturally adventurous than a tech company?
It's not wholly surprising: Early adopters in everything from gadgets to sportswear, tech folks often grow strangely conventional when it comes to the built environment. Start-ups may have begun life in a garage or cafe, but it seems ultimately all roads lead to the office park. When Facebook took over the corporate campus of now-defunct Sun Microsystems, it packed double the number of employees in the same space. Pre-Gehry, its most radical design innovation has been to deliberately "un-design" their office interiors. No one (not even Mark Zuckerberg) gets an office, but every employee gets a highly customizable square footage allotment complete with adjustable desk and chair.
Earlier this year, the architecture critic Paul Goldberger and I spoke at an event on urban design in San Jose, Calif., hosted by SPUR, the urban planning and policy think tank where I work. When asked what might help make San Jose the true "center of Silicon Valley," Goldberger made the unorthodox suggestion that instead of commissioning Foster's corporate campus, Apple should have moved from Cupertino and set up shop in neighboring San Jose, effectively transforming California's third-largest city into an economic and cultural powerhouse. The local crowd buzzed with excitement at this provocative suggestion, but Apple won't go urban anytime soon. 
Nor will Facebook, which could have opted for the same radical move Goldberger put out there for Apple. "We are creating the new urban place to work," said the Facebook real estate chief John Tenanes when the main campus was occupied, but really the company has chosen to approximate the experience of urbanism rather than the reality of it. Much like a city, the Menlo Park campus has services and amenities - a dry cleaner, a gym, a doctor's office, places to eat - and awnings. Like a city, there is density - inside, anyway. Where Sun employees got about 270 square feet of their own, Facebook's get just a very cozy 150. 
But so very unlike a city, the New Urban-ish campus is populated not by folks from different walks of life but solely by Facebook employees. For all the talk in startup circles of "serendipitous interaction," it's not the sort celebrated by Jane Jacobs. There may be a place to get a latte there but there is no Third Place, those accessible anchors of community life like bars, farmer's markets or barber shops that help foster civic engagement and interaction with both regulars and new faces. Yes, it's stating the obvious, but Facebook workers interact with other Facebook workers. There's next to nil outside influence to be found on a corporate campus. Indeed, many tech employees (Facebook's and others) have observed that many of their most meaningful encounters occur not at work but while waiting on city streets for the now-ubiquitous corporate shuttles from San Francisco that take them south to Silicon Valley. 
When I was editor of the modern architecture magazine Dwell, which launched in 2000, around the time of the first dot-com boom, we expected to see an embrace of radical design as more and more newly minted dot-com millionaires began looking for their starter homes. But I was repeatedly surprised to find that most took up residence in the most traditional-looking (and largest) homes imaginable. (Even Steve Jobs lived in a Tudor.) That hasn't changed this time around. For all their faith in the future, those earliest of early adapters remained strangely tied to conventional tropes of success.
In terms of work environments, there's been more experimentation, more playing with the possibilities of space. But the decidedly un-inventive office park paradigm has held on with a vengeance. Many companies are abandoning it - like Twitter, which recently set up shop on several floors of the historic Market Square building in San Francisco. Though Twitter and Facebook are both in the business of social media, Twitter seems to have opted for a headquarters strategy better equipped to avoid the seemingly inevitable groupthink that a warehouse of tightly packed engineers might produce. Katigbak speaks of things like whiteboards and snacks as if they were design innovations, but they aren't. Facebook headquarters are located at One Hacker Way: It's a shame Facebook couldn't have expressed that hacker ethos architecturally.

HEADLINE: Aug. 31: TV Ratings May Be Leading Indicator of Convention Bounce

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The mediocre television ratings for the Republican National Convention are one sign that Mitt Romney's convention bounce could be fairly modest. 

 BODY:
It remains too early to tell exactly what effect the Republican National Convention has had on the polls. But television ratings are one measure that come in almost instantaneously. Ratings for the final two nights of the Republican convention were down quite a bit from 2008, declining by about 30 percent overall. 
The ratings decline should not really be a surprise. Whereas, in 2008, Senator John McCain announced his running mate, Sarah Palin, just a few days before the convention, making her a national sensation, Mitt Romney rolled out his choice of Representative Paul D. Ryan three weeks ago, perhaps limiting the buildup to Tampa, Fla. 
The convention was also shortened by, and had to compete with, Hurricane Isaac. And the security in and around Tampa was airtight, limiting protests and distractions -- but perhaps also the spontaneity and newsworthiness of the event.
More important, this election has simply not generated the same excitement from viewers and voters than 2008 did. It would be quite surprising to me if the Democratic convention did not also experience a significant decline in its television ratings.
Nevertheless, television ratings may be of some value in predicting the size of the bounce a candidate gets from the convention in the polls. 
In the chart below, I've compared the historicalTV ratings for the challenging party's convention against the bounce that its nominee received in the polls. Ratings are measured by the share of American households that were tuned into the convention during prime-time viewing hours.
The conventions that produced double-digit bounces for the challenger -- 1968, then each year from 1976 through 1992 -- were usually associated with TV ratings above 20 percent. By contrast, ratings below 20 percent have been associated with single-digit bounces, and ratings below 15 percent smaller bounces still.
It's hard to tell where the causation lies in this relationship. Do fewer voters switch their voting preferences because fewer of them watched the convention on television? Or do fewer voters feel the need to watch the convention in the first place if more of them have already made up their minds? 
Regardless, the mediocre ratings for the convention are one sign that Mr. Romney's convention bounce could be fairly modest. Our forecast model will treat it as a favorable sign for Mr. Romney if his convention bounce is larger than four percentage points, and an unfavorable sign if it is under that threshold.
The Convention Bounce So Far
As for direct evidence of Mr. Romney's convention bounce from the polls, the data is pretty incomplete so far.
The most optimistic number for Mr. Romney comes from Ipsos, which has been conducting an online tracking poll on behalf of Reuters. In that poll, which includes some interviews from after Mr. Romney's acceptance speech on Thursday night, Mr. Romney now leads President Obama by one percentage point among likely voters -- a five-point swing in the poll from the benchmark survey that Ipsos conducted before the convention, which had Mr. Romney trailing by four points.
The Rasmussen Reports tracking poll now has Mr. Romney ahead by one point, improved from a two-point deficit in the last poll it released before the convention. However, there are two caveats to this poll. First, very few of the interviews in the Rasmussen poll were conducted after Mr. Romney's acceptance speech on Thursday night, which means that he'll have the potential to gain more ground in the coming days. But second, the two-point lead that Rasmussen Reports had given to Mr. Obama before the convention was a bit unusual for them. The poll has had a Republican lean this cycle and has more often than not shown Mr. Romney ahead. So the movement toward Mr. Romney thus far could reflect reversion to the mean rather than any effects of the convention.
Finally, the Gallup national tracking poll shows Mr. Obama one point ahead: a fairly good result for him, since that poll has also had somewhat Republican-leaning results this cycle. But Gallup's polling average is calculated over a seven-day window, which means that most of its interviews still predate the convention.
For the time being, I'm feeling pretty good about my guess that Mr. Romney's bounce will come in somewhere in the neighborhood of four percentage points. It was a smartly scripted and competently executed convention (Clint Eastwood's cameo aside) but also not one that packed a lot of excitement or surprise value. In other words, it felt pretty much par for the course given how conventions are run these days.
If Mr. Romney gets a four-point polling bounce, we'd expect him to lead Mr. Obama by about two percentage points in national polls conducted between Tampa and Charlotte, N.C., since he had trailed Mr. Obama by about that margin before the Republican convention began.
The forecast model has been a bit bullish on Mr. Obama's chances lately. It now gives him a 72 percent chance of winning the Electoral College, his highest figure since Aug. 12. However, that mostly reflects some relatively favorable economic reports from among the economic data series that we track rather than anything having to do with the convention.

HEADLINE: From Physician Glut to Physician Shortage

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Concerns about a doctor shortage &#8212; a questionable premise &#8212; might best be harnessed into seeking new efficiencies in how medicine is practiced, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
In my most recent post, I made light of the argument that the Affordable Care Act would lead to a major shortage of physicians in this country. I was unpersuaded in part because the newly insured are likely to present only a marginal added demand for physician services. More important, I am not sure what we mean by "physician shortage." 
Forecasters looking at the health work force have never reached a consensus on the ideal physician-population ratio for this country. 
Indeed, widespread worries over a looming physician shortage are a relatively new phenomenon. They come at the time when experts are also lamenting an "epidemic of overtreatment" of patients, said to cost America $210 billion a year.

Throughout the 1980s, however, and until the late 1990s, the dominant narrative among experts on the American health work force was that, with the exception of primary care physicians, the United States faced a large overall future physician surplus. There were only a fewdemurrals from that dominant narrative.
The problem is that forecasting the future supply of and demand for any type of health professional is a highly complex and nuanced enterprise with wide margins of error (see, for example, Figures 9-1 and 9-6 in my 1991 paper).
Crucial in such forecasts is the assumption one makes about the average annual physician productivity in future years. That variable depends chiefly on two factors: the number of hours per year that physicians typically devote to patient care, and the degree to which physicians delegate to others tasks for which an M.D. degree is not required - for example, administrative tasks to clerks or business managers and certain medical tasks to physician assistants or nurse practitioners trained to perform tasks now performed by physicians.
How crucial that assumption is can be inferred from a once highly influential paper written in 1994 by Jonathan Weiner, a Johns Hopkins University health services researcher. In that study, Professor Weiner sought to estimate the impact of the then-impending Clinton health reform on the country's future work force situation. 
Professor Weiner noted that, in 1992, well-managed, clinically integrated, staff- or group-model health maintenance organizations that were compensated by prepaid capitation (an annual lump-sum fee per patient) required an average of only about 120 or so physicians per 100,000 enrollees, while the overall ratio of patient-care physician per 100,000 population in the United States was as high as 180 (about 220 in 2011; see Table 2 in this publication). 
It appeared that the H.M.O. had pushed task delegation to nonphysician personnel further than had the rest of the health system. Furthermore, H.M.O.'s freed clinicians substantially from many administrative chores that physicians elsewhere must perform. Such H.M.O.'s, incidentally, would be the ideal form of the accountable care organizations called for in the Affordable Care Act of 2010. 
Assuming, when he made the forecast in 1994, that as a result of the Clinton health reform some 40 to 60 percent of the United States population would be enrolled in such H.M.O.'s by 2000, Professor Weiner projected that the demand for and supply of primary care physicians would be more or less in balance in 2000, but that the supply of specialists would exceed the demand for them by more than 60 percent (a projected surplus of 165,000 physicians).
This prospect - widely accepted at the time - subsequently led the prestigious Council of Graduate Medical Education to recommend in its report of 1996 that "that the number of physicians entering residency be reduced from 140 percent to 110 percent of the number of graduates of allopathic and osteopathic medical schools in the United States in 1993." 
And why were health policy makers and work force specialists so worried at the time about an impending physician surplus? Did not standard economic theory predict that an imminent surplus would drastically drive down physician fees - particularly specialists' fees - and thus make health care more affordable and accessible?
The problem is that this theory has found little empirical support in the data, in part because third-party payment intervenes. Furthermore, there has always been a strong belief, especially among policy makers, that modern medical practice, when coupled with third-party payment, is subject to an analogue of Parkinson's Law. It is named after the British historian Cyril Northcote Parkinson (1909-93), who promulgated the law more or less in jest in 1955, then with regard to the British civil service.
According to Parkinson's Law, "work will expand to fill the time available for its completion." In medicine, its manifestation is feared to be the overtreatment of patients - sometimes harmful - even though individual physicians may sincerely believe that more care implies superior quality of treatment. 
As the late economist Eli Ginzberg, an early pioneer in work force studies, noted as early as 1966: "Physicians are in a position to create their own demand." He added that the effective use of physician manpower "depends in the first instance on a taut supply of physicians." 
Academic economists since that time have tied themselves into analytic knots over whether or not Ginzberg was right, in exercises reminiscent of medieval scholasticism. At the theoretical level, their models are mathematically elegant but lack predictive power. The data available at the empirical level does not allow economists to distinguish between health care actively demanded by patients and health care passively accepted on the doctor's recommendation, nor between services prescribed by doctors in good conscience and those rendered mainly to shore up doctors' incomes. 
As on so many other areas of the real world, the views of economists on this matter cancel one another out.
Policy makers in the real world, however, seem to have no doubt that Parkinson's Law applies to medical practice, as well. Consequently, they prefer paying physicians by annual capitation or bundled payments instead of "inflationary" fee-for-service, and they often seek to impose global budgets on physicians. 
If Eli Ginzberg was right - and often he was - the suspected physician shortage now imputed by critics of the Affordable Care Act may actually drive our health system into more efficient medical practice. Step No. 1 in that direction, of course, would be to lighten the enormous administrative load now heaped by our health insurance system onto physicians devoted to rendering patient care.

HEADLINE: Unraveling the Nuclear Renaissance

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: A proposed twin-reactor plant in Texas and another planned project in Maryland, with a French connection, have become victims of tough economic and regulatory times. 

 BODY:
Power plants are a bit like insect eggs. At the start, there are huge numbers, but few of them make it to adulthood.
The last few days may have seen the demise of two reactor projects that had looked promising a few years ago, when the economy was strong and people worried about the high price of natural gas and the possibility of a price on carbon emissions. But natural gas is at historic lows, carbon charges seem unlikely, and lately neither reactor project has looked likely.
On Wednesday, Exelon Corporation, the nation's largest nuclear operator, threw in the towel on a planned twin-reactor project in Victoria County in Texas.
Texas is short of generating capacity, but it has vast amounts of natural gas and a highly competitive electric market, both of which make it hard to build a reactor.
Exelon had not said exactly when it would build, but it took advantage of a provision in a reformed nuclear licensing system to seek early approval of a 11,500-acre site southeast of the city of Victoria. The licensing system now allows companies to get "early site permits" and "bank" the sites, and later match the preapproved site with a preapproved reactor design, potentially shortening the time between deciding to build a reactor and getting it into operation. Exelon was one of the first to try it out.
The company faced opposition from people who said there was not enough water in the area and that the ground was subject to subsidence that could wreck a cooling pond. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission might well have approved the site over these objections, but the company said the economics were not favorable.
On Thursday, a panel of administrative law judges ruled that Electricite de France could not proceed with a plant in Maryland, Calvert Cliffs 3.
That plant was originally a joint venture between Constellation Energy, which owned the adjacent Calvert Cliffs 1 & 2, and the French. But two years ago that consortium, called Unistar, fell apart when it could not obtain a loan guarantee from the Department of Energy on terms that Constellation found acceptable. (Constellation was later bought by Exelon.)
Under an American law from the cold war era, reactors must be controlled by American entities. One purpose of the law was to keep American secrets in American hands, which may be inappropriate now since Electricite de France has more recent experience building power reactors than American companies do, and was seeking to build one of a French design.
The judges gave Electricite de France 60 days to show evidence that it was bringing in an American partner. After that, if it wanted to proceed it would have to redo some steps in the application process. But, like Texas, the economics in Maryland are similarly awful.
Two projects, each with two reactors, are under way, one in Georgia and one in South Carolina, but no additional groundbreakings seem very likely soon.
