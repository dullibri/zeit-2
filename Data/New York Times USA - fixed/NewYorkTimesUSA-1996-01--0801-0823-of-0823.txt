HEADLINE: As the Shopping Cart Turns

BYLINE: By CAROL LAWSON 

DATELINE: DE WITT, N.Y.

 BODY:
SUPERMARKETS have heard the vox populi "No time to cook! No time to cook!" -- and they are reinventing themselves. The newest stores are determined to snare customers with a trio of irresistible forces: convenience, service and, above all, "meal solutions."
On a recent night, the 6 P.M. crowd was prowling in search of meal solutions -- known outside the supermarket trade as dinner -- through the new Wegmans here, the very model of the modern mega market. 
 The hard part of buying dinner at Wegmans in this Syracuse suburb is deciding which dinner. The choices: freshly prepared foods to eat in the store's Market Cafe restaurant or to take home and reheat; uncooked dishes (teriyaki beef kebabs, chicken cordon bleu) that can be finished at home, and pizzas, pastas and grilled sandwiches cooked to order in the cafe's open kitchen to take out or eat in.
Or how about fish? A shopper can make a selection in Wegmans's vast fish department -- 87 varieties, some flown in daily from Hawaii, Scotland, New Zealand or Ecuador -- and have it cooked to taste (steamed, broiled, baked, grilled or fried) at no additional charge.
At 123,000 square feet, nearly three times the size of the average supermarket, Wegmans is like a mall with an abundance of tempting food and services. Shoppers can drop off dry cleaning, have a make-over at the makeup counter, fill prescriptions, rent videos, develop film, order flowers, buy groceries and eat lunch, dinner or weekend brunch -- a new plateau in one-stop shopping. The store, open 24 hours a day, is so big -- it has 34 checkout lanes -- that it offers shoppers maps and benches for rest stops.
For those who would even think of doing their own cooking, Wegmans wants to make dinner as effortless as possible. The leaflets of free recipes throughout the store could fill a grocery cart. There are also daily food demonstrations (stir-fried mahi-mahi fillets with peppers on this night), with all the ingredients conveniently assembled nearby.
The DeWitt store, which opened in November, is the prototype in the company's 50-store chain, based in Rochester. But Wegmans is not the only cutting-edge supermarket operation promoting prepared foods and what the industry calls "assisted cooking."
"The growth of prepared foods is happening in supermarkets all over the country, in all sorts of neighborhoods," said Tim Hammonds, the president of the Food Marketing Institute in Washington, a supermarket trade association. "For years, we watched fast-food restaurants take dollars away from supermarkets. Now, we see an opportunity to expand sales."
Indeed, Ukrop's, a chain of 23 stores in Virginia, offers more than 100 prepared items daily, including dinner for two in a bag -- an entree, salad and bread, for $8.99. Byerly's, based in Minnesota, has a home economist in each of its 10 stores to answer shoppers' questions and a cooking school in its St. Louis Park, Minn., flagship store. Among the classes: "Vous Etes en Provence."
Mr. Hammonds said he knew of no plans for similar multiple-service supermarkets in New York City, because, he said, real estate is expensive and hard to come by.
In the Wegmans restaurant, Ed Porter was eating a Caesar salad with grilled chicken and watching his 4-month-old daughter asleep in an infant seat on top of the table. His wife, Gretchen, was filling her plate with sesame chicken, egg rolls and vegetable lo mein at the nearby Wok ery, a self-service Chinese food cart.
"Dinner is the enticement to come here," said Mr. Porter, who owns a residential and commercial cleaning business. "We drive 20 miles from our home in Auburn, N.Y., to eat here and shop."
Stacy Ruben, who was eating with her three sons, also takes her children to the store regularly. "The kids go to the video shop while I shop," said Ms. Ruben, a radio station news director. "It is very convenient."
At the same time that modern stores are trying to feed customers, they are also trying to meet their other needs. "With more two-wage-earner families, people don't have time to shop in four or five locations to do daily errands," said Brent Scott, a vice president in Atlanta of the Kroger Company, the country's largest food retailer, with more than 1,300 stores, some of which also offer multiple services. "One-stop shopping is very important."
Those words -- "one-stop shopping" -- are on the map of the new Wegmans. The map is necessary for those unfamiliar with the terrain -- finding a carton of eggs would be a challenge without it. It can take three hours to walk through the store, which is sprinkled with 14 benches.
"When we opened, senior citizens complained that the store was too big," said Patrick Lynch, the manager. "But now they have a routine: they stop and rest at the cappuccino bar."
Walking into Wegmans is not like ordinary, fill-up-the-cart grocery shopping. The automatic front doors open, and you are in the 16,000-square-foot produce department. It is stocked with 800 different items, compared to 500 in a typical produce department. The overall effect is so colorful that it looks as if Martha Stewart had designed it. Among the offerings: 12 varieties of tomatoes, 21 varieties of peppers, 18 varieties of mushrooms, 17 varieties of apples, 25 varieties of potatoes, 15 varieties of onions. Phe store also carries more than 60 organically grown fruits and vegetables.
For customers who have never heard of products like canistels (egg fruit), cherimoyas (custardy South American fruit), hedgehog mushrooms, licorice basil or purple potatoes, there are visual aids -- easy-to-read labels with explanations as well as cooking suggestions.
Elsewhere, the store has a cheese department with 250 varieties, plus caviar; a bakery that produces bread round-the-clock, as well as tiramisu, bagels, cakes and pies; a coffee department with 48 varieties of beans, and a pet center stocked with Mane 'n Tail horse shampoo, argyle dog sweaters and Iguana Diet, in juvenile and adult flavors.
Wegmans also has a pharmacist who offers "patient counseling"; an organic grocery department with recycled, chlorine-free toilet paper; greeting cards, and a video store with 8,000 rentals.
Everything about the store is outsize, even the huge shopping carts that have attachments that can seat two children who are too big for the typical grocery-cart seat. "The carts are so long," said Dr. Karen Lawitts, a Syracuse dentist who has pushed her children, 8 and 4, through Wegmans. "I've hit a couple of people, but not hard."
The entire fresh-food area was designed, said Mr. Lynch, the manager, with "a European market look." The floor is of ceramic tile that looks like red bricks. The ceiling has a black iron grid, with clusters of plastic grapes hanging from it.
Wegmans placed the store in a Syracuse suburb that seemed as if it would have a supportive audience. "The store is in an upscale neighborhood where people have traveled and have a real appreciation for wonderful food," said Jo Natale, Wegmans's consumer services manager. While some of its features are part of other Wegmans stores, this is the only one with a brick oven 16 feet in diameter that can bake 300 loaves at a time.
Shoppers do not have to buy a meal to eat. Everywhere, foods are set out for tasting: breads, cheeses, teas, pastas, juices, fish.
It is tempting even for people who work there day after day. "You always want to try this, try that," Mr. Lynch said. "When I go home, my wife says, 'I made this wonderful dinner,' and I say, 'I can't eat another thing.' "

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
A Revolution More About Power Than Principle

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

A STRUGGLE FOR POWER
The American Revolution
By Theodore Draper
544 pages. Times Books. $35.
 The French and Indian War, as any schoolchild knows, saw the British fighting alongside their American colonists to conquer Canada for the Mother Country. What fewer of us know, as Theodore Draper reminds us in his lengthy and learned new interpretation of the origins of the American Revolution, is that the British-American alliance was a difficult and contentious one. Colonial assemblies, for example, balked at providing money to pay for British troops. New England traders continued to trade briskly with the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, even though those sugar-rich islands belonged to the enemy French. The Massachusetts Legislature refused even to quarter British troops in Boston, arguing that the order to do so, issued by Parliament back in Britain, "did not extend to America."
The continual bickering between the colonists and the representatives of the King and Parliament was, Mr. Draper writes, "simply and solely" over the power to make decisions: "Where was it -- in London or in Boston?" 
 The answer is that in practice, it was in Boston, and that this was true nearly from the beginning of American colonial history. That in turn suggests Mr. Draper's main theme: the American break with England, which became irrevocable with the battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, was the culmination of a nearly ceaseless struggle over just that decision-making power, and whether it would be in the colonies themselves or in England.
The American Revolution, to put it differently, was not so much over libertarian ideas or principles, as many have argued, or over the various British impositions that Americans learn about in elementary school: the Stamp Acts, the Townshend Acts, the Tea Duty or the Intolerable Acts. From the beginning, the relationship between England and America involved a struggle for power, a struggle that, given the size and the rapid growth of the colonies, the British were bound to lose.
"Whatever they did," Mr. Draper writes of the colonies, "they were determined to do it on their own terms. When their interests conflicted with what the British wanted, they held out tenaciously, by passive resistance as well as by outright opposition."
Mr. Draper, who has written a dozen or so notable books on history and current events, does not pr'sent this interpretation as incompatible with other factors, like economic interest or notions of political principle, which, as he shows, also played their role. By putting the contest for power in the forefront, he provides a new and very interesting vision of the revolution. That this vision is drawn from a comprehensive, exhaustive study of the documents is at the heart of the book's considerable merit and of a largely forgivable flaw.
On its merits, "A Struggle for Power" is a work of enormous scholarship, of clarity and great intelligence. Mr. Draper seems to have read everything about the American Revolution, from numerous secondary works to the collections of essays and the letters written by statesmen and ordinary citizens in both America and Britain. It is mainly out of these numerous "speeches, pamphlets and resolutions" that Mr. Draper draws out his themes, tracing the way the possibility of independence (or, from the British point of view, the fear of it) was inherent almost from the first English settlements in the New World.
Among the most fascinating stories that Mr. Draper extracts from the documentary record is the first one he tells, about a battle of pamphlets that broke out in both America and Britain after the French and Indian War. The pamphlets discussed whether the British, as a result of victory over the French, should take possession of Canada or of Guadeloupe, which at the time was richer than Canada because of its sugar. Some in Britain foresaw that if Canada were returned to the French, "the American colonies would be forced to remain British." That was because the Americans would be dependent on British protection against the French. Conversely, by keeping Canada and thus eliminating the French threat, there would be no real obstacle blocking the colonies' impulse toward what was already being called "independency."
Mr. Draper's argument here is that well before the Stamp Acts, and before any Jeffersonian ideas about inalienable rights appeared in the American discourse, the British were worried "about the progress made by the American colonies and where it was going to lead."
Reading the documents, Mr. Draper finds numerous illustrations of the prickly American insistence that the colonies govern their own affairs, an insistence that grew as America's wealth and population grew. It was not easy, for example, as Mr. Draper shows in what are nearly comic passages, to be a British colonial governor dealing with stingy colonial assemblies.
The flaw in Mr. Draper's book is that he overdoes it. The detailed studies of those "speeches, pamphlets and resolutions," which are frequently quoted at length, are, frankly, tiring. The reader, his attention flagging, begins wishing for some spice, some color, some action in what is largely a story of the evolution of ideas. And when, as he does from time to time, Mr. Draper stops to describe some event like the Boston Massacre or Paul Revere's ride, his narrative adds little if anything to the work of others.
Still, the reader who is interested in understanding the founding of the American Republic will forgive Mr. Draper for his stylistic sobriety and his piling up of citations. "A Struggle for Power" may run aground at times, but it also reaches very high. Mr. Draper's descriptions of the way each side saw the growing conflict are models of clarity, and his conclusion that American "independency" followed a logic of power, rather than principle or economic interest, adds a valuable perspective to one of the most important events in the history of the globe.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Stung by plunging tourism, Rio de Janeiro hopes Della Femina will put it back on the travel map.

BYLINE: By Jane L. Levere 

 BODY:
TO revive its flagging tourist industry, Rio de Janeiro is getting ready to package itself as a sophisticated destination for international travelers, particularly Americans. Fittingly, the package bears some sophisticated markings of its own.
Through its convention and visitors bureau, Rio has teamed up with Jerry & Ketchum in New York and Visa International for separate multimillion-dollar advertising and promotion campaigns. What is more, city officials hope to get Brazilian and multinational companies to foot a big part of the advertising bill. 
 The two-pronged effort will begin in the spring with a "Rio Welcomes Visa" promotion, the first large-scale program by the credit card company for a Latin American city.
At about the same time, Jerry & Ketchum, which is a joint venture between Jerry Della Femina and Ketchum Communications, will begin a five-year advertising push. It is the first that Rio is aiming at Americans and the first so-called destination advertising from Brazil since 1986.
Tourism took a tumble in Rio in 1990, caused in part by the global recession, but also because of the country's political and economic turmoil and an increase in crime, particularly in the city's favelas, or slums. In July of that year, the State Department issued the first in a series of travel advisories that discussed crime, warning tourists to avoid the Copacabana district, home to many of the city's hotels and beaches and center of its night life.
For all these reasons, the number of foreign visitors dropped sharply, to 1.1 million in 1991, from a high of 2 million in 1986; travel by Americans plummeted, to 120,000 in 1994, from 400,000 in 1986, and the profit margins of Rio's hotels went into a free fall.
To get back on track, tourism interests in Rio persuaded local authorities to establish a special police unit in late 1992 to patrol areas frequented by visitors, including Copacabana. Its success can be read in the State Department's most recent Brazil travel advisory, issued in August, which noted that the crime rate had declined and no longer singled out Copacabana as a place to avoid.
But while the number of foreign visitors is climbing again -- to 1.6 million last year, including 135,000 Americans -- that is a reflection more of an increase in business travel than in tourism, Rio officials say.
Which is why they are counting on the coming advertising and promotion campaign.
Visa's part, for one year starting in April, will be to send direct mail brochures outlining specially designed Rio vacation packages to more than 20 million card holders in the United States, Canada, South America and Europe. It will also distribute coupon books, with various offers from Rio hotels, restaurants and shops, to all arriving airline passengers. Visa has not disclosed the exact cost of the program.
Visa's goal is to attract 200,000 new visitors to Rio, expanding card holder sales in Brazil, one of its top 10 markets.
Jerry & Ketchum was selected to handle the Rio assignment just last month, when city tourism officials obtained $4.25 million to partly underwrite the campaign from the office of Cesar Maia, Rio's Mayor. Mr. Della Femina, the chairman, chief executive and creative director at Jerry & Ketchum, has produced campaigns for other travel clients like Pan Am, Air France, Rail Europe and most recently the French Government tourist office.
The Mayor's contribution is seed money for what is projected to be a $15 million campaign. Rio officials intend to use Jerry & Ketchum's creative work to solicit multinational marketers like Coca-Cola, Pepsico and General Electric as well as the Brazilian brewers Brahma and Antarctica for the remaining $10.75 million; those companies would participate with the convention bureau in what would be a co-op campaign.
All the seed money is scheduled to be spent the first year; if it is, Rio would rank among the 15 vacation destinations worldwide with the biggest ad budgets. According to Competitive Media Reporting, a research company in New York, Puerto Rico was the top spender, at $11.4 million, in 1994, the last full year for whichfigures were available.
By the end of the five-year campaign, the Jerry & Ketchum ads are expected to increase the number of American visitors to 500,000 annually, generate $1.5 billion in new revenues and create 13,000 jobs, the convention bureau says.
How will Jerry & Ketchum make this happen?
 For starters, the agency has no plans to address the crime issue directly in its advertising. "We're not documentarians," said Jack Taylor, president, chief operating officer and account services director. "We've got to balance the things people know with what they don't. Our strategy is to create awareness among trend-setters."
Mr. Della Femina said the agency was betting that Rio would appeal to the high-income, sophisticated traveler "who's looking for places that are new and rewarding, someone who's had the ordinary and wants the extraordinary."
To reach this market, Jerry & Ketchum is creating ads for travel agents, to begin sometime around April 1, and ads for the travelers themselves, which will begin shortly thereafter.
Jim Tenny, executive vice president of Jerry & Ketchum, expects to use both print and television, because "it's hard to do Rio justice in only two dimensions on a flat piece of paper."
The agency is considering using a live satellite feed from Rio in the TV ads, Mr. Della Femina said.
 The ultimate goal, according to Mr. Della Femina and others, is to stimulate word of mouth about Rio, which they say is the most effective way to put a vacation destination back on the map.
"We could do the best ads in the world, but they can't compare to someone saying they went to Rio for a week and want to go back," Mr. Della Femina said. "If you get one person to say it's great, all of a sudden you're a hot destination."

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
A California city is attracting short-term leases to a naval shipyard while it works on a long-term plan.

BYLINE: By John McCloud 

DATELINE: VALLEJO, Calif.

 BODY:
IN what its backers view as a test of a new approach to the conversion of a military base to civilian uses, a real estate firm has begun a plan for short-term subleases by industrial and office users at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard.
The Navy is pulling out of the shipyard, which occupies 5,000 acres in this blue-collar town of 115,000 people 30 miles north of San Francisco. With about 7,000 civilian employees, the base has been central to the city's economy. The pullout is to be completed in April. 
 The city of Vallejo is leasing out the space, and has most recently put the task in the hands of the E&Y/ Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group of San Francisco. So far, 700,000 square feet of the 10.5 million square feet of office, industrial and retail space at the base has been taken as subleases from the city. The long-term plan is to convey the base to city ownership.
The tenants are paying as little as 15 cents a square foot a year for these leases, which run a maximum of five years, and the Navy is paying for tenant improvement work when it is necessary.
So far the plan has brought in six tenants, Ann Blackburn, the project manager, said. The tenants include the Forest Service; XKT Engineering, a steel fabricator, and Pegasus Inc., a ship-dismantling company, as well as Number One Golf, which took over management of the base golf course.
The idea is to find short-term users that will help pay for base upkeep and provide immediate employment as the city gradually puts a long-term plan into effect. The long-term plan envisions a much more diverse economy, with many of the barracks serving as the core for a university or other educational center. A business park would be erected on land that is now vacant. Development of several million square feet of new commercial space would be allowed, as would development of new retail and residential uses. Approximately 3,500 acres are to be retained as open space.
"By going for short-term uses, we're buying time to support the long-term goals," said Michael Evans, national director of the E&Y/ Kenneth Leventhal group.
The Mare Island base was commissioned in 1853. During and after World War II it was the Navy's largest West Coast ship repair yard. Work has been gradually scaled back since the mid-1980's, with repair activities distributed throughout the country.
After the base closing was announced in 1993, negotiations began with the city on an eventual transfer of ownership, and the city sought professional help in remarketing the space.
Project management went to the Bechtel Corporation of San Francisco, but Bechtel withdrew last year, saying it wanted to concentrate on managing its own holdings. E&Y/ Kenneth Leventhal, the new manager, has brought in Cushman & Wakefield of California to help lease out the heavy industrial space.
"We believe there are two or three million square feet that are usable as-is," said Alvaro da Silva, the city's director of community development. "Over five years or so, we ought to be able to absorb that, though it calls for an aggressive marketing campaign."
New leases have generated only about 200 jobs so far. Mr. da Silva forecast that the number would reach 1,500 by the end of the year. But 7,000 civilians were working at the base as recently as July 1993, and the number is already down 1,200. Some of the employees were transferred to other naval jobs, but many are believed to be out of work.
Among the new tenants is one start-up business, Pegasus, the ship dismantling company. Ronald Edwards, the president, said Pegasus had leased two of the base's four drydocks and hoped to lease all four. He said he expected to have 160 employees working at the base within the next year.
"We looked at sites from Long Beach to Tacoma," he said, "but this was the most recently used location for Navy ship repair and construction. It had a current facility that was easy for us to migrate into. It also has a pool of skilled workers." He said he expected to hire 160 to 200 workers to dismantle the ships already in contract or negotiation.
Another new tenant is XKT Engineering, the steel fabricator. Nancy Bottini, operations manager for XKT, said she and her husband had moved their company from Napa for the larger space, rail and water access and equipment that was already in place. The company originally took 60,000 square feet, double what it had in Napa, and subsequently expanded by two-thirds. The number of employees has more than doubled to 200.
In addition to its commercial space, Mare Island has 2,700 residential quarters, a 10-year-old fully equipped hospital that is now closed, two fitness clubs and a three-year-old elementary school, now operated by the city. Some of the residences are 7,000-square-foot historic mansions.
"It's just waiting for people to come and repopulate it," Mr. Evans said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains vs. Mark and Yen; Cuts in Europe's Rates Expected

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies in New York yesterday as expectations grew that European central banks would soon lower interest rates.
Germany and France, Europe's two biggest economies, announced measures yesterday aimed at spurring growth. Yet many currency traders said those steps would not be enough, and that more rate cuts would be needed to revive their ailing economies. 
 "People are pretty confident that Europe is going nowhere fast," said Howard Kurz, head of foreign exchange at Lehman Brothers in New York. The Europeans "have hit such a wall on their fiscal agenda that they will have to resort to easing monetary policy."
Even the possibility that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates this week did little to undermine the dollar's rally, since many analysts expect European rate cuts to outpace those in the United States in the months ahead.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest-rate policy, met yesterday and meets again today in Washington.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.4893 German marks from 1.4830 marks on Monday. The dollar rose to 107.25 Japanese yen from 106.75 yen. The British pound slipped to $1.5050 from $1.5057 Mr. Kurz said he expected the dollar to rise to 1.52 marks and 110 yen within three months. So far this year, the dollar has gained more than 3.5 percent against the mark and the yen, and 5.3 percent against the Swiss franc.
Analysts say they expect the Bundesbank to lower its 14-day securities repurchase rate, a key money-market rate, today.
Moreover, a Bundesbank council member, Reimut Jochimsen, said yesterday that another reduction in the German discount rate could not be ruled out. Lower rates in Europe often help the dollar by making dollar-denominated deposits more appealing.
"On balance, everyone is bullish, bullish, bullish on the dollar," said J. D. Jensen, president of Jensen & Company, a money manager with $100 million in global bonds.
France and Germany are struggling to cut their budget deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product to qualify for European monetary union. For that reason, their ability to increase growth by cutting taxes and increasing spending is limited. Lower interest rates may be the most effective way to get their economies growing, analysts said. And lower interest rates typically diminish the value of a nation's currency.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Expectations Of a Rate Cut Raise Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Expectations of an imminent rate cut by the Federal Reserve brought a steady stream of buyers to the bond market yesterday, causing prices to climb.
As the Fed's Open Market Committee began a two-day meeting that will determine monetary policy for months ahead, investor beliefs were reinforced by morning reports on January consumer confidence and a retail sales report for December. 
 The 30-year bond rose 26/32 , to a price of 11118/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 6.04 percent, from 6.09 percent on Monday.
The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence, regarded as a measure of future spending and business activity, fell to its lowest level in almost two years -- 87, from 99.2 in December. Market expectations had been for a reading of 97.3, according to a survey by Bloomberg Business News.
Behind the slump in consumer confidence was rising concern about job security in the face of corporate layoffs and the Government's inability to reach a budget accord.
Also released yesterday was the Commerce Department's retail sales report for December, which was weaker than expected. Sales were up by three-tenths of 1 percent, lower than the expected gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Anecdotal reports confirmed the retail weakness. The Mitsubishi Bank/Schroder Wertheim retail sales report released in the morning rose two-tenths of 1 percent last week from the previous week. The Johnson Redbook Service reported that sales for the week ended last Saturday moved back to positive territory, showing a gain of half a percentage point for the period. Analysts were not surprised, given that the numbers had been previously depressed by the storms on the East Coast.
Michael Krauss, chief technical strategist at Chemical Securities Inc., said that yesterday's numbers raised the odds that the Fed would take action on rates today.
He described recent market activity as basically in a consolidation for six weeks, working off excess bullish psychology. "Even if the Fed did not move tomorrow," Mr. Krauss said, "and, mind you, the market has already priced in a lot, I don't think yields will back up that much, since we have a very important employment number due Friday in the form of nonfarm payrolls. If that number turns out weak, the bond market will likely begin to immediately discount" in expectation of a more aggressive rate cut in March.
Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said that "based on the weak economic data already out, there is a 60/40 chance that the Fed may respond to those signs by cutting short- term interest rates by 25 basis points." A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
And because the bond market continues to respond to the low-inflation and low-growth economic environment, he said, it should not panic if it does not get a cut in short-term interest rates today. "Any short decline in bond prices will probably be used as a buying opportunity," Mr. Dwyer said.
Today, the Treasury will announce the size of its quarterly sale of new securities, including a 30-year bond. Tomorrow the Treasury will sell $18.75 billion of new one-year bills.
As far as any developments about the Federal budget, market participants continue to expect a resolution on the debt ceiling, but for now are less fixated on the budget talks.
Elsewhere, the Mexican Government priced $1 billion of five-year global bonds denominated in dollars, making it the largest Latin American sale of dollar debt since 1994.
The bonds, which were priced through two joint lead managers, Merrill Lynch International and J. P. Morgan Securities, drew strong investor demand, enough to increase the size of the offering, from $750 million.
Analysts called it Mexico's biggest test of investor appetite since the peso's collapse in December 1994.
The bonds were offered simultaneously in several world financial markets, drawing strong demand from investors eager for the high interest rates on the five-year notes, which were priced at par to yield 9.75 percent, or about 445 basis points more than the five-year Treasury note. That reflects compensation for the risk associated with debt that is rated Ba-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Some market analysts said that the demand indicated a cautious return by to Mexico by investors who fled in droves last year as the economy contracted sharply in response to the tumbling peso.

HEADLINE: Cruise Missile Is Test-Fired From a Ship By Iran's Navy

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Iran has increased its military power in the Persian Gulf in the last year, most recently by testing a new Chinese cruise missile fired from a ship, senior Pentagon officials said today.
Along with sea mines, two Soviet attack submarines, five Chinese patrol boats and land-based missiles, the new weapon could increase Iran's ability to try to close the Strait of Hormuz -- the gateway to the Persian Gulf and its oil -- in times of tension or war. 
 None of the officials said Iran's test of the Chinese-built cruise missile in the northern Arabian Sea on Jan. 6 was a significant challenge. The test "does not make them a major threat to our naval forces or to commercial shipping in the area," said the Pentagon's chief spokesman, Ken Bacon.
But Vice Adm. Scott Redd, who commands United States naval forces in the region, said today that the test signified "a new dimension" to military strategy in the gulf.
Admiral Redd said the missile, called the C-802, was about as powerful as the Exocet, fired by Iraq in its 1987 attack on the frigate Stark, killing 37 Americans. The Chinese cruise missile flies closer to the ocean's surface than the Exocet and is harder for radar to detect.
The test of the missile, which was fired from a Iranian patrol boat and monitored by a British ship and by United States intelligence satellites, took several days and was not completely successful, military and intelligence officials said.
But the fact that Iran can place a cruise missile with a 60-mile range on a boat "allows the missiles to come at you from any direction," not just a fixed position on land, said Comdr. T. McCreary, a spokesman for the Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain. Tracking mobile missiles, as allied forces learned in the gulf war, is nearly impossible.
"It's not overwhelming, but it is now just one more thing in the Iranians' bag of tricks," Commander McCreary said. "As you add them all together it makes the job a lot tougher. Still, we certainly can deal with the threat." Military and intelligence officials said the deployment of the missile did not mean it would be fired in anger. But they said it was hard to tell what Iran was up to on any front, military or political, given a lack of hard information from inside its ruling councils.
"It's much more difficult for us to gauge intentions than it is to gauge capabilities," said Mr. Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman. "We don't know where they're going; we don't know what their intentions are."
Iran is no superpower. It has enormous military and economic problems left over from its long war with Iraq, which went on from 1981 to 1988 and cost hundreds of thousands of lives. While China and Russia still sell arms to Iran, efforts by the United States to impose an arms embargo have cut overall weapons sales to the Iranian Government to about a third of what they were in 1992, several military experts say.
Nevertheless, given recent history, the United States will "maintain a strong force that's able to deal with any contingency in the gulf," Mr. Bacon said. Ever since the 1991 gulf war, the United States has been building its military presence in the region. More than 20,000 American troops are in or near the gulf. Tanks and heavy armor for 5,000 soldiers are stored in Kuwait.
Mr. Bacon said the United States had seen no "sharp increase" in the threat posed in recent months from its other major nemesis in the region, Iraq. Military cargo ships carrying arms for 20,000 soldiers were sent to the gulf in August from the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia and elsewhere in the region, he said.

HEADLINE: China Hints at a Timetable To Take Control of Taiwan

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 30

 BODY:
China took the first step today toward setting a timetable for the unification of Taiwan with the Chinese mainland, saying that after the return of Hong Kong and Macao to Chinese rule in 1997 and 1999 respectively, unification with Taiwan will become a top priority.
China's assertion that there is a tentative schedule for unification raises the question of whether the Communist Party leadership has set a limit on its patience for establishing control over the island of 21 million people off its southeastern shore, and whether Beijing's leaders might at some point abandon their longstanding commitment to "peaceful reunification" in favor of a more forceful approach. 
 The statements made today come against a backdrop of the most serious tension in the Taiwan Strait in decades. China has conducted extensive military exercises in waters near Taiwan since last summer to signal its hostility toward the Taiwan President, Lee Teng-hui, and his efforts to gain greater international recognition for the island. Threats of more direct military action have been conveyed in private channels and have set off alarms in Asia and the United States.
China today criticized the passage of the American aircraft carrier Nimitz through the Taiwan Strait on Dec. 19. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Chen Jian, said that while the Taiwan Strait is an international waterway where foreign warships have a right of "harmless" or "innocent" passage, China is nonetheless "highly concerned" that an American aircraft carrier would pass through the sensitive strait "in view of the situation" of tension there.
"We would hope that a state of stability in the Taiwan Strait could be maintained against any intervention by foreign forces," Mr. Chen said.
A White House official said the decision to send the Nimitz, which was on its way to the Persian Gulf, through the strait was made by the commander in chief of Pacific forces, Adm. Richard Macke, without consulting Washington, and was "weather related."
The new Chinese statements on Taiwan were delivered in an address by Prime Minister Li Peng, and in editorials in newspapers controlled by the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. In delivering his address at the Great Hall of the People, Mr. Li was flanked by other members of the Politburo, including Adm. Liu Huaqing, China's most senior military officer.
The theme of these statements was that unification can no longer be delayed "indefinitely."
In the most direct statement, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Chen Jian, said that after 1999, "the settlement of the question of Taiwan and the accomplishment of the reunification of the motherland will be on the top of the agenda."
The Communist Party newspaper, The People's Daily, also referred to the post-1999 period, saying, "The solution to the Taiwan question -- for the completion of the historical mission of reunifying China -- will emerge as more outstandingly important than ever before."
The new statements fell short of setting a deadline, but they were significant in suggesting an urgency for Chinese Communist Party leaders to force the issue of Taiwan after Hong Kong and Macao return to Chinese rule after a long period as British and Portuguese colonies.
One China specialist who has advised several administrations on policy toward Beijing said, "These statements by Chinese leaders underscore that the Taiwan issue is not going to go away and that the next generation of Chinese leaders will very likely press for a resolution within a foreseeable future."
The occasion for today's statements was the one-year anniversary of an address on Taiwan by President Jiang Zemin, who has sought unsuccessfully to draw Taiwan into a broad new set of negotiations to establish greater direct ties in trade, air travel and shipping across the narrow Taiwan Strait that separates the mainland and the island.
The address by Prime Minister Li carried reassurances that China's approach to unification would be based on the same "one country, two systems" covenant that Beijing offered Hong Kong.
"We fully respect the life style of our Taiwanese compatriots and their aspiration to become masters of their own destiny," Mr. Li said. "We sincerely hope that our Taiwanese compatriots will work together with us to create a new form of relations between the two sides."
He also sought to reassure the Taiwan business community, which has a $20 billion investment on the mainland and has been rattled by the recent war talk. He restated President Jiang's admonition that Taiwan and the mainland should join economies "to face global economic expansion in the 21st century."
But in a warning to President Lee, the Chinese Prime Minister said the policy of seeking greater international recognition for Taiwan, including attempts to rejoin the United Nations, are the same as advocating "independence for Taiwan."
China has long maintained that any declaration of independence by Taiwan would lead to a military response from the mainland. Western specialists said it seemed possible that China was raising the stakes by asserting that the sum of President Lee's actions amount to an independence drive.
"We have consistently stood for reunification of the motherland by peaceful means," Prime Minister Li said. "But we have not forsworn the use of force."
"The Taiwan authorities have recently deliberately given a false appearance of improving relations with the mainland, but have in fact intensified efforts to create 'two Chinas,' " Mr. Li said, adding that Taiwan has also "bought large amounts of military equipment.
"This only serves to demonstrate that they have been plotting the independence of Taiwan under the pretext of achieving detente," he said, adding, "Their attempts are doomed to fail."

HEADLINE: A Former Ghost Town Faces Prosperity's Demons

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah

 BODY:
Half a century ago, residents clinging to this played-out silver-mining town grumbled when Park City was listed in the guidebook "Ghost Towns of the West."
On Feb. 1, the town surrenders to changing times. Facing a crush of shoppers bound for Main Street's art galleries and jewelry stores, Park City inaugurates a municipal system of valet parking. 
 A century after joining the union, Utah has shed its image as a desert colonized by eccentric Mormon polygamists and has become a magnet for migrants enjoying the economic boom of the Rocky Mountains.
But with economic development in the region has come a lack of affordable housing, traffic jams on alpine highways and a backlash against growth. Here in Park City, a ski resort in mountains half an hour east of Salt Lake City, many people say the town is gorging on growth.
"That's the enemy," Chuck Klingenstein, a newly elected Councilman, said as he watched a line of four-wheel-drive vehicles crawling up a slushy street here.
Bill Coleman, a local real estate pioneer, recalled: "In 1970, I offered 6,000 bucks for my first house here. The owners said they would take $4,000 because an avalanche of snow had taken off the bathroom. Today, that miner's shack been remodeled a dozen times, and it's worth $250,000."
Since 1990, Utah has added about 180,000 people -- the equivalent of another Salt Lake City -- many of them disaffected Californians. In the next decade, the state's population is expected to balloon by a quarter.
The state economy has grown at 5 percent a year since 1990, creating jobs at a rate that nationwide is second only to Nevada. Utah now boasts a 2.8 percent unemployment rate, half the national level. Cutting taxes every year since 1993, Utah is ranked as the nation's best-managed state by Financial World, a magazine based in New York.
As just one example of how the state has grown, the number of information technology companies in Utah is second only to that for California, which has 16 times Utah's population of two million. This year Micron Technology is building a $2.5 billion computer chip manufacturing plant near Salt Lake City.
A high birth rate among Mormons and the fact that the California migrants include a large number of Mormons have kept Utah's population 75 percent Mormon. Employers say they are attracted by the Mormons' work ethic and abstinence from alcohol and tobacco. (Polygamy has been outlawed for more than a century.)
Nowhere is the debate over growth more vocal than here in Summit County, which registered a population growth rate of 39 percent during the first half of the decade, the second-fastest in the nation. With 22,000 people, Summit County has real estate valued at $3.4 billion.
In Park City, economic development is hitched to tourism. Growing at 6 percent a year in the 1990's, tourism revenue in Utah now is $3.4 billion annually -- more than mining, ranching and farming combined.
And with the Winter Olympics coming to Salt Lake City in 2002, tourism will only grow, analysts agree. Most Alpine events are to take place in Park City, Utah's largest skiing center, where snow-covered mountains loom over a 7,000-foot-high urban center. Plans call for an 800-seat arts complex and 550 more hotel rooms.
"It took 110 years to reach our first billion," Toby Ross, the city manager, said of the town's $1 billion in assessed real estate value in 1994. "It will probably take us another seven years to reach our second billion."
New condominiums for out-of-state skiers and houses for Salt Lake commuters have spread across valley floors and up mountain flanks. With 6,200 residents, Park City has 1 real estate agent for every 17 people. Nationwide, the ratio is 1 to 250.
A recent issue of Real Estate Weekly offered more properties -- 19 -- priced at more than $1 million than it did properties for less than $200,000 -- 16. For a mere $110,000, an "adventurous" buyer could get a "rustic mountain cabin," accessible in winter only by snowmobile.
"We are getting the first 'scrapers' here -- someone knocks down a $1 million home to build a $5 million home," said Myles C. Rademan, a Philadelphia transplant who is the town's spokesman.
Protesting the cost of growth, community leaders at Gov. Michael O. Leavitt's recent "growth summit" called for construction of more apartments and for a light-rail line along the Salt Lake corridor, home to 80 percent of the state's population.
"Local governments must realize that they can't keep on zoning for quarter-acre lots," the Governor said in an interview, referring to new subdivisions that now blanket old ranch land.
Last fall in a pre-election poll conducted for KPCW, a radio station here, voters listed their top concerns: growth (development), growth (population), housing (lack of affordability) and growth (loss of historical character).
"The election issue was, How do we control growth?" said Mr. Klingenstein, an urban planning teacher and outspoken slow-growth advocate who won the largest number of votes in last fall's City Council race. "What I heard in the election was, People want a break from this."
To keep working-class people in town, Park City is completing a $2.2 million project to build 210 units of affordable housing. To ease traffic, the city maintains a free bus loop from ski areas through Main Street. Last year, the buses carried one million riders, making the system the state's second largest, after Salt Lake City. This year the City Council decided to ease Main Street congestion by hiring attendants to park shoppers' cars on back streets.
"The bottom line is that we will have to adopt some limits," predicted Hugh Daniels, a Councilman who runs the Old Miner's Lodge, a 100-year-old inn here.
But Utah's strong tradition of western individualism is compounded by memories of the state's economic stagnation a half century ago. Last fall, Midway and St. George were the only Utah communities with building-permit curbs on the ballot. Both were rejected.
In Park City, where condo-mania shows little sign of abating, bumper stickers started cropping up last summer on construction workers' pickup trucks. Addressing slow-growth advocates, they implored, "Please Make Welfare as Hard to Get as a Building Permit."

HEADLINE: Data Gloomy On Consumers And Retailers

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
The economy entered the new year on a dismal note as the holiday shopping season was even worse for retailers than most Wall Street economists had expected and consumers' confidence in the economy sank to the lowest level in nearly two years, according to statistics released yesterday.
But what was bad news for consumers was good news for Wall Street, where investors are counting on the latest evidence of sluggish growth to push the Federal Reserve toward a cut in interest rates. 
 "The silver lining from these numbers is that we are going to get interest rate drops very quickly," said Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director of ASB Capital Management, a money manager based in Washington, D.C. "This is being anticipated at this moment by the stock market."
Indeed, as bonds rallied, investors aggressively snatched up stocks yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 76.23 points to close at a record 5,381.21. In the broader markets, the Standard and Poor's 500 index also hit a record, closing up 5.93 points at 630.15. [Page D8.]
Several economists said they expected the Fed to cut by a quarter-point the Federal funds rate, a benchmark short-term bank lending rate. The Fed last cut that rate on Dec. 19, when it was lowered a quarter-point, to 5.5 percent. Fed policy makers may move as early as today, analysts said, when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee concludes a two-day meeting. Or they may give Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, authority to cut the rate at a later date. Some economists cautioned, however, that the Fed might hold off taking action until it could review data that were delayed by the Government shutdown.
Still, what the Fed already has on the table will give its policy makers plenty to think about.
The Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose a tepid three-tenths of a percent in December, about half the rate predicted by many Wall Street analysts. Excluding automobiles, sales rose only two-tenths of a percent.
Meanwhile, the Conference Board, an independent business group, reported that consumer confidence plunged in January, suggesting that spending would continue to be weak. The board's index of consumer confidence dropped 12 points in January to 87 as consumers worried about the Government shutdown, the stalemate over the Federal budget and the recent flurry of layoff announcements by big corporations.
"Clearly, consumers are feeling pretty tapped out right now," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company. "The bottom line here is that the economy is not growing very fast at all right now. But things are not so bad that we are falling into a recession."
The Commerce Department report confirmed the impression left by general retailers that the holiday season was the worst since the 1990-91 recession, with seasonally adjusted spending at $198.6 billion, up slightly from $198 billion in November. Retail sales in November were weaker than the department had initially estimated, rising seven-tenths of a percent rather than eight-tenths of a percent. Sales fell in both September and October.
The Commerce Department looks at a significantly broader range of spending than initially reported by individual retailers and includes auto dealers, grocery stores, restaurants and other purveyors of consumer goods and services.
For the year, sales rose 4.9 percent above 1994, to $2.3 trillion. It was the smallest advance since sales edged up only six-tenths of a percent in 1991, at a time when the last recession was coming to an end.
A number of special factors, like the snowstorms on the East Coast, contributed to the weakness. But the overriding factor accounting for the recent sluggishness, economists said, is the rising burden of debt that consumers have taken on as the economy advanced over the last few years.
"Most families' buying power has been stagnating for many years, and as a result, they have had to go more and more into debt," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at the Chemical Bank. "Beginning last year, that started to have an effect on spending."
Clothing stores and other traditional mall-based holiday outlets put in a particularly poor performance. On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales at department stores fell a tenth of a percent in December while spending at apparel shops was down four-tenths of a percent. Such other areas as building materials and home furnishings also pointed to a slowdown in spending.
The one exception was auto sales, with dealers posting a gain of seven-tenths of a percent. "The thing that was a bit surprising was that the auto component was stronger," said Waldo Best, an economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities.
But even that advance was a slowdown from the pace of gains common in previous months and much of the gain may well have been from special price promotions by car dealers.
In its report, the Commerce Department said sales of durable goods -- big-ticket items like computers and refrigerators that are expected to last more than three years -- rose three-tenths of a percent, a much slower pace than the 1.4 percent jump in November.
Sales of nondurable goods like food and fuel also rose three-tenths of a percent.

HEADLINE: In Connecticut, Comptroller Predicts a Large Budget Gap

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 30

 BODY:
State Comptroller Nancy Wyman today projected a deficit of as much as $600 million in the state budget in the next fiscal year, raising questions about how the state will be able to enact a $200 million tax cut scheduled to take effect in time for 1997 tax returns.
The report from Ms. Wyman, a Democrat, comes on the heels of other studies warning of a substantial budget gap that were issued by three nonpartisan groups: the Legislature's Office of Fiscal Analysis; the Connecticut Policy and Economic Council, a nonprofit research organization, and Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating agency. 
 Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, is to convene a new legislative session on Feb. 7 and is expected to offer adjustments in the two-year, $20 billion budget adopted last spring.
But the Governor's chief budget official, Reginald L. Jones, dismissed Ms. Wyman's predictions as overstated and said today that the administration had been working on ways to address the problems she and others had raised for the last eight months.
"There will not be a deficit," Mr. Jones said, while also vowing that the tax cuts would remain in place. He said that budget revisions would be revealed next week in the Governor's speech to the Legislature.
Still, the recent spate of critiques of the state's fiscal condition suggest that resolving the problems will be difficult.
At a news conference this morning, Ms. Wyman cited five reasons for the impending deficit and said that a "conservative estimate" is a gap of at least $377 million in next year's $10.1 billion budget. She cited these factors:
*State officials had been too optimistic about the state's economic recovery and had overestimated next year's income, sales and corporate tax revenues by $100 million.
*Changes in taxes on hospitals could cost the state $67 million.
*Cuts in Federal financing and added costs in welfare programs may total at least $50 million.
*A plan to borrow $160 million next year in short-term notes and then repay it by selling shares in the lottery in 1998 could be rejected by the Legislature.
"I am urging the Legislature to shy away from using a credit card to pay for next year's budget," Ms. Wyman said, referring to the lottery plan.
Ms. Wyman's projections were echoed roughly by the Office of Fiscal Analysis, the nonpartisan legislative budget office. In a report released on Monday, the office projected a shortfall of $224 million and said that if the lottery plan was not approved, the gap would grow to $405.6 million.
A similar forecast was offered by the Connecticut Policy and Economic Council, a research group financed largely by state businesses, though its conclusion went one step further: it called for rescinding the $100 million income-tax cut and an accompanying property-tax credit of $100 million.
While Ms. Wyman refused to take any position on the tax cuts, John Carson, an economist who is the council's president, said the reductions "are clearly unaffordable because they are to be financed by new revenue initiatives, in this case selling the lottery."
The recent analysis from Moody's focused solely on the state's plan to eventually sell shares in the lottery, criticizing the interim measure of issuing short-term lottery notes until the sale could be made. David Alter, an assistant vice president at Moody's, expressed concern about whether the sale would go through and the notes would be paid back promptly. "Uncertainties surround the proposal," Mr. Alter said.
Mr. Jones, the state budget chief, brushed aside the criticism. "We believe it is a sound plan," he said.

HEADLINE: Lure of the Education Market Remains Strong for Business

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
Despite last week's collapse of the nation's largest experiment in private management of public schools, in Hartford, there are increasing signs, from the growth of new businesses to rising stock performance, that public education is becoming an enticing market for private businesses.
A recent study estimates that for-profit companies now take in $30 billion of the $340 billion that the United States spends each year on preschool to high school education. That figure includes for-profit companies that run schools; offer classroom instruction or tutoring; sell textbooks, software or new technology; design curriculums; provide consulting services, or fill other niches. 
 Thus, while Education Alternatives Inc. was losing its high-profile contract to run the schools of Hartford, Newark's school district, now operated by the state, signed a $1.25 million contract last week with Sylvan Learning Systems of Columbia, Md., to run the remedial education program at three local high schools through June 1997. Experts say that might be a more revealing situation than Hartford's.
"When you look at the raw numbers, this is a very big industry with enormous potential for growth," said Michael R. Sandler, chief executive officer of Eduventures Inc. of Boston, which invests in companies involved in education and acts as a consultant. "Education has reached the point where the status quo is no longer acceptable."
How much growth will occur will depend, experts say, largely on the push and pull of two opposing forces. The first, coming out of a changing political climate, consists of new demands for leaner, more innovative education approaches, like charter schools, which can be operated by private businesses. The second is the open resistance by many unions to ventures with private companies, and skepticism by some educators.
Still, a recent study for the National School Boards Association found that more than 60 percent of school boards were considering or had considered hiring a private company to run a district or part of one. The vast majority were interested only in private contracts for support services like food, transportation and maintenance. According to the same study, only a third of the districts who hired private companies for cost savings said they had actually saved money.
The private companies providing services to districts include Ombudsman Education Services, which works with at-risk students in nine states; Marriott International Inc., which has about 300 contracts for food services in primary and secondary schools, and Sylvan, which began with independent learning centers but now also has centers in 60 schools.
The best accounting of the size of the for-profit education market comes from The Education Industry Directory, published this year by Mr. Sandler and John M. McLauglin, editor of a publication called The Education Industry Report.
The directory says education is a $600 billion enterprise nationwide, 8.9 percent of the gross domestic product; it is larger than defense spending and second only to health care. Of the money for education, $307.5 billion is spent on kindergarten through 12th-grade education and $30 billion on preschool education.
The directory also says private businesses account for $81 billion of the money spent on education. More than half of that is for training and development programs for the employees of businesses and public institutions. Leaving that out entirely -- although some for-profit companies do training and development in schools -- leaves about $30 billion. The largest chunk of that is $15 billion for educational products like textbooks, computers and software. An additional $10.5 billion is spent on for-profit preschools and child-care centers. Also growing rapidly -- and not included in the $81 billion total -- is the number of school districts that contract with private companies for services like maintenance, food services and security.
There are no reliable figures on how much the industry has grown because so much of it, such as educational software or for-profit preschools, is the result of changes in technology and society that have virtually created new fields.
The widely publicized ventures in running districts or public schools, like Education Alternatives or the Edison Project of Christopher Whittle, remain a tiny part of the overall market, but one with large potential for growth as parents demand greater choice within public education, experts say.
There are other signs of business interest in schools. Mr. McLaughlin's Education Industry Report has begun rating the performance of 25 publicly traded education companies in what it calls its Education Industry Index. It says the stock price of the 25 companies rose last year by 65.47 percent, compared with 39.9 percent for the NASDAQ and 26.2 percent for the Russell 2000 index of small companies.
And Lehman Brothers is sponsoring a conference in February for education companies and institutional investors to look at the investment opportunities being presented by changes in education.
Whether those changes will include the large-scale private management of school districts remains very much in doubt.
In Hartford, the school district canceled the company's contract last week after the company sought payment for some of the $11 million it has invested in the city's 32 schools. So far, the company has been paid only $343,000. "I can't see how there's big money to be made in managing school systems that are failing, for the most part, because of a lack of resources, not because they're grossly mismanaged," said Edward Miller, editor of The Harvard Education Letter. "The idea of taking an existing school system like Hartford and turning it around is just one of the most foolish, unrealistic propositions I've ever heard of."
Some analysts are less downbeat, saying the problems in Hartford and Baltimore, where Education Alternatives' contract was also curtailed, had more to do with bad decisions and bad contracts than the concept itself.
More common is a sense that the prospects are far greater for operating individual schools under contract with school districts than for running whole districts. The spread of charter schools -- which run independently of local districts and receive direct financing from the state -- has offered avenues for public-private partnerships that did not exist even three years ago.
Thus, the Edison Project, after being almost dragged down by the financial problems of Mr. Whittle's other ventures, began operating four schools this year. It has signed contracts for three more next year, which will more than double its current enrollment of 2,300 students.
"It is far more feasible and far more sensible to pursue innovation on a smaller scale than to think about it systemwide," said Benno C. Schmidt Jr., president of the Edison Group. "There's a lot of fresh thinking about reinventing government and finding new ways to deliver services, and public education is looking for the same thing."
Many districts remain more interested in contracting for support services than instructional ones.
"Our primary mission is the education of young people, and we do that better than anyone else," said Robert Stalick, former superintendent of the Albany, Ore., schools. "We aren't necessarily trained, nor are we better than anyone else, at busing kids, providing food service, maintenance and custordial."
Many others remain skeptical that businesses providing instructional services will be able to cut costs or raise performance.
"People seem to assume that raising performance is an easy thing, that businesses can just come in and do it," said DeWayne Boyd, superintendent of the Bremerton, Wash., schools. "If it was that easy, we would have done it a long time ago."

HEADLINE: A Futile Rush In Desperation For Green Card

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
Mohammed Uddin was sound asleep in his Queens apartment when he got the call. The Government was giving out green cards at the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service offices in Manhattan, his friend told him.
In a flash, Mr. Uddin was dressing and kissing his wife goodbye. By 1:30 A.M. yesterday, he was in a taxi, racing toward downtown. 
 Over in Brooklyn, the phone was ringing in Kazi Hossain's apartment. The story he heard: 10,000 green cards were already gone; only 2,000 were left. By 2 A.M., he, too, was on the road, also hoping for the chance to get the permanent resident visa that would allow him to work and live legally in the United States.
But when they arrived, there were no green cards to be had, only hundreds of immigrants already in line, all with scarves and gloves and dreams in hand, all willing to endure the freezing night for the promise of legitimacy in America.
"It was like a flood coming, all the people coming, from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh," said Mr. Hossain, a 33-year-old Bangladeshi, who waited until dawn yesterday only to discover that the rumor was not true. "Everybody wants a green card. This rumor, it was like a dream."
The late-night pilgrimage of nearly 1,000 people -- a mistaken response to an announcement about the annual Federal immigration lottery -- offered a glimpse of the desperation that many of the city's estimated 350,000 illegal immigrants feel about getting a green card.
Those standing in the lines snaking around the Federal Building in lower Manhattan included waiters and housekeepers, chefs and janitors -- people who fuel the city's underground economy, often working long hours for little pay and with few of the protections of legal residents.
Curiously, it was Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts to help them that sparked the rumors that whipped through the city's immigrant communities. His announcement of the Federal immigration lottery at City Hall on Monday was intended to give people guidance about applying for the 55,000 coveted visas available to illegal immigrants in the United States and foreigners living abroad.
But some immigrants who watched the Mayor on English-language newscasts understood little of his announcement, either because of language difficulties or perhaps because they only focused on two words: green cards. Once started, the wrong message traveled quickly, passing second-, third- and fourth-hand over the phone lines.
"Obviously, there was a massive miscommunication," said Valerie Oltarsh, executive director of the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs, as she looked helplessly at the hundreds of people demanding information about the lottery and clarifications of the rumors. "They don't understand. We've been trying to tell them, but they don't understand," said Ms. Oltarsh, who returned later with pamphlets about the lottery.
Congress established the visa lottery as part of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1990 to create greater diversity among immigrants. In last year's lottery, the United States received 4.5 million qualified entries for the 55,000 visas.
Some people in line yesterday and Monday night were not even eligible for the lottery, which is open only to those from countries that have sent fewer than 50,000 people to the United States in the past five years. The bulk of the available visas -- 81 percent -- will go to immigrants from Europe and Africa. The rest will be parceled out to people born in Asia, Latin America, Oceania (which includes Australia and New Zealand) and North America.
Applicants must have either a high school diploma or five years of experience in a field that requires two years of training. The lottery will be open for applications from Feb. 12 to March 12. If selected, illegal immigrants would have to pay a $750 fee for a green card.
Excluded are people from China, Taiwan, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, South Korea, the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland), Canada, Mexico, Jamaica, El Salvador, Colombia and the Dominican Republic.
For many of New York's illegal immigrants, the lottery is their only opportunity to get a green card, which grants legal, permanent residency in the United States. Outside the lottery, most green cards go to the immediate relatives of American citizens and permanent legal residents, those with specialized skills, or people with $1 million or more to invest in American industry.
"There isn't a way that people who don't have those connections can come here," said a spokeswoman for the State Department who insisted on anonymity. "That's why people come here illegally."
And it is also why hundreds of people turned up before dawn at the Federal building.
Getting a green card would mean the opportunity to work legally -- usually at better wages. It would allow them to bring their spouses and children to the United States. And it would allow them to travel to their home countries without fear of being turned back when they return to the United States.
Mr. Hossain, for instance, a bartender with a business degree from a Bangladeshi university, was dreaming of the day he could get financial aid to study computers at a college in the United States.
Mr. Uddin, a 32-year-old chef from Bangladesh, was hoping to open his own Indian restaurant.
And Julie Ravello, a 42-year-old housekeeper from Trinidad, was dreaming of going home and seeing her five children for the first time in six years. She fears that without a green card she would be denied re-entry to the United States.
Jose Vargas, a 36-year-old Colombian who showed up at the I.N.S. building yesterday, said he heard the Mayor's message on Spanish-language television. But he said that a newscaster said Colombians could participate in the lottery, too.
"We're included," insisted Mr. Vargas, who has worked as a janitor in New York since 1986, even as he read the white pamphlet that clearly said in Spanish that Colombians were excluded. "I need this. To work, to bring my children here so they can study and have a future."
A group of 10 Indian men suffered the same disappointment when they waited in line for five hours only to discover that Indians could not apply. One 26-year-old man, who would not give his name, shrugged his shoulders and said he would apply anyway. "This is my only chance," he said sadly. "What else can I do?"

HEADLINE: Giuliani Seeks $150 Million From Assistance Agency

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani plans to seek $150 million in cash from the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation to help close a gap in this year's budget, turning once again to the agency created 20 years ago to help New York City avert bankruptcy, senior officials said yesterday.
The request will be included in Mr. Giuliani's preliminary budget proposal to be announced today, the officials said, even though the Mayor's office has not yet received a commitment from the corporation, including its chairman, Edward V. Regan. 
 The Mayor's senior aide, First Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers, said yesterday that the city intended to model its request on its program two years ago to use a $200 million surplus controlled by the corporation to finance severance packages. That program ultimately persuaded 15,000 workers to leave the city's payroll of 216,000 at the time.
This time, Mr. Powers said, the city would pledge to continue to trim its payroll through attrition. He declined to specify the total cut in jobs.
Mr. Powers said the corporation could raise the money by refinancing some of its outstanding debt to take advantage of lower interest rates, but he declined to discuss the details of the proposals.
"We view this as sort of transitional money to help us transition from a higher work force to a lower work force at a good pace," Mr. Powers said, "so we don't have to do it all at once."
The request for help from M.A.C. came as part of a late scramble to close a $750 million gap in the city's $32 billion budget this year, as well as a projected gap of $2 billion for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins on July 1.
For the coming fiscal year, the Mayor plans to propose nearly $700 million in agency cuts and $650 million in reductions in welfare and Medicaid, officials said. He will also seek $150 million in new aid from Albany and Washington, they said, despite the likely deep budget cuts in both places.
The preliminary budget, the officials added, also assumes that the Mayor will win his longstanding fight with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey over the leases for the city's airports and gain $244 million as a result. It also includes $300 million in savings from selling assets and turning over some services to private company, including parking meters.
Although City Hall and the Municipal Assistance Corporation have had a flurry of meetings in recent weeks to discuss some financial help, the decision to include the $150 million in the city's plan for the current fiscal year apparently took M.A.C.'s directors by surprise, said one official familiar with the talks, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. Neither Mr. Regan nor other officials from M.A.C. would comment on the Mayor's proposal.
The corporation was created to sell bonds to keep the city's finances afloat during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. It pays off those bonds by tapping the city's sales tax revenues. In the past, it has generated surpluses, like the one used to pay for Mr. Giuliani's severance program two years ago. At the moment, however, the corporation does not have a significant surplus, officials say.
If approved, the proposal would join a list of strategies Mr. Giuliani plans to use to balance this year's budget. Many of those maneuvers, including the M.A.C. cash, have been criticized as gimmicks or "one-shot" actions that provide only temporary budget relief.
"My immediate reaction is: It's outrageous," said Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private advocacy group financed by businesses.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL IMPASSE A STUMBLING BLOCK TO STATE BUDGETS

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki is warning that a protracted battle in Washington over the Federal budget will throw New York State's new budget into turmoil and force him to make deep new cuts in spending on top of the ones already proposed.
Other governors say they share his concern. 
 "I lie awake at night worried about things not happening in Washington that could have a devastating impact on our budget," Mr. Pataki said in a recent interview. "Every time I hear talk, 'Let's wait and hash it out in November,' it really does threaten the whole premise of the budget."
Because New York's fiscal year starts on April 1, earlier than any other state's, Mr. Pataki has been grappling for a month with a problem that most other governors are now beginning to confront: assembling a budget without knowing how much Federal money the state will receive and how much flexibility will be given to spend it.
New York and other states find themselves in this predicament because their spending plans are so closely intertwined with the Federal budget. Between 25 and 40 percent of spending by individual states, or a total of $200 billion this year, comes from the Federal Government. Most of it comes from the Medicaid, welfare and transportation programs.
In New York State, Federal Medicaid spending alone will account for $12 billion, 19 percent of the entire state budget.
Fiscal policy experts say New York State's budgeting problems are more severe than they are in many other states because Mr. Pataki must close a $3.9 billion shortfall and had counted on almost $2 billion in savings from Federal policy changes. These proposals, which include converting Medicaid and welfare programs into block grants, are now at the heart of the fight between Congress and the White House.
Mr. Pataki's budget will effectively unravel, he said, if there is no budget agreement in Washington and current Federal spending policies continue. The Governor will still have problems, though not as great, if President Clinton's more modest proposed changes to welfare and Medicaid are enacted.
His budget is sure to remain balanced, he says, only if Congressional proposals to increase the Federal share of Medicaid and to give states broad new powers to set Medicaid and welfare rules are enacted.
"We had premised the budget on some of the regulatory reforms out of Washington that right now are held up," Mr. Pataki said. "We need greater flexibility with Medicaid, greater flexibility on welfare."
In the budget she released on Monday, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey assumed $200 million in savings from changes in Federal Medicaid and welfare policy. But her aides said her budget would not become seriously unbalanced if current policies remained in place.
The fiscal experts said that many, if not most, governors are assuming in their proposed budgets that some revisions in the Medicaid and welfare programs will help them save money.
If President Clinton and Congress fail to reach an agreement before November, a distinct possibility, or do not enact the changes that governors want, many states are likely to find themselves revamping their budgets in special legislative sessions, experts said.
"They are all talking about having to come back" for special sessions, said Raymond Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors Association. "It's not something they want. But there is a sense it might be inevitable."
In New York, Mr. Pataki not only assumed that Washington would give him much greater freedom to squeeze huge savings from Medicaid and welfare programs, he also counted on Congress to give the state a $1.3 billion windfall by increasing the Federal Government's share of Medicaid. It is now anyone's guess whether either change will happen.
In California, Gov. Pete Wilson released a budget last week that counts on $2.6 billion in savings from revisions in Federal welfare and immigration policies. Governors in Michigan and Massachusetts, among many others, are assuming that Washington will create Medicaid and welfare block grant programs that will enable them to save hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming year.
"If these things don't happen, we'll have to adjust the budget, and there would be significant cuts," said Mark Murray, Michigan's budget director.
The states' problem is an example of the widening impact of Washington's budget deadlock. Until now, the main effects of the impasse have been the Government closings and underfinanced Federal departments. But if it drags on into summer, as many in Washington predict, it is expected to force state and local governments to begin paring back their own programs because of uncertainty about Federal aid.
The Federal impasse is not causing immediate problems for most states because they have cash reserves that can cover unanticipated reductions in Federal assistance. But the impasse has left states confused about what they can expect from Washington in the next fiscal year.
Amid widespread anxiety about Federal spending, some governors and legislators across the country are already budgeting more conservatively.
"They aren't starting new programs," said Mr. Scheppach of the National Governors Association. "They don't know how much state money they'll have to put in to compensate for reduced Federal levels."
Fueling the governors' confusion, they must choose between two different Federal budget proposals. The Republican plan would convert Medicaid and welfare into block grants, under which states would receive lump sum payments and be given much greater freedom in determining eligibility and benefits.
But Mr. Clinton insists on keeping Medicaid as an entitlement, meaning everyone eligible would get it. He would reduce costs by setting a per-capita limit on spending. The President has not explicitly rejected the idea of a welfare block grant, but has objected to the Republican version as too harsh on children.
"You almost have to get yourself prepared to do two budgets," said George Delaney, Colorado's budget director.
In California, Governor Wilson is anticipating changes in Federal rules that would allow him to reduce welfare benefit levels and make other cutbacks in social programs. He is also assuming that the Federal Government will reimburse the state for over $1 billion in services to illegal immigrants.
"The longer the Federal deadlock stretches on, the more of a problem it is," said Russell Gould, California's director of finance.
Many other governors, including Mr. Pataki, are counting on Federal block grants that would allow them to put more Medicaid recipients into managed care programs faster and to reduce their payments to health-care providers.
In the face of the impasse, Mr. Pataki has asked his budget director, Patricia A. Woodworth, to prepare a list of new spending cuts in case he does not receive the $1.3 billion to $2 billion in Federal changes he needs.
Though the Governor refused to discuss that contingency plan, he said most of the new cuts would be to social programs. "It would require us to go far beyond what we think is reasonable in looking to restructure the entitlement programs," he said.
Mr. Pataki said he would oppose deferring a scheduled reduction in the state personal income tax to help balance the budget. Legislative leaders in both parties have agreed with him on that.
Some fiscal monitors, including Moody's Investors Service, have been critical of Mr. Pataki for assuming that the Federal Government would increase its share of Medicaid costs. Though the proposal would benefit about two dozen other states, New York is the only one to have assumed that it would be enacted.
Asked if he thought he had erred in anticipating such a large and uncertain windfall, Mr. Pataki said no.
"Everyone had to make some assumptions, and we tried to be as conservative as possible in ours," he said. "We still think it is likely to happen. It's a question of when."

HEADLINE: Russia Reform To Continue, Clinton Says After Meeting

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, after meetings today with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia, expressed their confidence in Russia's continuing commitment to market reform despite Moscow's dismissal of well-known reformers and new plans for large social expenditures.
Since the Russian Communist Party did so well in December elections for the lower house of Parliament, President Boris N. Yeltsin, expected to seek re-election in June, has been moving to co-opt the Communist policy agenda and ridding his Government of ministers associated with Western-style reform. 
 Mr. Yeltsin has also been issuing decrees, most notably raising pensions and wages, that would swell the budget deficit and risk higher inflation. That has the International Monetary Fund worried about a three-year, $9-billion loan largely negotiated with one of the reformers now dismissed, Anatoly B. Chubais.
But Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore both said they supported the loan to Russia. Senior American officials said that to deny Russia the loan would be a drastic and politically devastating blow to Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin. They said that the fund would probably go ahead but would insist on monthly or quarterly disbursements dependent on an ongoing review of the Russian economy.
"I believe the loan will go through, and I believe that it should," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Gore, speaking today at a joint news conference with Mr. Chernomyrdin, agreed with Mr. Clinton, saying that personalities did not matter. "The ultimate test will be in the performance of the Russian Government and the Russian economy," Mr. Gore said.
It is clear that American officials want to give Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin some space to maneuver before June's Russian elections, while keeping a minimum standard of economic performance. American officials say the fund can live with Mr. Yeltsin's multi-billion-ruble decree raising pensions and the minimum wage, while Mr. Chernomyrdin said today that the Government expected to abide by the legal spending limits imposed in the 1996 budget passed by the previous Russian legislature.
At the same time, Mr. Chernomyrdin has emphasized the need for "certain corrections in the social spheres," which means more spending. He refused today to describe those corrections, saying that Mr. Yeltsin would make a major announcement on Feb. 15 about the Government's new plans.
Mr. Chernomyrdin noted that both countries were having presidential elections this year, giving "a special tone" to the bilateral relationship.
Mr. Gore said the United States backed reformers of all stripes in Russia, and had understanding for the "tensions" involved in the Russian transition from a command economy to a market one. It is only right, he said, that a Russian Government would want to be sensitive to those tensions.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin spoke after the sixth session of the semiannual Government meetings that the two men were assigned by their Presidents to lead. The regularity of the meetings has produced a relatively quiet working environment, which has helped to solve difficult economic and trade problems.
For example, in these sessions both sides are said to be very close to solving a long standing issue about the purchase and use of Pratt & Whitney engines on a new Russian airframe by Ilyushin, the IL-96, despite early opposition from Boeing and Russian engine makers. In return, the Russians will lower tariffs for Western aircraft.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin announced today that the Russians will be allowed a larger share of the commercial space launch market, getting the same deal as China and Ukraine, with the possibility of 20 launches a year, rather than the 8 now, a senior American official explained. The United States will also agree to do more shuttles to the Russian Mir space station, helping to keep it going in the face of severe Russian budget restraints.
The two countries have also worked out clearer rules on importing Russian weapons and ammunition into the United States. The import of four dangerous weapons will now be banned, instead of frozen, but ammunition trade will resume for sporting weapons with careful monitoring, the official said.
The two men also exchanged environmental information derived from previously secret satellite maps of each other's countries. "They have better maps of our country than we do," Mr. Gore said. "And we have better maps of Russia than they do."
Other sensitive bilateral issues -- like the Russian contract to provide research nuclear reactors to Iran -- were discussed, but little progress was disclosed today.
Other statements of cooperation were made in areas from small-business development to joint work on fighting infectious diseases, especially diphtheria, which is at epidemic proportions in Russia. There was also an agreement in principle to provide American Export-Import Bank credits to support American exports to Russian forestry enterprises.

HEADLINE: Replacements Lift Building Owners in Strike

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
They work largely in the shadows as they clean bathrooms and wax floors at night, but at least 15,000 temporary replacements are being used during the building workers' strike in New York City, according to real estate executives -- the biggest use of such workers in recent city history.
Not only is the use of these workers undermining New York's vaunted reputation as a union town, a town where "scabs" were once beaten and scorned, but it has given the building owners a leg up in the strike by enabling them to keep their buildings from sliding into chaos. 
 The two sides said they would resume negotiations today, after having broken off talks on Jan. 20. The Secretary of Labor, Robert B. Reich, plans to meet briefly with the negotiators beforehand to urge a settlement.
On the eve of the new talks, the large-scale use of replacement workers seems to have thrown the union on the defensive in the 27-day strike, one of the most important labor contests in the city in a decade.
From across 50th Street one recent day, a dozen strikers shouted "Scab!" with stunning vehemence at two thin, dark-haired replacement workers who were sweeping the sidewalk at Rockefeller Center.
But when the two men, both immigrants from Colombia, ever so hesitantly told their stories and why they leapt at the chance to earn $9 an hour during the strike, they sounded little different from the pickets: they, too, were struggling to keep their families above water in these turbulent economic times.
With a wife and young daughter to support, the shorter, mustached worker said he had barely thought twice about quitting his $250-a-week job at a Brooklyn junkyard to take his new cleaning job, which with all the overtime from the strike has doubled his weekly pay. The taller worker, who is studying computer science at Hunter College, said he was forced to take the job to pay his tuition and support not just his family in Queens but his parents in Colombia.
"I feel bad that I'm doing another person's job," said the taller worker, who, like the other, refused to give his name. "But I have people here and in Colombia to support."
Management officials expressed confidence that they had the upper hand, not just because of the use of replacement workers, but because the strikers are feeling the strain from three weeks huddled in the cold without paychecks.
"The momentum is on our side because we haven't really felt the effect of this strike as much as we thought we would," said Charles Mahoney, director of property management at Tishman Speyer Properties, a real estate firm that owns six Manhattan office towers. "We didn't realize we would be able to find replacement workers so quickly. There was a learning curve, but right now, we're 90 percent of where we were before."
Mr. Mahoney said Tishman Speyer had hired 400 temporary replacement workers to replace the 400 strikers at his company's buildings, explaining that the new workers were doing the same jobs as the old: running freight elevators, vacuuming carpets, mopping floors and taking out the garbage.
"I have a waiting list of several hundred more people who want to work as replacement workers," he said.
Like other management officials, Mr. Mahoney said the building owners did not plan to turn these temporary replacement workers into permanent ones, who would force the strikers out of jobs. Management officials say the temporary workers will lose their jobs after the strike, although they say they will try to find spots for the best ones.
Some tenants are less generous than the building owners in grading how well the buildings are being maintained. While many tenants say their buildings are running more or less normally after the blizzard and some big stumbles during the strike's first week, at other buildings tenants complain that toilet paper is not being refilled, that they have to empty their own wastebaskets and that only one of a building's two or three entrances is open because the lobby managers are on strike.
From labor's point of view, "scabs" have made an unwelcome visit to New York largely because old-time notions of labor solidarity have given way to economic desperation. Many replacement workers are at the bottom of the economic ladder: the longtime unemployed, new immigrants from Latin America and Eastern Europe and people not able to make ends meet from their first job.
"Where the unemployment rate is high, and especially when it's high in a place as large as New York, it has always been easy to recruit scabs to pit workers who are hungry against workers who are hungry," said Ray Abernathy, a spokesman for the striking union, Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union.
Stanley Aronowitz, a City University sociology professor who often advises unions, said the replacement workers had definitely weakened the union's bargaining leverage. "It will make it more likely that the union, although it will claim victory, is going to have to accept a compromise that is closer to what management wanted," he said.
Complaining that high operating costs are squeezing their profits and chasing away tenants, building owners are demanding that the starting salary for most maintenance workers be cut by almost 40 percent, to $352 a week from the current $573. Under management's proposal, the salary of new workers would climb to that of experienced workers after six years, but the strikers fear that this formula will spur management to get rid of higher-paid veteran workers and replace them with new low-paid ones.
Several officials close to the talks said management's fall-back position would probably be for a 30 percent cut in starting salary, rather than 40 percent, and rising to the level of an experienced worker's salary in three to four years, rather than six years.
Mr. Aronowitz, along with many labor supporters, including some senior officials in the Service Employees International Union, say the striking local is in a weaker position than they thought it would be because it has only belatedly taken steps that many striking unions take early on. They note that Gus Bevona, the union's reclusive president, has yet to organize a large-scale labor rally and waited three weeks after the strike began to run radio and newspaper advertisements to win public support.
"The union is not laying out its side," Mr. Aronowitz said. "They haven't made enough appeals to the public."
As the strikers picket out in the cold day after day, many have also faulted Mr. Bevona and New York City's Central Labor Council for failing to have the picket line honored by several unions with an ability to squeeze management. In particular, these strikers mention the electricians, the operating engineers, who run boiler rooms, and the teamsters, who deliver oil and collect garbage.
At times, it appears the replacement workers have more compunction about crossing the picket line than do members of other unions.
One worker sweeping the lobby of 2 World Trade Center said he thought the strikers were being treated unfairly, but he said he took his $9-an-hour cleaning job "because I need the money."
This worker, who like other replacement workers refused to give his name, said his $7.53-an-hour day job as a bike messenger was not enough to support him, his wife and three children. So he now works eight hours as a messenger by day and seven-and-a-half hours as a janitor by night.
"It's pretty hard out there," he said.
A well-dressed, well-spoken replacement worker at 2 Penn Plaza, which towers over Pennsylvania Station, said: "When I first heard about the strike, I thought there was no way I was going to cross the picket line. But then I saw they were paying $8.78 an hour, and I have to feed my family,"
This worker, who was sweeping outdoor walkways, said that once the strike began, he left his $6-an-hour job as assistant shoe department manager at a Sears in Westchester. The $352 a week that he jumped for is the same lower starting salary proposed by management, but rejected by the union.
"I see this as an opportunity," he said. "I'm trying to do a good job in the hope that after the strike ends, they will keep me on."

HEADLINE: California Keeps College Tuitions Level

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Jan. 24 news article on falling tuition prices at many colleges wrongly suggests that tuition cuts will benefit most students. Most colleges have followed a policy of providing financial aid to poor students while charging higher tuition to those from wealthy families.
But as colleges try to resemble corporations, they are moving to a more profitable policy of drawing wealthier students by lowering the top tuition rates. Often, the results are a decline in the quality of education and reduced opportunities for poorer students to get financial aid.
When a college education is essential to intellectual growth and employment, it is appalling for colleges to sacrifice their principles for tuition revenue by trying to lure the economic elite to their campuses.
Attendance at top colleges will once again become a symbol of status and wealth rather than an opportunity available to excellent students.

HEADLINE: Why Raising Minimum Wage Will Hurt, Not Help, the Poor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The State of the Worker" (Op-Ed, Jan. 25): Thomas Geoghegan is wrong when he suggests that the poor will be helped if the Clinton Administration raises the minimum wage to $7. Many American companies are already moving production facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper labor. Many more are on the brink of moving production overseas -- wage differentials are still just small enough to justify keeping production domestic. 
 While it is true that if the Administration were to raise the minimum wage by 65 percent, some Americans would earn more money, more would lose their jobs as factories were shut down.
A $7 minimum wage is a prescription for high unemployment. Will the poor be better off if even fewer people have jobs?

HEADLINE: It's Not on Line, It's on Cable;
In a Test City, Sitcoms and Internet Travel Together

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: ELMIRA, N.Y.

 BODY:
Charles Tolbert goes on line for all the usual reasons: to swap E-mail with friends, participate in chat groups or just roam around the Web.
By signing on to the Internet through his cable television company, however, Mr. Tolbert has access to something that eludes most small-town cybernauts: articles from his tiny local newspaper the night before it hits his doorstep. 
 "I can catch the editorials before they slam me the next morning," said Mr. Tolbert, who, as a member of the Elmira school board, often finds himself in The Elmira Star-Gazette over some tempest or another.
For Mr. Tolbert, cable television has broadened the definition of cyberspace to include his own backyard. And for the cable industry, cyber-ready customers like Mr. Tolbert represent a new business frontier.
As part of a test of its Internet-access service in this upstate New York city, Time Warner Cable has connected Elmira's newspaper, library, community college and Chamber of Commerce to its network. Using a cable modem and his personal computer, Mr. Tolbert can search for a book in his local library as easily as he can browse through national on-line services like America Online or Prodigy.
And he can do it all at lightning speed -- at least compared with the treacle-like pace that information flows through computer modems connected to conventional copper telephone lines.
For Time Warner and the rest of the cable industry, the Internet is the most tantalizing new business opportunity in years. It offers cable operators a chance to stay competitive at a time when telephone companies are swarming into their business, both because of looser Federal regulations and a spate of recent investments in high-powered satellite broadcasting.
By linking subscribers to local organizations that might not be able to afford to put themselves on line, these services play upon the "community access" tradition that has always been one of the supposed benefits of cable television, a feature national satellite services cannot hope to match. By providing ultra-high-speed access to the global computing web, cable companies are also seizing on a technological advantage over telephone networks.
And in contrast to the situation with interactive television, which was the industry's previous big futuristic hope, the technology to provide Internet access over cable wires already exists. No wonder some cable executives sound breathless.
"While we were all waiting for interactive television, something called the Internet took over the world," said Brian L. Roberts, the president of the Comcast Corporation and the chairman of the National Cable Television Association. "It's exciting and frightening."
Comcast, the nation's third-largest cable operator, recently ordered 250,000 modems from Motorola and Hewlett-Packard and plans to offer a commercial service to cable subscribers in Baltimore later this year. Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 1 cable operator, ordered 200,000 Motorola modems to begin offering on-line access in Sunnyvale, Calif., this April. And Time Warner has ordered a total of 100,000 Motorola and Toshiba modems to offer service in Elmira, San Diego and other places in its network, which is the nation's second largest.
Time Warner currently has just 200 participants in its Elmira market test, which began in July. But Glenn A. Britt, the president of Time Warner Cable Ventures, said there was a waiting list of 250 for the service, which is called Linerunner. "We haven't even marketed it," he said. "This is all through word of mouth."
Time Warner selected Elmira for the test because it is a small cable system, yet one with a technologically astute group of subscribers, since many residents work for the industrial glass manufacturer Corning Inc., which has headquarters in the neigboring town of Corning, N.Y. Mr. Britt said Elmira would serve as a template for Time Warner's larger cable systems, including Rochester and, eventually, New York City.
In interviews with half a dozen Elmirans who are using the service, everyone said that it met their almost palpable need for speed. With a potential top range of 25 million bits a second, Time Warner can deliver its data up to 800 times as fast as phone companies can, because coaxial cable has far more capacity, or bandwidth, than the copper wire used by phone companies.
That capacity allows cable to rapidly transmit complex multimedia images and photographs, which have become a big attraction with the growth of the World Wide Web. Downloading these files over regular phone lines, where the fastest modems operate at only 28,000 bits a second, is a frustrating and time-consuming -- not to mention costly -- procedure.
Mr. Tolbert, who is a supervisor with the Postal Service, said he was spending more than $200 a month in phone bills to use his on-line service, Compuserve. He paid just $30 to install Linerunner, and is receiving the service free. Eventually, Time Warner plans to charge $39.95 a month for this all-you-can-eat on-line package.
"The choice is between driving on a superhighway or driving on a 5-m.p.h. bumpy access road," said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Company. Mr. Wolzien predicted that high-speed data delivery would become an $8.4 billion business for the cable industry by the year 2004.
Cable operators believe they bring two other strengths to this business: plenty of programming and a strong local presence. In Elmira, besides connecting subscribers to the locally owned Star-Gazette, Time Warner is also avidly promoting its magazines, books, and other products on Linerunner, which has a menu that prominently features a link to Pathfinder, Time Inc.'s elaborate Web site.
Paul Sagan, the editor of new media at Time Inc., said the goal was to offer a full spectrum of local, national and worldwide information. "We want to help people make communities, both across the fence and around the world," he said.
Such lofty pronouncements raise the hackles of telephone companies, which are still the sole local gateway to the Internet for the overwhelming majority of Americans, since most home PC owners use a computer modem and a telephone line to gain access.
Ray Albers, the vice president of technology planning at the Bell Atlantic Corporation, contended that the technology for cable modems still had kinks in it and that some cable operators had already scaled back their plans for deploying them.
Even while acknowledging that coaxial cable has more capacity than phone lines, Mr. Albers said cable's speed dropped quickly if too many users signed on at the same time. Unlike the phone model, in which each call is allocated to an individual circuit, the cable network is a shared system, where all the cable customers are vying for use of a single pipeline. And the cable network's highest speeds can be superfluous if the subscriber is interacting with a remote Internet computer that allows connections of only 56,000 bits a second -- a fairly common limitation.
Bell Atlantic and other phone companies are trying to maintain their dominance in data delivery by developing a new generation of high-capacity lines, called integrated services digital networks, or I.S.D.N., which can transmit data at much faster rates than regular phone wires.
At the moment, phone companies are merely the local conduit to an Internet access provider -- whether it be a commercial on-line service like America Online or a direct-access company like Netcom or Psinet. But phone companies hope to expand into the more lucrative Internet-access business.
The biggest threat to cable's on-line future may not be phone companies, however, but squabbles among the cable companies themselves. The two largest, Tele-Communications and Time Warner, have been unable to agree to join forces on a national network that would link cable systems to each other, and in turn, to the Internet. Such a network would bring efficiency and economies of scale to the cable industry by enabling operators to store vast amounts of data in one location, and ship it around the network as required by individual subscribers.
Tele-Communications has been developing such a system in a joint venture with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a venture capital firm. But executives familiar with the project, which is called @Home, said that Time Warner had rebuffed several offers to make an equity investment in it.
These executives said that Time Warner did not want to turn @Home into a national brand name. But Mr. Britt said the disagreement was based on technology issues, rather than any concerns at Time Warner about brand identity
Executives at @Home said they had doubts about Time Warner's technical approach. As it has done in Elmira, Time Warner plans to connect its cable systems to the Internet one at a time, while @Home is building a network that would connect a group of systems to the Internet.
"If you don't integrate the system, you'll end up with something unmanageable," said Will Hearst, the chief executive of @Home and the former publisher of The San Francisco Examiner.
None of these issues mean much to the early adapters of Elmira, who are quickly finding ways to turn Time Warner's new service to their advantage. Elisabeth Carvelyn, a marketing executive at the Arnot Ogden Medical Center, is using Line-runner to publicize the hospital's fitness and health programs.
"In health care, you have to be able to download very large files, so speed is very important," Ms. Carvelyn said.
The service can be turned to unexpected uses. Gary Packard, who runs a small industrial brake and clutch manufacturer in Elmira, has used the service to save on legal fees. After a customer tried to renege on a contract recently, Mr. Packard logged on to Linerunner and found his way to the law library at nearby Cornell University.
Mr. Packard, who is not a lawyer but once took a course in business law, said he downloaded a few pages from the Uniform Commercial Code and mailed them to the customer. Payment was quick in coming.
