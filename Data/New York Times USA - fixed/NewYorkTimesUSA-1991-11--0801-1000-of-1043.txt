HEADLINE: DEPOSED HAITIAN MEETS WITH FOES

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARTAGENA, Colombia, Nov. 22

 BODY:
The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's deposed President, arrived here tonight and met with opposition leaders from his country for the first time since he was overthrown in a military coup on Sept. 30.
Father Aristide's 45-minute session with 11 Haitian legislators opened a weekend of talks in which the possibility of his reinstatement will be discussed. The meeting was also attended by delegates from the Organization of American States, who are to mediate. 
 Haitian delegates and members of the O.A.S. delegation said it was urgent that some compromise be reached soon to rescue the Caribbean nation from a "critical and dramatic" situation. The country's already desperate economy was dealt a near-mortal blow on Oct. 8, when the O.A.S. announced a trade embargo to protest the coup. A month later, the United States suspended about $85 million in aid and froze Haiti's assets.
"Life in Haiti is paralyzed right now," said Josue LaFrance, a member of Parliament and delegate here, who opposes a return by Father Aristide to Haiti. "We have virtually no transportation, people are dying, and there is danger of epidemic."
 
Desperate Journeys
 So drastic have conditions become that about 3,000 Haitians have undertaken the perilous 600-mile journey to southern Florida by small boats. Many of those are believed to be lost at sea.
The United States officially resumed a policy this week of returning the Haitians, but a temporary restraining order issued by a Federal judge bars any forcible returns pending a hearing on Wednesday.
The broad agenda of the meetings here is to find a constitutional solution to the crisis. Father Aristide said earlier in the week that he would be willing to name a new prime minister and open the Government to opposition leaders. He also said he would agree to a pardon for the military as long as those directly responsible for the coup were removed from power.
Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, Colombia's O.A.S. delegate, said that one of the goals of the talks would be to reinstate the former President. Mr. Ramirez, who spent three days last week in meetings with leaders in Haiti, said the military had pledged to honor whatever measures are agreed to. But whether that promise extends to Father Aristide's return is unclear.

HEADLINE: Mining Solid Gold on the Radio

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Just after 9 A.M. a man in a yellow sweatshirt spins his chair around in a Manhattan studio, pulls his headphones on and shoves a tape into a cassette player. "Hello, Luv," he booms into a microphone. "Good morning, everybody, this is Ron Lundy at CBS-FM, and I got a song for ya. Oh, 'Baby, I Love Ya.' "
As that 60's tune fills the studio on West 52d Street, the more subdued co-anchors one floor below at WCBS-AM preach the commuter gospel -- news reports from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut peppered with traffic and weather updates. 
 A flip of the dial to the right finds a Spanish-language station and Gospel music. To the left is WXRK's Howard Stern, the nation's foremost "shock jock," who recently asked Wilt Chamberlain, a guest, to explain his claim that he'd had sex with 20,000 women.
This is New York radio.
No question it is big. With more than 18 million listeners, New York-area stations have the largest reach in the nation; they took nine of the top 10 slots in a recent poll of America's most-listened-to stations by the Arbitron Company, which measures radio audiences.
New York radio can also be quite profitable.
 
A Money-Making Proposition
 Though its gross revenues are only a third of newspaper and television revenues, even the smallest stations can be profitable, says Elliot B. Evers, a partner in Media Venture Partners, a radio and television brokerage firm.
"In a market the size of New York, there are a lot of people making a hell of a lot of money," he said, adding that the region's top 10 stations will take in $18 million to $30 million this year.
The secret of radio's success, industry experts say, is that in the heat of the cable television revolution and recent recession that have scalded network television and newspapers, radio has been able to make the most of its biggest assets: low production costs and the ability to appeal to specialized audiences.
Like the region itself, New York-area frequencies are a smorgasbord of languages and subcultures -- from sermons at Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church on WRKS-FM to "Memories of Lithuania" on WSOU-FM to "Ruby, the Intergalactic Gumshoe," a weekly science-fiction serial on WBAI-FM.
"There are so many choices that it is a very competitive market for both listeners and advertisers," says Chris J. Witting Jr., general manager of WCBS Newsradio 88, the all-news AM station.
Though New York radio has always been eclectic, much has changed since the days when a handful of large stations dominated the region's AM airwaves, broadcasting live shows cross-country from Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan. The arrival of television brought an identity crisis for the medium that once monopolized in-home electronic entertainment. The industry then underwent a further transformation with the advent of the technologically superior FM band, where high fidelity music would sparkle.
Now regional listeners can choose from as many as 100 stations -- urban and suburban -- based in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and beyond.
They have turned from "broadcasting" to "narrowcasting." No more Madonna bumping up against Metallica on dozens of stations. Today, even playing "rock" isn't specialized enough. Now there is "lite rock" (WLTW-FM), "classic rock" (WXRK-FM), "adult contemporary rock" (WNSR-FM), "heavy metal rock" (WZRC-AM) and "rock-and-roll" (WNEW-FM) -- just to name a few.
"There is so much out there -- some of it is almost subterranean," said Jo Maeder, a disk jockey for WXRK who is known as the "Rock-and-Roll Madam."
In suburban areas, narrowcasting has allowed local stations to be even more local. "We're not New York, not Philadelphia. Proud to be New Jersey 101.5 FM," is a refrain repeated regularly on WKXW-FM in Trenton.
Many listeners say they prefer narrowcasting because they can tune in to specific stations for specific things. Jeffrey Nichols of Hackensack, N.J., for example, listens to New York City's WXRK classic rock as he drives to and from his job as a delivery man with United Parcel Service in Secaucus, N.J. At other times, he says, he listens to New Jersey talk shows, which he likens to "the regional section of your local newspaper."
Advertisers say that narrowcasting offers an efficient and accurate way to target consumers. A case in point is WCBS-FM. Having grown steadily in popularity since the early 1970's, WCBS-FM last spring did what radio experts thought impossible. Playing a "golden oldies" format with a cast of disk jockeys who had appeared on WABC-AM in the 1960's, the FM station struck a chord with baby boomers and became New York's top-ranked station in the spring and summer Arbitron ratings.
Advertisers, who covet 25-to-54-year-old listeners and who funneled more than $325 million into New York radio last year, were ecstatic.
James Duncan Jr., editor and publisher of a trade publication, Duncan's Radio Market Guide, predicts that WCBS-FM will be the third-biggest money-maker in the nation this year, with total advertising revenues of about $29 million, right after top-ranked WGN-AM in Chicago, which plays adult contemporary music, and KABC-AM in Los Angeles, a talk-radio station.
"This has been a soft year for radio revenue," said Mr. Duncan, adding that revenues were off by 3 percent from last year. "But radio has done better than television and newspapers because of its low costs and because it efficiently targets audiences."
This has also been a bad year for the Top-40 stations -- not only because there are fewer teen-agers listening, but also because of heightened competition in an increasingly fragmented market.
For example, Top-40 playing WHTZ-FM, known as Z100, was No. 1 in its market from 1987 through the summer of 1989, three times earning a 6.2 share, or percentage of the listening audience, based on Arbitron data. By last summer, Z100 was hovering at 3.8 percent, having been surpassed by stations specializing in oldies (WCBS-FM, with a 5.1 share), rhythm and blues (WRKS-FM and WBLS-FM, with 4.8 and 4.2, respectively), "lite" music (WLTW-FM, with 4.9) and six others.
"The Top-40 format has just gotten so narrow," said Rick Sklar, a radio consultant, former vice president of programming for ABC's radio division and now a vice president of Interep Radio Store in New York, which sells radio advertising. "It appeals to young people, particularly young women, and it's no longer the mass appeal format that it once was," said Mr. Sklar, the author of a book about New York radio entitled "Rocking America," (St. Martins Press, 1984).
 
Old Loyalties Persist
 Other Top-40 stations have struggled as well, in the region and elsewhere, buttressing two themes voiced frequently these days by radio experts: narrowcasting works, and New York radio, though multifaceted, is more conservative these days than one might think. According to Arbitron, for example, the top two stations in Nassau and Suffolk Counties play adult contemporary rock (Phil Collins, say, or Billy Joel) and golden oldies, respectively.
Though most listeners and radio professionals say that the predictability of narrowcasting is an important radio quality these days, there are exceptions.
The most notable among them are the "shock jocks," Don Imus of WFAN-AM and Howard Stern, whose irreverent often controversial talk show on WXRK (which also calls itself K-Rock) is beamed to radio stations in three other cities.
But for listeners, finding a station that suits them is, after all, what matters.
"I have to admit, I love Howard Stern," said Robin Brooks, a 32-year-old housewife in Toms River, N.J. "I don't know why. I guess I just can't believe what he gets away with."
Ali Breland, 19, a student at Nassau Community College, prefers WBLS-FM and WRKS-FM (known as KISS-FM), which play rhythm and blues and some Jamaican music. "Rap and Jamaican is hot," he says.
And for Rick Sandri, 39, a business executive who lives in Glen Rock, N.J., in Bergen County, it is the golden oldies that have his loyalty.
"When I'm at home with the kids I tend to turn on 'oldies but goodies,' " he said. "I've got a 3-year-old and a 9-year-old, and I dance with them. I want them to hear the music I grew up with."

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Makes Late Sally on Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
With the blessing of the White House, Republicans in the House of Representatives tried today to embarrass Democrats by offering a broad package of popular tax cuts that stand no chance of enactment just days before Congress plans to adjourn for the year.
The initiative by the House Republicans underscores their frustration with the lack of forceful policy proposals by the Bush Administration. But even more, it demonstrates an attempt to regain political momentum that has been lost in recent weeks because of the shaky economy, a drumbeat of attacks from Democrats and a series of misfires at the White House. 
 Announcing the package, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, delivered one political sally after another in the hope that at least one would make the television news. A typical line about the Democrats was this: "In the next four days they get to show the people of America whether they are truly interested in creating jobs."
The measures would go far beyond what President Bush has proposed. But before he had seen the initiatives, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, said the White House would support them so long as they did not cost the Treasury a net loss of revenue.
 
Differences in Accounting
 Because under the Administration's accounting system some tax cuts actually raise revenue, at least in the short term, the Republicans were able to say that their plan would not lose money. But it would cost billions of dollars over the next five years according to the way the Congressional Budget Office does the accounting.
The Republicans worked hard to choreograph their strategy for maximum political impact. Here are the steps:
1. The Republicans will offer their tax proposals next week as an amendment to legislation providing money for the savings and loan bailout, which must be passed before Congress adjourns.
2. The House Rules Committee, an arm of the Democratic leadership that establishes the procedures under which legislation is debated and voted on, will declare that the amendment is not "germane" to the savings and loan legislation and thus, under House rules, cannot be presented.
3. The Republicans will demand a vote on this ruling and will lose on a nearly party-line vote. Then they will offer to back down if the Democrats will agree to a specific date next year on which their package can be brought up for a vote. The Democrats, who hold a better than 3-to-2 majority in the House, will reject this idea, too.
 
Delay Would Be Costly
 The final step is not clear. Whether, without their amendment, enough Republicans will refuse to vote for the savings and loan legislation to defeat the bill is not clear. The Administration has asked for $80 billion more to finish the bailout. Albert V. Casey, president of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is in charge of the bailout, has estimated that a delay in financing the bailout until Congress returns in January would cost taxpayers an additional $300 million to $400 million.
But whatever happens in the end, the days before Thanksgiving are sure to be filled with barbs and jibes about growth and jobs and fairness and all the other words that Republicans and Democrats throw out when they are bickering over the economy.
Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker of the House, left no doubt today that he and other Democrats would vigorously oppose adding tax cuts or any other amendments to the savings and loan measure.
"There's no chance in my judgment, none, that the R.T.C. can bear burdens other than its own," Mr. Foley told reporters. "What are the chances of this having some forced leverage for other issues? Zero, absolutely zero."
 
Significant Tax Code Change
 Among the Republican proposals are a lower capital gains tax rate, new tax breaks for small businesses and real estate investments, new and more generous rules for individual retirement accounts, a tax-free savings plan for households with incomes of less than $50,000 a year and a repeal of the excise tax on expensive boats, cars and aircraft.
This would amount to a signficant revision of the income tax code, the kind that normally takes Congress a year or two to act on. The measures, many of which would enjoy broad popular support because they would save taxpayers money, are sure to arise again next year, when some kind of tax legislation may be considered.
This year, however, the White House has not even pushed for a capital gains break, the centerpiece of its tax strategy. That is because senior officials like Mr. Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady feared that if they opened the issue of taxes, the Democratic-controlled Congress would produce legislation the Administration could not abide.
Senate Republicans did not participate in this latest sortie. In large part that is because they are a potent force in their own right and can get their way better by striking deals with Democrats rather than attacking them.
In the House, however, the Republicans are such a small minority that their only real strength is making noise and causing trouble.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
Folks, Take My Unemployment Check (Please)

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
At a comedy club on Manhattan's West Side, a favorite fixture for years has been the nights when people from a given walk of life gather to tell jokes about their jobs. Doctors, gravediggers, cabbies, ad executives, plumbers, whatever.
Nights to remember. A bus driver once reported being asked how long will the next bus be -- a common enough, though grammatically murky expression. He replied, "About 19 feet." A dentist said he almost flunked out of dental school because he didn't have enough hair on his arms. Lawyers have flagellated themselves unmercifully, though not nearly enough. 
 But with so many people losing jobs in every walk of life, such vocational fun has worn thin -- not least because the ranks of possible contestants keep thinning. So it was that Cary Hoffman, owner of Stand Up New York at 236 West 78th Street near Broadway, saw the need to confront these bleak economic times. He began a contest to find New York's funniest unemployed person.
Mr. Hoffman characterizes himself as an old-time liberal furious at how little is being done for the jobless. "I became outraged about the lack of outrage," he said.
His plans are to hold monthly contests until the Presidential election or until the unemployment rate dips. The first installment, a preliminary one, was Wednesday night, when an even dozen brand-new comics eagerly debased themselves in front of strangers.
The winner got a T-shirt, said to be brand-new, and a chance to move on to the next level of competition where the prize will be a chance to perform for money. A measly $50, but who's counting?
The emcee got things rolling with some definitions. He said the phrase hardcore unemployed is used to refer to people who watch daytime TV. Entrepreneur was defined as a French word meaning, "My check's no good." He said to call oneself self-employed is "like saying I have an imaginary friend."
Last, he warned the audience to be nice. "The unemployed have a self-esteem problem," he explained. That was a line that nobody laughed at. Jobs are teetering all over this edgy town.
And, indeed, the first contestant, Ed Hagar, began with a request. "Please be gentle," he begged, before lapsing into something of a reverie about his days employed in a shipping room. "I was the Picasso of cardboard," he said to scattered applause.
Christine Petrillo, who used to work in advertising sales, kept the momentum going. She said she lives in a high-rise apartment directly across from an office building, and pulls the shades up each morning. Then she said she dances nude. "If I can't work, why should they?" she asked.
Next up was Dave Weinberg, an erstwhile art director, who announced, "I'm a Street News success story."
Lauri Kay, an unemployed writer, said she has taken to answering the remotest leads, a recent one of which was to be a technical writer for a pharmaceutical company. "Hey, I used to do drugs," she reasoned.
Next came a former usher who couldn't remember his jokes; an unemployed real-estate agent who said her father had sent her picture to Save the Children Foundation in lieu of urgently requested money, and a journalist who knew more about Geraldo than seemed altogether seemly.
Kevin Calloway, a security guard who has been relieved of his badge and gun, said he thought he had developed the perfect line for a job interview: "I know where your children go to school."
Even that hasn't worked.
Sometimes, there seemed to be tears just beneath the laughter. Barry Hauptman, an unemployed sportswriter, began ordinarily enough by saying one of his goals was to dispel the myth that the jobless are lazy. "So I took my pajamas off and came over here," was the punch line.
Things continued to progress pleasantly, with Mr. Hauptman meticulously recounting a claimed former job stamping the expiration date on edible underwear.
But his final remark chilled. "I get to the point where crying is the only alternative," he said.
Similarly, a cabdriver whose career has run out of gas, Jay London, also left poignancy hanging in the blue air. "If you have a nightmare tonight, could you include me?" he asked.
The emcee bounced back to thank the audience for building performers' self-esteem. But he jerked them right back to ground-zero when someone wondered if the losers also got T-shirts. "No, they're losers," was the reply.
The winner was Lauri Kay, the writer. She is well past the point of looking any gift horse in the mouth. "I have something to wear to my next job interview," she said appreciatively.

HEADLINE: O'Casey of 1923: Not Dated Yet

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Last summer in Belfast, Northern Ireland, a 13-year-old girl sorrowfully approached one of the actors of the O'Casey Theater Company after a performance of "The Shadow of a Gunman," Sean O'Casey's 1923 play, which uses exuberant humor and soaring language to evoke the human tragedy of the 1919-1921 bloodletting between the British and the Irish.
"The girl said to me, 'Isn't it terrible that nothing has changed,' " recalled the actor, Niall Buggy, who portrays Seumas Shields, a sharp-tongued Dubliner and onetime revolutionary. The play opens on Monday at the Symphony Space, at Broadway and 95th Street in Manhattan, for a two-week run. It is the first production of the newly formed O'Casey company, which has arrived in New York on its inaugural American tour. 
 "The Shadow of a Gunman" is the story of a struggling writer, Donal Davoren, the roommate of Seumas Shields, whom the neighbors believe to be a gunman. He encourages their interest, especially when he wins the admiration of a pretty neighbor, Minnie Powell, but this fantasy puts him, and Minnie, on a collision course with the British Black and Tan forces.
Most plays of this age are creaking theatrical antiques, "but we quickly realized that this play wasn't a bit dated," said Richard Holmes, one of the American actors in the troupe. Others come from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
 
Combatants in the Audience
 Shivaun O'Casey, who is directing her father's play, said after a performance in Boston: "There are so many similarities between the situation in the play and in Northern Ireland -- the intolerance and strife. On opening night in Belfast, where the sound of the stage-effect explosions always startle audiences, there was the sound of a real explosion outside."
"Shadow" began its American tour in Boston, was in Pittsburgh last week, and is traveling to Philadelphia and Washington after its New York run.
In Newry, the Northern Ireland town where the O'Casey company is based, the police were advised that rifle shots and bombs would be going off during the play. "When the explosion went off in the second act, the people flinched -- they thought it was a real bomb," said Ian Fitzgibbon, who plays Donal Davoren.
The play may have even been attended by a fair number of combatants on both sides in the struggle. "One day we were invited to a reception," Mr. Fitzgibbon recalled, "and I said, 'So, where are all these gunmen that are supposed to be everywhere?' And the man with me said: 'Oh, didn't you know? You've already met three of them.' "
Pauline Flanagan, who plays Mrs. Grigson, a neighbor of Donal Davoren, said, "Doing this play was very daring in the north."
Although O'Casey himself was a Protestant, and the play's message is one of peace, Ms. Flanagan said that the subject matter of "Shadow" was risky in the atmosphere of tension between the Irish Republican Army and British soldiers in Newry.
The actors and their director were not sure how audiences would react to a play that came so close to portraying the crisis of their own lives, but the company received an enthusiastic response from audiences. These included republicans, unionists and people from all walks of life. Often they applauded after every scene.
"I think the play was a catharsis," said Stephen Gabis, who plays an auxiliary policeman in the play.
One purpose of the company is to transcend Ireland's boundaries, said the 52-year-old Ms. O'Casey, who founded it last year and established it in Newry, an old manufacturing city at the foot of the Mourne mountains in County Down near the border with the Irish Republic. Her partner is Sally de Sousa, an international festival producer. "
 
Widespread Support
 The O'Casey company has been supported by a consortium of government agencies, local and international businesses, foundations and hundreds of individuals on both sides of the Irish border, as well as contributors from the United States. The townfolk in Newry hope the troupe will serve as a catalyst for tourism and economic growth by training and employing young people from both sides of the border in theater arts. Local youths serve as trainees in set construction, scene painting, carpentry, lighting and sound.
The company's first performance was in a 500-seat space in Newry Town Hall on Sept. 18, the 27th anniversary of Sean O'Casey's death. The company then toured five northern and southern Irish cities with "The Shadow of a Gunman" and "The Shadow of O'Casey," a documentary theater piece celebrating the playwright's life and work that will be performed in two New York matinees, Dec. 5 and 7.
Working with O'Casey's daughter "was like being taken into the family," said Mr. Buggy, whose last name is pronounced as might be expected and whose first name, Niall, sounds like "nile." He is best known to New York audiences for his much-praised performance in the Manhattan Theater Club production of the Brian Friel play "Aristocrats" in 1989.
"I do have a knowledge of what Sean wanted his plays to be like, because we shared an awful lot of thoughts about the theater together," said Ms. O'Casey, who studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, toured England and America at the age of 18 with the Dublin Players and worked at the Bristol Old Vic.
She said she strongly believes that the spareness and economy of the play, which scholars have said influenced the work of Samuel Beckett, is best served by keeping it in a single room. "Sometimes directors open the play up and take it outside, but the sense of place is very important to the play. It's a small masterpiece, not an enormous canvas."
She also objects to productions in which the characters are made to look like coarse, cruel brutes, wearing dirty costumes on a delapidated set. "That's a very middle-class attitude about the poor," she said. "But most of the people in the situation my father described had their dignity about them. They wore the cleanest clothes they could and kept their flat as tidy as possible."
 
A Force for Peace
 What would O'Casey have thought of the production? "I think he would have loved it," said Doreen Keogh, another member of the company. She toured with O'Casey in England during the first production of his play "The Purple Dust" in 1953. "He would have felt so happy about the community participation in Newry, and the fact that Shivaun is directing it. But most of all he would have liked the fact that his play could be a force for peace."

HEADLINE: Sonny Werblin, an Impresario of New York's Sports Extravaganza, Is Dead at 81

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
David A. (Sonny) Werblin, the sports and entertainment impresario who upstaged his entire stunning career by luring Joe Namath to the struggling New York Jets in 1965, died Thursday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 81 years old.
Mr. Werblin, who had homes in New York, Miami and Rumson, N.J., died of a heart attack, his wife said yesterday. 
 In a career that spanned more than 50 years and included almost as many professional successes, Mr. Werblin became an agent with the Music Corporation of America in the 1930's and later built its television division into such a dominating behemoth that it ran afoul of the nation's antitrust laws. The company represented clients like Elizabeth Taylor, Johnny Carson and Ronald Reagan and put together television hits like the Ed Sullivan and Jackie Gleason shows.
 
Other Arenas
 In his later career in sports, Mr. Werblin at one time or another owned a share of the Monmouth Park race track, ran Madison Square Garden and rejuvenated moribund Knicks and Rangers teams. In his crowning achievement, he created the $340 million Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey, which has become one of the nation's premier sports venues.
But for a generation of sports fans in New York and for football fans across the nation, nothing Mr. Werblin ever accomplished could compare with what he did in January 1965, when as president and part-owner of an American Football League franchise renamed the New York Jets, he put the Broadway in Broadway Joe.
The $427,000 Mr. Werblin spent to induce Namath, the acclaimed quarterback from the University of Alabama, to pass up the established National Football League in favor of the much-maligned American Football League transformed professional football.
Or, as Mr. Werblin's longtime friend Howard Cosell put it yesterday, "He single-handedly changed the face of sports in America."
 
Lift for the A.F.L.
 The three-year deal was not all in cash and included money for two of Mr. Namath's brothers, who were hired as scouts. But the sum, by far the biggest ever paid to a collegian to turn pro up to that time, captured the imagination of the nation's fans, helped make the flamboyant Mr. Namath into a national celebrity and represented the emergence of the A.F.L. as a force to be reckoned with.
Although the contract seemed stunning in 1965, Mr. Namath was not the Jet with the highest annual salary. And after adjusting for inflation, the $427,000 would translate today to $1.86 million, well below what elite sports stars are making.
"He knew the value of the fan and the star system," Mr. Namath said yesterday, recalling Mr. Werblin as an employer who became a close friend. "Over the years, he adopted me. He made sure I was getting along well. He told me to get to know New York, that it was the greatest city."
Mr. Werblin, who together with several partners had paid $1 million for the languishing New York Titans franchise, drew on his theatrical experience to explain the significance of the Namath contract: "A million-dollar set is worthless if you put a $2,000 actor in the main role."
Eighteen months later, after Namath proved in his first season both on and off the field that he was worthy of his pay, the N.F.L. agreed to a merger and the Super Bowl was created as an annual championship game, initially between the leagues and since 1970 between the top teams in the American Football Conference and National Football Conference.
In one of the crueler twists of Mr. Werblin's career, by the time Namath led the Jets to their famous upset victory over the Baltimore Colts in the third Super Bowl, in Miami in 1969, the man who built the championship team was no longer an owner of the team.
His partners, including Leon Hess, the chairman of the Amerada Hess Corporation, had become so miffed at all the attention paid to Mr. Werblin that they bought him out before the start of the 1968 season, paying him $1.2 million for a share that had cost him $250,000.
 
Grew Up in Flatbush
 Mr. Werblin, whose father was a founder of a successful paper-bag company, was fond of talking about his early years in Flatbush, where his mother, to honor the oldest of her three sons, called him Sonny, thereby planting the seed for what Mr. Cosell acknowledged yesterday was one of the most memorable sobriquets the broadcaster ever lifted from Variety: "David A. 'Sonny' (as in Money) Werblin."
David Abraham Werblin was born in Flatbush on March 17, 1910. As a Jew he relished the fact of having been born on St. Patrick's Day. The Jets' colors, green and white, were bestowed on the team "because they're my colors," he once explained.
He played high school football at Erasmus Hall and James Madison and went to college at Rutgers University. But he injured his shoulder as a freshman and never played college football.
In 1932, a year after his college graduation, and following a stint as a copy boy at The New York Times, he joined M.C.A., the huge talent agency, and was soon pioneering the practice of packaging talent, invariably his clients, into single productions.
A movie producer, for example, might need a singer and Mr. Werblin would agree to provide one -- if a band, which he also represented, also was hired. He sometimes provided the bulk of the cast of movies.
 
Married in 1938
 While he moved toward the top as a show-business agent, he met the singer for Phil Harris's band, Leah Ray Hubbard, who performed under the name Leah Ray. They were married on March 27, 1938.
In 1951, Mr. Werblin became president of M.C.A.-TV, and it became so successful that it began producing its own shows and providing the talent for them as well as others, including "Wagon Train, "My Three Sons," "Bachelor Father" and "The Virginian." The enterprise was so successful in establishing a virtual monopoly that the Justice Department eventually forced it to break up into several divisions.
As an agent, Mr. Werblin, whose own M.C.A. stock was once valued at $11 million, was something of a visionary. In addition to negotiating one of Johnny Carson's early lucrative contracts, for example, he also helped establish a line of Johnny Carson clothing that made millions for both men.
Despite his own accomplishments and his famous, often flamboyant, clients and friends, Mr. Werblin remained straightforward and direct, even self-effacing, not to mention understated. When someone, inquiring about a client, asked, "What's Elizabeth Taylor really like?" Mr. Werblin got to the point. "Short," he replied. "Very short."
 
Stranger to 'Retire'
 When he finally left M.C.A. in 1965, the headline in Variety read, "Mr. Show Business Retires."
"Retired" was hardly the word. By then, Mr. Werblin was well on his way to becoming Mr. Sports.
Two years earlier, he and his other partners in the Monmouth race track, including Mr. Hess, bought the Titans for a nominal $1 million, nominal because almost no money changed hands. The new owners merely assumed the team's debt.
When Mr. Werblin sold his share in the remamed Jets in 1968, it was also not a retirement.
 
'Greatest Thrill'
 By 1970, he was back near the top of a sport once again when he had a highly touted colt, Silent Screen, in the Kentucky Derby. The 3-year-old had the lead in the stretch, but faltered and finished fifth. Still, Mr. Werblin described that brief moment as "my greatest thrill in sports."
Within a year he became head of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, luring his old football rival, the Giants, across the river. Yet, no sooner was the Meadowlands complex built than he left in 1977 to take over Madison Square Garden, whose Knicks and Rangers had started a downward spiral after great success in the late 1960's and early 1970's.
Although the formula was less successful this time, Mr. Werblin again spent money freely to acquire big names. Despite some success, neither club was able to sustain winning campaigns and after a degree of upheaval and several coaching changtes, Mr. Werblin relinquished active control of the Garden in 1984 but remained as chairman of the MSG Corporation.
He remained active with one of his early loves, Rutgers, and not only was a major fund-raiser for the school but also worked diligently in upgrading its athletic teams. A new, $18.5 million recreation complex on the university's Busch campus in Piscataway was named after him last month.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Werblin is survived by two sons, Thomas and Robert. According to friends, a third son, Hubbard, died earlier this week, but Mr. Werblin was not told.

HEADLINE: Tougher Rules On Fuel Are Set For California

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The California Air Resources Board voted yesterday to adopt new standards on gasoline that will require the most significant changes in fuel since the Federal Government ordered the removal of lead from gasoline nearly 20 years ago.
The board said the new fuel would be "the world's cleanest," reducing the emissions of smog-forming chemicals by 30 percent to 40 percent compared with current blends. 
 By most estimates, the cleaner fuel will add 15 to 20 cents to the cost of a gallon of gasoline, which is likely to be passed on to the consumer eventually.
 
Eastern States Are Watching
 Oil companies say yesterday's 6-to-1 vote by the Air Resources Board, which regulates activities that pollute the air in California, is being closely watched by Eastern states. Those states have already said they will adopt California's new auto emissions standards.
The rules adopted yesterday are to take effect in California in 1996. Small refiners get an extra two years to meet the requirements.
The rules, which do not require further government approval, build on less stringent standards that take effect in January.
Most oil companies oppose the standards because they fear they will bear a large portion of the cost.
But George H. Babikian, president of the ARCO Products Company, California's largest gasoline marketer, said he favored the change. "I'm proud of the Air Resources Board," he said in a telephone interview shortly after the vote. "They took some heat, but they did the right thing."
Mr. Babikian said that the new fuel would meet the Federal standards into the next century and that while the expense would be substantial, it would damage the economy of the state far less than trying to remove an equivalent amount of pollutants from other sources. The investment will "jump start this economy," he said.
He said the ARCO refinery in Los Angeles, which produces more than 10 million gallons a day, would spend $700 million to $800 million on the refinery to meet the requirement.
California regulators have tried to minimize that cost by describing it as being about half a cent for each mile a motorist drives, compared with an average motorist's overall cost of driving of 38 cents per mile, including fuel, aintenance and the purchase price of the vehicle.
But oil companies have argued that the collective cost is in the tens of billions. The cost of pollution control measures is typically measured in the dollars required to remove a ton of pollutants from the air. Texaco, arguing against the changes that the board made, put the cost at $500,000 per ton. Previous pollution control measures like smokestack controls on factories cost $5,000 to $10,000 a ton.
"I think the American people lost," said the chairman of Texaco, James Kinnear. "What they've done is very bad for the economy of California and bad for the economy of the United States. This country is in a recession. What we need is some productive investments."
Cleaning up "stationary sources" of pollution, from factories and other areas, would be cheaper, he said.
Mr. Kinnear complained that the delay in the standards for small refineries would destroy the refining industry. If small refineries can sell gasoline that cost 15 to 20 cents less to produce, he said, big refiners will have to meet the small refiners' price, and will be unable to recoup the cost of their investments.
The motor vehicle standards could easily have an effect far beyond California. The District of Columbia and all the East Coast states from Virginia to Maine with the exception of Connecticut, have agreed in recent weeks to adopt them.
Those states have not yet said what they will do about fuel, and they do not have to act together. But the oil industry is persuaded that those states will eventually conclude that to get the full benefit from cleaner cars, they should also require the cleaner fuel.
As a result, the oil companies that market nationally vigorously fought the proposal the Air Resources Board accepted. The exceptions were ARCO, a regional oil company that does most of its business in California, and Ultramar, which is also centered in California.
But the California standards could have an influence in another way, said Michael J. Bradley, the executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, an organization of state air pollution control officials from the New England states, New York and New Jersey. California's action may convince the Federal Government to adopt a similar fuel for polluted areas nationwide. In that case, the Eastern states would not have to take any action, he said.
Alternatively, Mr. Bradley said, the Eastern states might tinker with the California fuel to suit their own needs. For example, the California specifications call for a gasoline that is highly resistant to evaporation, but weather conditions in the Northeast are less severe, making such a strict limit on evaporation less necessary. The eight states in Mr. Bradley's organization moved jointly in 1988 to require more evaporation-resistant gasoline, thus becoming the largest state coalition thus far to take action on fuel.
Independent of California, the Clean Air Act amendments passed by Congress last year require the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to issue new standards to take effect in 1995 for gasoline used in polluted areas. The California requirements are far more stringent, however.

HEADLINE: For New York's Businesses, Time of Wrenching Changes

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Businesses in the New York City region that are waiting for a national recovery to lift them out of their doldrums are looking in the wrong direction, several economists say. The downturn here, they say, has less to do with the nationwide slump than with the wrenching changes being forced on many of the industries for which the city is a center.
The large New York banks have watched new competitors from both their own and other industries, often based elsewhere, come into fields they have traditionally dominated. Television broadcasters have been hurt by deregulation, which forces them to compete against cable and other media companies for audiences and advertising dollars. 
 And New York's plethora of firms that specialize in accounting, law, public relations and advertising have all suffered from the shrinkage of publicly owned companies during the merger-ridden 1980's, companies that were once their clients.
 
Reinventing Themselves
 Although these industries have already shed thousands of jobs, they may have still further to go.
"They are having to reinvent their industries," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for New York and New Jersey. "So many industries key to New York are in that stage, and we don't have experience as a city with that phenomenon."
Mr. Ehrenhalt calculates that one-quarter of all jobs in the city are in financial, business and professional services. But in the 1980's, those industries generated 56 percent of all job growth. Since their peak in 1988, they have lost 79,600 jobs.
Of course, not every industry in the region is hurting. The health-care and pharmaceutical industries in particular are still growing.
But with so many companies in so many vital industries experiencing a fundamental challenge to their existence, the effect on the local economy has been dramatic. Most recessions since World War II in the New York region have been more moderate than those nationwide, and have generally run for about the same length of time.
This time around, however, the New York region went into its tailspin a full 17 months before the national economy. "That's unprecedented in the post-World War era, and signals that there is something different going on," Mr. Ehrenhalt concludes.
In part, companies in New York are being hurt by an upheaval that reshaped the corporate world in the 80's. Salomon Brothers has estimated that 500 publicly owned companies disappeared from the business horizon from 1985 to 1988 alone, as the result of mergers and the trend of companies to go private. And many of the companies that remain took on large debts to do so.
 
A Muted Recovery?
 The ripple effect is clear. Until they disappeared or became hobbled with debt, those companies were among those that accounting firms audited for, advertising firms wrote snappy jingles for and law firms defended.
The structural changes afflicting some of New York's most important industries suggest that even when the national economy starts to rebound, the salutary effect on the metropolitan region will be muted.
"It's not that New York is impervious to the national economy," said Matthew Drennan, a professor of economics at Cornell University. "But it won't bounce back because of the structural problems."
He predicts that the local economy will not hit bottom until early 1992.
How quickly New York rebounds depends on how far these industries have come in their transformations.
 
Halfway Through?
 In the case of banks, those based in New York City have already shed 12.5 percent of their workforce since 1987, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Despite that, most analysts think there is still a long way to go, and indeed, Citicorp, and Chemical Bank, which recently merged with the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, have already announced another round of layoffs.
Even with their cuts, most of the largest banks still have expenses that are much larger in proportion to their revenues, compared with smaller but fast-growing "super-regional" banks, according to analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "They're only about half to three-quarters of the way through their adjustment," said Robert Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Advertising firms are also still in the throes of restructuring. The industry has been suffering from a steep decline in corporate advertising, which has hurt television networks, publishing companies and public relations agencies as well. According to Robert J. Coen, director of research at McCann-Erickson, the growth rate in ad spending has declined from the low teens in the early 1980's to zero this year.
 
Slow to Cut
 Few new consumer products are being introduced, and companies' debt is discouraging research and development efforts, trends that suggest that advertising spending will not rebound any time soon.
That leaves many of the large publicly held advertising firms that gobbled up many of their smaller competitors during the 1980's with heavy overhead expenses and declining revenues. Just this week, Oglivy & Mather, a division of the WPP Group, announced that it was laying off 7 percent of its New York staff, after layoffs earlier this year.
New York's big accounting firms are privately held, but that has not helped them escape the pressures of change. The industry has been hurt by the shrinking number of public companies that need full audits, and by tax reforms that have reduced the number of shelters and made it harder for many accounting firms to bill as much for tax consulting.
 
The Big 5?
 The growth in the largest firms' revenue has declined from a healthy 16.6 percent in 1988, to an estimated 4.5 percent this year, according to the Atlanta-based Bowman's Accounting Report, which tracks the industry. On top of those problems, of course, is the decline in business from the recession.
Employment has already shrunk in the industry by 5.7 percent since 1988. But Mr. Bowman thinks that when the process is over, there will no longer be the Big Six firms -- already down from the Big Eight -- but simply the Big Five.
Department stores in New York have also been part of the disappearing act. Although New York's famous department stores have long been a treat for locals and tourists alike, over the last few years the industry has suffered severe setbacks unrelated to the national recession.
The final blow for some stores was the heavy debt load they took on during the late 80's wave of mergers and buyouts. The result is plain in the loss of names like B. Altman's, Gimbels and Bonwit Teller.
Employment in the industry has already shrunk an astonishing 40 percent since 1979, and most of the weakest participants have been weeded out, analysts say. "I think the worst is over," said Steven B. Greenberg, president of the Greenberg Group, a Hewlitt, L.I., real-estate adviser to several national retailers.
The one industry that most analysts think has gone through the worst of its adjustment and is emerging intact is the securities business. Wall Street firms have been cutting jobs as quickly as they added them in the boom years. Employment in the industry is down by 18 percent, or 30,000, since it peaked in 1987.
The size of the workforce, however, has finally started to stabilize, and some firms, like Shearson Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch have actually started hiring.

HEADLINE: Letter: On New York City;
Showing Private Business How to Help

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As chairman of the Mayor's Committee for Public-Private Partnerships, I read with great interest "The Business of Business" (editorial, Nov. 2). You correctly state that "individual corporations already provide much direct financial and volunteer aid" to New York City. However, you conclude by saying that many business people "feel they are talking to deaf ears," and that business partners can only help if there is a mutual willingness to hear and act. 
 That willingness is more than exemplified by our pro bono committee. In April 1990, Mayor David N. Dinkins created the Committee for Public-Private Partnerships and the Office of Partnership Programs to match the resources and abilities of the private sector with the right public-sector partner to address some of the city's most pressing needs.
Since that time our committee has helped with more than 100 different partnership projects -- from refurbishing basketball courts with the support of Reebok and the Parks Department to getting the advertising firm of Korey Kay & Partners to assist the city, pro bono, in alerting the public to the current water shortage. The study you cite by Booz, Allen & Hamilton for the Board of Education was a marriage made possible by our staff's bringing the right people together as partners.
Other notable projects our committee helped coordinate include the donation of $10,000 to the New York City Housing Authority's urban gardening program by the Swatch watch company; the renovation of playgrounds at 10 city schools made possible by a donation from J. P. Morgan; the production by the Department of General Services of a free film series called "Street Cinema," in which donated films were projected on building walls in vacant city-owned properties, and an ongoing partnership to increase the level of communication between city government and the foundation community.
Our job also includes bringing greater public attention to successful partnerships. To that end we have participated in more than 50 press events that have announced joint initiatives between the public and private sectors.
Our small operation has established itself as a point of access for the private sector. We know the private sector wants to contribute, but sometimes they just don't know to whom to talk and consequently they get frustrated. That is exactly why the committee was established. Any company or private individual who would like to contribute toward addressing the city's ills should call 212-240-4300. Our ears are open; we want to listen.

Still Disenchanted

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re: "Big Losses for Top 2 in Detroit" (Business Day, Oct. 23): 
 It is easy for American auto makers to blame rebates and the recession for the worst losses in history. The answer is more painful than that. American cars are not as good as Japanese imports.
My husband's family and mine were loyal General Motors car drivers for decades (with an occasional lapse when Studebakers caught everyone's fancy). We remained loyal longer than most of our friends, all of whom are, like us, dedicated Americans. In 1986, when our Buick Century wagon needed a new transmission before it was a year old, and that was just one major nuisance that year, my husband wrote the president of General Motors to warn we were being forced to switch to Japanese cars.
He received some half-hearted response from a regional lackey. No satisfaction was offered. In June 1990 we bought an Acura Legend, which has required no service from the dealer. Our children have also bought Japanese cars and have nothing but pleasure from them. The one child who bought a Ford wagon has had the vehicle back to the dealer several times, which is a nuisance and usually unsatisfactory.
Protective tariffs are not the answer. Quality products are needed. How to recover lost customers is the problem poor quality and service caused.

HEADLINE: 9,900 Jobs To Be Cut By Nynex

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The Nynex Corporation, the provider of local telephone service in New York State and New England, said yesterday that it planned to reduce its work force over the next two years by more than 10 percent, or about 9,900 employees.
The cost of severance pay and early-retirement benefits, plus costs for getting out of the separate businesses of writing computer software in Britain and developing real estate in the Northeast United States, is expected to total more than $500 million. As a result, the company will report a substantial loss for its fourth quarter, instead of the modest profit that had been expected. 
 The layoffs and early retirements are expected to begin in January and end in December 1993, and will further chill the recessionary climate of the New York City metropolitan area, which is home for many of the employees who will lose their jobs.
There are no detailed estimates of how many white-collar employees, known as management workers, will be laid off, or of how many blue-collar employees, known as craft workers, will take advantage of an early-retirement offer.
 
Replacements May Be Hired
 But the Communications Workers of America, Nynex's union, estimates that in New York State 4,000 craft workers and more than 500 management workers may be off the payroll by April. Most of those employees will be in the New York City area. To help replace these experienced workers, at least temporarily, several thousand new permanent and temporary workers may be hired, presumably at lower salaries.
Analysts estimate that the savings from the work-force reduction -- without taking other factors, like inflation, into account -- will amount to roughly $50,000 a year per worker, or $495 million for 9,900 employees.
Like other regional Bell operating companies, Nynex has been struggling to reduce its operating costs as the installation of more advanced equipment, like digital fiber-optic transmission gear, means that fewer employees, both white-collar and blue-collar, are needed. Nynex has also been hurt by competition from smaller, more efficient telecommunications companies that specialize in serving large corporate customers.
Moreover, Nynex has been hurt even more than the other "Baby Bell" companies by the lingering recession, which has been particularly damaging in the Northeast. The downturn has dampened revenue from professionals, who are responsible for the greatest proportion of business phone traffic, both for conversations and for the transmission of text, numbers and images over telephone lines.
Growth in the number of telephone lines and in the minutes of telephone use has slowed considerably in the Northeast.
In the third quarter, the number of Nynex telephone lines rose 1.1 percent, to 15.3 million access lines, half of the average growth rate of 2.2 percent for all of the Baby Bells. The minutes of use by Nynex customers rose 2.9 percent, to 11.8 billion minutes, compared with 4.7 percent growth for all of the Baby Bells.
Nynex, based in White Plains, is the parent of New York Telephone and New England Telephone. As of Oct. 31, it had 91,200 employees, including 59,500 craft employees and 31,700 management employees.
The charge announced yesterday, of $550 million, or $2.73 a share, means the company will have a large loss for the current quarter. Frank J. Governali, a telecommunications analyst with the First Boston Corporation, had estimated before yesterday's announcement that the company would report a fourth-quarter profit of $1.47 a share, or $297 million. The new charge will mean a loss of $253 million instead.
In reaction to news of the fourth-quarter charge, Nynex's stock price fell 87.5 cents a share yesterday, to $75.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Under the Nynex plan, about $395 million of the quarterly charge relates to work-force reductions. And half of that figure stems from early-retirement provisions for craft workers who will leave the payroll by January.
About 6,500 craft workers have announced that they intend to take advantage of an early-retirement offer. Although some 20,000 workers qualify for some form of early retirement, Nynex has set aside enough money for only 10,000, which is considered the likely upper limit for retirements.
As part of an unusual early negotiation of a union contract, announced in September, Nynex agreed to expand retirement pay by changing certain assumptions in the pension plan, like years of service.
Most of the reductions of white-collar employees will come from layoffs. Nynex plans to reduce the number of management employees by 1,900 by April, and by up to 1,500 more over the next 24 months.
Nynex also plans to take a $155 million charge against earnings for restructuring costs.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 25, 1991, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about layoffs at the Nynex Corporation misstated the company's plans for its software-writing subsidiary in Britain. Nynex is consolidating several offices of its BIS Group in London. It does not plan to terminate its operations.

HEADLINE: Credit Cards: Variable Rates Don't Always Help

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Congressional efforts to cap interest rates on credit cards have ground to a halt amid fears that banks might revoke millions of credit cards and drive the economy deeper into recession. Consumers who want good deals -- low interest rates and low annual fees (or none at all) -- will have to continue shopping around.
Some will no doubt be attracted to variable-rate credit cards, which account for about 10 percent of all cards issued, according to Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer advocacy group in Herndon, Va. 
 Such cards are often made to seem like adjustable-rate mortgages, an attractive concept. Rather than being saddled with a fixed interest rate, for instance, the borrower can play the financial market, finding a card that ties its interest rate to a benchmark like the prime rate. When the prime rate goes down, as it has in recent years, the borrower should be the winner. The prime rate is the interest that banks charge their most credit-worthy customers.
 
Borrowers Don't Always Win
 But as some consumers who signed up for variable-rate credit cards are finding out, the borrower does not always win when the prime rate falls. In some instances, the rates on such cards have actually gone up despite the decline in the prime rate over the last year. In other cases, companies offered consumers variable-rate cards to get them signed up and then dropped those plans for fixed rates, which were set higher.
Consumers should not assume that the interest rates on their cards won't decrease as the prime drops. Robert McKinley, the publisher of Ram Research's Cardtrak, a newsletter, in Frederick, Md., warned, "There are a lot of gimmicks and games that companies play with variable rates."
Elgie Holstein, president of the Bankcard Holders group, said, "The concept of a variable rate for a credit card doesn't work anything like an adjustable-rate mortgage."
Consider the case of the Bank of New York, which offers a variable rate on its standard Visa and Mastercard. Early this year, the rate the bank charged on both cards was 16.98 percent. The variable-rate formula used by the bank was based on fluctuations in the interest rate paid on certificates of deposit plus an additional 8 percentage points, said Michael Pascale, a bank spokesman. Rates are adjusted monthly.
Under the plan's terms, the lowest the rate could go was 16.98 percent, even if rates for certificates of deposit dropped further. But on March 1, the interest rate charged by the bank on both cards rose to 18.4 percent. C.D. rates hadn't risen, so how did it happen?
Easily enough. The Bank of New York changed its variable-rate formula to one based on fluctuations in the prime rate plus 8.9 points.
"The effect of the change was to increase the pricing somewhat," Mr. Pascale said. As required, the bank notified all customers in advance of the change, he said. The bank also let those who wished to close their accounts pay balances at the old rate. The rate on both cards recently dropped back to 16.98 percent.
The Bank of New York is by no means the only lender to reshuffle its formula as interest rates drop. American Express, for example, has changed the ground rules on its Optima card twice in recent months.
 
Rising Surcharge on Optima Rate
 In December, interest on an Optima card was 15.75 percent. The formula used by American Express was the prime rate plus a surcharge of 5.75 points.
Since January, the prime rate has fallen by 2.5 percentage points, to 7.5 percent from 10 percent. But interest charged by American Express on its Optima card rose to 16.75 percent in January and is now 16.25 percent. The changes occurred because American Express raised its surcharge to 6.75 points in January and then to 7.75 points in October; it adjusts its Optima rate twice a year.
Maureen Bailey, a spokeswoman for American Express, said customers were alerted to the changes, and added hat the rate currently charged is still below that charged by many companies that use fixed rates. The current national average on fixed-rate cards is 18.98 percent.
But Mr. McKinley of the Cardtrak newsletter said that if American Express had not changed the formula, Optima holders would now be paying about 13.75 percent interest. Based on an average $2,400 monthly balance, the typical Optima holder will pay an added $60 in interest this year as a result of the changes, he said.
The rate on another popular card, the A.T.&T Universal card, has fallen to 16.4 percent from 18.4 percent for most customers, said Bruce Reid, a company spokesman, and to 17.4 percent from 19.4 for others, Mr. Reid said, adding, "If the prime keeps going down, our rates will keep going down." The Universal card has no interest-rate floor.
Mr. McKinley said he is concerned that as interest rates continue to fall, lenders will begin to change variable-rate formulas more often.
"When card rates start dropping issuers start to get nervous," he said.

HEADLINE: Sununu Says Bush 'Ad-Libbed' Comment on Credit Card Rates

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22

 BODY:
John H. Sununu, the beleaguered White House chief of staff, said today that President Bush was responsible for the remark about credit card interest rates that started a chain of events and sent the stock market skidding last Friday.
Mr. Sununu's comments in a television interview to be broadcast this weekend seemed aimed at heading off the mounting pressure for his removal. 
 This latest development in the public drama over Mr. Sununu's survival at the White House came as many Republicans speculated that Mr. Bush had privately decided to replace his chief of staff and was waiting for the right moment. There was also a general sense that Mr. Sununu had been caught up in one of those capital controversies that have proved fatal to other Washington figures.
Mr. Sununu said Mr. Bush "ad-libbed" the remark about credit cards. The remark added to the impression that Mr. Bush is confused about how to handle the economy.
 
Sununu's Account Rebutted
 Late today, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, rebutted a crucial part of Mr. Sununu's account. He said the credit card proposal, included in a political speech in New York on Nov. 12, was "the President's idea." But he said the remarks were in the President's text, not ad-libbed as Mr. Sununu said.
This public back and forth between a President and his top aide has few parallels in recent Washington history, and it came at a time when most major newspapers have been publishing articles about the torrent of advice from top Republicans urging Mr. Bush to dismiss the combative former Governor of New Hampshire.
Mr. Sununu's latest account, in an interview on "John McLaughlin's One on One" television program, to be broadcast on WRC-TV in Washington at noon on Sunday and on PBS stations elsewhere at varying times, conflicted with earlier accounts from the Administration.
Administration officials said the credit card notion came from Kenneth M. Duberstein, a White House chief of staff under President Ronald Reagan, and that Mr. Sununu had talked to Mr. Bush about it before he delivered the speech. They said Mr. Sununu wrote the lines about credit cards.
Even if Mr. Sununu did not write Mr. Bush's specific words, his comments today represented an extraordinary attempt by an aide under fire to shift the political heat to his boss.
Publicly, the White House and Mr. Sununu himself said today that his job was secure and that Mr. Bush had no plans to replace him.
But Administration officials and Republican Party strategists said Mr. Bush was under increasing pressure to move Mr. Sununu aside as he nears the time when he would have to announce the formation of his re-election campaign team.
 
Challenges From Far Right
 Although Mr. Bush had been widely expected to name his campaign team in January, there is increasing evidence that he will move the date up to December, when the process begins for choosing delegates that will be on the ballot in the New Hampshire primary.
Mr. Bush went to the Presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., for the weekend, and Mr. Fitzwater said the President would discuss by telephone with his advisers the campaign and administrative concerns.
Mr. Bush, who thought just a few weeks ago that he would be unopposed in New Hampshire, now faces the possibility of two challenges from the far right, from Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, and State Representative David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader and neo-Nazi who lost last Saturday's race for governor in Louisiana.
The problem Mr. Bush is facing, Republican strategists said today, is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to build a campaign structure around Mr. Sununu, especially when the President's political ground seems so shaky.
"If Sununu's the problem, the solution cannot be a new campaign structure or other bright people doing things outside the White House," said one Republican. "The solution has to be to make a change inside the White House.
At the White House, aides said Mr. Sununu's political difficulties had cast a pall over Mr. Bush's efforts to deal with criticism that he was not paying enough attention to domestic issues. One official described the attention to Mr. Sununu as "very frustrating."
At a campaign fund-raiser in New York last week, Mr. Bush said in a speech that he had been talking to business people recently and thought that it would spur the economy if banks lowered the interest they charge on credit cards.
That remark prompted Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, to introduce legislation, which was passed by the Senate, to put a legal limit on those rates. Last Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average, which tracks 30 of the nation's leading companies, fell 120.31 points, the largest plunge in more than two years. The credit card issue was blamed by many analysts for the plunge.
In his interview with Mr. McLaughlin, Mr. Sununu said the idea was "never in" any text of Mr. Bush's speech. "The President ad-libbed," Mr. Sununu said.
 
'Dead Wrong'
 In the interview, Mr. Sununu also said his relationship with the Bush family was warm and that after The New York Times reported that Barbara Bush was souring on him, the President's wife made a point of seeking him out and made him "very, very comfortable." The Wall Street Journal said in a front-page article today that "even Barbara Bush is said to be convinced that the former New Hampshire Governor's 'flaws are fatal.' "
Although Mr. Bush has a record of resisting outside pressure of this kind, in the high-stakes world of White House politics, it is an article of faith that a senior official like Mr. Sununu can stand only so many political body blows before his downfall becomes inevitable.
In his interview, Mr. Sununu also denied that he had called Ann Devroy, the White House correspondent for The Washington Post, a "liar" in a widely reported confrontation on the lawn of the Rose Garden after Mr. Bush signed the 1991 Civil Rights Act on Thursday.
Ms. Devroy said on Thursday and again today after hearing of Mr. Sununu's comments that he shouted at her: "You're a liar! Your stories are all lies! Everything you write is a lie!"
Asked by Mr. McLaughlin about the exchange, Mr. Sununu said: "Well, I told her that everything she had written recently was dead wrong. There's a difference."

HEADLINE: As 'Steamtown' Grows, So Does Parks Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCRANTON, Pa., Nov. 22

 BODY:
A $73- million Federal project to build a theme park meant to recreate the age of steam locomotives in a decrepit railroad yard here has touched off an extraordinary debate over the changing mission of the National Park Service.
Members of Congress, which has become more and more involved in setting priorities for the Park Service over the past decade, say the park, called the Steamtown National Historic Site, could help revive the depressed economy of this northeastern Pennsylvania region by drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. 
 "The bottom line," said Representative Joseph M. McDade, a Republican who has represented Scranton in Congress for almost 30 years, "is that we have the opportunity to create and display to the world a highly important era in the history of our nation."
But a number of historians and museum curators around the nation call Steamtown a second-rate collection of trains on a third-rate site. They say that while such historic recreations have a place, the Federal Government should not be financing them simply because influential members of Congress want them for their districts.
And officials of the National Park Service, in interviews over the past week, said Steamtown and other such Congressionally mandated projects were diverting the agency from its historic mission of preserving and maintaining great national parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone.
 "It is the most serious problem we face in the next 10 years," said James M. Ridenour, director of the Park Service. "We're spending lots of money creating new parks, which may or may not be of national significance."
Not all historians dismiss the Steamtown project. "The person who finds his way to Steamtown will have an excellent and enjoyable experience," said Walter P. Gray, director of the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento, though he added that the money could have been better spent on rail preservation projects elsewhere.
And others point out that industrial restoration efforts have been successful elsewhere. Since 1978, the Park Service has spent $23 million restoring textile mills, canals and worker housing at the widely acclaimed Lowell National Historical Park in Lowell, Mass.
But Mr. Ridenour said that too many restoration efforts "were pork-barrel projects that the Park Service neither wanted nor needed," and he added: "Many of these proposals are great ideas, but they should not all be lodged in the National Park Service. Tourism is not our mission."
The director said the agency had been forced to administer an increasing number of such projects since 1981. In that year, the Reagan Administration sought to rein in the agency's spending and Congress responded by providing the agency with hundreds of millions of unrequested dollars every year for construction projects that the members earmarked for their own states and districts.
 
Hurting Established Parks?
 But the Park Service's operating budget has not been increasing at the same rate, and its officials complain that the proliferation of new sites like Steamtown are hurting the older parks, which have postponed maintenance projects worth over $2 billion.
Congress began spending money for Steamtown five years ago at the behest of Mr. McDade, a 15-term Republican from Scranton, who is the ranking minority member on the House Appropriations Committee and a member of the Appropriations subcommittee for the Park Service. Even the Reagan Administration, which had earlier tried to enforce a moratorium on new park development, enthusiastically supported Mr. McDade's proposal.
The provision for the park was inserted into a huge appropriations bill at a late-night meeting near the end of the legislative session in October 1986. Congressional authorizing committees, which are charged with setting policy and reviewing such proposals, were bypassed, and the Park Service did not conduct its customary two-year review of proposed new parks.
Indeed, the agency had earlier rejected a plan to acquire the same collection of trains, then assembled at a site in Vermont that was also called Steamtown, saying it lacked historic importance. The collection "didn't fit our basic mission, to preserve historic sites, actual places that are significant in American history," said Barry MacKintosh, an agency historian.
 
Panel to Vote on Project
 But in Scranton, which has never recovered from the decline of the region's coal mines, such concerns were dismissed as academic hair-splitting. At a subcommittee hearing on Steamtown last month, Representative McDade called one historian a "loser" for criticizing the park.
Congress has appropriated $56 million for the project since 1986. And next Tuesday, the House Interior Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands, is scheduled to vote on legislation that would formally establish Steamtown as a national park and set a $73 million ceiling on development costs, making it the second-most expensive park project in the past 20 years.
The goal is to build a functioning railway yard, almost from scratch, on a 42-acre downtown site that was abandoned by Conrail, the freight railroad, in 1983. By that time the yard had been razed, remodeled and pillaged so many times that there was little to recall the glory days of steam transportation -- 1851 to the late 1940's, when railroads like the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western hauled coal and passengers around this region.
In early 1995, when Steamtown is scheduled for completion, visitors will be able to take excursion rides in refurbished commuter cars and see steam locomotives puffing down rebuilt tracks, being spun around on a new concrete turntable and maintained in a reconstructed roundhouse.
Mayor James P. Connors of Scranton testified at a subcommittee hearing last month that "The Steamtown National Historic Site has already drawn thousands of people to our area and it's only in its infancy."
Markley E. Smith, publisher and editor of Locomotive and Railway Preservation Magazine, said that although he had concerns about the quality of the collection of trains, Steamtown had the potential "to be a leading contribution to railway preservation in North America. "
Because it takes a big labor force to run a railyard, Steamtown's projected annual operating cost is $6.5 million, more than twice the operating budget of 39,000-acre Acadia National Park in Maine. Steamtown's sponsors expect to attract 500,000 visitors a year; Acadia received five million visitors last year.
Along with officials of the Park Service, some members of Congress say such spending priorities distort the agency's mission. Representative Bruce F. Vento, the Minnesota Democrat who is chairman of the panel that is to vote on the Steamtown measure next Tuesday, calls the project "a runaway locomotive." But he added, "It's hard for members to oppose each other's projects."
Some junior members of Congress have sought in vain to halt spending on such projects. This year, Senator Robert C. Smith, a Republican from New Hampshire, introduced a measure to rescind $1 billion appropriated for 325 projects, including Steamtown, but the bill went nowhere.
 
Complaints Over Projects
 Agency officials also complain about many other projects that depart from the service's traditional mission. For example, Congress last year required the service to spend $500,000 on a new local museum in Tennessee and $4.5 million to convert a theater in West Virginia into a four-screen movie house.
The Park Service also had to make the Charles Pinckney Home in Charleston, S.C., into a national park. Then it completed a historical survey concluding that Pinckney, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, died long before the "generic early 19th Century" house was built. The property's annual operating budget is $315,000.
 
Trying to Block Proposals
 Mr. Ridenour, the Park Service director, said the agency planned to make a concerted effort to deflect such proposals. He said the agency might create a separate program that would provide start-up grants and technical assistance in historic preservation to the state and local governments that would run such projects, reducing the burden on the Park Service.
What angers many historians about Steamtown is that there are many railroad collections of far greater historical value rusting away.
"I can't find words strong enough to express my contempt for this whole thing," said Robert M. Vogel, who was curator of mechanical and civil engineering at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History for 30 years before retiring a few years ago.
"There are only a few remnants of structures on the Scranton site," he added, "so they are spending millions of dollars building a Walt Disney movie set that will be absolutely phony from the word go."

LIVES, LIES AND THE IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR
By Ann Wroe.
Illustrated. 341 pp. New York:
I.B. Tauris & Company/
St. Martin's Press. $24.95. 
 THE Iran-contra scandal was so Byzantine, the Congressional investigation of it was so inadequate and the public performances of President Ronald Reagan and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North were so dissembling that most of the American public was left either hopelessly confused or apathetic. Senator William S. Cohen aptly quoted T. S. Eliot to describe his feelings about the affair: "We had the experience but missed the meaning."
The meaning, according to Ann Wroe, the literary editor of The Economist, is that deceit and illegality permeated two of the Reagan Administration's major foreign policy initiatives -- its proxy war on the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua and its haphazard effort to free the Western hostages in Lebanon. In "Lives, Lies and the Iran-Contra Affair" she reproaches not only the Reagan Administration but also the American political culture that produced it. Ms. Wroe writes that the players in the scandal -- from some of the President's closest foreign policy advisers to the private profiteers who moved the weapons and the money between Iran and Nicaragua -- "did not seem to see much correlation between right action and observance of the law."
For this, Ms. Wroe believes President Reagan should have been impeached, and probably would have been, had lying to Congress not become as common in the 1980's as the lobbyist's lunch, had patriotism not become indistinguishable from conservative politics and had the general public not fallen into the same know-nothing lotus-sleep as President Reagan himself.
MS. WROE would be more effective driving home her moral points if her book were not flawed in several fundamental ways. It reveals little about the scandal that is not already in the public record, and it jumps around so much that a reader not previously well versed in the chronology of the scandal can easily become confused. Ms. Wroe, like too many writers who have tackled the mountain of documents that came out of the Tower Commission, the Congressional investigation, the North trial and the special prosecutor's probings, gets lost in the trees. The Iran-contra forest has as many canopies as a dense tropical jungle, but the basic outline comes down to this: The Reagan White House disobeyed an explicit Congressional ban on supplying a guerrilla army in order to make war on the Government of Nicaragua. That the aid was financed by the secret sale of arms to Iran in a vain attempt to buy American hostages out of Lebanon compounded the illegality with foolishness.
Ms. Wroe is especially weak at explaining the Middle Eastern and Central American contexts. Her point that few of the senior American policy makers deciding Nicaragua's future spoke Spanish or understood the country they were attacking has merit. But there is no evidence that she herself has studied Nicaragua. Her description of the contras as purely a creature of the United States, the Frankenstein of the Iran-contra affair, is a simplistic distortion. Many of the contra leaders were corrupt and inept, especially those, perhaps not surprisingly, who depended most on American financial support. But the Nicaraguan counterrevolutionary movement began before the Reagan Administration started financing it, and took root in at least half the country.
In her indefatigable search to root out immoral politics and cynicism, Ms. Wroe ascribes the religious aspects of the contra effort to Washington's manipulations. She states offhandedly that the large numbers of Protestant evangelicals found in the contra camps were "presumably converted by American missionaries while the Catholic priests were away," as if Nicaraguans can't make their own religious choices. As evidence for this claim, she ingenuously quotes from a poem by Ernesto Cardenal, a renegade Roman Catholic priest who, as the Sandinista culture minister, was hardly an objective observer. In fact, the contras attracted widespread support among the conservative peasants of Nicaragua's central highlands, evangelicals and Catholics alike.
Fortunately, for all her moralism, Ms. Wroe does succeed in bringing wit to her subject, and her best writing, describing the plain wackiness of the Reagan White House's shenanigans, has a P. J. O'Rourke flavor. She complains that the American public, if it thinks about the Iran-contra affair at all, remembers it only in terms of Mr. North's testimony, "that piece of film everyone had seen and talked about, like the shooting of JR in Dallas or the opening on Geraldo of Al Capone's secret vault." Perhaps Ms. Wroe's good humor can help perk up interest in this scandal. When the White House breaks the law and conducts war in secret, those actions should attract more lasting attention than J.R.'s shooting.

HEADLINE: Lamar Alexander's Self-Help Course

BYLINE: By Susan Chira; Susan Chira is national education correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
ONE DAY LAST SPRING, WHEN THE SUNLIGHT SPARKLED ON broken glass and Manhattan streets had already begun to smell of summer, Andrew Lamar Alexander Jr., at the age of 51, went to school.
At the Holy Cross School in Hell's Kitchen, children in magenta plaid uniforms sang for the new Secretary of Education, stood up when he entered their classrooms, and greeted him in singsong unison. Later, the tall, soft-spoken Alexander sat with the principal and superintendent and pulled out a green spiral notebook. "Is there anything I ought to know?" he asked, and took notes as the Catholic educators described how much the school's largely working-class parents would benefit from his proposal to let taxes pay for Catholic school tuition. 
 The approach was vintage Lamar Alexander -- understated, unaffected, purposeful and quietly subversive. It may have seemed like a routine visit for a Secretary of Education, but Alexander was pushing the most controversial idea in the President's plan to transform American schools -- "choice," or vouchers that would let parents apply tax dollars toward the cost of whatever public or private school they chose. The hope is that market competition will force schools to improve.
Presiding over dozens of school visits, press events and community rallies, Lamar Alexander has swept into office like a whirlwind after the lassitude of his predecessor, Lauro F. Cavazos. In his first eight months, Alexander has drawn up a new education plan, jetted around the country promoting it and recruited a highly respected team at the Education Department, including his deputy, David T. Kearns, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Xerox, and Diane Ravitch, an Assistant Secretary who is an outspoken advocate of academic rigor.
Alexander is embarking on the most important sales pitch of his career: convincing Americans that their schools are in trouble, and that they alone can fix them. President Bush, under attack for ignoring domestic issues in general and his pledge to be the "education president" in particular, is counting on his Education Secretary for results he can trumpet during his re-election bid. Success in this risky undertaking could boost Alexander's political profile -- many of his friends believe he wants to be President. But he is betting his national prospects on improving education, a goal that has defeated generations of reformers before him. Now Alexander must persuade the country that his education strategy is more than an empty public relations exercise.
America's education crisis is really two crises: the mediocre performance of most students and the complete failure of others in many inner-city schools. Alexander's plan addresses the first far better than the second.
By training and temperament, Alexander is well suited to attack the first problem: shaking up a complacent public and spurring parents to take responsibility for improving their children's schools. He comes armed with a strong resume as an education reformer acquired as a Republican governor of Tennessee and president of its state university system. Friends and enemies alike call him a brilliant salesman and politician with a sure populist touch.
Alexander wants to lead what he calls a "populist crusade," one that subverts the education establishment and incites people to get so angry about school failure that they will force through real changes. "Too many people say the nation's at risk but I'm O.K.," he tells his audiences around the nation.
In the speech he gives as he barnstorms the country he asks American communities to consider these questions: "If you weren't already doing it, would you let children out of school in the afternoon to go home to empty houses? Would you let teachers off in the summer to bring in the crops? Would you have the playground locked in a city when boys and girls need somewhere to play at night? Would you have classrooms that had teachers without a telephone? Would you continue to have buildings that are almost untouched by the technological revolution of the last 20 years?"
The plan he endorses, however, ignores the poverty at the heart of many inner-city school problems. It does not provide much money for innovative programs, although Alexander pushed through the biggest tax increase in Tennessee history to pay for education when he was governor. In the end, Alexander draws his vision of what American education can be from his own roots in a small, cohesive town, a world apart from the ravaged neighborhoods of the inner city.
Faced with such criticisms, Alexander remains, as ever, affable. He does not betray anger, and he does not betray himself. He resists detailed debate on issues, offering instead a series of well-crafted political set pieces. This composure can be infuriating to the questioner who tries to pin him down, or to find the cracks in his smooth persona. He approaches fans and critics alike with a grave, earnest, butter-wouldn't-melt-in-my-mouth demeanor. He has an air of determined reasonableness, as if he is leaning over the back fence chatting with his neighbor and can't understand why anyone would ever disagree. His is a consistent, carefully cultivated, folksy image that he insists is the truest reflection of himself and his East Tennessee roots.
While his admirers praise his ability to reach and persaude the public, his detractors call him a politician of the sound-bite era, better at symbol than substance. Either way, the success of the education reform will be Lamar Alexander's crucible in public life. And the question remains: Is his vision enough to save all American schools?
THE TENNESSEE CITY of Maryville is dotted with churches and ringed by the Great Smoky Mountains. When Lamar Alexander was growing up in the 1940's and 50's, the town had fewer than 7,000 people, and most of them made it their business to know his.
When he was in first grade and crossed the street on an errand for his mother, a neighbor called her to say she thought it wasn't safe. When the young Lamar was paddled in school for leading fellow ninth graders in a chorus of whooshing noises every time the teacher opened the window, he got in trouble all over again at home. This vision of small-town America, of communities, families and schools working together to celebrate achievement and enforce discipline, shapes the education plan Alexander is selling.
Accompanied occasionally by President Bush, he began criscrossing the country this fall to enlist "America 2000" communities that pledge to act to force radical change in schools. The President is proposing voluntary national tests to enforce high standards and shatter illusions by showing how students and schools really rank nationwide. To create models of excellence and get communities involved in thinking about education, the President charged business leaders to raise $150 million to help found at least 535 "break the mold" schools, designed by local groups with help from a team of experts. To force schools to change through competition with each other, even between private and parochial schools, the plan endorses choice and calls on Congress to allow Federal money for disadvantaged children to follow them to any school. The total price tag: $690 million.
There are few definite deadlines for action, which depends largely on local communities. Dozens of towns have already begun "America 2000" efforts. Design teams for the 535 "break the mold" schools are to be selected by next spring, and the first of the voluntary national tests are supposed to be given to fourth graders in the fall of 1993.
The plan raises several provocative ideas, like national standards and national testing. This strategy puts the focus squarely on public attitudes, which must change before schools can. The proposal issues a long-overdue challenge to families, who have too long blamed teachers for problems that are rooted in the home. In the American tradition of local control of education, the plan leaves many important decisions to individual communities.
But the plan shirks what have traditionally been Federal responsibilities -- like poverty, equity or desegregation. There are no specific ideas to combat the social ills that have destroyed in many areas the safe, disciplined world that Alexander knew. The grinding poverty that blights many children's lives and prospects of school success is not addressed. There is not enough money for health care or preschool classes like Head Start (a documented winner) that would help children be ready for school, one of the national education goals. The proposal does not talk about extensive teacher training or recruitment or the gap between rich and poor schools. Many educators fear that the plan's endorsement of choice essentially gives up on the idea of public education. Nor is it clear how the plan would transform entire school systems, rather than individual schools.
These omissions have drawn passionate criticism. "Is war over a desert sheikdom more important than the destruction of a million children?" says Jonathan Kozol, author of "Savage Inequalities: Children in America's Schools," a book about the gap between rich and poor schools. "No goal calls for equal education for rich and poor children. No goal breathes a whisper of the abiding American embarrassment of racial segregation. I feel bewildered, heartsick, that it is politically possible to omit what ought to be the two most pressing ethical goals of a just society."
Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, a Democrat who has led the governors' efforts to reform education and who has worked closely with Alexander, says that he applauds parts of the plan, but that it is not enough. "It's dangerous to answer the concerns of the nation with glib generalities," he says. "There are 110,000 schools out there right now that cannot wait. There are 30 states in a deficit position, cutting back, and we're dancing around the tent."
BY FAR THE MOST vociferous opposition has come on the voucher issue, the idea Alexander was plugging when he visited the Holy Cross School in New York. The presidents of the two national teachers' unions have bitterly attacked the plan, primarily because they fear parents will take their vouchers from public to private schools, leaving public schools short of money to teach those students who are either too handicapped or too disruptive to be accepted at private schools. Many educators who applaud the idea of choice still worry that children in the most desperate shape, those whose parents are indifferent or unable to choose the best schools, will end up stranded in the worst schools.
Alexander's friends say they believe that, if he could, he would spend more money on education, as he did when he was governor. In the tradition of most Tennessee Republicans, Alexander has consistently displayed a moderate, pragmatic bent, but now he is part of an administration that must satisfy a vocal and powerful right wing. That is the reason, some of his friends believe, Alexander pushes choice so hard.
Alexander offers a spirited defense of his plan, exhibiting his sometimes exasperating calmness and ability to skirt the details for the big picture. With an air of bland surprise, he says over and over again that he cannot understand why choice is an issue at all, because this is America and people can choose anything they like, so why not schools? Or, without raising his voice, he attacks doubters as elitist. To those who charge that the plan ignores the poor, he paints himself as their champion.
"What I really think people are saying is that we don't trust poor people to make decisions for themselves," he says. "The truth is, they don't and I do." Most of the criticism has come from educators and politicians, but Alexander is confident he can sell the plan to the voting public.
He sounds Republican themes of small government and faith in local enterprise. The proposal may sound vague, he says, but that is because each community must investigate the problem and come up with its own answers.
"Very few people understand what we're doing with America 2000," he says. "Over time they will. Everybody wants a how-to-do-it book today in American society. Everybody wants to be saved by a TV preacher. But you've got to, in the end, save yourself.
"We don't want to tell people how to have an America 2000 community. It would be silly for me to try to tell a professional educator how to teach a child, but I can help put that professional educator in a different sort of classroom or school where he or she can think about how to reach a much higher standard than we're now reaching. I can help a community introduce itself to reality by reminding them to watch MTV six hours a day like a lot of kids do and see what they think about that. They can go down to the neonatal care center or police station and find out how kids are growing up, sit in the back of a classroom for three hours and come to their own conclusions. It's frustrating to lots of people because after a while it hands them the ball. Leadership does point the way, but it doesn't walk for you."
ALEXANDER'S LEADERSHIP style, forged in his eight years as governor of Tennessee from 1979 to 1987, is reminiscent in many ways of Ronald Reagan's -- a skillful use of symbols, an approachable yet unflappable manner, and an understanding that the public resonates to broad themes simply stated, not to the details that interest Washington insiders or policy makers.
He formed that style with the help of his wife, Honey, and Doug Bailey, a consultant, after they told him he had lost his first race for governor in 1974 because he was too stiff and formal to reach voters. Bailey came up with the idea of walking across the state, and Alexander did, wearing a favorite red plaid shirt and spending each night in the home of a voter.
"Playing the trombone and walking across the state without a tie on and meeting people, that was the way I grew up," Alexander says. "So I guess I was more in my element."
Besides the governorship, Alexander gained from his walk an abiding conviction that he understands what people really care about and how to reach them -- a knowledge he used to rally Tennesseans for better schools and a host of other issues.
One of the first actions of his term set the pattern not only for his school reforms in Tennessee, but also for his strategy as Education Secretary.
He convened a jobs conference in Memphis to talk about the city's goals and strengths. In 1979, Alexander says, Memphis was a city battered both economically and psychologically. Out of the conference grew a successful promotion of Memphis as a major distribution center, an agricultural research center, a new hotel, a renovated performing arts center and a new emphasis on tourism and the city's blues heritage, according to Bill Gibbons, a Memphis lawyer and former assistant to Alexander.
From that experience, Alexander decided that communities did best when leaders helped them define their task, but stepped back to let them figure out how to achieve it.
In the first years of his term, Alexander sought jobs, and succeeded in landing two coveted automobile plants: the Nissan factory in Smyrna and General Motors' Saturn project in Spring Hill, near Nashville. But he concluded that Tennesseans would not get better jobs unless they got better educations.
As a result, Alexander became one of the first governors to start statewide education reforms. He presided over a series of changes, including merit pay for teachers, requirements that all students demonstrate mastery of specified basic skills before high-school graduation, tougher math and science requirements and computer literacy. He also called for mandatory public kindergarten. The teachers' union fiercely opposed his merit pay proposals, but after a tough fight, Alexander won the Democratic Legislature's approval of his plan, which was paid for by what he said was the biggest tax increase in Tennessee's history -- an interesting fact, given the lack of money in the "America 2000" proposal.
Tennessee's efforts won national acclaim. How lasting and important the changes were is still being debated. What no one disputes is that he roused a state that had been indifferent to education.
"Rather than trying to put your finger on any one program that made a significant difference in education, I think what happened in Tennessee under Lamar's leadership was we got down to the serious business of talking about education and got away from talking about the football games on Friday night," says John Jones, the Superintendent of Schools in Murfreesboro, who was Deputy Commissioner of Education during the last year of Alexander's tenure as governor.
Other indicators are less conclusive. Scores rose in most subjects in most grades on a series of tests that measured students' progress in basic skills, but S.A.T. scores stayed about the same. Teachers' salaries have risen, teachers are getting better training and tougher state university entrance requirements mean that more students are taking advanced math and science courses in high school.
Despite his unquestionable intelligence and his reputation as a knowledgeable education reformer, however, several educators who have worked with Alexander say they found him disappointingly superficial on the issues. One politician who works with Alexander and insisted on anonymity said, "There has been a lot of opportunity for me to hear, deeply, and I have not."
IF A SMALL-TOWN childhood provides security, it also often breeds a drive born of a determination to escape. Lamar Alexander's was a boyhood fueled by both emotions.
Maryville is hardly the poky mountain town or its children the arrant hillbillies that Alexander sometimes describes, with what he might call typical mountain hyperbole. It is a solidly middle-class bedroom suburb of Knoxville, and despite what were tight finances at home, Alexander grew up guided by middle-class aspirations.
Unlike those of Presidents Reagan or Bush, Lamar Alexander's background does in fact evoke the old-time American ideals on which a once-divorced actor and a New England patrician based their campaigns.
His mother ran a private nursery school and kindergarten, and his father was an elementary-school principal who took a job with Alcoa to earn more money for his family. His was a childhood of Boy Scout hikes in the Smokies, 4 A.M. wakings for paper-delivery routes and church on Sunday plus choir practice on Tuesday and prayer meeting on Wednesday. Piano lessons began at 3, and between schoolwork, church, Boy Scouts and chores, his mother made sure her son had plenty to occupy his considerable energies and decided mischievous streak.
"I knew from the beginning I had a little boy who was going to be into everything," recalls Floreine Alexander, a lively and opinionated woman who says herself that she is not known for her flexibility. "Our interests were church and school and music and books, and that's the atmosphere he grew up with."
It is clear that much of Alexander's politely masked but unmistakable drive was cultivated by his mother. When President Bush announced he was nominating Alexander as Secretary of Education, the new nominee made a minor grammatical error. Friends who met Mrs. Alexander around Maryville the next day recount that she told them, "He didn't learn to speak that way at home."
After high school, Alexander chose not to apply to Maryville College, the local college where his parents met. "It was the only time I ever saw his daddy get angry with him," his mother says. "I could tell when his ears turned purple that he was angry."
It was one of several choices that reveal contradictions beneath Alexander's smooth surface. At Vanderbilt University, he campaigned actively to allow blacks to become undergraduates -- an unpopular stand in 1962 that brought him and a classmate, the humorist Roy Blount Jr., threats of violence. He accepted a scholarship to New York University Law School, an unconventional choice for a would-be Southern politician.
At the same time he began grooming for a political future. He helped manage Howard H. Baker Jr.'s campaign for Senate in 1966, worked as his legislative assistant, and did a stint as an aide at the Nixon White House, acquiring the knowledge of Washington that serves him well now as secretary. He also amassed an ideologically diverse and influential circle of friends, including the author Alex Haley, Paul Tagliabue, the National Football League commissioner, who was his law-school roommate, Tom Johnson, president of Cable News Network and former publisher of The Los Angeles Times, and Judge John Minor Wisdom, the Louisiana judge known for his progressive civil rights decisions who hired Alexander as a clerk after law school.
Baker, whom Alexander includes as one of the people with the greatest influence on his life, recalls that his protege needed little training.
"He has a natural instinct for politics and public relations," Baker says. "He is a very even person. He can also be a very tough person. When he is very tough, even ruthless sometimes, he maintains that level of equanimity, calmness. I've never seen him blow up."
HIS POLITICAL opponents have felt his sting. Bill Nolan, a former Democratic state representative from Knoxville who supported Alexanderin his first run for governor, grew disenchanted when the new Governor impounded budget money set aside for higher education. Nolan and others sued the Governor, successfully, charging that Alexander tried to impound spending for Medicaid and declined to enforce a state law on hazardous wastes. Nolan says Alexander helped his opponent raise $50,000 and brought in several Congressmen to campaign against him, and he lost his next run for office.
"When Lamar has adversaries, he goes after them ruthlessly," Nolan says. "It was nothing for Lamar to say, if you do this, it's going to cost you."
By contrast, his friends tell of quiet acts of generosity. While a law clerk in New Orleans, he became friendly with Judge Wisdom's maid, whose husband was killed. Judge Wisdom recalled that when Alexander started practicing law, he sent her a check for $300, a large amount in 1966.
At the same time, his friends sense a certain remoteness. "He's a little bit mysterious in that he doesn't open up enormously," Roy Blount says. And Alexander's daughter Leslee, in an essay she showed him when she was 14, described him this way: "I characterize my father as an egret, standing on one leg and viewing the world. Although powerful in government, he is withdrawn in family life."
The description stung enough that he decided to take time off when he left office and flee with his family to Australia, a move that many warned would take him off the political fast track. In a charming, literate and self-deprecating memoir, "Six Months Off: An American Family's Australian Adventure," published in 1988 by William Morrow, Alexander wrote of learning the value of spending time with his wife, two sons and two daughters. Now, he acknowledges, he is back to being the busy politician and sees his children, now aged 12 to 22, less than he would like.
While Alexander's friends talk about him as a man of integrity, others have raised questions about his finances. In an August political storm, Tennessee newspapers were filled with headlines about Alexander's failure to disclose when he was president of the University of Tennessee that his wife, through a blind trust, retained a one-third interest in an East Tennessee resort where the university spent $65,000 for entertainment. University officials told Tennessee newspapers that they had not entertained very much at the resort before or after his tenure. They also said Alexander had assured them he had no interest in the resort, but did not tell them of his wife's interest.
Alexander says he acted on legal advice to avoid conflicts of interest by creating a blind trust to manage that investment and making his wife the beneficiary. Furthermore, he says, he and his wife had actually lost money on that investment, when the trustee sold their share in January for $2,000 less than they paid for it.
In addition, during Alexander's confirmation hearings for Education Secretary, investigators turned up what some Democratic Senators saw as questionable transactions, although no one said they were illegal or unethical. Democratic Senators charged, and a series of articles in The Wall Street Journal implied, that Alexander had used the high-level political contacts he had as governor to expedite lucrative business transactions once he left office.
Alexander says he was always careful to avoid any conflicts of interest, and any large profits have been due to his willingness to invest in risky start-up ventures.
"None of those ventures did business with the state of Tennessee, nor do they now, or with the Federal Government," he says. "I wondered why anybody would raise all this stuff. I think what surprises some people is that a governor would have enough sense to write a book or found a company, and I think that's just selling governors short. I could have gone to a law firm, done a lot of lobbying, peddled a lot of influence and made a lot of money. I thought that would be the most boring thing. I was helping to create something."
IN BETWEEN TRIPS around the country, Lamar Alexander sits in his new office in Washington. He favors a rocking chair with a cushion in his trademark red plaid, and on a rough-hewn desk is a carving of a plaid-shirted Lamar Alexander, striding across Tennessee.
The education plan is coming under increasingly strident criticism, but Alexander resists entreaties to endorse specific programs or provide more details. Asked to give examples of changes he likes, he mentions Murfreesboro, where his former Deputy State Secretary of Education charges parents a modest fee for child care before and after school hours; Vermont, where parents can use voice mail to hear their children's homework assignments, or a public school housed in Honeywell's headquarters in Minneapolis for teen-agers who have children or are pregnant. But he declines to endorse any particular educational approaches.
"We know plenty about learning," he says. "There are hundreds, maybe thousands of different ideas that would work. I think the problem is we haven't taken advantage of this last 20 years of technology to create systems that might help the school fit better into needs of families."
At least one prominent education analyst, who will continue to work with Alexander and spoke on condition of anonymity, says he believes that Alexander understands that his plan is in political trouble, and that he deliberately shies away from details in order to do what he has always done well in the past -- build coalitions and make compromises. "To get elected President, he's got to have a program that wins and the program he's got is not a winner," he says. "He'll be willing to modify it till he's put a coalition together."
If that is so, Alexander is not letting on. He talks about getting everyone on the train first, then arguing about what to do. But now Lamar Alexander, the train conductor, finds himself hectored by a sea of passengers wanting to know just where that train is heading.

HEADLINE: The Amish

 BODY:
To the Editor: In answering a question on whether there are any Amish communities in New York State (Q. & A., Oct. 20), you mention only the largest one, near Cherry Creek. Actually there are 14 Old Order Amish settlements in New York, scattered across 10 upstate counties. In most of these settlements a variety of crafts, baked goods and other products are sold by the Amish themselves. It is neither necessary nor advantageous to hire a guide or join a tour to meet and do business with the Amish. The "open" signs on Amish shops and homes attest that customers are welcome.
Cottage industry makes up an increasingly important part of the Amish economic base in New York, as in other states with an Amish population. For better or worse many Amish are far more accessible to the general public than in the past. From the visitor's point of view, being a customer goes a long way toward mitigating what might otherwise be an awkward and intrusive situation.

HEADLINE: Buyers Insist a Bigger House Is Better

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
ARCHIE AND TERRI SIMONS of Newtown, Conn., are 40 years old. They have two incomes. They plan no children.
Edward and Kaye VanDyke of Fairfield, Conn., are in their 50's. They each have careers. Their three children have grown up and moved away. 
 Both families bought homes this year, but neither bought the condominium, town home or small house that might best fit their lives as "DINKS" (double-income couples with no kids) or empty-nesters.
Instead, they bought big houses (four and five bedrooms, respectively) with a wide range of modern amenities (both have Jacuzzis) and large lots (both have two acres).
"We wanted the biggest house we could afford," Ms. Simons said.
"I like a lot of space," said Ms. VanDyke.
The Simonses and the VanDykes are examples of American families, who, despite their shrinking size and the lingering economic recession, are buying bigger homes with more amenities on larger lots.
Home builders are well aware of the desires of buyers and are producing the bigger houses they want. The median size of new houses has been rising steadily year by year, according to National Association of Homebuilders, and hit 1,905 square feet in 1990. In 1970, the median size was only 1,350 square feet and in 1980 it was 1,595.
Moreover, the new homes increasingly have more expensive features. Of the houses built last year, 45 percent had two and a half or more bathrooms; 76 percent had central air-conditioning; 66 percent had one or more fireplaces and 72 percent had garages for two or more cars.
Lots, too, are getting bigger. Last year, the median lot size for a new house was 10,000 square feet, up from 8,875 in 1985.
What makes a larger home affordable during a recession?
For one thing, mortgage rates have plummeted. In April 1989, the national average for a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage was 11.05 percent. Today, it is 8.5 percent. This, combined with the sharp decline in the price of many upper-end homes, have made some larger houses more financially accessible.
"I am building the same home today and pricing it for $100,000 less than I did last year," said Kevin Williams, president of Williams Contracting and Development Corporation, in Newtown. "A house that sold for about $450,000 a year ago, I'm selling for $350,000 -- and that is a pretty substantial drop."
"One thing is very loud and clear -- people want bigger homes," said Gopal Ahlunalia, an economist with the homebuilders association. "The size of homes has been on an upward track for 25 years." The pattern defies many projections made in the 70's and 80's that foresaw homeowners and home builders abandoning large houses for more compact and efficient, not to mention more affordable, models.
"Housing is a mystery," said George Sternlieb, a housing authority and the former director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University. "The only thing that seems sure is that Americans like lots of it."
SEVERAL reasons are cited for the continuing demand for big houses. A large part of the appeal appears to be flexibility. Maryanne DeGroote-Striano, 37 years old, and her husband, Peter, 40, intend to use the extra bedrooms in their new home as guest rooms and an office. They recently bought a 3,700-square-foot, four-bedroom house in Wycliff, N.J., for $414,000. They are planning, at the most, two children.
"If we have children, we don't think four bedrooms will be enough," said Ms. DeGroote-Striano, a lawyer who works in Manhattan. "We would probably need a fifth bedroom for live-in help."
Many economists and housing analysts also believe that because of exclusionary zoning laws in many suburban and rural areas, the only detached one-family housing that is built or bought consists of three-, four- and five-bedroom models.
"I find that you pick a location you like, and usually it is in a subdivision, and there are restrictions for certain size houses," said Rita VanHorn, who, with her husband, James, paid $350,000 for a 10-room, four-bedroom, 3,300 square-foot, colonial-style house in Newtown earlier this year.
Large homes appear to remain popular for their investment value, too. Rick Fernandes, a marketing executive, cited resale value as a prime factor for the purchase, with his wife, Lori, of a four-bedroom, five-bathroom, 3,700-square-foot home in the Greenfield Hill section of Fairfield, Conn.
The Fernandeses, both 33 years old, childless and planning no more than two children, paid $475,000 for the home. "Go for the biggest thing you can afford," Mr. Fernandes said. "If the market is at the bottom, the more you leverage, the more you will make."
"You buy them to sell them, even if you don't need the space," added Dr. Sternlieb.
Then there is the long-held American credo that bigger-is-better simply because it is bigger. "The United States middle class lives with more square footage than anyone else on Earth," said Leon T. Kendall, a professor of finance and real estate at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. "We really are homebodies -- big homebodies."
Younger homeowners often seem to gauge their own comfort and affluence by what they had when they were growing up. "With a lot of people our age, baby boomers, even though they may have no children, I think there is sort of a trend back toward nostalgia, to the type of atmosphere you grew up in, a home, something warmer," Ms. DeGroote-Striano said. "Plus, I think people are spending a lot more time at home."
Older homeowners often want big homes as a way of holding on to their past. "I always had a big house when the kids lived at home, and now they will be coming to visit with my grandchildren," said Ms. VanDyke, who moved into a 3,000-square foot home. "Why should I get a smaller house? All of my friends, they move up from one big house to another. I don't have any friends that have moved from one big house to a smaller one."
The desire for more space appears to be a priority among prospective home buyers. Earlier this year, a National Association of Homebuilders survey of 1,776 families who bought homes in recent years found that they were living in a home with a median floor area of 1,826 square feet but would like to have a home almost 29 percent larger, 2,356 square feet. (The respondents, a third each of first-, second- or third-time buyers, had a median household income of $53,412.)
More than 70 percent of the respondents also would like to have two and a half bathrooms; one out of four would like more than three bathrooms.
"IN the past four years, we've done at least 60 houses at over 3,000 square feet," said Toni Curto, of Curto & Curto, a developer in St. James, L.I. "And a lot of the families buying those houses have only one or two children, and many have none."
When asked what trade-offs they would make if they could not afford the big house of their choice, 36 percent of the survey respondents said they would rather buy the home unfinished and 35 percent said they would rather live farther away from work in a less expensive neighborhood.
The survey also found that only 19 percent would want a smaller lot; 18 percent would want a smaller house and 11 percent would accept fewer amenities, such as a fireplace or a garage. "You have to think down the road, and you have to think about resale," Ms. VanHorn said. "A 3,000-square-foot house with two bedrooms would be an odd house and a hard resale."
Furthermore, the survey found that 60 percent of the respondents prefer four bedrooms or more and one-third of them prefer at least three bedrooms. Only 12 percent of the homeowners, however, would use four or more bedrooms for sleeping, and only 41 percent of them would use three bedrooms.
"If you plan to have family or friends over, you have to have a place to accommodate them," Ms. VanHorn said.
"I'm sort of an audiophile, and now I have a room for all my equipment," said Mr. Simons of Newtown, who recently moved into a new 3,200-square-foot home.
"WHAT you do with 3,000 square feet is the question, not what you do with four bedrooms," Mr. Kendall added. "They are using properties in a lot of ways these days. A four-bedroom house may not stay a four-bedroom house -- they are not going to use all four bedrooms, always. They may knock out a wall and make a suite."
The decline in prices apparently is not the major impetus for home buyers purchasing bigger homes. In fact, the median price of new and existing homes in the Northeast has fallen only moderately. In 1989, the median price for a new home was $159,600; for 1990, it was $159,000. The median price of existing homes fell from $145,200 in 1989 to $141,200 in 1990.
"Despite protestations by economists, marketwise, Americans want a house a little bit bigger than they can afford," Dr. Sternlieb said.
Ara K. Hovnanian, the president of Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, N.J., the largest home builder in New Jersey, attributed the popularity of larger homes to demographics. He pointed out that, despite the declining overall size of the American family and a baby boomlet that is smaller than anticipated, a large bulge of baby boomers is still entering its prime child-raising years. (The size of the average American household has been falling steadily since the mid-1960's; the average was 2.62 persons in 1989 vs. 2.78 persons in 1979, according to the latest available Census Bureau figures.)
Mr. Hovnanian added that to meet the baby boomers' new familial requirements, his company is increasing the number of larger homes it plans to build. He also said there is an increased demand for larger homes on smaller lots and larger town houses.
"The average baby boomer is now between 35 and 45, and they are one of the major propellants to the housing market," he said. "They are maturing, nesting, having families -- having two or three children is not uncommon."
William C. Wheaton, former director of research at the Center for Real Estate Development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noted that the demand for larger homes is growing while the demand for starter homes is dwindling; the proportion of first-time buyers that make up new and existing home sales, according to the Chicago Title and Trust Company, has been fluctuating between 35 and 40 percent since 1981.
"The demand for entry-level housing will fall because of the baby bust," he said. "Those in the entry market now are those left over from the baby boom who are trying to get a piece of the dream while it is cheap."

HEADLINE: Talking: Refinancing;
Getting Around Hurdles

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
IT'S one thing to be told that interest rates are at their lowest levels in 17 years and now is the ideal time to refinance; it's another -- as many people are learning -- to actually get a bargain loan.
"I would read all those marvelous ads," said Thad McGar, who was eager to refinance his brownstone in the Chelsea secton of Manhattan, "but when I went to apply, the documentation was unbelievable." 
 About 10 percent of those who apply are being turned down, according to HSH, a mortgage monitoring service in Butler, N.J. But, says Thomas Hylinski, first vice president for residential lending at People's Bank of Connecticut, "there are things you can do to get around the problems."
Bankers say many people are rejected because of the erosion of values in the last five years, especially on the West and East Coasts. Many loans written in the mid-80's now exceed the customary 80 percent loan-to-value ratio limit and thus no longer qualify for refinancing.
Richard Rist, vice president of Shawmut Mortgage Company of Hartford, said this happens most often to people applying to refinance a luxury condominum, many of which have dropped over 30 percent in value.
In addition, lenders avoid properties considered high-risk for defaults as well as those that, if foreclosed, may be hard to sell. For instance, it is getting tougher to find a lender to refinance a vacation home unless the borrower can limit the refinancing to 70 percent of market value.
Vicki Papson, for example, was told that to refinance loans on her primary residence in Stamford, Conn., and her vacation home in Northport, L.I., she had to agree to cross-collateralize the properties -- let the lender seize one if she defaulted on the other.
Margaret Scott, president of Mortgage Advisory Services of Manhattan, a mortgage broker, warned that New York City lenders may also refuse to refinance a co-op in a converted building where the sponsor still owns a large number of shares. Also being shunned, she said, are studios, especially those under 450 square feet, apartments in walk-ups, co-ops or condominiums built on leased land and anything bought strictly for investment -- all deemed hard to sell now.
Qualifying the borrower has grown harder, too. The recession has left many people with lower income or even no income. Others may have taken on added debt or run up excessive amounts on their credit cards -- all of which adversely affect eligibility.
The lender may now also insist on certain repairs before approving a loan. Keith Gumbinger, an analyst at HSH, has found that the secondary market investors who buy most of these mortgage loans are adding more requirements. For instance, though the secondary buyers might have formerly sought only a market appraisal, they may now require a home inspection, too. Mr. Hylinski, the Connecticut banker, said that as a result, the borrower might be asked to repair the roof or certain leaks before being approved.
Lenders concede that rejections can be reversed or avoided with appropriate strategies. First, all borrowers should start by approaching the bank holding their current loan to see if it is offering special terms or rates to retain its mortgages. Staying with the original lender often can save on upfront origination costs for a new loan. Some lenders offer such deals.
Borrowers who suspect they may fall into a high-risk category should probably work through a mortgage broker instead of trying to go it alone. Mr. McGar did so because he had retired and his retirement income was 30 percent below what it had been.
Like an independent insurance agent, a mortgage broker has ties to many lenders as well as an awareness of which lenders have the most liberal policies.
USING a mortgage broker should not cost the borrower extra. Mortgage brokers normally are paid by the lender out of the "points" -- the amount the lender charges for writing the loan. The brokers, who can be found in the Yellow Pages or through real estate agents, are permitted, however, to charge the nonrefundable application, appraisal and credit-check fees normally charged by the lender.
Nancy Gordon, vice president of Globe Mortgage Company of Hackensack, N.J., said owners who suspect the value of their home may have dropped so steeply that refinancing is no longer feasible should begin by calling several local real estate brokers to get a realistic idea of current values. Most brokers will provide a free informal appraisal to build goodwill and the potential for a future listing.
If the appraisal indicates the 80 percent limit might be exceeded all is not lost. The borrower should offer to take out private mortgage insurance, which gives the lender more security by guaranteeing the loan. Premiums are based on the size of the loan. If the new loan represents 90 to 95 percent of value and if $100,000 is to be borrowed, the mortgage insurance is likely to cost $1,100 for the first year and $500 a year thereafter. If the same $100,000 represents 85 to 90 percent of value, the premium would drop to $450 for the first year and $350 thereafter. Premiums are normally divided into monthly amounts and added to regular payments.
The insurance can be lifted only if a reappraisal later shows that values have risen to the point where the loan now represents less than 80 percent of value. But it will be up to the borrower to ask the lender for an updated appraisal. Otherwise, the insurance will stay in place until the outstanding balance has been paid down to 80 percent based on the original appraisal -- normally 15 years on a 30-year schedule and 5 years on a 15-year schedule.
If household income has shrunk, the borrower should first find out if today's lower interest rates would let him qualify for the same amount anyway. Ivan Kaufman, president of Arbor National Mortgage of Westbury, L.I., noted that interest rates have tumbled so far that even borrowers with a 25 percent drop in income might still qualify.
Other bankers say an unblemished payment record for at least two years would encourage them to stretch conventional income limits to permit the refinancing. Mr. McGar squeaked through by noting there would be some freelance fees coming in.
Ms. Papson solved her problem by refinancing her primary residence only -- at least for the moment. She is now looking for a lender who will accept her vacation home as a separate deal. "Being right on the waterfront should make difference," she added, noting that a borrower should always bring such special attributes to a lender's attention.

HEADLINE: Tax-Credit Program on Borrowed Time

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
THE New York region stands to lose more than 3,000 units of low-income housing next year if the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit -- scheduled to die on Jan. 1 -- is not extended by Congress before it adjourns later this month.
Since 1987, the tax-credit program has been the nation's primary source of Federal aid for producing low-income housing. In New York City alone it has been used to create more than 12,000 low-income apartments. This year, 1,157 more for families and 564 single-room occupancy accommodations are being developed, with about 1,000 more projected to be developed in 1992. 
 "For New York City and hundreds of communities all over America that benefit from the credit, an interruption of even a few months would be disastrous because it would undermine corporate confidence, stall projects now in the pipeline and slow the momentum that has been achieved," Mayor David N. Dinkins said in a statement released earlier this month.
The program also has made an impact outside the city. In the rest of New York State, 6,000 units have been built with the aid of the tax credit. An estimated 800 additional units are projected for 1992.
In New Jersey, the program has assisted in the development of about 5,000 low-income housing units. Should the program expire, it will halt about 800 to 900 units now in various stages of planning.
In Connecticut, the program has helped build 3,950 units, with 750 more projected for 1992. Many of the projects there are in suburban or rural areas. In Ridgefield, in Fairfield County, a 25-unit complex partly paid for with the tax credits opened last week.
"The program has proven itself as an effective program and one of the strongest incentives for the development of low-income rental housing," said Orest T. Dubano, president of the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority.
The program works by giving states Federal tax credits of $1.25 for each resident; in New York, for example, this is about $22.5 million. The state then gives the credits to not-for-profit or for-profit community development corporations interested in building low-income housing in their neighborhoods. The development corporations then trade the tax credits to businesses for investment capital, which is often leveraged to get additional funds from other sources. After 15 years, the project is sold to the developer for the remaining mortgage cost plus taxes.
Investors can deduct from their Federal taxes 9 percent of their investment each year for 10 years. Depending on the price paid for the tax credits, which is negotiated with the developer, annual returns of about 10 to 20 percent can be achieved.
"It benefits the bank with significant tax credits," said John Tamberlane, executive vice president with Republic National Bank, which has participated in the program. "And it benefits the community by providing affordable, rehabilitated apartments for individuals with low and very low incomes."
BORN out of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the program was scheduled to expire at the end of 1989 but has been extended each year. Although the program remains popular with both parties in Congress and has been endorsed by President Bush, chances of another extension are marginal.
The executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, John T. McEvoy, said that most of what little opposition exists to the tax credit has not been targeted on its cost -- for a permanent extension, about $5.3 billion over five years; for a one-year extension, $1.8 billion.
"It is a matter of timing more than anything," Mr. McEvoy said.
He said that the extension's best chances of passage would be as an attachment to the tax legislation now being considered by President Bush. That proposal, however, probably will not be debated by Congress until March. He added that if the tax credit extension were proposed by itself, it is likely it would become weighted with other, less desirable, tax initiatives.
"We're telling our folks that they have to expect a shutdown because we cannot give them a concrete assurance that Congress is going to pass a bill," Mr. McEvoy said.
Since its inception, the tax-credit program has helped build 94 percent of all the new low-income housing in the nation, some 440,000 units. This represents more than 35 percent of all housing starts in that period. Eighty-five percent of the units are occupied by tenants who pay $450 a month or less in rent.
Supporters of the tax credit said they will be satisfied with another one-year extension but would prefer to see it extended indefinitely.
"The annual lobbying to extend the credit has a detrimental effect on the production of affordable housing," Mr. Dinkins said, adding that budgetary constraints have already diminished state and local subsidies for low-income housing.
Paul S. Grogan, president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, added that even an abeyance of the program for a few months -- a scenario that he said was being considered by some in Congress -- could be catastrophic. The nonprofit corporation, through its New York Equity Fund subsidiary, links corporations looking for tax credits with nonprofit community-based developers looking for investment capital.
Mr. Grogan said that the uncertainty over future funding dwarfs other long-term problems the program faces in New York City, such as the dwindling number of city-owned buildings that can be renovated into low-income housing.
"No one could rely on assurances or raise any capital if the program isn't there at the end of the year," Mr. Grogan said. "We could rebuild the momentum, but there would be a real cost in investor relations and a serious reduction in the less tangible matter of confidence."
In suburban areas, the money generated by the tax credits is often used to build new housing. In urban areas, such as New York City, it is often used in conjunction with city loans to renovate city-owned vacant buildings.
Under Federal guidelines, apartments can be rented only to families earning no more than 60 percent of an area's median income. Tenants pay up to 30 percent of their annual income for rent. Maintenance on the project must be provided by the community development corporation.
"The program has been a success," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan. "Nearly all the credits allocated each year have been used by the states. Nearly every state has used up all of its allocated credits.
"When used at this rate," he added, "the program can develop over 120,000 units per year for low-income tenants."
GROUNDBREAKING for the city's newest project financed by the tax credit took place last Monday at the 71-unit Hattie Dodson Houses on West 131st Street in Harlem.
"The transformation of this neighborhood from an area known for having the highest concentration of city-owned abandoned buildings into a viable, economically integrated and socially healthy community is under way," said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, a pastor at the Abyssinian Baptist Church and a board member of the Abyssinian Development Corporation, which is developing the project.
One of New York City's most successful projects has been a six-story brick structure at 1450 Bryant Avenue in the South Bronx that has been rebuilt by the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes, a not-for-profit community development corporation, into an 80-unit apartment complex. The building had been on a block of bombed-out brick, one of many that blight the area.
"It's so different, so much better," said Olfelina Sorian, a home attendant who used to live a few blocks away and moved last year into her new two-bedroom, $367-a-month rental in the building.
"The program works," added Ralph Porter, president of the Desperadoes. "And if it is not extended, then low-income housing is just going to stop around here and in a lot of places."

Decontrolled Rent
 
Question: If a one-bedroom, rent-controlled unit with a maximum base rent of $600 a month is vacated, and another one-bedroom apartment in the same building is renting for $1,200, will the decontrolled one-bedroom apartment automatically rent for a minimum of $1,200 too? . . . Marjory Rice, Manhattan
 
Answer: No. The new rent would depend on several factors. The procedure for setting rents after a tenant moves out of a rent-controlled apartment in New York City is spelled out in Section 25-22.3 of the Rent Stabilization Code. This applies to apartments in buildings with six or more units constructed before Jan. 1, 1974.
The code says, in part, that the landlord of a decontrolled apartment has the right to set the first rent at a fair market level, which means what a similar apartment would rent for in the neighborhood. However, the first tenant after decontrol has the right to challenge that rent if he believes it exceeds what is fair for the market.
The landlord must file an initial rent registration form, which includes the new rent, with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. The landlord must also give the tenant a copy of the form, via certified mail, within 90 days of the tenant's occupancy.
"The tenant then has 90 days to challenge the rent," said Joseph D'Agosta, an assistant commissioner for the agency. "If there is no protest, the rent is set and all future increases are calculated on the stabilized rent."
If the tenant objects to the rent and the housing agency agrees that it exceeds the fair market rate, the new stabilized rent can be calculated in one of two ways. In one formula, it is determined by adding 15 percent to the maximum base rent of the controlled apartment. In the other, that figure -- the M.B.R. plus 15 percent -- is added to rents on similar apartments in the same building, and then the average of those two figures provides the new stabilized rent.
The rent registration forms and forms for the Fair Market Rent Appeal are available at the central rent administration office, 92-31 Union Hall Street, Jamaica, Queens, and in the rent office in each borough office. In Manhattan they are at 156 Williams Street, ninth floor, and 163 West 125th Street, fifth floor.
More information is available by calling the Rent Administration Hotline at (718) 739-6400.
 
The Legal Fee on a Sale
 
Question: I recently inherited a co-op apartment, which I plan to sell. I understand that the board of directors requires that the seller pay not only his own legal fees, but also the fee of the lawyer handling the co-op's involvement in the sale. Is this legal? . . . Jo G. Trabucco, Woodside, Queens
 
Answer: Yes. Marc Luxemberg, a lawyer specializing in real estate matters, said it is common for co-op proprietary leases to require that legal fees be paid by the shareholder in cases involving the sale or transfer of shares. If the co-op uses the standard proprietary lease, he said, this provision will probably be in paragraph 16.
"If this owner refuses to pay the co-op's legal fees," said Mr. Luxemberg, "the board would be within its right to reject the sale."
 
New Rule for Tenants
 
Question: Recently I received a notice from the managing agent for my co-op concerning an extra payment for subletting. The board of directors has decided that after next January there will be another charge on subletting apartments.
As I recall, the bylaws mention an initial fee for approved sublets. Can the board pass new fees without amending the bylaws? . . . Rosalyn Levin, Brooklyn
 
Answer: They probably can. The bylaws of most co-ops give boards the authority to establish fees, among them sublet fees and flip taxes. Moreover, the right of boards to levy or increase fees without the specific approval of the shareholders has been upheld by the courts.
But to determine if the board has exceeded its authority, you should check the language of your co-op's documents.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcies Increase Sharply as the Stigma of Filing Fades

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
ACCELERATING a four-year trend of increasing numbers of bankruptcies in the state, residents and businesses have filed more than 18,000 bankruptcy petitions this year and are expected to file hundreds, perhaps thousands, more by the end of 1991, Federal Bankruptcy Court officials say.
With a record number of petitions already filed -- the vast majority for personal bankruptcy -- experts say the trend is reflective of more than just the fallout from the nation's vexing economic slump. 
 The bankruptcies, they say, though typically precipitated by unemployment or reductions in income, are often more deeply rooted in the frenetic consumer borrowing that was encouraged by banks and credit companies during the 1980's.
That, they say, along with a lessening of the stigma associated with bankruptcy and increasing anger at the anonymous forces that have unbalanced many borderline budgets, has led a record number of people to seek the fresh start afforded by the bankruptcy laws.
"It's almost uncontrollable," said Edward P. Bond, managing partner in the West Orange accounting firm of Bederson & Company, referring to the number of bankruptcies filed in recent years.
"Today, every major accounting firm and law office has established a bankruptcy department," Mr. Bond said, adding that in the past, bankruptcy work was often shunned by lawyers and accountants alike. "Now, my conception is that every attorney in the state has become a bankruptcy attorney," he said.
Mr. Bond said the effects of the current recession, coupled with tight credit, stretched budgets and diminished incomes, had created one of the most severe bankruptcy filing frenzies he had seen in 30 years in business.
By the end of August, New Jersey residents and businesses had already filed nearly as many bankruptcy petitions as the total number filed in all of 1990.
James J. Waldron, clerk of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey, said that last year 15,394 bankruptcy petitions were filed by businesses and individuals in the state. By Aug. 31 of this year, Mr. Waldron said, 15,112 petitions had been filed. By Oct. 31, the number had risen to 18,783. By the end of the year, he said, the total filings are expected to exceed 20,000.
"It's impossible to react to that," Mr. Waldron said, alluding to efforts of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey to deal with the rising number of filings. "You just kind of scrounge around as best you can and put Band-Aids on the problems by processing paper."
With only seven Federal Bankruptcy Court judges assigned to New Jersey, the state desperately needs another judge, he said. "Our judges are overwhelmed," he said.
The vast majority of filings, Mr. Waldron said, are for personal bankruptcies. Through Oct. 31, for example, 1,085 businesses had filed while 17,698 personal bankruptcy petitions had been logged.
In fact, while the number of business bankruptcies has remained fairly constant -- averaging about 1,000 each year since 1985 -- the number of personal bankruptcies has nearly tripled from a 1985 total of 5,977.
That does not come as a surprise to bankruptcy experts.
"It's like buying a new set of clothes," said Hugh M. Leonard, a lawyer with the Hackensack law firm of Cole, Schotz, Bernstein, Meisel & Forman. "It really should be a last resort, and for the most part it is, but there are some situations where it's used in a turnstile approach."
Mr. Leonard, who was the United States Trustee for bankruptcy courts in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania, said the "turnstile approach" had been made worse, at least in part, by law firms that advertise for bankruptcy clients.
"For the most part, I think they're factories," Mr. Leonard said. "You run into an office, you fill out the papers and you don't really understand the consequences."
A major consequence, Mr. Leonard said, is that after a bankruptcy "it takes people a while to rehabilitate their credit." Another, he said, is that those who file are effectively barred from filing another bankruptcy within six years.
Mr. Leonard said that when he was United States Trustee in 1979, there were about 250 bankruptcy filings each month in New Jersey. The current average for New Jersey is more than 1,800 filings a month.
Charles M. Forman, a Newark lawyer who specializes in bankruptcy law, said the only common denominator among people who filed for bankruptcy was that they had simply run out of options. "You have people from all walks of life now filing for bankruptcy," Mr. Forman said. "It runs the gamut from laborers who are dependent on overtime straight across the board to professionals like lawyers, doctors and chiropractors."
He said that among the reasons for many personal bankruptcies he had handled were the effects of balloon mortgages and home-equity loans that many property owners obtained in the early to mid-1980's.
A balloon mortgage, Mr. Forman said, is usually a short-term mortgage with monthly payments, often of interest only, calculated as if it were a long-term mortgage. After a specific number of years, the entire unpaid balance is due and payable.
"Years ago, people had conventional mortgages," he said. "But now, people have balloon payments coming due on these balloon mortgages and they can't get the refinancing they need."
Inability to pay off home-equity loans, he said, have also contributed to increased filings.
 
Trustees Are Busy
 "People underestimated the impact of home-equity loans on their household budgets," he said. "When you need two incomes to meet your budget, all it takes is for one of the partners to get sick or lose a job to put you right behind the eight ball."
Bunce D. Atkinson, a Red Bank lawyer who also acts as a trustee for the Bankruptcy Court, said he had seen "a tremendous increase in business over the last year and a half."
Mr. Atkinson said that in addition to lost employment and fewer work hours as the primary causes of bankruptcies, many people were also succumbing to financial pressures stemming from illness, overextended credit and divorce.
As businesses cut back on expenses, he said, many workers have lost their health insurance. Unexpected medical expenses not covered by insurance, Mr. Atkinson said, can place an insurmountable financial burden on a family with a fixed income.
 
Problems With Credit Cards
 And overextended credit, he said, which is at least partly a result of credit card companies' sending consumers unsolicited, preapproved credit cards, is also taking a toll on delicately balanced household budgets.
"People who use the cards always intend to pay them back," he said. "But when you're paying interest at 18 and 21 percent, it gets to the point where you can't even pay the interest back."
Even divorce, Mr. Atkinson said, contributes to the increase in bankruptcies. "Two households are more expensive to maintain than one," he said. "And in this economy, where both parties' incomes may be down, the divorce can push one or both of them over the edge."
Mr. Atkinson said that in his experience, filing a bankruptcy petition was "definitely not a move of convenience."
 
A Last Resort for Many
 Most people who file for bankruptcy, he said, do so "only after agonizing over whether or not they should do it." And most people, he said, do everything they can to avoid filing.
"They've utilized their savings, sold their autos to raise money to pay bills, and finally there's nothing left -- they don't have an alternative," he said.
Despite such reluctance on the part of individuals to file for bankruptcy, many experts say the stigma previously associated with insolvency is no longer as great as it once was.
"There's no question that the stigma as we usually know it has been removed from bankruptcy," said Dr. Stanley Fisher, a counseling psychologist speaking on behalf of the New Jersey Psychological Association in Livingston. "Bankruptcy by itself does not emotionally disturb all people," Dr. Fisher said.
He said an individual's reaction to being forced into bankruptcy depended upon a number of factors.
 
May Feel Anger or Depression
 "It depends upon the kind of people he's surrounded by and the kind of upbringing he's had," Dr. Fisher said. "He may be angry about it if he feels it has been forced upon him, or, if he believes that it's his own personal failure, he may feel depressed about it."
Not everyone perceives bankruptcy negatively. In fact, Dr. Fisher said, "there's a whole group of people who see it as a good business maneuver."
Albert Togut, senior partner of the Manhattan law firm of Togut, Segal & Segal, agreed that there was no longer a stigma associated with filing for bankruptcy. He said that with many large corporations filing for reorganization under the bankruptcy laws, the practice has now "gained respectability."
"Nowadays, the public's perception is that they don't care whether a company is in bankruptcy or not," Mr. Togut said.
 
Chance to Reorganize
 The reason, he said, is that the current bankruptcy code does not require a company to be actually insolvent to take advantage of the protections afforded under the law. A filing under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, for example, allows a corporation in danger of insolvency to reorganize and restructure its debt in order to have a fighting chance at survival.
Not all companies that seek protection under Chapter 11, however, are ultimately successful in reorganizing. One of Mr. Togut's clients, Mr. Goodbuys, a Pennsylvania-based retail hardware chain with stores in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, is now liquidating after having filed for a Chapter 11 reorganization last May.
"At the time we filed, we expected to do a classic reorganization," Mr. Togut said. "We would adjust our debt through a Chapter 11 plan, and we would emerge as a smaller but healthy company."
 
Creditors Take Action
 As the economy continued to decline, however, the business that Mr. Goodbuys needed to continue in operation failed to materialize, Mr. Togut said. As a result, he said, the creditors of the company, in an effort to maximize the return on its remaining assets, requested a liquidation of the company.
"The goal was to do what was best for the creditors," Mr. Togut said.
Mr. Togut said the factors that frustrated the company's attempt at reorganization were essentially no different from those affecting individuals.
"People are often the victims of economic circumstances beyond their control," Mr. Togut said. "Thank God for the bankruptcy laws."
 
 
 
THREE TYPES OF FILINGS
 There are three common types of bankruptcy, said Brian T. Moore, the partner in charge of bankruptcy and reorganization for the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Company in Roseland.
Bankruptcies filed under Chapter 7 of the Federal bankruptcy code, he said, involve the liquidation of a business's or a person's assets to pay outstanding debts. Typically, creditors receive only a portion of the amount they are owed, if they receive anything at all.
For individuals, debts that are discharged are permanently forgiven. Debts owed for such things as alimony, child support, income taxes, student loans and certain other judgments and fines, however, are not dischargeable.
Chapter 11 bankruptcies, Mr. Moore said, allow for a restructuring of the debts of a corporation or a self-employed person. After the petition is filed, he said, the business continues to operate under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court.
A committee is created to represent creditors during the reorganization. A plan of reorganization is developed and the plan is submitted to the creditors for their approval and to the Bankruptcy Court for its confirmation.
Chapter 13 bankruptcies, Mr. Moore said, apply to people who have regular sources of income like salaries, wages or commissions. In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, debts are adjusted or payments are made over an extended period of time. A Chapter 13 filing may allow a person to retain assets that would otherwise be lost in a Chapter 7 liquidation.
Both Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 bankruptcies can, under certain circumstances, be converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation by parties other than the debtor, Mr. Moore said.
Someone who has had debts discharged in bankruptcy, he said, may be barred from obtaining a subsequent discharge in bankruptcy for six years.

HEADLINE: Restitution Plan Aids Crime Victims

BYLINE: By TOM CALLAHAN

 BODY:
IN addition to their monthly bills for utilities and rent, 600 convicted offenders on probation in Westchester have a new bill each month under a year-and-a-half-old county program. As part of their sentence for committing a crime or misdemeanor, these offenders have been ordered to pay restitution to the people they victimized.
Since the beginning of this year, 853 crime victims in the county have received $1,147,397.71 in restitution for damages or losses sustained because of a crime. 
 A judge decides whether to impose restitution, but the collection and payment of the fines is the job of the economic sanctions unit of the County Probation Department. There are 7,656 probation cases in the county, and 600 of the offenders have been ordered to pay restitution.
While judges have issued these sentences for years, probation departments have had difficulty in the past collecting. "What happens in probation is that unless we treat something special, it can get lost in the shuffle," said Francis W. Maiolino, deputy director of the Probation Department.
"When dealing with sex offenders or drug cases, restitution often took low priority," she said. "It's nice to get money back, but we have to protect public safety, and that often means getting a guy into a clinic or rehab first."
Increasing restitution collections was one of the goals of Rocco Pozzi when he took over as Westchester Probation Director in July 1989. "When I arrived in Westchester, I made a commitment to the county executive to come up with a viable Economic Sanctions Unit," he said. "The amount of restitutions being collected were not as high as we would have liked."
 
Payment Process Speeded Up
 Mr. Pozzi established the sanctions unit in June last year. Before then restitution records were kept by hand by two full-time and four part-time accountants. Probation officers were responsible for collecting the money on a case-by-case basis.
"The process used to take three months from the time we received the check from the offender to the actual payment to the victim," said Nancy Lick, chief of planning, research and development for the Probation Department. "Now we have reduced that time frame down to one month."
Both Mr. Pozzi and Mr. Maiolino came to Westchester from Philadelphia, where Mr. Pozzi was deputy chief for probation and Mr. Maiolino served as director of that city's Economic Sanctions Unit. They decided to model Westchester's program on the one they developed in Philadelphia.
"What we did was consolidate the supervision and accounting function," Mr. Pozzi said. "We put four probation officers into the economic sanctions unit and computerized the accounting function, thus eliminating the part-time accountants. The computer is key because it does sophisticated accounting. It tells us instantly what's due and what's been paid."
 
Victims Are Often Surprised
 When a defendant is convicted, the Probation Department, as part of the presentencing report, determines the economic loss to the victims.
"People don't understand restitution," said Charles Brenner, supervisor of probation officers for economic sanctions. "They talk to the District Attorney, and then they are surprised to find out later that they can get money. We had people come to us after they received their first check and say, 'Am I really allowed to cash this check?' "
If a judge decides to impose restitution at sentencing, the offender's name and the amount owed is entered into the computer. The amount is generally pro-rated over the length of the probation sentence, which can be up to five years.
Victims then receive a letter stating how much they will receive each month, and offenders are given 12 numbered envelopes to mail into the Economic Sanctions Unit with the payments.
While many restitution cases involve medical expenses and loss of wages for victims of violent crimes, restitution can also cover crimes against property, such as vandalism, and white-collar, or business, crime. Indeed, one embezzlement case against three individuals yielded a restitution payment of $616,615 this year.
While conceding that this restitution award was largely responsible for the 192 percent jump in collection figures over the previous year, Mr. Maiolino said that even without that case, collections still increased by $135,000, or 26 percent over last year. Probation Department policy prevents divulging names.
 
Computer Keeps Eye on Payments
 "If Master Card can track millions of payments each month by computer, we can do the same thing for a more important system," Mr. Maiolino said. "We designed it to be just like paying your mortgage or phone bill each month. Like the banks and utilities, we expect payment by the first week of the month."
And as with common household bills, the computer knows exactly when the bill hasn't been paid. If that happens, the computer automatically sends the offender a delinquency notice. If that is ignored, a second and third notice are sent, with an arrest warrant issued after the third notice.
"The program is successful because most people on probation don't want trouble," Mr. Maiolino said. "The whole idea behind probation is staying out of jail." The sanctions unit has a success rate of 50 percent, taking in an average of 300 payments totaling $50,000 a month. Mr. Maiolino said he expected that success rate to increase by 10 to 20 percent each year.
"Who better to collect money than us?" he added. "We carry badges, allowing us to take people to court. We don't like to go that far. But some people don't think we will expend the energy on restitution, and they're dead wrong."
 
An Aid in Restoring Self-Esteem
 "We don't care if we are ordered to collect 5 cents or $5 million," Ms. Lick said. "If the victim loses because of a crime, they deserve to get it back. We work just as hard to get it back no matter what the cost."
In addition to aiding the victim, restitution helps probation officers keep track of an offender's education record and employment situation. "One of the things we are seeing because of this program is a younger element of kids getting jobs because they have to pay off the restitution," Mr. Brenner said. "And when a kid in trouble can get a job, it helps get their self-esteem off the ground."
Mr. Pozzi said he hoped judges would increase both the number and dollar amounts of restitution sentences. "Looking down the road, we want more cases," Mr. Pozzi said. "When we first arrived, people said wait and see. But we're now in a position to expand. Our computerized system can handle more."

HEADLINE: JUMP-STARTING NEW YORK

 BODY:
Peter D. Salins writes a very timely but somewhat idealistic article ("Jump-Starting New York," Nov. 3). He has the city's woes in a nice bundle, but some of his solutions lack a realistic view of the human condition. It seems to me that "social-assistance grants" will wind up being paychecks for drug dealers. Instead, why not pay some individuals an hourly wage to clean up the neglected parks, roadways and municipally held properties. This not only cuts some heavy spending but also instills a needed ethic.
Salins's views, I hope, will not go unseen by the next mayor in the next election.

HEADLINE: All About/Weight-Loss Programs;
Crash Is Out, Moderation Is In, And Diet Companies Feel the Pinch

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
After many years of wild growth, the $32 billion weight control industry is plunging into the valley of the 1990's with the recession to the right, regulators to the left, and the ever-expanding-and-contracting Oprah Winfrey looming in front.
Only the marginal companies are likely actually to go broke betting on the American avoirdupois roller coaster, but times are troubled. Ms. Winfrey's high-profile pas de deux with Optifast, which ended when she regained most of the the weight she had lost, devastated the very-low-calorie liquid diet market, which industry experts say is likely to contract. Reports of health problems after quick and drastic weight loss have depressed the diet-center segment. And even the venerable Weight Watchers International Inc., has been pressured by its competitors to retool. 
 The culture at large is changing as well. According to the Calorie Control Council, a light-foods trade group in Atlanta, the number of dieters has dropped to 48 million this year from 65 million in 1986 -- give or take 5 million "holiday" dieters in any given year. And research by Marketdata Enterprises, a market research firm in Valley Stream, L.I., indicates that only in the parts of the market that appeals to do-it-yourself dieters -- convenience foods and over-the-counter diet aids like pills, for example -- is growth either stable or rising.
"Consumers have begun to recognize because of proliferation of diet books and diet centers that the way to lose weight is through moderation and balance," said Phil Lempert, editor of the Lempert Report, a food industry marketing trends newsletter.
 
The Industry Doyen
Weight Watchers Holds Its Lead
 They call themselves the "lean, mean Lankenau team" -- a group at the Manhattan law firm of Lankenau, Kovner & Bickford that has been dieting together for nearly a year. The women are a virtual microcosm of the part of the dieting culture that industry loves to hear from: with 15 to 108 pounds to lose, they sought a regimen. Four are on supervised programs -- three on Jenny Craig, one on Weight Watchers -- and two have been chugging those libations to anhedonia, the over-the-counter protein shake, on their own.
Josephine Hauck, the firm's office manager, started the trendlet at Lankenau last January when she decided to lose weight for her son's wedding. Ms. Hauck chose Jenny Craig on the advice of an acquaintance. "I felt like a dumpy old lady. That was not how I wanted to be in life, and it was certainly not how I wanted to be remembered in the album," she said.
Jenny Craig International, the No. 3 company in the $2 billion commercial diet-center segment, combines a regimen of company-provided foods, called Jenny's Cuisine, with counseling and a gradual reintroduction of independent eating. The program's approach of providing prepackaged food is similar in many respects to that of Nutri/System Inc., the segment's No. 2 company. The core at Weight Watchers International Inc., the Jericho, L.I.-based leader, with about $300 million in sales, and some five million members, is still its trademark meeting: part testimony and revival, part nutrition education, part pep talk.
This year, Heinz, which owns Weight Watchers, made its convenience foods a separate company, in Pittsburgh. Heinz, analysts say, has been slow to respond to such fast-growing products as Conagra's Healthy Choice frozen entrees. Last week, Weight Watchers Food announced that its winter ad campaign -- "Total Indulgence. Zero Guilt." -- would proceed without its longtime spokeswoman, Lynn Redgrave.
 
Selling Convenience
Jenny Craig's No-Fuss Approach
 Weight Watchers International, which runs the meetings and sells franchises, has been nudged into innovating, particularly by Jenny Craig, which just completed a public offering to raise money for development. Jenny Craig's prepackaged meals have lured dieters who don't want to fuss with food preparation. "People are extraordinarily busy these days, especially women, who are 95 percent of our members. They say they'd like a more convenient, one-stop shopping approach," said Charles Berger, the president of Weight Watchers International. It is testing a Jenny Craig-like storefront system. At Lankenau everyone has made it to her goal weight or is dropping weight steadily and determined to stay in for the long haul. "I look at a cookie now and say, 'Do I really want to eat this?' When I cheat now, I cheat with a piece of fruit," said Fran Dissinger, another Lankenau dieter. The success of Lankenau's team sends one ominous message to the diet industry. "Anyone with the right motivation and right program for them at the moment can lose the weight," said Betsy Taylor, program director of Health Extenders, an independent weight-loss center in Norwalk, Conn., which offers a variety of approaches to losing weight.
But nobody in the business is worried that Americans will abandon their obsession with weight. "The desire for weight loss is very powerful. It's tied up with basic human desires like greed and sex," Mr. Berger said, adding: "The only thing that happens is that the solution people select to weight-loss problems shifts around."
 
A New Scrutiny
The F.T.C., F.D.A. And Congress, Too
 The forms of fraud in the weight-loss industry over the years pay homage to human imagination -- and gullibility. Since the first case in 1926, which involved a cream that supposedly melted fat, the Federal Trade Commission has taken action against a long list of improbable products including sunglasses that, the maker claimed, altered the color of food, making it unpalatable.
"Americans always want a quick fix," said Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who last year sponsored hearings on the diet industry in Congress. "It is almost in the chromosomes. We want results in 20 minutes."
Mr. Wyden's hearings targeted a considerably more respectable segment of the industry -- liquid diets, usually administered in medical settings -- than the fringy products the F.T.C. typically goes after.
Last month, the F.T.C. announced consent agreements with three liquid diet makers whose advertising practices it had investigated. Sandoz, which markets Optifast; Jason Pharmaceuticals, which makes Medifast, and the National Center for Nutrition Inc., which produces Ultrafast -- no relation to Ultra Slim-Fast, the over-the-counter powder -- have agreed to abide by an F.T.C. directive to disclose health risks and back up their long-term weight-loss claims.
Mr. Wyden wants the F.T.C. guidelines extended to the entire industry. "The F.T.C. is off to a solid start, but there's a tremendous amount to do," he said. "It's very unfortunate that industry has gone without scrutiny for so long."
The F.T.C. is still looking into liquid diet makers and commercial diet centers. The Food and Drug Administration, meanwhile, is scrutinizing the $1.3 billion appetite-suppressant market.
 
 
 
LURING MEN TO THE DIET TROUGH

At any given time, according to Marketdata Enterprises, which publishes a consumer guide to weight-loss programs, half of the women in the United States and a fourth of the men are on diets. Male dieters have proved elusive to the diet industry, although industry experts believe there are as many overweight men as women. They say men are less likely to acknowledge a weight problem and even when they do are more likely than women to be do-it-yourself dieters or to head for the gym.
Some 95 percent of Weight Watchers' members are female, a number the company concedes is unlikely to grow much. "When we get a man," said Charles Berger, president of Weight Watchers International, "he's one of 5 to 7 percent. He walks into a room of 40 people, mostly women. The discussion veers toward women's problems, and he gets bored."
Slim-Fast, a unit of the Thompson Medical Company, was pleasantly surprised when its "regular guy" spokesmen, Tommy Lasorda and Dan Dierdorf, both sports figures, seemed to attract business from men. Thirty-five percent of Slim-Fast's customers are male, unusual in the industry. And the football-baseball angle seems not to have turned off women: "They see Dan Dierdorf and say 'if he can do it, I can definitely do it,' " said Barri Rafferty, Slim-Fast spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
There's Still Some Flab In the Dow

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:
Even for Laszlo Birinyi's consulting firm, which watches historical trends as closely as anyone, it took a while to figure out that the Dow's 120-point drop Friday a week ago was only the 134th-largest percentage decline in the history of that index. But if the Nov. 15 squall presaged no hurricane, neither did fair weather return. With the economic outlook still dark, the market fell another 40 points to 2,902 by week's end.
In recent years, sharp drops like the Nov. 15 one have presented buying opportunities. But so far, the brave souls have held back. Some analysts think it's simple: even after the drop, stocks are still pricey. And, as the Birinyi Associates research implies, a 3.9 percent drop, although painful, is just not all that huge. Remember that the Dow dropped 22.6 percent in the 1987 crash, 6.9 percent in October 1989. 
 The worst days in recent years have brought price-earnings ratios down to at least moderate levels -- 16 after the crash of 1987, 14 after the 190-point drop in 1989. But last week, it seems, the bargain-hunters never went shopping because bargains were few. A Standard and Poor's 500 that many regarded as overpriced at 20 times earnings before the drop was still no bargain at more than 19 times earnings on Friday.
Short-term interest rates, a crutch for a market that would otherwise be immobilized by weak earnings, fell again last week. But James Grant's a newsletter on interest rates, emphasized two more ominous signs:
First, the dollar continued its decline, reflecting and possibly aggravating the withdrawal of foreign investors from American markets. Second, the flight to the safety of Treasury securities, expected after a sharp stock decline, was confined to shorter maturities; bond yields actually rose. Wall Street loves Republican Presidents, but Mr. Grant fears George Bush will embark on an inflationary course to revive the economy before the election -- corroding the value of stocks and bonds.
After months of placid gains, the suddenness of the decline a week ago was actually more remarkable than its size. For all the talk about program trading, the markets are only slightly more jumpy than in recent decades. "Volatility has gone up somewhat, but not as much as the public perception," said Burton G. Malkiel of Princeton University.
Panics do occur, he added, and stocks tend to fall more abruptly than they rise. The Dow has had one-day drops of more than 100 points seven times, but has risen that much only three times. The more-frequent plunges represent virtually the only sensible occasions for a buyer to try to time the market, Mr. Malkiel said. But not this time around. "I don't think this was much of a decline," he said.
The Nov. 15 drop was, perhaps, underdone, not overdone -- smaller in percentage than dozens of movements now forgotten. These days, the fifth-largest point decline in history turns out to be not so historic after all.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Equities March Their Separate Ways

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
When stock markets worldwide fall as they did early last week, it fosters the belief that they always dance to the same tune -- in this case the 4.3 percent swoon of the Dow Jones industrial average from Friday, Nov. 15, through last Tuesday.
Actually, markets around the world do not move in lockstep very often. And because of the weakness of the correlation among world markets, European stocks could offer an interesting opportunity for Americans in the next several months, especially if Wall Street declines slowly. 
 The key here is the speed of the American retreat. World markets are more likely to move down at the same rate as Wall Street if the American move is fast and large because that tends to spook investors everywhere. This is what happened in the 1987 crash, the mini-crash in 1989 and the one-day tailspin after the coup in the Soviet Union. Last week, the Dow was off again on Friday, falling 29.96 points, or 1 percent.
"In periods of high volatility, markets pay more attention to each other, and this happens even when there is no obvious common news event," like a war or oil price jump, that would affect everyone, said Sushil Wadhwani, director of European equity strategy for Goldman, Sachs & Company in London.
But if the decline in the United States is slow, markets in Europe are likely to move more to their own domestic beat than to Wall Street's. This could even mean some rallies abroad.
Underlying market forces look better in Europe than in the United States for the next several months because of Wall Street's growing unhappiness about the uncertainty and sluggishness of the American economic recovery. The Japanese stock market could also offer the same opportunity.
One reason for a divergent performance is that a slow United States recovery will have less impact on European companies than on American ones. The country with the largest exposure through exports or subsidiaries in the United States is the Netherlands, where 34 percent of earnings are American based, according to Goldman Sachs.
The dependence on the United States drops from there. In Switzerland, 25 percent of the earnings are tied to the United States; in Britain, the earnings factor is 20 percent American. In Germany and Italy the factor is down to 10 percent; in France it is only 5 percent and in Spain, 3 percent.
Interest rates, which can spark a stock market rally by falling, are now about twice as high in Europe as in the United States and thus have the potential to fall sharply.
In addition, European stocks in general tend to be a better value -- selling at lower multiples of earnings -- than American stocks. And in some markets, particularly Germany, stock market indexes are still far below their record highs.
"Europe will split off," predicted David Roche, international strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company in London. He expects the Dow to fall a few hundred points more. But as long as the decline is gradual, he said, the prospects for American investors are better abroad than on Wall Street.
The German and Italian markets mirror Wall Street's moves the least, based on the measurement of correlations between markets by Ennis, Knupp & Associates of Chicago, the percent of earnings exposed to the United States and the sensitivity of European markets to a fall in the dollar, which has dropped 7 percent against the mark in the last four weeks. France is also quite independent, but its correlation to the United States is higher for the last five years than for the last 20 years.
The European countries least able to resist Wall Street's call are the Netherlands, Switzerland and Britain, which all have closer -- but still not slavish -- correlations to the United States and higher exposures to a dollar decline and a slow American recovery.
The Ennis, Knupp correlations show that over time many leading markets are not particularly close followers of the United States. But, as the numbers also show, these correlations can change, depending on the period covered.
The reaction of European markets last week may also have signaled a break in the follow-the-leader flops of the past. Many stock markets in Europe declined less than the Dow Jones industrial average this time. And the markets that had the steepest falls, France and Britain, were responding to domestic problems as well as to Wall Street.
For example, the German stock market's DAX index of 30 shares dropped only 1.9 percent, compared with a 4.3 percent drop in the Dow through Tuesday. But in the three-day mini-crash in October 1989, the German market plunged 7.7 percent, twice the Wall Street slump of 3.8 percent.
Spain's stock market, which fell 3.4 percent in October of 1989, dropped only 1.1 percent in this episode. Italy's stock market was down just half a percent at the beginning of last week. But it dove 21.9 percent at the beginning of the Persian Gulf crisis, almost twice the 11.2 percent fall on Wall Street.
"Certainly our traders were glued to the screen," Mr. Wadhwani said. "But we did not have the same slavish dependence on the United States in Europe in respect to the size of the decline."
In France and Britain, the sharp stock market declines were mostly a response to problems at home. In France, the 5.4 percent fall of blue-chip stocks came after the Bank of France's surprising increase in official interest rates on Monday. The rise was made to support a weakening franc in the European Monetary System.
In Britain, the stock market fell more than in Germany but less than in the United States, with the FT-SE index of 100 shares off 2.9 percent through Wednesday. Much of the fall was because of a weakening pound, which eliminated a chance of another cut in interest rates soon. The pound and the FT-SE fell further on Friday.
"The real message is that the reason you get a very sudden kind of coordinated fall around the world's markets is a panic reaction," Mr. Roche said. "But the panic this time was quite limited. People looked and saw that the United States had a major problem but that those problems are not the same for the rest of the world."

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Setting the Pace On Discounts

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
With their industry awash in red ink, most airline executives say that only increased traffic and higher fares can restore profitability. But USAir has set its rivals' teeth on edge by periodically offering discount fares -- most recently, earlier this month -- and some analysts think the carrier may be on the right track.
The credit for the move -- or the blame -- must go to Seth E. Schofield, the 52-year-old president and chief executive of USAir Group and its principal subsidiary, USAir, based in Arlington, Va. 
 Since taking over last June in the depths of the worst slump in airline history -- 34 years after he joined the carrier, which used to be Allegheny Airlines -- Mr. Schofield has been busier than the proverbial one-armed paperhanger.
In addition to imposing the discount fares, he realigned USAir's hub system and eliminated flights within California to refocus on the carrier's traditional East Coast markets. The airline, which already has more daily departures from La Guardia Airport than any other carrier, recently moved to add even more by agreeing to buy 108 arrival and departure slots from Continental Airlines for $61 million.
USAir executives defend the fare cuts, saying they are for travel during off-peak periods and are aimed at passengers who might otherwise not fly. "Those are the only price cuts that make sense," said Daniel A. Hersh, a Denver-based airlines analyst with the Kemper Securities Group. "If you impose restrictions and control the seats available on each flight, as USAir is doing, you can generate more revenue when times are bad."
Mr. Hersh also said that Mr. Schofield, who was unavailable for an interview, appears to be "going in the right direction" in striving to reduce the airline's costs, which have long been among the highest in the industry -- in part because of its many short flights.
Another cornerstone of Mr. Schofield's strategy is USAir's acquisition of up to 40 Boeing 757-200 jets from the Boeing Company and the General Electric Capital Corporation. The new planes will add greater economy and flexibility to USAir's fleet. And as part of the deal, G.E. Capital will purchase 15 smaller 737-300's from USAir for $330 million and lease them back, bolstering the airline's cash position.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
The 9.5% Credit Card Bank

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
A week or so ago, big banks -- and Wall Street -- screamed in pain and panic when the Senate considered putting a 14 percent cap on credit card interest rates. How's a bank supposed to make a living, much less a profit, without charging the more typical 18, 19, 20 percent?
Simple, says Robert C. Dill, executive vice president and marketing director of Simmons First National Bank of Pine Bluff, Ark., one of the banks that regularly appears at the top of lists of low-interest cards. 
 "We are interested only in good credit risks -- people who have a habit of paying bills," said Mr. Dill, adding, "If you don't have excellent credit, it is unlikely you will get a card from Simmons." Those who do get one have to pay an annual fee ($25) and forgo the 24-hour access to account information that the big card issuers provide.
Mr. Dill and his bank are, contentedly, of the "when you've got a lemon, make lemonade" school: Arkansas has some of the nation's most stringent usury laws, mandated by the state Constitution. Banks may charge no more than five percentage points above the Federal discount rate; at the moment, interest on Simmons's Visa and Mastercard is 9.5 percent. 
Because of the rate limit, Simmons was never tempted into competing for the higher credit risks whose inability to pay during hard times is now giving the bigger issuers grief. As a result, Simmons's write-off rate for uncollectible accounts is less than one-third the national average. Simmons's 161,000 active credit card accounts constitute 39 percent of its loan portfolio, and an "important part of the profitability" of the $600 million bank, Mr. Dill said.
A 48-year-old native Arkansan, Mr. Dill has been with Simmons for 25 years, long enough to remember the last time people were so concerned about card rates, at the end of the Carter Administration. Simmons got so much attention then that it finally had to cut off out-of-state applicants.
Such a move may be necessary again. Simmons normally gets 2,500 to 3,000 requests a day for credit card applications. Since the rate-cap debate began, it has been getting four to five times that many.
"If you turn and look out your window toward Arkansas," Mr. Dill said, "you will probably see the smoke rising from our switchboard."

HEADLINE: Will the Recession Always Be With Us?

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
A year ago, when the economy tipped into recession, most economists were quick to say the downturn would be atypically short and shallow. They forecast a couple of quarters of negative growth brought on by uncertainty in the Persian Gulf and the looming war with Iraq.
The recession was on the shortish side, as Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities and Donald Ratacjczak of Georgia State University predicted 10 months ago in this space. It lasted barely three quarters before the White House declared it over, though the National Bureau of Economic Research -- the official referee of recessions -- has yet to make the call. 
 But the recession was not shallow. With a 2.8 percent contraction in the first quarter of 1991, it was not much different than the average post-World War II recession.
But the real concern now is the weakness of the recovery -- predicted here last year by A. Gary Shilling, an economic consultant -- which is far from normal. According to the Commerce Department, growth returned in the third quarter of the year, but with a whimper, not a roar. Gross national product grew by a modest 2.4 percent, far below the average rate for most postwar recoveries.
"In eight of the last 10 recoveries, first-year real GNP growth averaged 6.7 percent," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. "Two recoveries had growth rates of just 2 or 3 percent -- in 1970 and 1980. They were short lived," he said.
Such a poor showing so far has caused some economists to worry that the economy may "double dip," -- a less-than-technical way of saying the country may topple back into its slump. "The odds of a double dip are 50-50," Mr. Sinai said.
Consumers are worried too. The monthly Consumer Confidence Survey by the Conference Board, a business group, shows consumers growing more jittery each month since the end of the war in the Persian Gulf.
But what concerns economists most about confidence is the category called "expectations." It rates how people feel about their business and employment prospects. It is directly related to the way they spend. When consumers feel chipper, as they did in 1985 when the overall index hit 100, they buy, fueling growth. The overall index fell to 60.4 in October, its lowest level since January. "The October reading is down quite a bit," said Fabian Linden, the survey director. "It says the economy is still in a bit of a mess."
Slacking consumer confidence prompted concern at the White House. Last week, President Bush called a group of reporters to his office to remind them of some of the economy's strengths. "Inflation is down. Interest rates are down. Personal debt is down. Inventories are down," Mr. Bush said. He reminded them of the growth in exports and attributed the current gloominess about the economy to bad press.
No economist disputes Mr. Bush on these numbers. The economy has recovered, but too slowly. "It may sound trite," said Mr. Levy, "But 2.4 percent is not enough growth to lift all boats."
Financial services, real estate and business related services are still stuck on the shoals and the automobile industry is stumbling through its worst year of losses ever. Though housing starts jumped 7.4 percent in September, the housing industry is likely to have its first year since World War II with fewer than 1 million housing starts.
Ordinarily, Congress and the Administration can spark growth in a recovery through increased spending or by cutting taxes. This time, however, the government is constrained. A year ago in September, the White House hammered out a budget agreement with Congress that included spending cuts and a tax increase aimed at reducing the Federal deficit. Rather than provide the economy with a fiscal kick, those measures, some economists now say, helped nudge the economy into its slump.
The budget agreement "was a drag on growth," said Mr. Ratajczak. Nevertheless, it remains in place. "You probably need fiscal stimulus to really get growth going," he said. Mr. Ratajczak and many of his colleagues, are now less worried about the deficit than they are about sluggishness in the economy. "When you have a $300 billion deficit, what's another $20 billion?" he said.
One effect of the budget agreement has been to shift the entire responsibility for an economic rebound onto the shoulders of the Federal Reserve Board. Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has pushed down the interest rates it controls. The discount rate -- the rate the Fed charges banks for overnight borrowing -- dropped from 7 percent in January to the current 4.5 percent.
The prime rate has followed, down to 7.5 percent from 10 percent last year. With so many outstanding loans at variable rates, the rate drops have put money into the pockets of the consumer, as much as $50 billion, by some estimates. But with nervous consumers unwilling to spend, those dollars remain idle.
So what's ahead for the economy?
Mr. Shilling's model, which operates under the assumption that there is too much debt in the economy, thinks the economy will flail for another year before it recovers, providing a double-dip recession. Mr. Levy, who sees the economy drained of its vitality by three years of weak corporate profits, foresees lackluster growth with low inflation. Mr. Ratajczak's numbers show the recovery picking up slowly through the fourth quarter of 1993, with interests rates holding steady. Mr. Ratacjczak foresees a recovery, but without much oomph.
 
 
NO ,SAY THREE EXPERTS, BUT THE FIX WON'T BE QUICK

 
 
MICKEY D. LEVY
 
Chief economist, CRT Government Securities in New York.
The good news is there will be no "double dip," according to Mr. Levy. The recession really is over. But the bad news is that the recovery will be anemic and growth will be slow. "We're in an elongated trough," said Mr. Levy. That means any recovery will be uneven. Services, in Mr. Levy's view, will miss much of the recovery -- especially financial services, real estate and business services like accounting. Retail trade will rebound -- modestly. Exports should continue with some strength, so the Midwest will continue to outperform the East. "The economy will now start moving sideways," Mr. Levy said. The economy's problems began even before the recession. In mid-1989, "profit margins were being squeezed and employment growth was slowing," he said. That burden makes it likely the economy will remain virtually flat through the first quarter of 1992, then expand slowly.
 
 
DONALD RATAJCZAK
 
Director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University, Atlanta.
Mr. Ratajczak thinks growth in the gross national product will be sluggish -- a slim 1.0 percent in the first quarter -- accompanied by a gradual increase in inflation. "We've stopped building apartments for so long now, rental rates will pick up, fueling some inflation," he said. Energy prices are also expected to rise moderately. Later in the year, growth inches up to 1.2 percent in the second quarter and gradually makes its way to a lackluster 2.3 in the third quarter of the year. "Nothing's moving in the economy," Mr. Ratajczak said. In his view, a change in the habits of the consumer is part of the problem. "The consumer is downsizing his expectations," he said. Part of the reason for reluctance among consumers to shop the malls, is that they are uncomfortable with their current level of debt. "Consumers are scared about the future," Mr. Ratajczak said.
 
 
A. GARY SHILLING
 
President of an economic consulting firm in Springfield N.J., that bears his name.
Mr. Shilling has been gloomy about the economy for quite some time, and his economic model is forecasting a double-dip recession with unemployment climbing to almost 10 percent. The nation will slip back into a slump, Mr. Shilling says, by the first quarter. "The principal reason for the double dip is the debt overload. It's a balance-sheet recession. The first one since the 1930's," he said. Mr. Shilling says the economy will not make it to higher ground until at least the end of 1992. What might help push things along is "an across the board tax cut of 5 percent or 10 percent like there was in 1975," he said. "Congress shouldn't take time to rejigger the rates, just cut taxes and link the cuts to some offsetting cuts in defense." Though that might throw some sand in the bottom of the trough, so the decline would be more shallow, the nation's overall level of indebtedness would prevent growth from being robust.

Battle Shapes Up Over One of America's Last Areas of Dominance 

Jacques Attali, the French economist and philosopher, said America really only leads the world in computers and commercial aviation. In aviation, he said, it has a near monopoly. That's what keeps America competitive. But last week McDonnell Douglas decided to sell off 40 percent of its commercial airplane business for about $2 billion to a Taiwanese investor group that includes that country's government. A lot of people began wondering. Would McDonnell Douglas be forced to use Taiwanese suppliers? Would Taiwan's government subsidize it to the detriment of rival Boeing? "Without this alliance and international risk-sharing partners, we will be unable to grow as a commercial aircraft company," said John F. McDonnell, the company's chairman. That may be so, but Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, fired off a letter to President Bush questioning the deal. Twenty eight Senators co-signed. Hearings are planned; the deal could still unravel.
 
 
A Very Sober Look at Salomon
 
Marred by a summer's worth of scandals, Salomon Brothers Inc. is seeking to redefine its image. Last week, the word on the Street was that Solly would dismiss as many as 135 professionals. "People are just stunned," one Wall Street executive said. As many as 15 managing directors are also expected to go by the end of the year. That could change Solly's direction, since managing directors are the executives who set the firm's policy. The employees who remain are to refocus the firm on its core bond trading business, observers say. Scheduled for paring down: Solly's global equities, investment banking and real estate businesses.
 
 
Big Deal in Desktops
 
One of the largest contracts for small computers went to two little-known companies last week. The Compuadd Corporation of Austin, Tex., and Sysorex Information Systems Inc., of Falls Church, Va., will share a $1 billion contract from the Defense Department to build desktop computers based on Intel's i286, i386 and i486 chips. Compuadd -- which did not turn in the lowest bid -- has had experience with the Pentagon before. During the Persian Gulf buildup, it shipped $30 million worth of computers to the gulf from Texas in just six weeks. That impressed military leaders. Zenith Data Systems and Apple Computer Inc. were among the losers.


Cadillac's Recharged Pizzazz
 
Cadillac once touted itself as as the "standard of the world." Then came a host of competitors from across the seas, Europeans and Japanese nibbling away at Caddy's market and its image. Enter the new Seville and Eldorado models -- in the $32,500 to $38,500 range. They received rave reviews from the auto press for styling and (yes) technology. Drivers praised their nimbleness -- no land yachts, these. Best of all, the buyers are a baby-faced average of 44 years old -- 20 years younger than Caddy's typical customer. Now Cadillac has a problem it hasn't had in years: Too many orders, too few cars. The company said it would rather sell fewer cars than risk quality. "When you succeed in drawing people into the showroom," said Susan Jacobs of Jacobs Automotive, a consulting firm in Little Falls, N.J., "you have to capitalize and start building word of mouth and the car's visibility on the road." But that's a problem Cadillac can live with -- at least for now.
 
 
Orion After Allen
 
Orion -- the constellation, that is -- still has three bright stars in its belt. The Orion Pictures Corporation, the cash-starved studio owned largely by John W. Kluge, has lost at least one: Woody Allen moved to the Sony Corporation's TriStar Pictures last summer. Orion lost $48.1 million last quarter. Last week, Orion said it would delay the release of 12 films until next year. One of those is "Shadows and Fog," Orion's last film by Mr. Allen.

 
Door Closes on Clifford
 
Aside from the money that was lost, one of the greatest tragedies of the Bank of Commerce and Credit International scandal was the damage done to the reputation of Clark M. Clifford, a former Defense Secretary and Presidential adviser. Not only did the scandals sully Mr. Clifford's name, they caused his law firm, Clifford & Warnke, to shut down. Last week, Clifford & Warnke's wood panelled-offices, with their view of the White House, were put up for lease.


A Potential Winner for Merck
 
If a new drug does what two years of tests show it can do, it may prove to be a boon not only for heart patients but for Merck & Company. Merck's drug, called Mevacor, appears to halt and even reverse the buildup of fatty blockages in the arteries that can cause heart disease. Mevacor is already used to lower cholesterol levels. Last week Merck said it would seek approval of Mevacor as a plaque remover.


MCA Shifts Image a Bit
 
When Japanese companies bought studios in Hollywood, some wondered if it would change the way films portray Japan. Now they may be finding out. MCA Inc., now owned by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company of Japan, had a film in the works called "Mr. Baseball" before Matsushita bought it. The movie was about an American ballplayer in Japan. But last year the film was rewritten.That's common enough. But the emphasis was changed to incorporate Japanese values.Some jokes about World War II were dropped. Tom Pollack, chairman of Universal Pictures, said, "There was absolutely no involvement by Matsushita." The changes were made to lure Japanese viewers -- not to please Hollywood's new bosses.
 
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Stripped-Down Banking Bills
 
The banking bills passed last week in the Senate and House were as stripped down as they come. For nearly a year, Congress has whittled away at the Administration's plans. Out went the proposal to let banks write insurance policies and underwrite securities. Out went the plan to let industrial companies own banks. The Senate version lets banks open branches nationally; the House version does not. Together, the measures do little more than give the battered bank insurance fund, now down to its last $5 billion, access to as much as $70 billion for bailing out ailing banks. The Administration is not pleased.

 
Forget the Credit Card Cap
 
Even before the threat of a Presidential veto was raised, Congress lost its nerve about setting a cap on credit card interest rates. Its reasoning went as follows: Sure, banks have spreads that are wider than ever -- they pay 7 percent or less for the money they borrow but lend it at 18 percent or more to credit card holders. But those spreads contribute about the only profits the badly battered banking system now has. And even those profits are shrinking. Adherents of the proposal slunk away. Not to lose face, Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said the House would undertake a "study," of the plan to cap rates.
 
 
Bush: What Problems?
 
President Bush told a group of reporters last week that he believes the economy is sound. The problem, Mr. Bush said, was bad public relations about a good economy. "You see, there's some fairly good fundamentals getting out there," he said. Mr. Bush referred to the low inflation rate, falling interest rates and the strength of America's exports. But he did not refer to growth, which has been paltry. Mr. Bush met with several economists last week. Critics of Mr. Bush, including Senator Lloyd Bensten, Democrat of Texas, say more must be done than simply letting interest rates slide. Try tax cuts, they say.Many economists agree. "Monetary policy alone won't do it," said Alan Sinai of the Boston Company. "Bad as the deficit is, the economy is worse."


An Upward Blip in Housing
 
To the economic mavens who peruse the statistics looking for signs of life, housing seems to be a bright spot. According to the Commerce Department, housing starts in October jumped 7.3 percent, the biggest gain in eight months. That comes after a decline of 3.3 percent in September. "The primary factor behind the increase is lower mortgage interest rates," said Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. "We do have a recovery, the problem is its not as strong as the ones we've seen in the past."
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL


Hungry for Imports Again
 
The Commerce Department said last week that the trade deficit grew to $6.79 billion in September. Imports rose 3.2 percent while exports were up just 3 percent. The disparity between the two numbers suggests that America -- climbing ever so slowly out of its slump -- is starting to hanker for imported goods while the rest of the world, which is beginning to slow down, is not as hungry for the gadgets Americans produce. The sore spot continues to be Japan. The deficit with Japan grew 11 percent, to $4.18 billion.
 

The Parts Make Up Soviet Debt
 
Alexander Hamilton correctly grasped that the creditworthiness of the fledgling United States depended on the new government shouldering the foreign debts of the original 13 colonies. The fragmenting Soviet Union is trying to do the same thing, with a twist. Eight of the 12 republics, including Russia but not the Ukraine, have decided to make good on the entire $80 billion in foreign debt owed by the union. The republics told this to a Moscow gathering of finance ministers from the world's seven wealthiest nations. They were hoping that such an agreement would get the G-7 to extend more credit to Moscow. Maybe it will, but the offer presupposes that the republics can pay back those loans. That is still a big unknown.

Last week, the Soviet Union's major foreign creditors, agreed to defer repayment of that country's loans for up to a year.

 
Pressures on Maxwell's World
 
For Robert Maxwell's heirs -- and the businesses he left behind -- the pressure is mounting. The Swiss Bank Corporation said last week it was demanding repayment of a loan of 55 million (about $98.8 million at current rates) to a private company controlled by the Maxwell family. The big Swiss bank wants a repayment plan within 10 days. Other creditors are also demanding action on millions of dollars of outstanding loans. Last week, another group of creditors asked leaders of the Maxwell family's businesses to attend a meeting, bringing statements disclosing the condition of their finances. This is something new. It used to be that all initiatives came from Mr. Maxwell.

Barking Back Again for Big Oil

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
These are tough times to be a lobbyist for big oil. Oil and gas supply most of America's energy, but the public and Congress, far from grateful, want the job done with less pollution. The industry's image was so hurt by the Exxon Valdez spill and last year's sharp run-up in the price of gasoline -- even if that was Saddam Hussein's fault -- that oil companies have offered little resistance at times to their critics.
As the deadlines set by last year's Clean Air Act loom closer, however, the industry is complaining louder, and near the head of the pack is Charles J. DiBona, the president of the American Petroleum Institute since 1979. 
 Mr. DiBona has been saying more and more bluntly lately that some of the new requirements for cleaner-burning fuels will produce very little benefit for the environment, and at very great cost. He uses the recession as a cue.
"How many more inefficiencies can be imposed on the U.S. economy," he said in a speech at the institute's annual meeting here last week, "before the ultimate costs, in a more competitive world, are recognized? When will common sense be applied in evaluating the costs and benefits of proposed regulation? And more specifically, how much more damage will be done to this great industry before policy makers recognize the heavy price being paid for outlandish proposals?"
Mr. DiBona, whose organization is based in Washington, is also trying to capitalize on a general political alienation. "People are clearly angered with the way politics has been played in Washington and in state capitals across the country," he said.
The politics are strong within his organization, too. The petroleum institute represents companies in two different kinds of work -- drilling for oil, and then refining and selling it -- whose interests often differ.
But last week the audience, 1,700 oil executives, loved every word of Mr. DiBona's speech. His message will not play as well in the hearing rooms of Washington and the state capitals, though. The Senate just voted against considering opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling, and the states are rushing to adopt stricter and stricter emission standards on cars and trucks, which consume most of the nation's oil.
Mr. DiBona, 59 years old, is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford. He served as deputy director of the White House Energy Policy Office under President Nixon and joined the A.P.I. in 1974 as executive vice president and chief operating officer. He is now in charge of a big shop, with a staff of nearly 500, divided between Washington and 33 state councils, and a budget of $65.5 million.

HEADLINE: Polaroid's Russian Success Story

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: OBNINSK, U.S.S.R.

 BODY:
To Soviet factory managers, whose lives are made miserable by ramshackle machinery and a lack of raw materials, the Polaroid Corporation's circuit-board operation here must seem like a mirage.
Tucked into one corner of a glum, fortress-like factory building, Polaroid's five brightly lit, freshly painted rooms hum with gleaming American machinery, an abundant supply of precision parts and 70 workers hunched intently over their workstations. 
 Located 60 miles south of Moscow, the Polaroid factory, which produces 70,000 circuit boards a month for the company's instant cameras, is one of the few American manufacturing operations in the Soviet Union. And despite the myriad hassles of doing business here -- the bureaucratic nightmares, the growing political disarray, the archaic phone system, the nearly worthless currency -- Polaroid boasts that the factory is as efficient as its other plants around the world.
"Many of my friends say it's impossible to get quality production in the Soviet Union," said Edward Doyle, technical director of Polaroid's Soviet operations. "I just invite them to this place."
The factory, the centerpiece of Polaroid's Soviet venture, shows that doing business in the land of Lenin need not be the no-win nightmare that many American companies fear, but can lead to modest success and, perhaps someday, even more than that. Polaroid's joint venture also includes a small plant in Moscow that assembles Polaroid cameras and a shop there that sells 24,000 instant cameras and 250,000 packs of film a year.
The Obninsk factory is a model of what many Soviet and Western officials say is needed to pull the rickety, obsolete Soviet economy into the 21st century. Demonstrating how vital foreign investment is, the factory has created jobs, introduced high-technology equipment and served as a showplace for Western production techniques, like quality control. A proud example: less than one-half of 1 percent of the circuit boards made here have defects while, by many estimates, other Soviet boards have a 10 percent defect rate -- and are notorious for catching fire.
 
'Oasis in the Desert'
 "You might say this is an oasis in the desert," said Gennadi Lisitsin, a technical director for Polaroid's principal joint venture partner, the Soviet Ministry of Atomic Energy. "Everyone knows the level of technology in the West is higher, and this enables us to learn a lot more about making circuit boards."
While it is nice to build an oasis, Polaroid executives would prefer to see the whole Soviet economic desert bloom so they could conduct business without all the trials and tribulations. They are frustrated about accumulating mountains of rubles that cannot be converted into hard currency to repatriate to their headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. They have all but given up trying to obtain raw materials domestically because Soviet enterprises cannot guarantee a steady supply of anything, except grief. They complain that the Government is in such a muddle that they cannot find any officials willing to stick their necks out to grant Polaroid much-needed additional office space.
What is more, Polaroid's joint venture has had to hire a person just to make deals with collective farms for eggs, meat and other essentials for its workers. Otherwise, many employees would have to skip work to forage for such things.
Recognizing the difficulties of doing business here, Polaroid is pursuing what management consultants say is the wise course of action for Western companies: start small, test the waters, get to know the territory and be ready to expand when the Soviet economy turns around, which could be a long time coming. In this immense country, where it usually takes at least a month to get a roll of film developed, Polaroid sees unlimited opportunities for its cameras.
"We're dedicated to spreading our technology among the people," said George Marquart, managing director of Polaroid's Soviet operation. To pursue that goal, Polaroid set up the joint venture in July 1989, investing $3 million in cash and equipment, while the Atomic Energy ministry and two other Soviet partners contributed a total of $3 million worth of office, retail, factory and living space. The venture grew out of a friendship between a former Polaroid chairman and a leading Soviet atomic scientist.
Mr. Marquart, an American citizen whose stepfather was a Russian nobleman, is one of the rare foreigners who could not be happier working here. He was born in Estonia 55 years ago, fled with his family in 1941, and spent his teen-age years in Nyack, N.Y., speaking Russian at home. A tall, white-haired man with gentle eyes, he is thrilled to be in the Soviet Union to witness -- and participate in -- its metamorphosis from Marxism to a market economy.
 
In the Vanguard
 Mr. Marquart, who has a touch of the missionary in him, is proud that Polaroid is in the vanguard of American manufacturers here and often tries to persuade other Western companies to lend a hand rebuilding a nation held back by decades of Communism. A few other American consumer products companies, including Tambrands and Johnson Wax, also have plants here, and the number could rise as the 12 remaining Soviet republics move to market economies.
Still, the line to visit Lenin's tomb remains far longer than the line of Western companies waiting to set up shop here. "By and large, few foreign businessmen like working here," said Mr. Marquart. "There are all kinds of difficulties. The place is filthy. It's falling apart. The roads are bad."
But for Polaroid, a land of 290 million people starved of consumer goods makes eminent sense. With Polaroid's instant camera sales falling to 4.5 million last year worldwide from a peak of 13 million in 1978, the company sees this as a potential pasture of plenty.
Mr. Marquart said Polaroid, which has annual worldwide sales of $2 billion, could easily sell 2.4 million cameras a year here rather than 24,000. The company is strictly limiting the amount of cameras and film it sells until it figures out how to generate more hard currency.
Rather than open its doors to all comers, Polaroid sells its cameras only to workers at enterprises that first write to request cameras for their employees. Even with this method, there is a two-year waiting list to buy the 635 CL cameras. They sell for 500 rubles, about the average monthly wage for a Moscow factory worker. This represents about $10 at the official commercial exchange rate, while these cameras typically sell for $35 in the United States.
 
Paving the Way
 "The demand for our product is so high that we cannot simply open our doors and sell our cameras or we would be trampled to death," said Mr. Marquart. Polaroid hopes to populate the Soviet Union with its cameras to create a huge demand for its highly profitable film.
Each morning several dozen eager Muscovites whose numbers have been called line up in front of Polaroid's shop on Leninskii Prospekt shortly before it opens. The store is far different from the typical drab, humdrum Soviet shop: it is immaculate, the salespeople are courteous and handsome blown-up photos of Soviet beach scenes adorn the walls.
"These cameras have so many good qualities," said one buyer, Dimitri Yemulianov. "They make pictures immediately, which is something we haven't had before. A lot of people develop pictures themselves, which is hard because of all the equipment and chemicals you need."
Polaroid assembles the cameras in a factory a mile south of the Moscow shop, using 44 parts and 5 subassemblies sent from its plants around the world. The Moscow factory, located in a technical school, has eight engineers who do the manual assembly.
At first glance, this seems like a crazy proposition: importing components for hard currency from Western countries, assembling them here and then selling them for worthless rubles. Polaroid executives admit that selling cameras here is a drain on hard currency, but that at least for now, there is no other way to distribute their cameras.
The Obninsk factory helps offset the hard currency drain by exporting its circuit boards for dollars to a huge Polaroid assembly plant near Glasgow. Each board, which controls a camera's electronic flash, brings in $1.50 in hard-currency profit.
"Every dollar we make will be reinvested in new camera parts and film to help us expand," said Mr. Marquart. When Polaroid set up the joint venture, it agreed to reinvest all its profits for five years. Nonetheless, it is straining to build up export projects to create a steady stream of hard-currency profits to repatriate after five years.
Although Polaroid is not in the plastics business, it is setting up a 110-worker factory in Estonia that aims to export each year 10 million plastic cases that hold videocassettes. In addition, Polaroid plans to almost double Obninsk's circuit-board production to more than 120,000 a month.
While production at most Soviet factories is plummeting, Polaroid is bullish about its Obninsk expansion plans because the operation is already going so smoothly. Every six weeks, Polaroid trucks leave Amsterdam to bring all the parts needed to build circuit boards. It is a far cry from the Soviet system, where suppliers rarely have what other factories need, and when they do, often demand five times the usual price.
"In the Soviet Union, the supply situation is very complicated," said Vladimir Ponomarev, production manager of the circuit-board operation. "With Polaroid, this is all taken care of."
Polaroid executives selected this soft-spoken 37-year-old engineer to head production because of his ability to think independently and work with people. Like the other 81 workers and managers in the circuit-board unit, he used to work elsewhere in the drab factory building making control instruments for nuclear power plants.
 
'This Is Good Work'
 The Polaroid operation is laid out neatly. In one room, a shiny American machine inserts 31 tiny parts onto the 3-inch-by-1.5-inch circuit boards. In another, 20 women sit around two U-shaped tables adding larger parts by hand. The rooms look out on a sea of white birches on the outskirts of Obninsk, a city of 150,000 known for having the world's first commercial nuclear reactor.
"This is good work," said Tamara Belibezeba, who helps prepare the circuit boards for soldering. "I have a guaranteed job. It's interesting. And the work is well organized."
In the room behind her is Polaroid's technological piece de resistance: a $300,000 machine that forms a precisely measured wave of solder that is splashed onto the back of the circuit boards. Workers continuously monitor the machine to make sure it is applying neither too much nor too little solder. Nonetheless, because of uneven soldering, about 5 percent of the circuit boards must be retouched.
"The problem with this work is that it's monotonous," said Alec Dimitric, who monitors some of the equipment. "It's the same thing all day long. On our old jobs, we at least did different things each day."
These workers are for the first time seeing up close the pros and cons of Western mass production. On the pro side, they earn about 15 percent more than workers employed elsewhere in the factory building.
"The more they produce, the more they earn," said Mr. Ponomarev. "It's a good system because people see the results of their labor right away. It's reflected in their check at the end of the month."
Polaroid is delighted with the workers' dedication and the quality of production. "I have never had to reject a single lot of circuit boards," said Mr. Doyle, the technical director.
Polaroid originally hoped to vastly increase the profits of its circuit-board operation by obtaining most components from lower-cost Soviet sources, rather than from the hard-currency West. "But we haven't had any success," said Mr. Doyle, "because we can't buy plastics or obtain precision tools."
Mr. Marquart said that despite such problems the joint venture is making a small profit on annual revenues of about $3 million, when rubles and dollars are combined. He hopes, once hard currency profits can be repatriated, to increase earnings by selling other Polaroid products here, including machines that do medical imaging and take passport photos.
 
Dual Missions
 All this is helping Mr. Marquart fulfill his two missions: make money for Polaroid and help rebuild this crumbling nation. Having begun but never finished studies to become a minister, Mr. Marquart sometimes sounds as if he is giving a sermon when he talks about the importance of Western investment here.
"It seems that all the Western aid plans ignore the fundamental situation that exists today, and that is the total and absolute bankruptcy of this country," he said. "Its currency is worthless. It has no significant technologies and no significant pool of financial or managerial people."
He said that since deficit-strapped Western governments were likely to grant only limited aid, it was crucial for companies to invest here.
"Pulling yourself up by your bootstraps," he said, "can take a long time, and involve instability in this part of the world for a very long time. If foreign companies could bring jobs, new products and technology over here on a large scale, that would be a big help."
Fortunately for Mr. Marquart, Polaroid's Soviet joint venture seems to be doing good and doing well at the same time.
 
 
THE NEW SOVIET WORKER
 Are Soviet workers the loafers and louts they are reputed to be? Judging from Polaroid's experience, the answer is mostly no.
Polaroid executives have taken pains to arrange their factories and offices so they are vastly different from Soviet ones. The Polaroid workplaces are bright and cheerful, the equipment doesn't break down, supplies are available and there are financial incentives to be productive. By contrast, many Soviet workers take a "who cares?" attitude because their machines often don't work and raw materials are lacking.
"The word is the Russians don't know how to work and can't make quality products," said George Marquart, head of Polaroid's Soviet operations. "The reason is they haven't been in a position to work for something meaningful."
For years, the Soviets have worked for hollow rubles that bought them only the barest and drabbest necessities.
Polaroid pays high wages and helps its workers obtain food and clothing. "Productivity and quality are not a question for us," Mr. Marquart said.
For training, Polaroid has flown a dozen employees to the United States and Scotland to learn about teamwork, quality control and other production techniques.
"When I was with Soviet enterprises, I never received any training," said Yuri Bezotosny, an engineer in Polaroid's Moscow camera assembly plant. This gregarious 36-year-old hopes to become a marketing manager when Polaroid expands here, but for now he is a bit frustrated, assembling cameras by hand.
Polaroid pays him 1,000 rubles a month, twice the average for Moscow factory workers, but still just $20 at current exchange rates. Expressing sympathy for his workers, Edward Doyle, Polaroid's technical director here, said, "One problem in this country is everyone seems to be overqualified but underpaid."
 
 
 
ADVISING OTHER COMPANIES TO GO IT ALONE
 Hoping to attract many other American companies to the Soviet Union, George Marquart, the head of Polaroid's operations here, is eager to give advice to all who will listen.
Mr. Marquart, one of the first Americans to set up a factory in the Soviet Union, said foreign investors must be ready to tolerate some rough going. The Soviet Union, he said, is in such bad shape that investors have to provide all the equipment and technology and can rely on the Soviets for only the people and the buildings.
When Polaroid began manufacturing cameras and circuit boards here two years ago, it could only do so by forming a joint venture with Soviet partners. Investment laws have since been liberalized, allowing Westerners to acquire 100 percent of a Soviet enterprise or to set up shop without a partner.
Mr. Marquart recommends that foreigners eschew the joint venture route. Today the important thing is to have full control, he said. Some Western companies -- but not Polaroid, company executives say -- have been hampered by Soviet partners who do not understand market thinking or have been immobilized by the nation's political and economic chaos.
Still, Mr. Marquart said, foreign companies coming here will probably need to find some Soviets to guide them. A Westerner coming in without any ties will have a hard time getting space, phones and raw materials, he said.
In his view, it is important for American executives here to be able to speak Russian.
"Companies will tell you that their greatest asset is their people," Mr. Marquart said. "I say it's not just people, but people with the ability to communicate. If they can't communicate in the country where they are working, you have a real problem."

An Open Forum Sets Off Debate On Racial Issues

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, Tex.

 BODY:
Angry exchanges between the dean of students at Southwestern University and the College Republicans, a student group, have generated campuswide discussions over racism and affirmative action. The talks flared into heated disputes during a recent debate of the issues.
About 350 students, faculty members and administrators attended the open forum at which Dinesh d'Souza, author of "Illiberal Education," argued that scholarships should be based on socio-economic need, not on race, and that multicultural curriculums are so politicized that they shut off discussion. His opponent, Evan Carton, an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin, insisted that Mr. d'Souza was the spokesman for a predominantly white, male and monied crowd. 
 University administrators said it was one of the largest such gatherings in their memory. Students welcomed classmates' emotional response. "Things like this debate are the signs of a healthy, thinking campus emerging from a comatose state," said James DeWitt, a sophomore in international studies from Houston.
Angela Sparks, a senior majoring in psychology from Mesa, Ariz., agreed. "There is something changing at Southwestern. People's feelings have gotten hurt from whatever remarks and whatever rumors that sprang from the College Republicans-Dean Ballou issue. That's what made this debate so important. To have a group that large and that vocal at Southwestern is unusual."
The catalyst for the dispute was a poster supplied by the Young Americans Foundation, a national nonprofit organization based in Herndon, Va., which was displayed by College Republicans at a campus recruitment session in late September. The poster said: "Smash apartheid on campus. Resist special privileges based on race," in what the foundation described as an effort to compare special privileges for black students on campus with the special protections afforded whites in South Africa.
In a letter to student groups on campus, the dean of students, Roger Ballou, dean of students, criticized the poster as "elitist," saying it "smacks of white supremacy and does nothing to help push America forward toward a more inclusive and multicultural society."
The displaying of the poster prompted weeks of written criticisms of the College Republicans by Mr. Ballou; verbal ripostes by the College Republicans; angry letters to the editor in the campus newspaper; an apology by Mr. Ballou for a "misconception" about whom he had been criticizing, and a rebuff of the apology. And recently all this led to an article published in The University Review, the conservative student newspaper at the University of Texas in Austin, which has incensed most at Southwestern as an outside incursion into its private affairs.
The article has been criticized by Dean Ballou and Jennifer Imle, the chairwoman of Southwestern's College Republicans, as well as by students on campus as unwarranted and inaccurate.
 
'Its Own Agenda'
 Angelyque Campbell, a senior from Houston majoring in political science and communications, who is chairwoman of the student government, said the article was misleading and would heighten tension on campus. "It seems The Review came to our campus with its own agenda," Ms. Campbell said. "I don't think they actually portrayed the true account of the issue."
Ms. Imle, a sophomore from Houston majoring in political science, said that the Review article "exaggerated a few points" but that "I think that many people who hadn't thought about the issue before have realized its importance."
"We think he should apologize and retract the letter," she said. "The College Republicans think that what he did was an attempt at political correctness."
Southwestern currently has a student population of 1,231, according to the admissions office, with less than 15 percent of them from minority groups.
"We do not have dual-admissions standards," Mr. Gaita said in an interview. "There is no policy written down somewhere saying we practice affirmative action in our admissions standards. We have goals, but we do not have quotas. Some years we meet the goals, some years we don't."

 BODY:
All the patched clothes seen around town recently were not a result of the present recession, nor yet of nostalgia for the Great Depression of the 1930's, when patching clothes was a necessity. Today's patches are all about status and style.
Christian Francis Roth's clothes (at right and far right) have intricate patch inserts that are part of Mr. Roth's designs. 
 Patched jeans have been around since the 1960's. The newer ones are imitating Mr. Roth's more expensive designs with appliqued patches that don't cost as much (center).
And not to be confused with those styles are the rap-style patches with fringed -- or frayed -- edges on denim clothes (below).

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
For Collectors, a Decade to Treasure

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
I HAVE known a lot of neat cars. I have driven Ferraris. I have been at the wheel of the Thomas Flyer that once, back in July 1908, won the New York-to-Paris race. I have ridden down Fifth Avenue in a Hispano-Suisa. But for all that, my pocketbook has never let me be a real player in the world of fancy iron.
Pshaw. There was the '37 Cord convertible, for instance, flamingo pink and strutting around with a price tag of only $2,500. I could have bought the dark green Packard at the farm auction in Quakertown, Pa. My buddy Jim Case traded his '40 Cadillac on a new '54 Ford, and I could have had that lovely Fleetwood sedan real cheap. I should have kept my '36 Ford. 
 Coulda, shoulda, woulda. It is the stuff of life and dreams, and my failings come to mind because of the October issue of a slick classic-car magazine called the du Pont Registry. I could have done without it.
Bill Gillette is actually the guy responsible. He is a former stockbroker, a former New Yorker now transplanted to Tampa, Fla. He is an editor of the Registry, with collateral duty as what the magazine likes to call its "collector-car market analyst." And he set out to compile the rise and fall of neat-car prices over the past decade.
He did it, I think, just to make me feel bad, although he denies that. "I picked the cars at random," he said. "They're just cars that I like, although I threw in some old stuff, some newer stuff. Some snappy, some basic. I wanted something for everybody."
What that something amounts to is a list of 61 automobiles, the eldest being a 1930 Packard roadster and the youngest being a Jag and a Ferrari, both vintage 1974. According to the study, the whole lot could have been purchased for $1.6 million in 1980, while today's price would be close to $22 million.
Over all, it shows an increase in value from 1980 to 1991 of 1,285 percent -- if you include the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO. Without that conspicuously outrageous automobile, the listed increase is a mere 703 percent, but it still makes title to a collector car a gilt-edged security.
A sampling from the magazine's list appears at right, and it indicates that the Ferrari would have cost $65,000 in 1980 while today's price would be $10 million. Gillette cautions, though, that some of the figures, including the GTO's, are high. "You could probably pay the top price," he said, "but it would have to be for a car that Marilyn Monroe made love in and that originally belonged to the Queen of England, who sold it to Elvis Presley."
Whatever the true figures, this seems to be one of the better times to buy. "With the recession, the heavily hyped stuff took it on the nose," Gillette said. "Those cars had been going up by about 200 percent a year, and this is really the first time they've been checked. But prices are off 15 to 40 percent across the board."
The way to start, he said, boils down to one word: research. But it's important, too, to know precisely what you want. "For starters," he said, "you ought to buy something that's fun and that's relatively easy to fix. And remember what they say: When the top goes down, the price goes up."

HEADLINE: Why We Must Help Russia at Brink of Abyss

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Zbigniew Brzezinski may be right in criticizing the Bush Administration for its pro-Gorbachev bias (Op-Ed, Nov. 10). However, his own anti-Gorbachev bias is dangerously misleading. He advocates a "league of sovereign states to replace the fading Soviet center." Otherwise, he thinks, the United States might be opting for "a showdown between Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin." He recommends the United States must deal directly with the republics, thus undercutting the Soviet Government, whose "international responsibilities and nuclear weapons will be inherited by the Russian state." 
 One could hardly imagine any advice more misguided. It is not the "fading center" the republics fear after the failed August coup and the disintegration of the empire, but precisely the giant Russia, which may try to appropriate the place -- and the power -- of the former imperial center. It is against Mr. Yeltsin's Russia, not Mr. Gorbachev's center, that the Ukraine intends to build one of the biggest armies in Europe, complete with nuclear weapons. Why should Russia control the Soviet nuclear arsenals, asks Kazakhstan. And don't forget Byelorussia, riddled with nuclear bases. Is the United States really interested in confronting four nuclear powers instead of one? What about nuclear nonproliferation?
Unfortunately for Mr. Brzezinski, the embarrassing questions do not end there. Somebody has to be responsible for dividing the Soviet debt among the former republics. For coordinating their economic reforms. For serving as a troubleshooter in their conflicts. For keeping those conflicts from turning into waves of Russian refugees, which would undermine reform in Russia and supply Mr. Yeltsin's opponents with a ready-made army of counterreform.
Is there anyone in the former Soviet Union capable of performing any, let alone all of these necessary functions, except Mr. Gorbachev and his "fading center"? As long as the humbled and reduced center devotes itself to these limited but vital functions, there could be no showdown between it and Russia. If only because Mr. Yeltsin needs Mr. Gorbachev as a troubleshooter -- to dispel the fears of the republics, as well as dangerous anti-Russian sentiment, which tends to grow into bloody pogroms.
I found this out firsthand last month when I was included in the governmental delegation of Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak of St. Petersburg to the Republic of Tadzhikistan and participated in difficult negotiations to prevent another bloody riot in Dushanbe. This time we succeeded. But it would be unfair not to point out the major role Mr. Gorbachev's personal authority played in our mission. Paradoxical as it may seem, he is still a powerful force in Soviet Central Asia.
Mr. Brzezinski's recommendations and biases seem irrelevant to the post-August Soviet reality. There is no more Boris Yeltsin or Mikhail Gorbachev in this new reality. The nation is in a veritable revolution. And the stakes are high enough for the former adversaries to join forces against a threat of a complete reversal of everything both stand for. Establishing a credible division of labor between them seems a purpose worth pursuing for United States policy.
Mr. Yeltsin is finally starting Russia on the path of an economic breakthrough many times delayed by Mr. Gorbachev and much feared by the population. The breakthrough is starting amid economic chaos, ethnic strife and consumer panic. If the breakthrough fails, Russia may find itself in the situation of Weimar Germany in the early 1930's.
How to prevent such fateful developments? How to make sure that Russia's rendezvous with destiny does not end in worldwide disaster, and that fascism is not an option? This is the new post-August political agenda we should be discussing, not obsolete recommendations of how to undercut Mr. Gorbachev's "fading center."

HEADLINE: On Not Teaching Children the Wrong Economics Lessons

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a parent of twin 8-year-old sons, I enjoyed "With Allowances, Every Parent Differs" (Consumer's World page, Nov. 2). However, as a lawyer, I have to note that following the suggestions about interest and taxes would send inaccurate, misleading and confusing messages. 
 Since the maximum legal interest rate for personal loans in New York State is 16 percent -- General Obligations Law, Section 5-501, and Banking Law, Section 14(a)(1) -- the interest on a $1 advance on an allowance would be no more than 16 cents a year. As a matter of fact, charging more than 25 percent would be a class E felony (Penal Law, Section 190.40).
Requiring a child to give back $1.10 or $1.20 to impose a small interest rate on a short-term allowance advance would violate the law and teach the child the concept of loan sharking, instead of lending.
As for taxes, the suggestion to put aside allowance money for taxes suffers from several flaws:
(1) To the extent an allowance is a gift, it is nontaxable as to both donor (parent) and recipient (child) at the levels suggested.
(2) If the allowance is income for chores performed or other services rendered, the $3,250 standard deduction would typically cover the entire year's allowance.
Moreover, assessing a "tax" on the first money received at such low levels would be harshly regressive, and inconsistent with the principle of progressive taxation (one pays a higher percentage of one's income as one's income increases) that underlies our income tax structure.
If a parent wants to teach the concept of interest, a useful way is to have the child deposit allowance money in his or her own bank account and watch the interest grow. As for taxes, analysis of a payroll check stub form (with names and numbers omitted) would tell about this reality of economic life.

HEADLINE: 'A War Without Bloodshed'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Too American for Its Own Good?" (Oct. 27) claims Toyota has played by the rules. What rules? I assume your writer refers to following Lee Iacocca's challenge to build plants in the United States and to increasing jobs here and the purchases of American auto parts. But jobs and investment here simply take business from our own automobile producers. 
 International trade is really like war without bloodshed. The objective is to sell as much as possible at the highest possible price and buy little or nothing in return. The Japanese are doing this with great success in our country. They may be expanding their overall productive capacity here to increase their third-world market share for automobiles -- all this while continuing to exert heavy pressure on our automobile manufacturers.
Is there an economic conspiracy by Japan against the United States? Many people believe, as do I, that industries like steel and automobiles have been targeted by Japan. Also there are many who disparage the idea of economic conspiracy in international trade. If a bear that has discovered a honey pot and been joined by a number of his fellows is considered a conspiracy -- so be it.

HEADLINE: Filling the Unmet Labor Needs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Disability Dilemma" (Forum, Nov. 3) points out that employment prospects for people with disabilities are not as good as originally anticipated for white-collar jobs. But American business cannot fill many millions of jobs annually in fast-food chains, department stores and other establishments that require employees for customer contact, technical information processing, telephone marketing and back-room activities.
Most American companies are regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act as an unabashed disaster. The costs and administrative burdens cannot be denied. But some companies have happily recognized the value of hiring the disabled and more will eventually realize that the law has the potential to wipe out a chronic and future shortage of qualified entry-level and skilled labor plaguing businesses. The law also has the potential to turn 43 million formerly disenfranchised disabled citizens into consumers and taxpayers with spending power the economy badly needs.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
For Now, Anyway, Taking Hostages Just Doesn't Pay

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the eight-year ordeal of hostage-taking in Lebanon, the release of Terry Waite and Thomas M. Sutherland last week was a breakthrough.
Mr. Waite, the Anglican Church envoy, was not only the last British hostage to be freed; he was also the most valuable, the one who had been both accused of spying and credited with resolving other Middle East hostage crises. The Iranian-backed captors made predictions that the remaining Western hostages would be freed within weeks or even days and offered concessions -- however hollow -- that the hostage-taking in Lebanon had all been a mistake. Finally, the captors dropped their insistence that Arab prisoners be released by Israel, simplifying matters and essentially dealing the Israelis out of what had been a three-way game. 
 Until five remaining hostages -- including Terry Anderson, the longest-held and best-known American -- go free, any celebration of the end of state-supported hostage-taking in Lebanon will be premature. Even if all are released, there is no certainty that another group at another time will not snatch another Westerner from the Beirut streets. But the phenomenon of taking hostages has changed from the days when zealous captors undaunted by death could damage a Presidency and pervert a country's foreign policy.
It was the relentless public eye on the seizure of the American Embassy in Teheran in 1979 that elevated the tribal practice of seizing captives for ransom to the international stage. Americans saw clusters of angry young men on their television screens screaming "Death to Carter" and burning the American flag in front of the embassy compound. Mr. Carter's desperate use of intermediaries and the ill-fated American military rescue mission in the Iranian desert clearly signaled to the clerical leaders in Teheran the importance of the 52 Americans held captive.
Similarly, the willingness of the Reagan Administration in the mid-1980's to violate its own stated policy and secretly sell arms to Iran in exchange for hostages held in Lebanon showed just how valuable a handful or so of Americans could become. There were unconfirmed reports that the governments of Germany, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and France got their hostages back by paying ransom or making other deals with the captors, moves that would have validated the practice of seizing captives. At one point the captors had the audacity to demand a payment from the French because the cost of feeding and housing their hostages had been so high.
 
Emotional Traps
 To hear the White House explain the most recent four-month flurry of successful United Nations-led negotiations, which resulted in the freeing of six American and British hostages, President Bush contributed to the process by avoiding the kinds of emotional traps his predecessors fell into.
Mr. Bush also got lucky.
To their captors, hostages become little more than commodities whose value rises and falls with external circumstances. In the last year and a half, the hostages in Lebanon simply lost their value.
"While this is not the end of an era, this is the end of a story," said Richard W. Bulliet, professor of Middle East history at Columbia University. "These people may have achieved some intermediate political ends. We don't know what they're getting from Syria or Iran to induce them, but whatever it is, it's enough to satisfy them, to buy them out of the political arena or to move them into different and probably non-terrorist activity."
First, the immediate reason for the capture of some of the hostages in Lebanon -- and a non-negotiable demand for their release -- evaporated overnight. In the confusion of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, 15 prisoners who were jailed in Kuwait for terrorist activities were set free. Suddenly, the captors lost their main rationale for holding the hostages, just as the death of the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi removed a key demand of the Iranians holding the American Embassy that he be tried for his crimes.
Second, Iran, which enjoys considerable, although not total, influence over the captors, decided that its own economic reconstruction and links to the West superseded its aims in Lebanon. Teheran's leaders finally got the message that the United States would do its best to block Iran's economic development as long as there were American hostages in Lebanon.
Third, the collapse of the Soviet Union made it apparent that no Arab country would again have a Soviet-supplied state-of-the-art army or would benefit very much from Moscow's patronage. Syria, which for years had used Lebanon as a playground for its own terrorist aims, decided to buy into games played by American rules: the coalition in the gulf war and the Arab-Israeli peace process.
 
Restoring Stability
 Fourth, a Syrian-Lebanese treaty of cooperation gave Syria greater control over Lebanese affairs, helping to restore stability to the country. "Part of hostage-taking was to build prestige, popular support and a connection with important countries," said Shibley Telhami, associate professor of government at Cornell University.
"When radical groups were fully engaged in a civil war and competing for popular allegiance, hostage-taking was one of the easiest ways for them to make names for themselves. But now Syria's dominant role in Lebanon and American acquiescence in allowing Syria to play that role have converged to create a different domestic situation. The captors have found themselves increasingly isolated, in a position of declining assets and no future."
Still, there is no fundamental transformation of many of the goals that contributed to hostage-taking in the first place: bridging the gap between rich and poor, reducing the influence of the United States in the region and creating a military balance of power with Israel.
And even with the promises of freedom for the remaining hostages, there are spoilers calling for their continued captivity. Infuriated by Washington's efforts to staunch the flow of any nuclear technology to Teheran, the newspaper Salaam last week called the release of Mr. Waite and Mr. Sutherland a "miscalculation."
Hojatolislam Mousavi Khoeiniha, the Iranian cleric who edits the newspaper, has considerable knowledge about hostages. For the 444 days that the American Embassy in Teheran was held, he served as spiritual guide to the captors.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Racial Politics: Back With a Vengeance

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
RACE-RELATED issues are a staple of modern politics, but rarely has the subject seemed as raw or as close to the surface as it does now, as the country heads into the 1992 campaign.
Some political professionals say racial issues may be more prominent in this election than they have been in 20 years, when the painful battles over busing and civil rights, and the candidacies of George Wallace, kept the subject front and center in Presidential politics. 
 This time, the issue is fueled by hard economic times, by the emergence of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who may run for President next year, and by the rulings of a conservative Supreme Court that has reopened the political debate over affirmative action and racial preferences -- just as it reopened the debate over abortion.
In the political world, among those who plan and man presidential campaigns, there is anger and suspicion all around. Democrats, some of whom feel they have paid a heavy electoral price for championing civil rights and affirmative action over the years, accuse Republicans of fanning racial fears to build up white majorities. Republicans assert that Democrats cry racism to stifle legitimate debate over issues like racial preferences, because they know that most Americans disagree with them.
But some of the sharpest divisions over racial policies are within the Republican Party. The powerful cross-currents surrounding President Bush were reflected last week by the Administration's strange and conflicted handling of new civil rights legislation, a bill overruling several recent court decisions that made it harder to sue for job discrimination.
The legislation, a compromise produced after a two-year battle between Congress and the White House, was expected to defuse the so-called quota issue for the 1992 campaign, but even as Mr. Bush moved to sign the bill, his legal counsel, C. Boyden Gray, was circulating a draft policy statement that would have rolled back some critical affirmative action policies covering the Federal Government and related Federal contractors. The Gray document was quickly and widely assailed as an extraordinary retreat on policies dating back to 1965, and Mr. Bush just as quickly disavowed it.
But the week left the President in a hard spot. Many conservatives remain outraged that he signed what they still believe is a quota bill, although Mr. Bush contends that it is not. The argument could be pressed next year by both Mr. Duke and Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator now considering a primary challenge to the President. Richard Viguerie, a conservative direct-mail specialist and fundraiser, asserted, "He signed a quota bill and we're going to hang it around his neck."
 
Republican Fissures
 At the same time, supporters of the civil rights legislation remain wary that the White House will, once again, try to undermine it.
Kevin Phillips, a conservative strategist, argues that Mr. Bush will increasingly feel these strains in the Republican coalition. Higher-income suburban whites are embarrassed and put off by the use of issues like racial quotas, or Willie Horton, the black convicted murderer used by Mr. Bush in 1988 as a symbol of Democratic softness on crime, Mr. Phillips said. At the same time, the analyst said, frustrated working-class whites seem ripe for campaigns against racial preferences, and there are some within the party who argue that such campaigns are justified and wholly legitimate.
The pressures on Mr. Bush have been heightened by the rise of Mr. Duke, who casts himself as a Republican and whose defeat in the recent gubernatorial election in Louisiana seems unlikely to halt his political maneuvering. Democratic presidential contenders have tried to tie Mr. Duke directly to Mr. Bush, portraying the former Klansman as the inevitable product of a generation of Republican racial politics. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, for example, told a group of Democratic leaders in Chicago on Friday, "George Bush took the party of Abraham Lincoln and made it the party of David Duke."
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska told the same group, "The Republican Party watered this tree of racism, it's now grown to maturity and it's dropped this fellow David Duke from its branches."
There has been an important shift in the Democrats' psychology since 1988, when Michael S. Dukakis, the party's nominee, and his allies responded with now- legendary caution to the Willie Horton issue. Only late in the campaign did Democrats begin to accuse the Bush campaign of practicing racial politics.
"We're going to be a lot tougher, a lot more aggressive," said Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "We're not just going to roll over when these kinds of despicable political tactics are used."
Still, some conservatives argue that the Democrats want to choke debate on an issue -- racial preferences -- that badly needs airing. "Democrats have basically said this is not a discussable issue, and that really helps create a vacuum that David Duke helped fill," argued Terry Eastland, who was a top official in the Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan.
In trying to hold on to their base among black voters while regaining the allegiance of the white middle class, Democrats have their own problems and pressures on racial issues. Polls show the majority of Americans now oppose giving racial preferences in cases where there has been past discrimination. More broadly, the Democrats have yet to find a way on the national level to reknit the biracial coalition that enables them to win many statewide races in the South.
 
'Forgotten Middle Class'
 Democratic strategists are pinning their hopes on new economic appeals to what Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas calls "the forgotten middle class." The frustration of many Louisiana whites who voted for Mr. Duke came from economic decline, these strategists argue, not simple racism.
Indeed, Neil Newhouse, a Republican polltaker, argues that in the final analysis racial issues will pale beside economic realities next year.
"Racial politics right now is a 30-day wonder," he said. "In a bad economy, there are so many other issues for voters."
Still, it is a persistent issue for Mr. Bush, as it is for any President. And one year before the 1992 election, it seems very raw indeed.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Between Haiti and the U.S. Lies A Quandary

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
FROM its inception, the persistent clandestine marine traffic of Haitians toward southern Florida and the return of the refugees by an ever-vigilant United States Coast Guard have been fraught with deep moral ambiguities.
Since the early 1970's, shady boat operators, often said to be acting in close collaboration with Haitian authorities, have preyed upon the poor; they sell the would-be migrants expensive spots on leaky wooden boats that are known to have only slim chances ofevading disaster or detection at sea. 
 These operators have been guaranteed a steady if darkly tainted income by Haiti's unrelieved poverty and repression, enforced by the very officials who assented in the trade. The dangers were underscored last week by a shipwreck off Cuba that took dozens of lives, and by a rescue at sea by the Coast Guard of 246 refugees packed into a 30-foot sailboat.
Now, however, with the United States' decision last Monday to try to repatriate the Haitians who fled their country following the bloody overthrow of its first elected president, attention has shifted sharply from the cruelties of Haiti alone. Now it is also on the American ambivalence toward a people in desperate need.
The decision to begin repatriating the Haitians, more than 3,000 of whom have been taken into American custody since September and many of whom had been stockaded aboard Coast Guard ships for weeks, prompted an outcry from some members of Congress and from immigration rights advocates; the decision, many of these critics said, was tinged with racism.
Only days before, the United States had expressed strong concerns over Britain's decision to allow the forcible return of Vietnamese from Hong Kong. Now the Bush Administration found itself groping to distinguish the treatment of Haitians from that of Vietnamese. The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said that the situations were simply different, and that the United States's repatriation efforts were aimed at saving lives. The United States, she said, wanted to discourage Haitians from undertaking a voyage that experts say kills as many as half of those who set out from the country's Caribbean shores. But such arguments proved unconvincing for a Federal judge in Florida, who on Tuesday ordered the repatriation efforts halted.
For advocates of Haitian immigration rights, the line of reasoning had a familiar ring. They say that when it comes to Haitians, not even a long history of violent dictatorships and the worst poverty in the hemisphere have budged American immigration policies, which have consistently kept people from Haiti at the very bottom of the list of nationalities who are granted legal refuge in the United States.
So averse does Washington seem to allowing Haitians into the country, the immigration advocates say, that it devises one measure after another just to keep them out; early in the 1980's, for example, reports that Haitians might bring in AIDS were cited by officials as a reason to contain them in Haiti. Meanwhile, others with crises in their homelands -- notably Cubans -- are welcomed.
Since 1981, in fact, an agreement has been in force that allows the United States to pluck Haitians from international waters and return them to their shores. No accord like this exists with any other country, the immigration advocates say. Many argue that the agreement itself is tainted, since it was reached between the Reagan Administration and the Duvalier family at a time when the dynasty, in its declining years, was trying to get the United States to turn a blind eye to human-rights abuses.
In another step also applied only to Haiti, the United States canvassed other countries in the region at the start of the current refugee crisis, asking them to accept fleeing Haitians on the ground that allowing them to reach the United States would only encourage more to flee. This effort met with only limited success, because most of the countries that were approached agreed to take only symbolic numbers of the boat people.
 
Who Is an Economic Refugee?
 To those who have raised questions about the disparity between Haitians and Cuban boat people, who are immediately granted refugee status upon pickup by the Coast Guard and arrival in the United States, immigration and State Department officials say Cuba remains a Communist dictatorship, while Haitians are basically fleeing economic deprivation. Here again, though, immigration advocates cry foul, noting that many fleeing Cubans readily identify material hardships, not politics, as their motive. And interviews suggest that the latest surge of Haitians was impelled in good measure by fear of army violence and politically directed arrests.
"The attitude of the U.S. has been that if they are poor and black, they must be economic refugees," said Anne Fuller, associate director of the New York-based National Coalition for Haitian Refugees. "It doesn't occur to people that you can be poor and have political reasons for seeking refuge too."
In addition to race, which she said remained a factor in the treatment of Haitians, Ms. Fuller and others said the refugees were victims of a skewed ideological formula left over from the cold war.
"The whole thing has been terribly politicized," said Ms. Fuller of immigration policies since World War II. "If you come from a Communist country, you have a 60, 70 or 80 percent chance of receiving refugee status. But if you come from a right-wing dictatorship like Haiti, Guatemala or El Salvador, that has never challenged U.S. interests, you will find it extremely difficult to satisfy anyone that you deserve asylum."

After the Cold War, Different Times, Different Stations

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
NOT since World War II have the listeners from the British Broadcasting Corporation's overseas monitoring service been so busy. At their outpost in a former boys' school in rural Caversham, west of London, they work in relays before banks of dials and scanners, tuning in to the growing babble of faraway radio voices that fill the ether, bringing news of ferment and democratic rebellion in the Ukraine and Uzbekistan and Georgia.
Over the last four decades, the B.B.C., along with the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, helped pry apart the first cracks in the Iron Curtain, their scratchy short wave broadcasts piercing the noise and static from jamming transmitters across the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
 Now the jammers are silent, but the Western broadcasters find they are confronted by another sort of interference. It is the explosion of new radio and television outlets, unleashed by the powerful cultural and political forces sweeping Eastern Europe and the old Soviet empire. With political liberalization and the growth of a free press, scores of new stations are beaming a richer variety of music and commentary to listeners numbed by years of state radio. Some, like Moscow's Europa Plus, have been backed by Western investors. Others, like Radio Vladivostok, are sponsored by local city governments.
The new stations present the staff at the listening post with a new challenge in monitoring that part of the world: it must now cast a wider net or it will miss the disparate voices that have supplanted the voice of authority. And the stations represent an alternative to Western state-sponsored broadcasters, who suddenly face home-grown competition for listeners.
"With the emergence of relatively free media institutions, people aren't as dependent on Western broadcast," said David Morton, head of the B.B.C.'s Russian service, which has an estimated 13 million listeners in the Soviet Union. "If we want to keep our audience, we have to do something different with our programming."
This is not to say that Western radio has lost its draw as a source of information. If television is the most powerful force shaping public opinion in America and the West, radio remains the dominant medium in the rest of the world -- relentless, inexpensive and instantly accessible, especially in times of crisis.
 
Adapting to the Times
 In the first uneasy days of the abortive Soviet coup last August, according to a recent B.B.C. survey taken in Moscow, about one of every four Soviet citizens tuned in to a foreign radio broadcast. Among them was President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who said he was kept informed by the V.O.A., the B.B.C. and Radio Liberty while under house arrest in the Crimea.
But the cold war's end and the emergence of the new radio days in the Soviet republics and East Europe has forced both governments and broadcasters to rethink their mission. President Bush has assigned a task force to examine the role and structure of American foreign broadcasting. A major consideration is the future of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, which were established at the end of World War II with the explicit mission of broadcasting on behalf of the captive people of Eastern Europe. The committee's recommendations are due this week. The Western broadcasters themselves, meanwhile, find they must pay more attention to marketing, programming and listener demands if they are not to be viewed as a cold war relic. "In Hungary under Communist rule, cabaret was popular because it was one of the few places where you could go to hear political commentary," said Bob Jobbins, the editor of B.B.C.'s World Service News. "These days, you can hear political commentary almost anywhere, and so the audience for cabaret has dropped off. We don't want the same thing to happen to us."
The B.B.C. is about to add a new Ukrainian-language service, and wants to begin an Uzbek service as well. And it recently launched a television news network to compete with the Cable News Network.
 
Tunes and Teaching
 Both the V.O.A. and the B.B.C. are juggling programming schedules, adding more music and instruction in the English language. John Tusa, the general manager of the B.B.C., now talks about what he calls "a Marshall Plan of the mind," which would use radio to bring instructional broadcasts in history, banking, accounting or communication to the emerging democracies of Europe.
Other Western broadcasters have also jumped into the competition. Radio France Internationale has increased its hours of foreign broadcasting. The Swedes have begun a new service aiming at the Baltic states. And Deutsche Welle, the German foreign broadcasting service, has leased and adapted old jamming transmitters from the Soviet Union to boost its signal into Asia.
Radio Free Europe makes an argument for its own future by broadcasting regular primers on democracy and free-market economics, a strategy that has been welcomed by officials in Eastern Europe. The new leaderships in Poland, Czechoslavakia and Hungary have all urged the United States to extend the life of Radio Free Europe, describing it as an "irreplaceable" resource.
At stake, ultimately, are not advertising dollars, but political and cultural influence.
With a nod to the effectiveness of Western propaganda in the cold war decades, Congress is now studying a proposal for a new target -- China. The idea for a Radio Free Asia, like the European service, is for a "surrogate" broadcast of news and commentary to China and other parts of the region, as if it were a domestic station.
"Cliche though it may be, information is what drives the world," said Eugene Pell, a former network television correspondent who is now president of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. "If you want your point of view considered, you've still got to find a way to get it in front of people."

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Connecticut Developers Challenge the Power of Local Zoning

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
THE basic power that Connecticut towns have relied on to define themselves and guide their growth -- the control, through zoning, of what can be built -- is being challenged in a series of housing cases aimed at introducing affordable housing into expensive suburbs.
A state law that took effect last year enabled local zoning decisions to be appealed. Now officials must justify rejecting proposals that include affordable housing. And if they cannot show that concerns about health or public safety -- as opposed to esthetics or local character -- outweigh the need for the housing, a judge can order it built. 
 To bring such an appeal, a developer must dedicate at least 20 percent of a project to housing defined as affordable: within reach of a household earning 80 percent of the region's median income. In the Trumbull case, that would amount to annual earnings of $38,400.
The first of seven such appeals, recently heard in Superior Court here, involves the nation's largest builder of rental housing, Trammell Crow Residential, which is challenging the zoning in Trumbull, a bedroom community for Fairfield County with no apartment buildings.
However, the ultimate success of the law will depend on making inroads into long-held attitudes. Zoning, which spread across much of this country in the 1920's, was a way to guide development by designating certain areas of a town for residential and commerical use. Many towns, however, have also used it to exclude low-income people, especially those from minority groups.
Housing experts hope that suburbs will eventually yield as they recognize that cheaper housing is in their interest. The economy can't grow, they say, if exclusionary zoning makes housing too expensive. Housing prices soared in the 1980's in areas like Fairfield County as corporations relocated and the number of jobs increased far faster than the amount of housing in the region.
"Everybody says, 'My single-family house should continue to grow in value,' " said Charles Berman, the Northeast division partner of Trammell Crow, which wants to build 600 apartments in Trumbull, a town of 32,000 people. "But no one seems to realize that growth comes from increased demand, which comes from employers hiring people to come into the area."
 
A Carrot With the Stick
 Self interest works on several levels, and the Connecticut law, modeled after one in Massachusetts, employs a carrot along with its stick. According to Terry J. Tondro, a University of Connecticut law professor who helped propose the law, the intent is to encourage individual towns to negotiate with developers, rather than have state government impose a larger solution that would, he said, run "counter to what we call home rule, or the idea that towns define themselves."
The law exempts communities where 10 percent of the housing is subsidized or qualifies as affordable. Bridgeport, where 18.4 percent of the housing meets the standard, is exempt; adjacent Trumbull, with only 1.8 percent affordable housing, is not. The law allows a one-year exemption from appeals if a town finishes a project including affordable-housing units equal to 1 percent of existing housing and enters in a regional compact that aims to provide affordable housing.
Trammell Crow's plan, with 120 affordable units out of 600 planned, would qualify Trumbull for the one-year exemption, except that the town has refused to join the Bridgeport region's compact.
Supporters of the Connecticut zoning-appeals process point to the successful experience of Massachusetts, which enacted a zoning appeal process in 1969 after generous subsidies the state had offered for low- and moderate-income housing went begging for three years. The Massachusetts law established a state housing appeals committee while streamlining the entire approval process, which towns often dragged out in an effort to wear down developers. Unlike Connecticut, which enables a judge to approve housing that a zoning board has rejected, the Massachusetts law gives its appeals committee authority to overrule local zoning decisions.
In the first few years, said Maurice Corman, the 82-year-old chairman of the Massachusetts appeals committee, every housing application made under the law was rejected by local zoning boards, and "99 percent of them were then approved by the committee."
Eventually, some of the housing was built, and suburbs could see what they had been fighting. "It was the best-looking housing in town," Mr. Corman said.
Out of about 300 appeals decided by his committee, Mr. Corman said, about 100 were further appealed in court, several of them reaching the United States Supreme Court and were upheld.
Massachusetts housing officials credit the law for some 20,000 affordable-housing units built over the last 20 years. But it has also taken that long for Connecticut, as well as Rhode Island and New Hampshire, which both adopted similar laws, to follow their neighbor's lead.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
High Credit Card Rates: A Luxurious Necessity?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS a matter of principle, Ralph Nader has no credit cards. He says they encourage reckless spending, raise prices and permit the creation of data banks that could lead to invasion of privacy.
He may be right. But few other people would accept the inconvenience of life without plastic. For the person with no credit cards, it is difficult if not impossible to rent a car, reserve tickets to the theater or sports events, travel without a dangerous wad of cash or engage in many other routine activities of modern society. Mr. Nader, in fact, caused a ruckus in a Princeton, N.J., hotel last week when he arrived to check in and could not produce a credit card. 
 More than three-quarters of all American households have a Visa card or Mastercard or both, and millions more have cards issued by oil companies, retail stores or American Express. Typical customers carry eight or nine charge cards and owe about $2,000 at any particular time. They usually pay between 18 percent and 20 percent annual interest on that debt.
Politicians normally pay little heed. But a few words by President Bush recently changed the picture. The commotion that followed has called attention to the credit card business, the way it operates and its effects on American life. In what seemed to be an offhand remark at a political fund-raiser in New York on Nov. 13, Mr. Bush urged banks to lower their interest rates on credit cards so consumers would spend more and give a jolt to the sluggish economy.
Mr. Bush did not specifically advocate a new law. But Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, spotted an opportunity to boost his own re-election campaign. The next day, he offered an amendment to pending banking legislation to put a 14 percent cap on credit card interest. With barely half an hour of debate, the Senate approved the proposal by a vote of 74 to 19.
By last weekend, the Bush Administration and the banking lobby had begun damage control. Top officials like Vice President Dan Quayle and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady went on television to argue that the D'Amato amendment could put shaky banks out of business, cause millions of Americans with less than sterling credit to have their cards recalled and seriously harm the economy. Bankers flooded lawmakers' offices with telephone calls and faxes. Opponents of the credit card proposal said it had caused the 120-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average Nov. 15.
Last week, the politicians, even Democrats who reveled in the embarrassment the issue was causing President Bush, got cold feet. By week's end, it appeared that if any measure is enacted this year it will do little more than require a study of credit card interest rates by the General Accounting Office, the Government's auditor.
Senator D'Amato said, nonetheless, that he had achieved his main purpose: to focus attention on lack of competition in the credit industry and the danger of giving credit so freely to people who cannot handle it responsibly.
On the question of competition, Mr. D'Amato is only partly right. Six thousand different companies offer credit cards. (Mastercard and Visa are basically clearing houses. The banks and other institutions that issue the cards set the fees, interest rates and other conditions.) The biggest issuer of credit cards, Citicorp, has only about 4 percent of the market.
But the Senator is correct that the companies do not usually compete on interest rates. Seven of the 10 largest credit card issuers charge exactly 19.8 percent on unpaid balances, and that rate remained constant when other interest rates fell sharply in the last couple of years. Scott P. Marks, director of the credit card business at one of those companies, First Chicago Corporation, said the rate was a holdover from the late 1970's.
Mr. Marks said that companies do not win more customers with lower rates. Instead, they expand through marketing and by offering new services like product discounts and frequent flyer miles. "Rather than keeping credit conditions constant and lowering rates," Mr. Marks said, "most of us have expanded the credit risk profile we are willing to accept."
What that means is that more cards are being given to people with poor credit records, and that worries many experts. Twenty years ago, for example, men and women right out of college, even if they had good jobs and steady incomes, could not get credit cards unless their parents co-signed for them. Today, students are wooed the minute they enroll in college if not before. Mr. Marks said his 10-year-old son recently received a solicitation "from a large and well established competitor."
George Paine, a Federal bankruptcy court judge in Nashville, said excessive credit card debt was probably the most important factor in the swelling number of consumer bankruptcies in the United States in recent years. In one recent case, Judge Paine said, a businessman who owed $183,000 on 41 different credit cards received an unsolicited application for another card with a $5,000 credit limit. He got the card, immediately took a cash advance of $4,500 and charged $500 worth of goods. This was the straw that pushed him into bankruptcy.
"He didn't lie on his application," Judge Paine said. "They just never asked him how many other cards he had or what his unsecured debt was."
From the issuers' perspective, the best customers are not those who are the best credit risks. Lawrence W. Ausubel, an economist at Northwestern University, identifies three kinds of credit card users: people who pay their bills each month and are never charged interest, people who intend to pay their bills but at the end of the month cannot quite manage, and people who run up bills knowing full well they cannot afford them. The companies make little if any money on the first group, who are the best risks and make up about one-fourth of all card holders. They lose money on the third group, the poorest risks, because of defaults. "The middle group," Mr. Ausubel said, "is where the profit is for the banks."
And the profit can be handsome. The best-run banks in the country earn an after-tax profit of about 1 percent on their conventional loans and other assets. But industry figures show the profit margin on credit cards to be about 2 percent. With many banks strapped because of bad commercial real estate loans, the credit card business is a bright spot.
No solution is obvious. Banks will continue to issue cards freely as long as it is profitable to do so and will charge high interest rates as long as customers do not balk. A ceiling on interest rates would probably be counterproductive economically, and Government restrictions on who could have credit cards would never be acceptable politically.
Elizabeth Warren, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on consumer debt, said she herself could not imagine living without credit cards. But she said she was concerned. "A lot of people," she said, "are on the plastic edge of survival."

HEADLINE: Fleeing Haitians Fear Army More Than the Perils at Sea

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTROUIS, Haiti, Nov. 22

 BODY:
Roger Emilien says his decision to leave his country aboard a rickety boat for the United States was made this month, when he saw soldiers on his street corner in a Port-au-Prince slum order an arrested man to sit, and then shot him, leaving him for dead.
Like scores of other Haitians who have decided that the risks of drowning or detection on the high seas are better than the misery and fear they face at home, the 56-year-old Mr. Emilien said the brutality of the army since the coup that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide nearly two months ago had clinched his decision to seek a new life in America. 
 "I can tell you now the whole country lives in fear," said Mr. Emilien, crying as he held tightly onto two small bags, which he said contained all of his remaining belongings, plus whatever food he said he could muster for a 700 mile voyage that he acknowledged might end in tragedy.
The United States Coast Guard has made an intensive effort to stem the perilous tide of Haitians trying to reach southern Florida by stationing cutters off Haiti's shores to intercept them. But dozens of people who have come from various parts of the country to this town, where they waited to sail to the nearby Haitian island of La Gonave, said they would not be so easily stopped from leaving their badly torn country.
In the space of a half hour standing in the dusty path to the sea here, a small crowd of voayagers, each carrying a bundle of belongings, assembled around a reporter to share their tales of hardship and explain how they had arranged to make the trip from La Gonave, which has become an important staging point for sea voyages to the United States.
While most of the Haitians said that their lives were rendered even harsher by an international embargo imposed to punish the country's coup leaders, they said fear and uncertainty had driven them to sell all of their possessions and borrow when they could to gather the $400 or so they said was required by the boat operators to escape their homeland.
"Its hard if you have children you can't feed, you don't have any money, and on top of that there is nothing but insecurity," said one a man in a straw hat who snapped his fingers for emphasis as he spoke. "Even if you own a house, you can't sleep in it anymore. The soldiers can come at any time, and by the time you hear the gunfire, it may be too late."
 
'We Had to Go'
 "We have heard all the stories about the danger of the boats," said another man in his 50's, who had just returned from Port-au-Prince to seek news of a brother who had left by sea earlier in the month and was now himself setting out for La Gonave. "We live with death everyday in this country. For us, the situation has become so bad we had to go."
Haiti's provisional Government and the military commanders who overthrew President Aristide say that only about 100 people died in the coup, and deny widespread reports of continuing repression in the country.
But reports from international relief agencies and church workers support stories of intimidation and violence that are commonly heard in once-crowded slums like Cite Soleil and throughout rural Haiti.
United States officials say that most Haitians fleeing their country do not qualify as refugees eligible for political asylum because they are leaving primarily for economic reasons. American officials say that while much of the intimidation and violence in the country is politically motivated, it is general in nature and therefore would not necessarily qualify people fleeing troubled areas for asylum.
Over the last three weeks, the Coast Guard has taken about 3,000 Haitians into custody, holding them aboard American vessels, at the United States Navy base in Guantanamo, Cuba, or at temporary centers in Honduras and Venezuela while the Coast Guard awaits a decision by a Federal court in Florida on whether repatriations to Haiti may be resumed. More than 500 were sent back by the Coast Guard under longstanding American policy before an injunction on the action was issued on Tuesday in response to appeals by refugee advocates.
In Port-au-Prince, the streets of Cite Soleil, one of the capital's most heavily populated areas, are now eerily barren, as many, especially young men, have fled the insecurity for the countryside.
On the drive to Montrouis along a highway emptied by the embargo on oil supplies, women sat in the shade with thick green clusters of bananas, hoping in vain for a ride to the city, where they could be sold before they rot.
From time to time, armed soldiers could be seen escorting prisoners on foot, their hands tied behind their backs. Others, with rifles slung on their shoulders, had apparently commandeered rides on the few civilian vehicles, including bicycles that moved along the road.
 
Flight From Insecurity
 Standing on a dirt road that leads to the sea in this small coastal town, an hour's drive to the north of the capital, Mr. Emilien, the man who witnessed the police shooting on his street corner, trembled as he told of his initial flight from his home in the tin-roofed quarter of Cite Soleil to several other towns in the country in a vain search for a respite from Haiti's climate of insecurity.
"I am already very hungry, and many people have told us we will never make it, because the boats never arrive" Mr. Emilien said in Creole, as he stood with an 19 year old nephew who is accompanying him on the voyage. "But everywhere we went the soldiers were arresting people and going through neighborhoods and shooting. I couldn't take it anymore."
On a small, rocky beach here that faced La Gonave in the blue distance, two 30-foot wooden boats rocked gently in the tide, while workers busily readied a third boat of the same type for the lucrative passenger traffic.
"People come with their bags and pay me to go to La Gonave," said one of the boat captains, who wore several gold chains and an expensive looking watch. "I don't ask them where they are going afterward. That is not my concern."
 
'I Am Tormented Here'
 But most of the other people gathered here were far less cagey, admitting after only brief hesitation that few have any business on La Gonave, a large, but arid and sparsely-inhabited island. Everywhere, the refrain was Miami.
"I am tormented here," said Jean Robert, 30, dressed in a Nike T-shirt and good leather shoes. "I supported Aristide and can be arrested at any time. Others feel that because you have a job, you must be some kind of Macoute, and they want to attack you."
Though his reference was to the Tontons Macoute, the dreaded Duvalier family militia, the word Macoute long ago became generic for bad guy.

HEADLINE: PENTAGON MAKING A LIST OF CHOICES FOR SPENDING CUTS

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Fearful of a Congressional stampede on the military budget next year, the Pentagon is quietly preparing options for deeper long-term spending cuts than were planned and that President Bush could use to reclaim the initiative on the domestic front, senior Administration and Defense Department officials say.
The cuts, which would affect fundamental military programs, including troops, weapons purchases and military bases, could free as much as $50 billion over the next five years for use in other domestic programs at a time when Mr. Bush is under growing attack by Democrats who assert that he has failed to address problems at home. 
 The Administration has made no final decision on the deeper reductions, which would probably require modifying last year's budget agreement, and publicly continues to resist cuts beyond the 25 percent reduction in forces envisioned by 1995 under current Pentagon plans.
 
'Pressures Are Growing'
 But Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and General Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have ordered a comprehensive review of future military needs that could result in the deeper reductions in troops, warplanes and aircraft carriers, and some officials said that Mr. Bush could announce an initiative early next year, possibly in his State of the Union Message in January. Under these cuts, the Pentagon's budget could decline to about $240 billion and possibly lower, from $291 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
"The pressures are growing on the domestic front for reducing the defense budget beyond the present plan," said Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee.
High-ranking Pentagon and Congressional officials say that such pressures have been building in the aftermath of the collapse of Communism, the failed Soviet coup and growing calls for the Bush Administration to give domestic programs higher priority in a Presidential election year. They say that increases the likelihood that the White House will reluctantly order additional cuts in military spending.
"The purpose is to prepare for the worst, but we're not sure the worst will hit," said a senior Defense Department official. "There's really nothing authoritative yet, but certainly people here are thinking that Congress will do something stupid to us."
The reviews are being conducted in extraordinary secrecy by members of the military's Joint Staff under Army Brig. Gen. William Fedorochko, deputy director for force structure and resources, and by senior Pentagon staff members under the guidance of I. Lewis Libby, the principal deputy undersecretary of defense for strategy and resources. Mr. Libby is a top aide to Paul D. Wolfowitz, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, who is Mr. Cheney's senior strategic planner.
One possibility under consideration, a senior Pentagon official said, calls for the Army to cut the number of active divisions to 10 by 1995 from 18 now. Under the Pentagon's current plan, Army divisions would be reduced to 12 by 1995.
 
No Plans for Marines
 The Air Force would reduce fighter wings to 20 from 36 now, instead of 26. The Navy would pare its carrier fleet to 9 ships from 14, rather than 12, as currently planned. The Marine Corps, already by far the smallest of the forces, is shrinking to 177,000 troops by 1995 from 194,000 now, and is not likely to suffer much deeper cuts.
Advanced weapons programs, including the B-2 Stealth bomber, the F-22 fighter jet and the Seawolf attack submarine, could be canceled or production schedules could be extended. Under other scenarios, these force reductions would be stretched out through fiscal year 1997.
Cuts would be made gradually, beginning with $3 billion to $7 billion in fiscal year 1993, to avoid large immediate layoffs in the military. Deeper cuts would come in the mid to late 1990's.
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the political process is taking a look at the resources available and how to spend them," said one officer involved in the planning.
Mr. Cheney and General Powell face an agonizing predicament. One of their choices is to stick to their existing plan, resist Congressional efforts to make further reductions and risk lawmakers' dictating additional force cuts to them in next year's budget process.
Or they can take the initiative by combining cuts in forces with further reductions in two areas that are sacred to lawmakers -- military bases and reserve troops, like the National Guard. In this way they would force Congress to share the pain and they would retain some control over the size and shape of the military. Pentagon officials say they do not like this approach because they fear that ceding some cuts to Congress would only whet lawmakers' appetite to pare more.
"Dick Cheney and Colin Powell know how to read the political tea leaves, and everything says the budget has to come down faster than their five-year plan," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan research organization here.
For now, though, Mr. Cheney's marching orders are to stand firm. He continues to emphasize that the Pentagon's current reductions will take the military to its lowest troop levels since 1950, and that military spending will be about 3.6 percent of the gross national product. As a proportion of the nation's total output of goods and services, it would be the lowest level of military spending since 1939.
In a number of recent speeches, Mr. Cheney has stepped up his criticism of people who are clamoring for deeper cuts, warning that such reductions could hurt training and readiness and could force the Pentagon to dismiss thousands of troops.
Mr. Cheney has saved his sharpest barbs for Congress, openly voicing frustration with lawmakers who insist on deeper military cuts but who balk at closing bases, trimming the National Guard and shutting down weapons plants in their home districts.
"The choices we're making aren't about jobs back home in the district, it isn't about the economic impact of the defense budget, it's not about how much pork a congressman's able to deliver for the voters back home on election day, it's preparation for the next time we go to war," he said in a speech at the State Department.
 
Posing an Economic Case
 And in a sign of growing desperation as the pressures build, he changed tack last week and tried to make the case that Pentagon cuts were actually prolonging the nation's recession and that deeper cuts could do further damage.
"The changes we're going through in downsizing the force, laying people off, I think is, in effect, slowing down the economy," Mr. Cheney said in an interview with The San Diego Union.
Economists scoff at this, saying that Mr. Cheney's comments are little more than political statements aimed at preventing further cuts. The military and its suppliers make up about 5 percent of the $5.5 trillion G.N.P.
"The effects are very, very small," said Robert D. Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief economist.
With the collapse of Communism and the continuing disintegration of the Soviet Union, the American military has lost its main military foe of 40 years.
"There's no obvious, predictable threat out there anymore," Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, the Air Force Chief of Staff, said in an interview. "What we have now is generalized uncertainty."
The military is discovering that it is hard to sell senators and representatives on "generalized uncertainty."
Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has said that the Pentagon has "got to go back to the drawing board on base force structure." He said he would soon convene hearings to study future national security interests and which forces will be needed to protect them.
And there are rumblings from the Budget Committees that last year's budget agreement preventing the shift of Pentagon money to domestic programs may need re-examining.
"Last year's budget agreement is no longer an adequate blueprint for this country's economic future," said Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee.

HEADLINE: Fighting Obscurity on Tight Primary Budgets

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
If there is one piece of information that illuminates the difference between this Presidential campaign and the last one, it is this: By October 1987, Michael S. Dukakis had raised $8 million for his primary campaign. By October 1991, the six Democratic Presidential candidates together had raised one-quarter of that amount.
Hampered by a late start, a recession and an incumbent in the White House, several of this year's Democratic candidates are heading into the Presidential primary season with less money than it takes to run a credible campaign for Mayor of New York City. 
 Some of the candidates, like Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, are having so much trouble raising cash that they have already publicly revised their fund-raising goals. Others have done the same thing more quietly.
The candidates' relative poverty, political analysts say, is clearly a hindrance to the Democrats as they try to rally support against a well-financed President. Not only are the candidates fighting the incumbent's power and popularity, they are fighting their own obscurity, a battle best waged with heavy, and expensive, television exposure.
But some Democrats, struggling to make a virtue of necessity, insist that there are advantages to a cheaper primary campaign. They say the early primaries, at least, are likely to be a throwback to the days when the Presidential nomination was won not through television but through talking to voters.
"We're looking at a resurgence of retail politics," said Ann Lewis, a Democratic political consultant. "We're talking about going to coffees and answering questions. These candidates are going to have to earn the free media, because they can't buy the paid stuff."
 
The Inexpensive Path
 Many prominent Democrats also predict that the bargain-basement nature of the campaign will amplify the importance of early primaries. Only those candidates who show strength early on, they say, will attract enough money to survive. This is particularly true because Federal matching campaign money is running low.
New Hampshire holds the nation's first primary, and "the big kick comes this time after that," said Charles T. Manatt, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "Whoever wins that can expect a big lift, both politically and financially."
The last time the Presidential candidates disclosed their financial condition was Sept. 30, just a few weeks after some of them announced that they were running. Filings with the Federal Election Commission show that as of that date former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who the first Democrat to declare his candidacy, was leading the pack, with $792,000 in contributions.
 
Brown Trails the Field
 Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa was second, with $713,000. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Governor Wilder each had roughly $200,000. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who has vowed not to accept any contribution over $100, had $48,000.
Since the last filing, most of the candidates have devoted at least half their waking hours to raising money, either on the cocktail circuit or on the telephone.
"Fund raising is a very important part of the schedule, and anyone who tells you otherwise is not telling the truth," said Lorraine Voles, press secretary to Senator Harkin. "I know it's 50 percent of the schedule; I just don't know if it's 70 percent."
All of the Democratic candidates say they have made advances in raising money since the end of September, although most refuse to give specifics. But the modesty of their financial gains has been underscored by President Bush's recent fund-raising triumphs. The President reported no contributions at all in the September filing, but at a handful of events over the last few weeks, Republican Party officials say he has raised more than $5 million.
The Democrats' fund-raising difficulties can be traced to all the usual problems of the party out of power, and several unusual ones as well.
The weak economy has clearly handicapped the Democrats, particularly since both New York and California, the party's traditional gold coasts, have been hard hit. "George Bush's recession is helping George Bush because it's hurting Democrats," said John A. Marino, chairman of the New York State Democratic Party.
The candidates are also disadvantaged by their late start; they have simply not been campaigning long enough to cultivate the kind of national fund-raising network that helped Mr. Dukakis clinch the nomination.
Finally, there is the problem of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York. Many potential donors, particularly in the Governor's home state, appear to be waiting for Mr. Cuomo to conclude his public agonizing before they sign a check. If Mr. Cuomo does enter the race, he is expected to attract substantially more money than any of his Democratic rivals.
"Until the bloody Governor makes up his mind," said one New York Democrat who has raised money for Presidential candidates in the past, "it is very hard to go with anyone else."
Mr. Cuomo has done no Presidential fund raising, and most of the $4 million in his campaign fund for governor cannot be used in a Federal election.
 
Giving Less, Eating Less
 The circumstances of the campaign have produced lower expectations all around. While the legal limit for Presidential contributions, $1,000 a person, was once the standard price for dinner with a candidate, Democratic Party officials report that $250-a-plate events have become common. Wealthy contributors who were once expected to assemble $10,000 or even $50,000 from their friends are now being asked to come up with $5,000.
Even the hors d'oeuvres have been slashed.
"We had one $1,000 event where there were literally two dinner plates of crudites with dip in the middle," said Ron Fried, finance chairman for Senator Kerrey's campaign. "We're thinking of doing a fund-raiser without any food or drinks at all."
Hard times have also prompted the Democrats to embrace some novel fund-raising ideas. Last week, for example, the Harkin campaign organized more than 1,200 birthday parties for the Senator, who was 52 years old on Nov. 18. Each party was supposed to raise about $300.
Mr. Brown's low-budget campaign has gone a step further, forgoing fund-raising events altogether and establishing a toll-free telephone number to accept pledges.
In any campaign, "early money" is the hardest to raise, and also the most important. A promising early fund-raising effort can confer front-runner status on a candidate even before a vote has been cast. "Money is the first primary," said Bob Farmer, who masterminded Mr. Dukakis's fund-raising effort in 1988 and is now helping Governor Clinton.
Unfortunately for the Democrats, early money, which is precisely what they are having so much trouble raising, is more crucial than ever this year. This is because the pool of Federal matching dollars for Presidential candidates is likely to run out before the end of the primaries.
To qualify for Federal money, a candidate must raise at least $5,000 in each of 20 states, made up of contributions of $250 or less. Once a candidate has qualified, all contributions of $250 or less are supposed to be matched by Federal money. So far, Mr. Tsongas is the only Democrat who has qualified for such financing.
But partly because of the decline in the number of taxpayers who have checked off $1 for the fund, Federal election officials estimate that the fund will be short by more than $2 million before the first 1992 primary takes place. Candidates who qualify for the missing money are supposed to be reimbursed eventually, as new payments to the fund are made. But in the early months of the campaign, few candidates are likely to be able to hold out.
"Their concern is that they need the money right then," said Scott Moxley, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission.
Most of the Democratic candidates have been close-mouthed about their fund-raising goals, not wanting to suffer a public setback if they fail to meet them. But those like Governor Wilder who have announced a timetable for themselves have found it difficult to live up to.
Last week Mr. Wilder, the nation's first elected black governor, sent a letter to supporters bemoaning the nation's continuing racial divisions and appealing for donations. In the letter, the Governor quietly revised an earlier schedule; instead of raising $1 million by the end of the year, as he had planned, he said he now hoped to raise that amount by Feb. 1.
Even those candidates who insist publicly that they are meeting their goals are rumored to be falling short. Staff members for Senator Harkin, for example, say that their fund-raising efforts are on track and have brought in more than $1 million. But this amount falls short of the $5 million to $10 million that his aides are reported to have privately discussed as a goal.
Aides to Mr. Tsongas say they still hope to reach $1 million by the end of the year. But as Nick Rizzo, Mr. Tsongas's finance chairman, acknowledged, "It's been a fight all the way."

HEADLINE: Tax Protesters Vent Anger at Hartford Hearing

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 23

 BODY:
One man yesterday identified himself only as "a tax slave from Wallingford." Another stood and shouted like a prophet: "November's coming! November's coming!" A third told state lawmakers to show some spine and not be swayed by "Gestapo threats and tactics."
It was the first of three public hearings on what should be done with Connecticut's three-month-old income-tax law, and it was clear that the lawmakers holding the hearing were braced for the worst from the 500 taxpayers on hand. 
 Security was tight, and even included searches of people's handbags, an almost unheard of precaution in a building where the metal detectors are rarely used. Two handguns were confiscated, along with several cans of Mace and a knife, the police said.
 
Anguish and Humor
 Inside the committee room, there were moments of anguish balanced by flashes of humor, as members of the General Assembly's Appropriations and Finance Committees listened to scores of speakers for eight hours.
"You're on very thin ice," said one income-tax opponent, Walt Mattesen Jr. of Stafford Springs. Most people he knows have already decided to follow New Jersey's example and throw out the Legislature next November, he said.
And do not look to Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. to help you, Mr. Mattesen added calmly. "He's not going to care that you never hold public office again."
The unusual Saturday hearing, conducted by at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford, shed little new light on the state's tax debate. The vast majority of citizen speakers -- each allowed three minutes for an opening statement -- did not mention any of the various bills that have been proposed either to modify the income-tax law or to replace it, ostensibly the point of the hearing. Many were clearly there only to vent anger and would not even take questions from lawmakers.
Some attacked the process itself.
"Don't humor me and tell me that you want to hear our ideas and thoughts, because it's obvious that you don't," said Jon Garrity, a Bridgeport resident who came to the capital at 6 A.M. to be one of the first in line to speak in favor of repealing the wage tax.
Not all were against the wage tax, however. Some came to voice their support, saying the tax was fair because it fell less heavily on the poor than the old sales-tax-based system.
Others, including the first speaker of the day, Peter Smith, said that getting rid of the income tax could mean cutting state spending for the alcohol-abuse recovery program that he said had saved his life several years ago when he was living in the streets of Hartford.
"Those cuts are going to hurt a lot of people," Mr. Smith said.
The impact of the hearings, which continue on Monday and Tuesday, will not be known until votes are held in the Assembly next month on whether to repeal the tax, but lawmakers on each side of the question appeared ready yesterday to use the hearings to bolster their case.
"The fact that these are regular people who believe very deeply and are asking for relief has to have an impact politically," said Representative Thomas S. Luby, a Democrat from Meriden on the Appropriations Committee who supports replacing the wage tax.
Mr. Luby, a former prosecutor, compared the anti-tax speakers to crime victims, saying they would dramatize the human element in what is often discussed in only abstract terms.
Repeal leaders have said a strong majority stands ready to vote for scrapping the tax. But neither the House nor the Senate has apparently mustered the two-thirds majority that would be required to force repeal over Mr. Weicker's promised veto.
 
Income-Tax Supporter
 One income tax supporter, Representative Geri Langlois, a Democrat from Thompson, said he thought that emotional anti-tax appeals could very well aid his own cause: making the tax more fair by lowering the burden on the middle-class wage earners who were most heavily represented today.
Mr. Langlois, along with a group of other Democrats, proposed this week replacing the 4.5 percent flat-rate income tax, with one of two alternatives, both of which would raise the effective tax rate on upper income families earning above $100,000, thus allowing tax cuts for those people earning less.
"It may not be exactly what they want," Mr. Langlois said of his revised tax plan. "But quite frankly it's not possible to give people exactly what they want in this economic environment. At least that's responsive to what people are saying."

HEADLINE: CANADA RETHINKS ITS HEALTH CARE

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 17

 BODY:
An unparalleled round of hospital staff layoffs and bed closings has hit Canada's national health-care system as it struggles against the biggest crunch in resources since the Medical Care Act came into effect in 1966.
Ontario, the richest and most populous province, where more than a third of Canadians live, has lost nearly 5,000 hospital jobs and 3,500 beds over the last two years. In Toronto, the provincial capital, 2,900 of 15,000 acute-care beds have been taken out of service. 
 Other institutions in other regions have introduced similar cutbacks as budget deficits, high debts and spending ceilings at both the provincial and Federal level are shutting off flows of new money for the national health program, which costs $60 billion a year.
Judy Darcy, national president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, representing 90,000 health-care workers, said, "Medicare is being dismantled before our very eyes."
 
Time of Soul-Searching
 Although not everyone agrees, shrinking Government revenue caused by Canada's recession, combined with exploding medical costs, are suddenly raising profound questions about the future of a health-care system that is almost as much a national symbol as the maple leaf and red-coated Mountie.
The soul-searching over new ways to finance medical care comes as the United States is going through its own debate about whether to adopt a Canadian-type system -- in which everyone is promised equal access to doctors and hospitals through provincial insurance plans covering practically all medical expenses.
For years, the system has been cited as a sign that Canada is a kinder, gentler country than its neighbor.
 
System of Contradictions?
 In the Pennsylvania Senate election earlier this month, the victor, Harris Wofford, a Democrat, came from behind with a campaign advocating national health care. If people have a fundamental right to a lawyer when accused of a crime, he argued, they should have a right to a doctor when they get sick.
In Canada, that right has existed for a quarter-century and has produced a high level of basic care for most Canadians. Yet today as hospital staff and beds are cut back, a number of influential commentators are warning that the system is beset by contradictions.
A recent editorial in The Toronto Star said: "We, the taxpayers of Canada, are not willing to pay for the level of service that we, the users of medicare, want. After 25 years of congratulating ourselves on having one of the finest health-care programs in the world, we have begun to wonder whether we can afford it."
 
Managing Finite Resources
 A best seller, "The Trouble With Canada," by William D. Gairdner, makes a similar point -- "the demand for an unlimited free commodity is infinite" -- and says the "Government must recognize it has made a mistake."
Yet the system is still so popular it would be political suicide to end it. The issue today is not so much dismantlement as how to manage existing, finite resources more effectively.
"To survive intact, our system will have to adjust -- and adjust quickly -- to a whole new set of realities," said Ontario's Health Minister, Frances Lankin.
 
Pressure for More Cuts
 In Manitoba, the provincial government is so desperate for revenue for its $2.5 billion health budget that it is studying the possibility of marketing health services to Americans. But critics say the plan could deprive Canadians of basic health care, or at least shuffle them to the end of surgery lists in favor of cash-paying Americans.
More than 300 hospital beds have closed in British Columbia this year, the Hospital Employees Union of British Columbia said, and with 30 percent of the province's hospitals saying they will be short of money next year, the pressure for cuts is likely to continue.
But nowhere are the difficulties so acute as in Ontario. "We are going through a period of unprecedented down-sizing and our projections are that it's going to accelerate," said Dennis Timbrell, president of the 224-member Ontario Hospital Association.
 
A Leader Contracts
 The 99-year-old St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, one of the first in Ontario to perform open-heart surgery and the first in North America to do a muscle transplant, has just announced a severe contraction, cautioning that it will have "dramatic consequences" for patient service.
Even though the Ontario government is now run by socialist-leaning New Democrats, firmly wedded to the concept of national medical care, Health Minister Lankin said she was not about to ask for any increase in the $17 billion the province has allocated this year for its health budget.
The projected budget deficit for this year stands at a staggering $9.7 billion, and Treasurer Floyd Laughren is even having trouble meeting that target because of declining revenues. The $17 billion, moreover, represents about a third of the total provincial budget.
 
Different Financing Systems
 The Canadian national health-insurance system comes primarily under the jurisdiction of the 10 provinces and two territories, which share costs with the Federal Government. Ottawa used to contribute 50 percent, but this has been cut back over the years and today stands at 38 percent.

HEADLINE: Science Publishers Bridging U.S.-Soviet Gap

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
For the first time since the end of the cold war, editors of 19 leading Russian physics journals met last week with American counterparts to discuss the broadening of scientific exchanges between the two countries. But underlying the camaraderie was some hard-nosed bargaining between the two nations' scientific publishers, each side hoping to cut costs in the face of mounting economic pressures at home.
As the two delegations sat down for talks at Loews New York Hotel in Manhattan, an American physicist asked, "Are you speaking for Soviet physics journals, or Russian ones?" After a long pause, one of the Russians replied: "We don't really know. But maybe they're the same thing now." 
 The rapid changes in the Soviet Union during the last year have deeply disrupted the organizational structure of Soviet science. Scientists employed by powerful state science institutes, who formerly were virtually guaranteed lifetime jobs in their professional specialties, now face uncertain futures. Another change expected soon is the abolition of a powerful Soviet state enterprise called the All-Union Organization for Authors Rights, which since 1975 has controlled copyright agreements between the Soviet press and foreign publishers. With the demise of this organization, each Soviet scientific group would be free to make its own deals with Western publishers.
The non-profit American Institute of Physics, an umbrella group serving all the specialized physics societies in the United States, organized last week's series of meetings with Soviet publishers. The A.I.P., which publishes many physics journals in specialized fields, has a contract with the Soviet copyright agency until 1993, but if the Soviet agency is disbanded soon, new contracts would have to be negotiated.
The subscription prices of American physics journals are high, and a large share of the A.I.P.'s foreign publishing earnings comes from the Soviet Union. But the Soviet journals formerly locked into a collective agreement negotiated by the Soviet Government may soon be able to seek better reciprocal deals with competing Western scientific publishers, like Germany's giant Springer Verlag.
"One of our big problems," said Dr. Yuri V. Shmartsev, an editor of the Soviet journal Semiconductors, "is the price of American journals. Soviet physicists can now read these journals freely, provided they understand English and can pay prices that are much higher than those of Soviet journals. Starting in January, though, the editorial board of each Russian journal can receive two free subscriptions to each American physics journal, and will make U.S. scientific literature more accessible to us."
American scientific publishers acknowledged that Soviet papers are rarely read in the United States, partly because Soviet science has been widely regarded by American scientists as spotty or inferior in quality. "But that bias is disappearing," said Dr. Robert Beyer of the A.I.P.
 
Costly Subscriptions
 Subscriptions to English-language translations of Soviet journals are also expensive. Dr. Beyer said that a year's subscription to a translated version of JETP, the Soviet Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics, costs more than $1,000.
Dr. Kenneth Ford, chief executive of the A.I.P., said that the new era of Soviet-American scientific cooperation had already led to quicker exchanges of publications. "The November issue of JETP has already been translated into English and is available to American scientists," he said.
Dr. Pyotr S. Isayev of the Dubna Institute, which operates one of the U.S.S.R.'s leading accelerator laboratories, said that many of the Soviet publishers in New York were also having their first face-to-face meetings with other editors of the Soviet scientific press. In the past, professional contacts were limited in the closed Soviet society.
The Americans and Russians found they had many common problems. But they also noticed an important difference. Russian scientists are allowed to participate in the selection of the jury of experts who judge their papers. American journals rarely allow that.

HEADLINE: Another Yale Panel Urges More Women and Minorities for Faculty

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Eighteen times since 1968, committees at Yale have recommended that the university do more to recruit women and minorities for the faculty.
The latest committee said in a report released last month that "Yale's position and its national image in this area remains precariously close to the backwaters of academic progress, not in the position of national leadership we proudly seek and claim in other important areas." 
 On Wednesday, about 50 students demonstrated to protest the denial of tenure to Susanne Wofford, an associate professor of English who has won several teaching prizes for her courses on Shakespeare.
 
President Backs Diversity
 The university's president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., responded to the report last week by endorsing the goal of increased diversity in the faculty and pledging to prevent budget cuts in Yale programs devised to meet that goal. But he did not offer any new proposals to increase the number of minority and women professors.
Of 725 tenured faculty positions, 70 are held by women and 45 by minorities, of whom five are women. Citing a 1990 survey by Harvard University of minority and women on the faculties at 17 private and public universities, the report said Yale ranked 15th in female faculty representation and 11th in minority faculty representation.
Without endorsing the notion of giving automatic preference to women and minorities, Mr. Schmidt said he expected the proportion of women and minorities on the faculty to continue to grow. "We will proceed toward this goal without lowering in any way Yale's very high standards of appointment," he said.
Mr. Schmidt endorsed the committee's proposal that each department appoint a permanent panel to identify talented minority and women candidates and to coordinate departmental affirmative action programs. But he rejected a proposal to create a panel to review all cases in which a department rejects a minority or woman faculty member for tenure, saying that would undermine the confidentiality of the process.
 
Giving Issue Prominence
 Gerald Jaynes, a professor of economics and Afro-American studies who is chairman of the committee, said he thought the president's response was "very positive," although he expressed disappointment that Mr. Schmidt had rejected some of the committee's recommendations.
"This is a significant improvement because it puts a process into motion that will force decision-making units to consider this issue every time they make an appointment," Professor Jaynes said.
The committee's report attributes the problems at Yale to the lack of a clearly defined set of affirmative action rules and procedures that could be enforced uniformly across all academic departments. "What has resulted is a corpus of procedures and policies that leave departments largely unaided and unrestrained in their individual approaches to the problem," the committee said.
In urging a standard, the committee said a woman or minority "should be deemed better qualified" and therefore selected when he or she is competing with an equally qualifed white male.

 BODY:

Stan Who?
 Even though recent election results show that the recession has made it a bad time to be an incumbent, Stan Lundine might like it if a few more people knew he was in office. 
 In a New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll taken earlier this month, only 6 percent of the 1,838 adults questioned in downstate New York could identify Mr. Lundine as the Lieutenant Governor.
Another 5 percent of those surveyed, when asked if they knew who the Lieutenant Governor was, named someone else. And 88 percent did not have a clue.
Still, Mr. Lundine joked that he did not mind the anonymity, given that the same poll showed high levels of dissatisfaction with Governors Mario M. Cuomo of New York, Jim Florio of New Jersey and Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut.
"What a great time it is to lay low," Mr. Lundine said. "If they don't know your name, how can they hate you?"
The poll was taken from Nov. 2 to Nov. 12 in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange counties as well as in New Jersey and Connecticut. It has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
As a former congressman from Jamestown in the state's southwestern corner, Mr. Lundine has long recognized that his is not a household name in metropolitan New York. But the poll results indicate that his recent efforts to get known in New York City have yet to bear fruit.
Mr. Lundine has been Mr. Cuomo's hand-picked deputy since 1987 and has not disguised his ambition to succeed Mr. Cuomo as Governor. His name recognition would undoubtedly rise if Mr. Cuomo decides to run for President.
If Mr. Cuomo decides to resign as Governor, which seems highly unlikely, Mr. Lundine would take his place. But even if Mr. Cuomo runs for President while remaining Governor, Mr. Lundine would play a more visible role in the day-to-day operation of the government.
 
Shedding Civility
 In the annals of frosty relations between New York City Mayors and their Albany counterparts in the Governor's office, David N. Dinkins and Mr. Cuomo have managed to keep things relatively civil in public, even amid the tremendous tensions brought on by chronic budget problems.
Mr. Dinkins has refrained from calling Mr. Cuomo "an 800-pound gorilla," as Edward I. Koch once did, and he often says he would like to be in the "vanguard" of a Cuomo Presidential campaign if there ever is such a thing.
But it is no secret that there has been plenty of behind-the-scenes animosity in the last year, with heated arguments over pay raises granted by the city and local-aid cuts imposed by the state. And last week, after the Cuomo administration announced next year's state budget gap may be double its previous estimate, Mr. Dinkins offered an unusual public venting of his frustrations that amounted to a slap at the Governor.
"I can only say that if we were to come out with an estimate today and a week or so later say it's double that, almost to a person you all would say we don't know what we're doing," the Mayor told reporters.
Mr. Dinkins also pointed out that he had produced two budgets "on balance and on time" while Mr. Cuomo and state leaders were setting two consecutive records for lateness. It should be pointed out that in one the many Byzantine stretches of Albany logic, state law essentially forces the city to shut down if it does not have a balanced, timely budget -- a requirement from which state government has exempted itself.
If the Governor took any offense at the Mayor's rebuke, he certainly tried not to show it in public. "I have congratulated him for that over and over," he said of Mr. Dinkins's performance on his budget. "I say it very openly that he did it better than we did."
 
Identity Crisis
 The special legislative session now under way to consider the repeal of Connecticut's three-month-old income tax law has a powerful subtext agenda for many Democrats, who hold the majority in both chambers of the General Assembly.
John F. Droney Jr., the party's state chairman and one of the loudest and brashest opponents of the income tax, announced his resignation last month, and as the party battles within itself on the income-tax question, it simultaneously has to decide the ideology of the next chairman.
Should he or she reflect the majority of Democrats in the Legislature who voted for the income tax? Or should the next chair continue to be opposed, and so dispel the potential notion among voters that the Democrats are the monolithic party of the income tax?
Moderate Democrats in the House, who last week proposed a no-income-tax alternative that would extend a 2.5 percent "transactions" tax on almost every level of economic activity in the state, have said that sending a message of disunity is a primary goal, and that some of the tax struggles of the special session really reflect a sort of public identity crisis.
"It's a front for the battle," said Representative Carl J. Schiessl, a Democrat from Windsor Locks and a leader of the moderate group. "The direction of the party may be set by whoever wins."
 
A Familiar Voice Moves On
 New Yorkers all over the state have heard the rich baritone voice of the political reporter Walt Wheeler, who covered New York City's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's for WCBS-AM and, more recently, kept tabs on Albany for the 16 stations he served on the Empire State Network News, a newsgathering cooperative he directed.
Mr. Wheeler seems to have such a perfect radio voice that politicians and even his fellow reporters have been known to ask him to repeat his questions just so they could hear him speak again. Governor Cuomo once joked that he wasn't sure he could tell the difference between the voice of God and the "voice of Walt."
Now, though, he is embarking on the radio reporter's equivalent of hanging up his cleats, his network having succumbed to the ravages of the recession. Reporters can still hear his voice -- his new job is as a spokesman for the state Division of Military and Naval Affairs -- but the tone of the state's airwaves will be a little less richer without it.

Sports Are More Than Games in the Groves of Academe

BYLINE: BY ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
THE Footnote League has opened its season and the air is filled with flying hypotheses and the heady crunch of fresh ideas.
It is the time of academic conferences, and these days there are few meetings of historians or political scientists or sociologists without at least one session on the intricate relationship between sports and society. 
 In Chicago last week, for example, the 90th meeting of the American Anthropological Association included a morning devoted to the identity crises of women who pump iron and ride motorcycles. Among the papers delivered was Barbara Joans's "Dykes on Bikes Meets Ladies of Harley."
"It's part of what's happened in academia generally," said Peter Levine, a historian at Michigan State. "Those of us who came of age during Vietnam began to study history from the bottom up -- working people, blacks, women -- and sports is certainly something that affected millions of everyday lives."
Professor Levine is a Jacksonian, an expert in 19th century American political and social history, but he is best known for "A. G. Spalding and the Rise of Baseball" (Oxford, 1985), a lively tale of the original George Steinbrenner and the not coincidental emergence of the national pastime and the middle class.
"A very important book," said Professor Charles P. Korr, a historian at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. "I've ripped it off in half-a-dozen conferences, here, Hungary, Australia. It's part of the current movement to apply what we learn from studying sports to the real social problems of the larger culture."
Professor Korr's original area of expertise is 17th century Cromwellian foreign policy. He is currently writing a book on "the union that revolutionized sports," the Major League Baseball Players' Association. With his new expertise, Korr is on his way to a conference in Florence, Italy, sponsored by the members of the Common Market. They are facing the problem next year of not only unrestricted trade but of the unrestricted flow of foreign workers. How will this affect all the soccer clubs? And the national teams?
Twenty years ago, the relationship between sports and academia was far less intellectually rigorous and more likely to be either confrontational (such activists with doctorates as Richard Lapchick, Harry Edwards, Jack Scott and Mark Naison gave the profession some credible muscle) or sycophantic (thousands of men with leather elbow patches who sat at the 50-yard line to watch the players they were passing, but never teaching).
While interesting, pioneering work was being done, primarily in college physical education and sociology departments, in kinetics, behavior and the role of the emerging female athlete, the output was erratic. Too many papers had the words "anomie" or "agon" in the title, and there was a bit too much on the flip side: i.e., the Oedipal aspects of baseball in which the son (batter), waving a you-know-what, tries to interrupt the relationship between the father (pitcher) and the mother (catcher).
Traditionally, most academic departments looked down on sports studies. But in the 70's, when enrollments in many of the liberal arts slipped, professors began to scramble for sexy ways to repackage history and sociology and even literature courses. "The Rise of Baseball" was as good a way as any to study 20th century America and had a better chance of packing the hall. Not only did students flock to such courses, but many went on to take other, more orthodox, courses in the field.
And there has been research progress as well. In one recent thought-provoking study, two economists, Sumner LaCroix of the University of Hawaii and Torben Andersen of Red Deer College in Alberta, Canada, compared black and white baseball superstars who had similar performance statistics. While their salaries were comparable (the economists suggested that arbitration was color blind), the value of their trading cards were not. Collectors, mainly youngsters, paid higher prices for the cards of white players.
In recent years, the literature of sports has been enriched more by
Ph.D.'s than by sportswriters. Worth serious study are Bruce Kuklick's "To Every Thing a Season: Shibe Park and Urban Philadelphia" (Princeton, 1991); Elliot J. Gorn's "The Manly Art: Bare-Knuckle Prize-fighting in America" (Cornell, 1986), and William J. Baker's "Jesse Owens: An American Life" (Free Press, 1986).
The works of John J. MacAloon of the University of Chicago, Jules Tygiel of San Francisco State, Michael V. Oriard of Oregon State and Bruce Kidd of the University of Toronto have been outstanding over the years.
Professor Levine, at work on his study of Jews in sport, "From Ellis Island to Ebbets Field," sees even better seasons ahead.
"We tended to wait until we were tenured and secure before we studied sports," he said. "But there's a new generation of scholars who have come right into sports through black studies and gender studies and they will have a lot to say that's worth hearing."
Meanwhile, at Springfield College in Massachusetts, members of the Sports Literature Association are still talking about George Grella's recent paper on "Karl Marx: Tennis Anyone?" And out at Creighton University in Nebraska they are waiting for papers to fill their proposed volume, "The Psyche At Play," a volume on Jungian and Archetypal Approaches to Sports and Athletics.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Yankees' Fiscal Policy Offers Less for More

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The signs are so unmistakably there, it's deja vu all over again, as Yogi Berra, who played for and managed both teams, maybe said. The Yankees resemble the Mets of the M. Donald Grant years, and the Yankees' fans may have to adopt the same strategy as the Mets' fans of those years.
Because Grant, who ran the team for Lorinda deRoulet, refused to spend money on free agents, contending that his way would be proved right, the Mets steadily deteriorated in the late 70's. Refusing to accept repeated last-place finishes, the fans dwindled too, reaching a franchise-low 788,905 in 1979. 
 Faced with severely declining revenue, deRoulet and her family were forced to sell the team, a transaction that led to the rebirth of the Mets and the return of the fans to Shea Stadium.
Now it's the Yankees who, for some unexplained reason, don't seem to want to spend money, even though they have lots to spend, and then some. The deterioration that got a running start under George Steinbrenner has continued without his presence (though possibly not without his input).
 
No Improvement Promised
 Not surprisingly, the attendance has deteriorated, too, falling this year to 1,863,731, second lowest for a full season since 1975.
But the Yankees aren't content with spending less; they want to take in more. Without promising instant improvement, the Yankees have announced the largest ticket-price increase in their history, topped by an additional $2 for a lower-level box seat.
What have the Yankees done to justify the increase? Obviously nothing. They are, in fact, asking their fans to pay more for less. Given their guaranteed revenue from local and national television, they appear to be greedy without being considerate of their fans.
The Yankees will receive between $35 million and $40 million next year for the local television and cable rights to their games. The next most lucrative local rights belong to the Mets, who will receive about $22 million. The Yankees also will get about $14 million from the CBS-ESPN package. There's no recession in those numbers.
This hardly seems like a team that has to save money by dismissing several low-level office employees and needs additional revenue from ticket sales.
 
Red Sox Revenue
 Baseball history teaches that winning teams draw more fans than mediocre and bad teams. If the Yankees had attracted an extra 500,000 fans this year, putting them at a level they have attained when they have been legitimate contenders, their revenue, at an average ticket price of $10.56, would have risen by more than $5 million on ticket sales alone.
The Boston Red Sox, in the race until the last 10 days of the season, had ticket revenue, based on a $10.30 average, of $26.4 million compared with $19.7 million for the Yankees.
Win, and they will come. Lose, and they will stay home. The Mets' fans did it. The Yankees' fans may learn from their experience.
As for the reason behind the Yankees' strange fiscal policy, some people in baseball suspect Steinbrenner. He still controls more than 50 percent of the team, and he is not a silent partner. The theory is he wants the Yankees to fail miserably for two reasons:
It would show that only he can operate the Yankees successfully (even though recent history says he can't), and people would begin clamoring for his return.
 
Reds Talking About Davis
 Give the Cincinnati Reds credit. Unlike many teams, they are prepared to trade a major player to a team in their division, unconcerned that the player could have an adverse impact on their chances for a divsion championship.
Barring some unexpected snag, the Reds are expected to trade Eric Davis before the winter meetings, which are in two weeks. They have mixed feelings because they suspect that Davis will have an outstanding season in 1992, but at least some people in the organization have grown weary of his presence and are concerned about the contract they would have to give him to keep him beyond next season.
"I can't characterize it as close," General Manager Bob Quinn said, talking about a Davis deal. "We're talking and exchanging ideas with two or three clubs."
The San Diego Padres appear to be the team most likely to acquire Davis, but the Los Angeles Dodgers also are a possibility. The Reds bolstered their starting-pitching rotation by acquiring Greg Swindell, a potential 20-game winner from Cleveland, but want to strengthen it even further.
The Dodgers are reluctant to give up a pitcher until they re-sign one or both of their free agents, Orel Hershiser and Mike Morgan, which could put them at a disadvantage because the Reds want to make a deal sooner rather than later.
 
'That's Their Baby'
 The Padres would reluctantly give the Reds a 26-year-old pitcher, Jose Melendez, who had an 8-5 record and a 3.27 earned run average in nine starts and 22 relief appearances this year. Bip Roberts, who can play anywhere, and Thomas Howard, an outfielder, could also be included.
Whoever gets Davis would be at risk because he can be a free agent next winter. Quinn said he would not agree to a conditional deal, by which the acquiring team would have to sign Davis to a new contract before completing the trade.
"We didn't do it with Swindell," Quinn said. "We wouldn't go that route. That's not the right way to approach a deal. That's their baby, just like Swindell is ours."
That means a team could have the center fielder for only one year. On the other hand, if a team were able to sign Davis to a multi-year contract, it would do so in the best tradition of caveat emptor. As one National League general manager said, "Once you sign him, say to a three-year contract, does that mean he doesn't play hard for two years, then plays hard the last year of the contract?"
 
Dollars, Not Sense
 Leave it to baseball club owners to blunder so badly they embarrass themselves and the commissioner of their sport.
The owners went out and hired Richard Ravitch to be head of the Player Relations Committee, their labor arm, and they gave him a $750,000 salary. Fine, but Commissioner Fay Vincent has a $650,000 salary, and the chief labor negotiator isn't supposed to be paid better than the commissioner.
The owners who hired Ravitch supposedly didn't discover their fiscal oversight until an Executive Council meeting a few weeks ago. It was agreed that the commissioner would have to receive a raise, but compounding the original blunder, instead of acting on Vincent's salary immediately, they delayed long enough for the development to be disclosed publicly.
Vincent will be restored to a commissioner's proper economic position. He, in fact, will join the 223 players in his sport who earned $1 million or more this year. His salary will not include "or more."
 
What McMullen Knows
 John McMullen of the Houston Astros has long been one of the most battered owners for his perceived wrong-headed actions. Yet McMullen seems to be the only owner willing to recognize that blacks have the "necessities" to work in critical jobs. He has had a black assistant general manager, Bob Watson, and now he has a black third-base coach, Tom Spencer.
Chris Chambliss learned yesterday that he was not among the final four candidates for the Chicago White Sox managing job. General Manager Ron Schueler called him with the bad news. Chambliss will manage Atlanta's Class AAA minor league team at Richmond.

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
Steve Smith Is Making His Point as a Rookie With the Heat

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
WHEN Steve Smith was growing up, and growing up, and growing up, in the playgrounds around Detroit, his goal was to play point guard just like his idol, Magic Johnson.
Smith got the height nearly right -- 6 feet 8 inches -- and he got the college career right, becoming the leading career scorer at Michigan State. 
 But then Smith was drafted by a losing expansion team, the Miami Heat, which already had a regular point guard, squatty, shuffly Sherman Douglas.
Nothing is permanent, particularly in sports. Wally Pipp once had a headache, or so the legend goes, and maybe the headache came from the onrushing sound of Lou Gehrig, who was getting ready to play 2,130 consecutive games for the Yankees.
Sherman Douglas did not have a headache, at least not at first. He did, however, have a lapsed contract. And while Douglas holds out, and practices alone in a Washington gym, the Heat comes into New York on Tuesday as a winning team. Miami had a 7-3 record going into last night's game in Indiana, and the biggest reason was its new point guard.
Smith had a 14.9-point average in his first 10 games, and is being praised as unselfish by everybody, even Rony Seikaly, the Heat center, who is Douglas's best friend in the league, going back to their Syracuse days.
"They say point guards are a dime a dozen," Seikaly said after a victory over Sacramento on Friday. "But not 6-8 point guards who can see the floor."
Not only can Smith move the ball, he has also played shooting guard and small forward, although he has not gotten around to playing center, the way his hero did to clinch the 1980 N.B.A. championship when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was injured.
Meanwhile, the Heat has changed from an uptight team that created more turnovers than a bakery on Sunday morning.
"You could see it in his first practice," said Kevin Loughery, the team's new coach. "Steve was a little late reporting, but when he did, he started moving the ball around. He would turn down shots."
Smith, who had played against Magic in summer games, was stunned when his hero retired early this month after tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS.
"You could see it affected him," said Alvin Gentry, a new assistant coach, "but Magic called him and talked to him, and he bounced back."
Smith does not want to talk much about Johnson; he wants to focus on playing in a league he says is even tougher than he had expected.
"You couldn't tell from exhibitions because there were a lot of free agents, and the veterans don't play that hard," Smith said. "But these guys jump even higher than you thought."
Who has impressed Smith the most so far? Charles Barkley. "He just takes over when he gets ready to take over," Smith said. "You know he's going to shoot, but he does it anyway."
Smith has not done badly. The Utah Jazz put its all-league power forward, Karl Malone, on him the other night when the guards couldn't handle him. On Friday, Smith cold-bloodedly scored 23 points over 5-foot-7-inch Spud Webb.
"Yeah, but Spud gave me trouble," Smith said. "He's so quick, he took the ball away from me."
The rookie's attitude is so professional that Lou Schaffel, Miami's managing partner, says Smith has the quiet poise of Julius Erving and Michael Jordan when they joined the league.
Schaffel, of course, is protecting his bargaining position with Douglas. Neither side gives specifics, but Douglas was making $325,000 last year and may have been offered a figure near the $2 million level approached by John Stockton, Terry Porter and Kevin Johnson, the best young point guards. Once Smith signed, the Heat lowered its offer, probably still above $1 million.
Douglas's agent, Eric Fleisher, was given permission to arrange a trade to a club that would meet Douglas's salary demands, but nothing has happened.
"If Sherman agreed to our current offer, we would do the right thing," Schaffel said. "We would love to have him."
In the meantime, Bimbo Coles is playing about half the game at point guard, defending hard and scoring in double figures, and Kevin Edwards is a better player because of his extra time. Even Douglas's supporters doubt he will ever play for the Heat again.
"He's not doing great," Seikaly said of his pal who threw him all the alley-oop passes in college and with the Heat. "I try to put in my two cents, but what can you say? The weird thing is, I would have loved to see Sherman and Steve together."
Will that ever happen? Seikaly shook his head and said, "No, I don't think so."
It is not clear whether Wally Pipp really did have a headache. But Sherman Douglas has a headache. It is called unemployment.

HEADLINE: Tough Choices as Bush Tries to Break His Slide1

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
After one of the most battering weeks of his Presidency, George Bush faces crucial decisions on starting up his re-election campaign, the political viability of his chief of staff and how to heal a division that threatens the Republicans' image as the party best able to manage the economy.
The President, who was at Camp David today consulting by telephone with political associates, hopes to start his political rebound on Monday with the first of a quick series of damage-control trips intended to show that he does not have a detached attitude about domestic problems. 
 But as an increasing number of Republican lawmakers and members of his Administration urge Mr. Bush to take quick action on the economy, the trips may serve to underscore the way in which the President and the top White House aides have decided to treat the economy as a public relations problem, not a policy issue.
 
Hopes for the Future
 So far, Mr. Bush has stuck to his decision to wait until his State of the Union Message in January to offer economic proposals and try in the meantime to convince voters that he is engaged on issues that matter to them and that the economy is not as bad as it seems.
To that end, the White House is counting on an effort by House Republicans to force a vote on an economic growth package to shift attention from Mr. Bush's political problems to what one aide today called "a nice, distracting partisan brawl on Capitol Hill."
In the same way, Bush advisers are hoping his announcement of a campaign staff will give them a chance to reframe the political debate over the economy, so far dominated by Democrats and Republicans dissatisfied with Mr. Bush's leadership on the issue.
Republican strategists and Administration officials said today that Mr. Bush was now expected to name his campaign team as early as the first week of December because of mounting political pressure from Democratic attacks, the debate within his own party about tactics and the prospect that he will face challenges in the New Hampshire primary in February.
 
What About Sununu?
 But Mr. Bush still faces a central problem in choosing a campaign team: what to do about his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, whose action this week overshadowed White House efforts to change the subject, as it sought to do last Friday by scheduling a meeting between Mr. Bush and some leading economists.
Republicans close to the White House, uncertain what was in the mind of a President who has kept Mr. Sununu on despite his political gaffes, today offered a variety of options for the chief of staff's fate. Some see Mr. Bush easing Mr. Sununu out by asking him to resign. Others suggest that Mr. Bush might add a layer of campaign managers with direct access to the Oval Office as a way to diminish the chief of staff's power and dampen the impact of Mr. Sununu's stated intention to run the campaign from the White House.
A White House adviser suggested today that while there was "an awful lot of consternation" about Mr. Sununu, staff shake-ups could only further delay efforts to appear empathetic about the economy. "The present cast of characters, even though they may have stumbled, stands as good a chance or better than a totally new cast," this adviser said.
A senior Administration official said today that Mr. Bush has decided he needs to have his top campaign staff in place to respond to an active schedule of Democratic campaign events over the next month.
On Monday, Mr. Bush goes to Columbus, Ohio, to visit schools and day-care centers and talk about educating adults for jobs in medical technology. He plans to visit California, Hawaii, Mississippi, Illinois and Arkansas before Christmas.
 
Pressure on the Economy
 The economic debate within the Republican Party, meanwhile, has become a short-term fight over tactics and public relations, since the party's leading Washington figures are described as deeply divided over the proper prescription for growth.
Mr. Bush and a dominant group of advisers insist on patience, but a growing number of lawmakers and a restive faction within the Administration are calling for dramatic action.
Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp is reported to be urging the President to keep Congress in session and push for tax cuts. Vice President Dan Quayle has been quietly suggesting that the White House may need to revisit the 1990 budget agreement, which has been the unshakeable foundation of Mr. Bush's domestic policy for a year. And more than 80 House Republicans today asked Bush to appoint Mr. Kemp as a domestic policy czar who could "declare war on our domestic ills."
Adding to the conflict and the appearance of confusion is the lack of a basic agreement both within the Administration and between the President and Republicans outside the White House on the state of the economy -- is it in a real recovery, has the recovery stalled or is the recession still going?
This has produced an anomaly that no one in the party would have predicted a few months ago. For years, polls have shown that voters' trust in the Republicans' ability to manage the economy was the party's single strongest asset in domestic policy. But that strength has been steadily eroding, and the economy has emerged as the issue that is both hardest for Republicans to deal with and by far the most threatening for Mr. Bush.
"We have won elections because we reversed the Hoover legacy and became the party of economic growth and competent management," said Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, a vocal critic of White House economic policy. "If we don't have that mantle going into 1992, it's going to be very difficult for us to win, at the Congressional level and the Presidential level."
 
Trying to Recoup
 Just a few months ago, Mr. Bush and his aides thought they were going to coast through the 1992 Presidential campaign on the strength of high approval ratings and another traditional Republican electoral asset: foreign policy expertise.
Now, as the White House gropes for a way to stop a steady downward spiral of Mr. Bush's popularity, it has tried ill-timed and poorly planned political gestures to demonstrate the President's concern for domestic issues. Each of them has either backfired or added to the impression that Mr. Bush is at a loss about what to do.
Administration officials say the White House has been operating on a basic decision that now is not the time to do anything drastic about the economy and on a commitment to the 1990 budget agreement, a commitment that drives all domestic policy decisions.
This approach is maintained by the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, Mr. Sununu and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. And it has left the White House trying to argue that if only it did a better job of presenting its case, not only would its political troubles ease, but Americans' confidence would rise and the economy would do better.
But this approach smacks of President Jimmy Carter's politically disastrous "malaise" argument, and Bush aides concede that it pales against proposals like a tax cut for middle-income Americans, most of which are not considered fiscally sound by economists but which have enormous appeal.
"The budget deal has become a millstone around the Administration's neck," a senior Republican strategist said. "But people at the White House are proud of it, and they think that if we just keep rearguing it eventually everyone will agree."

HEADLINE: Japanese Charity Gives Millions to U.S. Groups

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
A new source of philanthropy has opened for Americans with a made-in-Japan label.
The Center for Global Partnership of the Japan Foundation began its gift-giving on Wednesday with 40 grants totaling $5.4 million to educational, research and cultural organizations in the United States. In Tokyo, 11 Japanese organizations received another $1.3 million from the charity created by the Japanese Government. 
 The center, based in Tokyo, plans to increase its charitable giving to $25 million annually starting next year. Only about 25 foundations in this country give away more money annually.
The center's gifts will support Japanese-American exchange programs and research on the environment, education, immigration, urban decay and the aging, as well as the exploration of trade and tariff issues.
 
Independence Is Questioned
 Friction created by Japanese trade position and acquisition of American companies is widely believed among American scholars and foundation officials to have led the Japanese Government to create the center with a $375 million endowment in 1990. Some scholars and foundation officials still regard the initiative as a public relations ploy to improve Japan's image and doubt it will be independent of government.
"The center's track record should provide the answers," said Tadashi Yamamoto, a member of the center's A Japanese company keeps a low profile in its New York City philanthropy. Business, page 21.
advisory committee, in an interview Tuesday at the organization's office in Manhattan. "This is not a fire-brigade operation to extinguish heated argument. Rather, it is a step toward Japan's assuming a more active role in world affairs. The center will build on its American experience, develop ties in other countries and become a multilateral partnership, tackling global concerns."
Prominent Americans are serving as special advisers, including former Secretary of State George P. Shultz; Mike Mansfield, a former Ambassador to Japan, and David Rockefeller, the former chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank.
 
Selections by American Panel
 Jun Wada, a 42-year-old economist who directs the center, said his goal was winning acceptance from American foundations and forming joint programs. Discussions are already under way with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Pew Charitable Trust and the MacArthur Foundation, he said.
Recipients of the center's gifts were selected by an American panel from among 200 nonprofit organizations that responded when the center sent out 3,000 announcements in September explaining its guidelines. The gifts not only went to major universities, but also to Evanston Township High School in Illinois to enhance its Japan Education Center.
Other grants will finance exchange programs for teachers, women leaders and youth groups. The largest, a $670,000 outlay, went to the 21-year-old Close Up Foundation of Alexandria, Va., which has brought hundreds of thousands of foreign students to Washington to learn about the American political system.
The center gave $2.2 million for educational programs. Children's Museums in Boston and Indianapolis received grants for exhibits about Japan. The Aspen Institute, the Brookings Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations received grants, as did the Institute of International Economics, to measure the costs of trade and tariff barriers in the United States, Europe and Japan.
Among the other grants were $200,000 to American Public Radio in Minneapolis to develop and disseminate news programs; $55,000 to National Public Radio for news coverage of Japan, and $265,000 for the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at the University of Connecticut to develop Japanese public opinion data.

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup;
Foley Denies Weakness In Session or Leadership

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
As lawmakers struggled all day to find the votes and the legislative language that would let them end the Congressional session on Tuesday, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley today defended Congress and himself personally against charges of ineffectiveness.
At a breakfast with reporters, he said Congress had made a "very good record" in adhering to last year's budget agreement as well as on domestic legislation from civil rights to the still incomplete banking, transportation and campaign finance bills. And he called it "the most constitutionally important Congress since World War II" for asserting war-making power in the Persian Gulf conflict. 
 But it was in defending himself against the largely anonymous grumbling of some House Democrats that Mr. Foley displayed the greatest intensity. "They want to hear me bash George Bush," he said, pounding his fist into his hand. "My job is to try and persuade, rather to try and just make speeches. I am not a basher.
"Somebody else is going to have to take on that particular responsibility, because it's not my way of communicating," he said. "I don't think people are going to find that a lot of Americans are persuaded by name-calling and partisan bashing."
 
Bush Is Seen as Wounded
 The recent criticism of Mr. Foley, a Democrat from Washington State, has come from Democrats who see the Bush Administration as wounded by the economy and its anti-abortion stand and who want him to lead them to the kill.
Mr. Foley did predict that, even without "bashing," he would become more partisan next year as the Presidential election nears. But he argued that it was important for Congressional leaders and the President to have some time to work on finding areas of agreement that would enable the Government to function.
If intense partisanship were a full-time obligation, he said, there would be a four-year election campaign and a "seamless web of forever and forever and forever political debate that has no conclusion and no purpose other than the election itself."
 
Criticism Called Unfair
 He also said it was unfair for him and Congress to be criticized for their inability to override any of Mr. Bush's 24 vetoes, including the Tuesday vote on which the President was sustained in barring federally financed family planning clinics from discussing abortion with patients.
Mr. Foley had predicted on Monday that this veto would be overridden, but the attempt in the House failed by 12 votes. Today he said: "My perspective is that the President should get no particular credit for sustaining a veto, and a lot of blame if he gets overridden. For the President to lose, he has to have some element of major repudiation by his own party members in the Congress, and that's very hard to achieve."
In fact, on Tuesday's vote, 53 Republicans deserted Mr. Bush, while only 113 voted with him. If 12 of the 43 Democrats who voted with the President had voted against him and with Mr. Foley, the veto would have been overridden.
 
Banking
 There was little progress today on ironing out the differences between a narrow House banking bill and a broader Senate measure that includes a limited version of the White House's proposal to ease restrictions on interstate banking.
Formal negotiations between House and Senate lawmakers on a banking bill are expected to begin on Monday, although aides to the lawmakers have already begun informal discussions.
Last week the House and Senate adopted the different bills after the House had rejected two other measures that included interstate banking provisions.
The two bills that have been approved contain taxpayer loans of tens of billions of dollars for the nearly depleted Federal insurance program that protects bank deposits. The Administration has said the loans will be repaid by the banks.
The loan provision has caused leaders of both houses to insist on passage before Congress can adjourn. Mr. Foley described both the bank insurance measure and additional financing for the Resolution Trust Corporation, which handles the savings and loan bailout, as "heavy lifting."
 
Spending
 The Senate passed and sent to the White House the last regular spending bill of the session, a $270 billion Pentagon appropriation.
While the measure closely tracks the legislation adopted Friday that would all but eliminate the B-2 Stealth bomber while preserving an anti-missile defense system, it drew sharp opposition from the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia.
Mr. Nunn complained bitterly that the bill, as it came back from the Senate-House conference committee, included $3.3 billion for which no authorizing legislation had been passed. He said the money was earmarked for projects like creating museums at closed military bases and grants directed to specific universities.
Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who was one of the conferees, said House negotiators had been adamant on the issue. Mr. Nunn replied that "I do not believe there has been a very vigorous effort" by Senate conferees on the issue. He voted no but lost, as the bill was passed on a 66-to-29 vote.
On Friday night the Senate sent Mr. Bush the $205 billion appropriation for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education.
That was the last major regular domestic spending bill. The Senate also passed and sent to a House-Senate conference a $7.5 billion supplemental spending bill for items ranging from remaining gulf war costs to aid for children.
The bill included another effort to require the Defense Department to let servicewomen and dependents have abortions at United States military hospitals overseas if they pay for them themselves. That issue commands Congressional majorities that are short of veto-proof strength. Such provisions have repeatedly been dropped from bills in conference to avoid a veto.
 
October Surprise
 While the Senate on Friday night killed a proposal to spend $600,000 on an investigation of the "October Surprise," the House still plans to try to proceed on the issue. The term refers to allegations that Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign conspired with Iran to see that American hostages were not released before the election.
A resolution authorizing a House investigation of the accusation is to be considered on the House floor Monday.
 
Supercomputers
 The Senate sent to the White House a $3 billion measure for developing a high-speed supercomputing network that would link Federal reserach centers, universities and corporations.
The five-year program, sponsored by Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, would add $1 billion to the $2 billion already authorized in computer research, and fianance development of the switching systems and software needed to create what Mr. Gore today called "interstate highways of information."
Old-fashioned long-distance telephone lines do not have the capacity to deal with the bits of information used by supercomputers, but fiber-optic cables can be used for this purpose if appropriate switches and software are developed. Mr. Gore said the measure would "enable us to leapfrog the Japanese and make the best use of an area in which we hold a tenuous advantage."
The Bush Administration supported the bill, which passed on a voice vote Friday night after House passage Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Blame for New York's Budget Mess

 BODY:
If Gov. Mario Cuomo really wants to run for President, he'll have to convince America that New York's fiscal mess -- the "New York Nightmare," in Vice President Quayle's alliterative words -- is Washington's fault. Can Mr. Cuomo legitimately claim that responsibility for the state budget deficit, newly doubled to $3.6 billion, lies outside Albany? The short answer is no. The long answer is, there's plenty of blame to go around.
Mr. Cuomo cannot be blamed for the state's plunging economy, a product of the national recession. Nor is it his fault that states with large populations of the poor have suffered since the Reagan years from deep cuts in Federal social programs. 
 Still, New York could weather the recession more easily had it got responsible leadership from Mr. Cuomo and legislators in Albany. In good times, they spent liberally and used fiscal gimmicks -- borrowing, rolling over debt, one-shot revenues -- that have come back to haunt them.
Mr. Cuomo is not the worst offender. Republican lawmakers, while pretending to be fiscal conservatives, pushed for even more profligate financing gimmicks than the Governor allowed. But he went far enough, irresponsibly raiding the State Insurance Fund and failing to restrain legislators.
Consider the 1987 income tax cut. Mr. Cuomo first complained that it was too deep, but then went along and even took credit for it. Later he and legislative leaders had to freeze the cut because the state needed the revenues. Mr. Cuomo often encouraged the use of one-shot revenue-raising devices that helped mask budget deficits.
One-shots can serve as useful cushions in bad fiscal times, but New York has over-indulged. As Sam Howe Verhovek reported in The Times, one-shot revenues of $2.7 billion covered nearly 10 percent of the spending in last year's budget, a record; this year's budget includes $1.4 billion.
Now Mr. Cuomo proposes a multiyear budget to close the combined deficits in this fiscal year and the next. Theoretically, the idea has merit. With more time, the state can make true reforms and avoid harsh service cuts or abrupt tax increases. But a multiyear plan is also an invitation for abuse, allowing officials to push fiscal problems into the future by rolling over debt. Until Mr. Cuomo actually issues a plan instead of merely an idea, it is impossible to judge its fiscal integrity.
Unfortunately, the idea is mired in politics. Since the plan would smooth over the state's problems past the 1992 elections, Albany Republicans -- no doubt taking their cues from their national party -- resist it as part of Mr. Cuomo's Presidential strategy. But whatever the political implications, a responsible multiyear budget could be better than another quick fix of one-shot gimmicks.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The U.S.: A Pathetic Nation?

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
With the trillions spent to win the cold war, it will be pathetic if the U.S. fails to find $1 billion to combat famine and the danger of nuclear chaos in the Soviet Union.
Famine in Soviet cities this winter could kill the Soviet democratic experiment, and there is only one way to prevent starvation. That is by loading up U.S. military aircraft with food, flying to cities and overseeing the distribution. But aside from a few Democratic Representatives such as Les Aspin and Lee Hamilton, Washington sits on its hands. 
 The spread of Soviet nuclear weapons could present the greatest threat to world peace, and there is only one way to guard against their misuse, theft or sale. That is a crash joint effort by U.S. and Soviet specialists to secure them. But apart from an encouraging bipartisan group of senators joined by Mr. Aspin and Mr. Hamilton, Washington shows no urgency.
The risks of inaction and delay are clear and grave. Yet legislators, fearful of being accused of helping Soviets at the expense of Americans, shrink from doing what they know is right. And President Bush, who above all understands what must be done, is also frozen by such accusations and remains inexcusably silent.
The one thing Mr. Bush has done -- his now $4 billion "food aid" program -- raises serious questions about his competence and motives. Senator Patrick Leahy is not alone in charging that the President "is playing a deceptive game with American taxpayers."
The Bush $4 billion plan sounds good. It provides U.S. credit guarantees for the Soviets to borrow money from banks to purchase American grain. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the program "is aimed at alleviating food shortages and other dire humanitarian consequences . . . this winter."
But much of the grain won't even reach Soviet seaports in time to make a difference this winter. Much of what does arrive is bound to rot on the docks or find its way into the black market, if past experience with Soviet distribution is any guide. Most of the cargo is feed grain, destined for farms and animals, not people. This grain will help sustain livestock. But it will do very little to alleviate hunger in Soviet cities now.
This is no secret. Which is why Mr. Leahy and many others see the $4 billion as aimed more at raising American farm incomes than at helping needy Soviets.
Mr. Leahy is also rankled by what he sees as Mr. Bush's budgetary sleight of hand. The President is not asking Congress to appropriate $4 billion, and says the Soviet Union is creditworthy and will pay its bills. Mr. Leahy argues that there is little chance the Soviets will find the cash, and that the American taxpayer will eventually have to pick up the tab. The Senator is by all odds correct.
Here another fundamental issue is joined. If the $4 billion is essentially a gift to the Soviet Union and mainly a boon to American farmers, and if it won't do much to relieve famine this winter, why spend it at all? Or why not use the money to provide emergency relief for needy Americans?
Put this way, the Leahy stance is not frivolous or isolationist. Politicians could say in honesty that they would rather use the funds for America's emergencies than make a grand, but largely ineffectual gesture abroad.
But the choice should not be between a questionable food aid effort and American domestic priorities. It ought to be between those priorities and a food relief program that can work.
Mr. Aspin has put together a list of already-bought and ready-to-go foodstuffs, including $165 million in free food already allocated by Mr. Bush, and tons of food leftover from the Persian Gulf war. Europe is also loaded with excess stocks.
What is needed is transportation and reliable distribution inside the Soviet Union. U.S. forces fed the Kurds after the gulf war and could do it again on a much larger scale. They are also ready to help their counterparts gather and destroy Soviet nuclear weapons. The $1 billion needed for these vital tasks would come from existing Pentagon funds, not new money.
A nation loses its soul and spirit if it cannot act to protect its most basic interests and values. Soulless and spiritless we will enter our future if we fail to do what we can to forestall new dangers and dictatorship in the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Limited Menu: Lots of Pressure To Fix the Economy, But Few Options

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
SOMETIMES the American economy in recession, like a kayak that has capsized, rights itself. So far, this recession has not been one of those times. And so the question is, who should try to make the economy grow again: the President, Congress, the Federal Reserve Board or you, the consumer?
 The New York Times, November 24, 1991 
In past recessions, the answer has often been all four. The President and Congress cut taxes, or found other ways to put money in people's pockets. The Fed lowered interest rates. And the consumer got his job back, or received more wages, and started spending again. But this time only the interest rates have been cut, and that has not worked.
 With the recovery that apparently began in May having come to an abrupt halt in October, the nation's top economic forecasters recently revised their opinions drastically, according to the Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter, which polls 52 prominent economists each month. And in Washington, Robert D. Reischauer, chief economist at the Congressional Budget Office, captured the flavor of the new thinking. "The motors that normally revive an economy are running, but they are running very slowly," he said. "Not that we have not had a recovery, but you need an electron microscope to analyze it."
 Naturally, there is much debate about what to do next. There are experts who argue that sometimes the best thing to do for an ailing economy is to do the least that is necessary; in trying to rush a recovery along, they say, the Government risks doing more harm than good. But the experts work with computer models, which do not vote.
 The New York Times, November 24, 1991
 Having pushed for lower interest rates, President Bush and the Federal Reserve say, in effect, sit tight; the lower interest rates will revive the economy by early spring, which would bode well for the Republicans in an election year. But the longer the recovery is delayed, the greater the pressure on the Adminstration to take further steps. On the other hand, the price of ending the recession through economic stimulants might very well be an increased Federal deficit and eventually inflation.
 But why hasn't this interest rate phenomenon worked yet? In an interview last week, David W. Mullins Jr., the Fed's vice chairman, offered an explanation that is also put forth by economists who advise President Bush. The upturn has been delayed because Americans are still retrenching, Mr. Mullins said. Rather than borrow to spend, they are paying off debts accumulated in the 1980's or borrowing to refinance mortgages at lower rates. Such behavior does not expand the economy. Similarly, corporations are also paying down debt, rather than hiring or investing heavily in new machinery.
 "The retrenchment process raises the possibility of subdued growth for the next couple of quarters," Mr. Mullins said. "It may be unpleasant, but there is no shortcut."
 The New York Times, November 24, 1991
 Mr. Mullins acknowledged that "subdued growth" could mean no growth at all from now until April, when he expects the retrenchment to be over. Nevertheless, the prospect of waiting until spring for growth to resume -- if the scenario outlined by Mr. Mullins works -- is prompting some politicians and economists to talk of priming the fiscal pump. They are beginning to wonder if, for the first time in years, the Federal Government should spread cash among Americans through such things as public-works jobs, tax credits, and more unemployment benefits than Congress recently authorized.
 "We are closer than I would have believed we could have gotten to where we are seriously talking about Depression-style programs to pull ourselves out," said Paul Krugman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist.
 Still, the talk is hesitant. That is because the most effective pump priming makes the budget deficit rise, and neither Congress nor the White House has much stomach for the political risks of a rising deficit. The problem, however, is that growth is not likely to result when Congress simply takes money from one budgeted outlay -- nuclear waste disposal, for example -- and then spends it on another, perhaps airport construction. New money, in effect, must be created and spread through the population, a process that might end the recession while increasing the deficit. "It has to be a genuine increase in the transfer of
 The New York Times, November 24, 1991
money to the public, without higher taxes to pay for it," said Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economic science.
 Just such pump priming occurred during the 1981-1982 recession, although by coincidence rather than design. During the recession's worst months, President Reagan's big tax cut took effect, serving as a windfall for millions of Americans, but of course running up the deficit. In the 1950's, 1960's and early 1970's, pump priming was common. As late as 1975, President Ford pushed through an income tax credit to help end a recession.
 But in those days budget deficits were relatively small, and certainly not the mesmerizing issue they are today. Even Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland and chairman of Congress's Joint Economic Committee, hesitates to push for pump priming, although he favors it as a way out of the recession more than do most in Congress.
 Mr. Sarbanes' boldest proposal would go no further than what he calls front-loading the budget. Rather than wait, he would immediately spend money that was budgeted for, say, highway and bridge repair, with the funds spread out in the budget to last two or three years. Thus, he would adhere to the 1990 budget agreement, which prohibits absolute increases in spending. And to get
 The New York Times, November 24, 1991
the front-loaded spending more quickly into people's pockets, Mr. Sarbanes would funnel money to states and cities, where it would subsidize projects already under way.
 "We could go through the whole Federal budget and get some impetus for the economy by front-loading items," Mr. Sarbanes said. "Not much stimulus, but some."
 Mr. Sarbanes has not embodied front-loading in a bill. But recently introduced bills designed to prod the economy are similarly low-keyed. Many are revivals of someone's favorite tax proposal, involving I.R.A's, capital gains and tax credits. But they would be financed through an offsetting increase in revenue or a spending cut.
 The bill that comes closest to pump priming, in the view of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group, is a tax credit aimed at the middle class proposed by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois. A two-year credit of up to $200 for single people and $400 for married couples would be financed by raising the tax for the wealthiest Americans. The aim is to shift money from the wealthy to those more likely to spend it; the rich traditionally save a bigger percentage of their income than the middle
 The New York Times, November 24, 1991
class. But it is a proposal that Representative Bill Gradison, Republican of Ohio, says is likely to increase the budget deficit by $25 billion over the next two years, and stick the wealthy with a permanent tax increase.
 
The Lonely Consumber
 Beyond the Government stands the consumer. More than in previous recessions, consumers are on their own. There is no pump-priming to bolster their income, and jobs are disappearing as states and municipalities cut back to balance budgets. What's more, in a stagnant economy, jobs and raises are hard to come by, which means that the disposable income of the average American is growing more slowly than usual, if it is growing at all.
 In Germany, France and some other industrial countries, the consumer is not so much on his own. Public works spending is more robust. Jobless pay in Germany equals 63 percent of an average production worker's last salary compared with 50 percent in the United States, according to the O.E.C.D. Housing subsidies for the unemployed are generous in Europe, and in other industrial nations jobless pay usually runs much longer than it does here.
 The New York Times, November 24, 1991
 Such shortcomings add to the anguish of a prolonged recession and the pressures on the Bush Administration. Even Mr. Mullins at the Federal Reserve, which has been opposed to fiscal stimulus, says the day may come when that position could change. "I think we are not at the stage of putting forth fiscal packages," he said, "but I think it is worthwhile debating to see if we can design some policy actions that are useful here."

HEADLINE: Closing Down the K.G.B.

BYLINE: By David Wise; David Wise is the author of the forthcoming "Molehunt," a book about the C.I.A.'s search for Soviet spies in its ranks.

 BODY:
YASENEVO.
Even to most Soviet citizens, the name is unfamiliar. But to anyone in the K.G.B., it needs no explanation. The highly guarded, restricted compound in a wooded area southwest of Moscow is the headquarters of the K.G.B.'s First Chief Directorate, its intelligence and espionage arm. The spies. 
 It is night, and we are speeding east along Moscow's outer ring road in a black Volga. I am the first Western reporter ever to be allowed into the directorate, the Pervoye Glavnoye Upravlenie. The huge K.G.B. man at the wheel has the broad shoulders of a linebacker; he is so tall that his head touches the top of the car.
All at once, through the darkness and the mist, the red lights atop the 21-story skyscraper inside Yasenevo come into view. A few minutes later, the Volga swings into an unmarked exit on the right. All that is visible from the ring road is an international "no entry" sign, designed to turn back any hapless civilians who take a wrong turn.
The Volga moves along a narrow road amid birch trees and we come, incongruously, to a small farm-style gate. The car stops for a moment, scrutinized by unseen armed watchers in a guardhouse just beyond. Then the gate swings open.
I had asked to visit Yasenevo, not believing it would really happen. Suddenly, in a burst of post-coup glasnost, I am actually inside. It is surreal.
Physically, the parallels with the rival Central Intelligence Agency are remarkable. Like the C.I.A., the espionage directorate is out in the woods, away from the capital. Indeed, K.G.B. insiders call Yasenevo "the Russian Langley." The sign at the C.I.A. turnoff reads "Bureau of Public Roads." Inside the grounds of the directorate, the sign says, "Scientific Research Center." Even the rivals' ultramodern offices bear a close resemblance.
Like C.I.A. officers, who call their agency by a variety of nicknames, of which "the Company" is best known, Soviet case officers never refer to the K.G.B. -- the initials stand for Komitet Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti, or Committee for State Security -- by name. They call headquarters the "les" (forest) or the "kontora" (office).
In a moment, we are at a smaller, low building, its driveway bathed in bright floodlights. With my K.G.B. escort, I am shown to a second-floor reception room.
A few minutes later, Maj. Gen. Vyacheslav Ivanovich Artyomov, the acting chief of the directorate, mounts the stairs. He is 55 years old, a career spy with a crew cut, sharp features and a swarthy complexion. He invites me into an adjoining office furnished much like a traditional Russian living room, with two large low cocktail tables set with bottles of mineral water.
Forget Boris and Natasha, the cartoon character Russian spies. At the top, the K.G.B. leadership today is smart, smooth, sophisticated and well tailored. For three hours in near-perfect English, Artyomov covers a wide range of subjects, from past abuses to the spy agency's future.
Artyomov says he was born in Grozny, in the Caucasus, "the son of a truck driver." He pauses for a beat, and adds, "a teamster." It strikes me that Artyomov's command of the language is all the more remarkable if, as he claims, he has never lived in an English-speaking country.
He graduated from Moscow's Oriental Institute, joined the K.G.B. in the late 1950's and was a station chief, or resident, as they are known in the K.G.B., in Africa and Asia. As he speaks, his left hand fiddles with a double row of white worry beads, or chotki, a habit he picked up in his years abroad in Muslim countries. As acting chief, his rank is roughly equal to that of the director of the C.I.A. But this is the K.G.B., after all, and nothing is quite what it seems. Artyomov is an operational name, an alias. He declines to reveal his true name. (From other sources, I was able to learn that it is Vyacheslav Ivanovich Gurgenev.)
I ask him whether even a repackaged K.G.B. could ever fit into a democratic system. "Unfortunately for the K.G.B., it became and remained until recently the tool of the party," he responds. "And the party used it indiscriminately against all sorts of dissent. The K.G.B. should have completely divorced from the party. It should just be part of the Government. Intelligence agencies exist in all countries, and the K.G.B. should be like them. I believe it is possible.
"The K.G.B. had become a mammoth, monstrous organization, with too many functions. Instead of an institution to protect the state, the K.G.B. became an institution dangerous to the state." For a moment, I thought I had wandered into a seminar in Washington on the dangers of intelligence agencies to democratic government. Did Artyomov talk that way before the coup? Did he really believe what he was saying? He certainly seemed to, but there was no way to tell.
"I believe what remains of the K.G.B. will be two separate institutions," he says. "One for counterintelligence, antiterrorism, organized crime and corruption on the highest levels. The other, this directorate, will just be foreign intelligence, without any domestic powers. I don't know what the name will be, but I'm quite sure it will never be K.G.B. again. The society simply will not stand it."
Four days after my visit, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced that the directorate would become an independent agency under a presidential appointee, Yevgeny M. Primakov, who served as Gorbachev's closest foreign policy adviser. Its new name will be the Central Intelligence Service.
During the interview, Artyomov had talked about Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, the man who ran the espionage arm for 14 years before he was elevated to K.G.B. chief in 1988 and who is now imprisoned, charged with treason for leading the failed coup. Kryuchkov led the coup, Artyomov says, "to roll history back. It was a terrible miscalculation."
But the intelligence directorate, Artyomov adds quickly, "was not implicated, not at all. At 8 o'clock in the morning of Aug. 19, I was shaving and my wife had gone to her daughter to help with the children and she telephoned me. I said, 'Who the hell can be calling me at this time of the morning?' She said, 'You're shaving and there's been a coup.' "
All K.G.B. residencies around the world were alerted, Artyomov says, but not instructed to support the plotters. "It became clear that the whole affair was absolutely idiotic and unlawful. And then we did nothing but watch CNN."
The conversation is interrupted by a full-course dinner: lavish zakuski -- mushrooms, vegetables and other typical Russian hors d'oeuvres -- then beef stuffed with prunes, blueberry pie and tea. There is no food shortage in the K.G.B.
I ask Artyomov about the pervasive network of K.G.B. informers, the stukachi. Although Vadim V. Bakatin, the new K.G.B. chief, abolished the system of informers, he declined to release their names, on the grounds that it would tear Soviet society apart. Artyomov agrees. "We don't want a civil war in our country," he says. "The problem of reporting, of mutual suspicion, fear, these are the problems so deeply rooted in our soul and our genes, even. If we open up certain things in many parts of our country, real vendettas will start. You had wives, children, informing and so on. Most were not paid; they were forced into it."
K.G.B. bugging and wiretapping had turned the entire Soviet Union into a sort of giant electronic ear. What, I ask, would happen to the wiretap technicians, and the employees of the notorious Fifth Directorate and its recently disbanded successor, Directorate Z, which monitored internal dissent? It was the Fifth Directorate that hauled opponents of the regime off to the prison camps, suppressed dissident writers and artists and over the decades served as the secret police of a system that claimed millions of victims.
The wiretappers will be re-employed, Artyomov replies, and the officers of Directorate Z transferred into other jobs, some in the police. "The policy of the present bosses is that these people should not be made pariahs," he says. "If you force them into a tight corner, people with those skills can join all sorts of mafias."
Is it true that spies being sent to the United States are trained near Moscow in an exact replica of an American village? He laughs. "Coca-Cola city? Absolutely ridiculous. It doesn't exist."
It is approaching midnight and time to go. We walk out to the front of the building, into the strange bright floodlights. The Volga has turned around and the linebacker is in place at the wheel. I shake hands with the chief K.G.B. spy, get into the car and we move off into the darkness.
IN THE AFTERMATH of the failed coup, the question facing Soviet society is not so much whether the K.G.B. can be caged, whether a decades-old instrument of terror and repression can be brought under control. Rather, it is which parts of the vast security apparatus will survive at all, or should, and in what form. As the Soviet Union fractures, so does the K.G.B.
The C.I.A., of course, is closely watching what happens to its old adversary. Last month, Richard J. Kerr, then the agency's acting director, spoke privately to a group of Yale alumni -- including many former and current agency employees -- in the C.I.A.'s white-domed auditorium at Langley. "There are at least three K.G.B.'s today," he said, "and perhaps as many as 18." Kerr's point is that the K.G.B. is no longer a monolith, but is fragmenting, both in Moscow and in the republics, many of which may establish their own security agencies or take over existing K.G.B. organizations.
C.I.A. officials believe that the intelligence arm will concentrate on collecting the West's scientific and technological secrets and will reduce covert political action. This view is shared by Donald F. B. Jameson, a former senior Soviet operations officer for the agency. "Covert action, propaganda and political operations were really under the international department of the Communist Party, which used the K.G.B. as an instrument," Jameson says. "Since the party is gone, I expect a lot of that will disappear."
Although it continues to spy, the K.G.B. has fallen on hard times. Its former chairman, Vladimir Kry uchkov, is sitting in cellblock No. 4 of Matrosskaya Tishina prison, a grim building on the northern edge of Moscow, facing a possible death sentence. All of the intelligence agency's leaders have been fired by the new K.G.B. chief, Bakatin, a reformer and a leader of the democracy movement in what is left of the Soviet Union. Morale is low, and the K.G.B.'s size has been cut drastically. It no longer controls any troops or border guards. Bakatin has lost his army of spies, now that the First Chief Directorate has been declared independent. To top it off, the K.G.B. is broke; it does not have enough money to pay its officers.
If all that were not enough, Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian republic and the hero of the resistance to the coup, is eyeing the K.G.B., especially the intelligence directorate, as a rightful prize. The agency has become a pawn in the larger struggle for political control between Yeltsin and Gorbachev.
If its leaders in Lubyanka, the former prison that still serves as K.G.B. headquarters, have any doubt how far the K.G.B. has fallen, they have only to look out the window. The 14-ton statue of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the Polish aristocrat who founded the Cheka, the first Bolshevik secret-police agency, is gone, toppled by the cheering crowds. In its place is a bare pedestal.
VADIM BAKATIN, THE modish, youthful-looking chairman of the K.G.B., is seated in his fourth-floor office in Moscow, drawing little circles in pencil on a sheet of white paper. Each circle represents a piece of the K.G.B. already stripped from his domain and transferred elsewhere.
"For the K.G.B.," Bakatin tells his visitor, "I see a process of disintegration."
Bakatin had headed the Interior Ministry until hard-liners forced him out last year. Now Bakatin is a player once more, albeit on a much smaller playing field.
His office, in a gray granite building across the street from Lubyanka, gives no hint of this; it is as big as a bowling alley. Bakatin has six white phones on his desk, another status symbol. The Soviets apparently do not believe in multiline phones. Bakatin sits in the chair occupied a few months ago by Kryuchkov.
The building, 3 Lubyanka Street, in which his office is located also houses the Second Chief Directorate, the K.G.B.'s counterintelligence arm, on the seventh floor. The building is packed with electronic equipment, as Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d discovered when he called on Bakatin in September. "There is so much stuff in here," one K.G.B. man says, "that your walkie-talkies didn't work. Baker's security people couldn't speak to each other."
Square-jawed, handsome and athletic-looking, Bakatin has reddish brown hair, brushed in the style of a television anchorman. He turned 54 on Nov. 6.
A photograph of Gorbachev hangs over his desk. But not all of the icons of the Soviet state have disappeared -- a white bust of Feliks Dzerzhinsky watches over Bakatin's reception room. In front of his desk, chairs are neatly arranged on both sides of a polished table at least 30 feet long. Before the coup, it was the meeting place of the K.G.B. collegium, the intelligence agency's board of directors. Bakatin fired them all; the collegium is no more.
Spies are being fired as well. K.G.B. sources say the espionage directorate is being slashed by 30 percent, and earlier this month Bakatin said the number of intelligence officers abroad would be cut by half.
Bakatin finishes drawing circles for his visitor. The circles, he explains, form a chart of independent intelligence components that he sees as loosely linked.
"To talk about the K.G.B.," he says, "we have to know what kind of state we will have in the Soviet Union. Assuming the Soviet Union will be preserved, there will be some independent directorates such as for intelligence, counterintelligence, Government communications, customs, border troops, the directorate that deciphers communications." He pauses, puts down his pencil and adds:
"We won't have a K.G.B."
What, then, will be left for Bakatin to preside over? Essentially, he says, the K.G.B.'s Second Chief Directorate, the unit in charge of counterintelligence, now renamed the Inter-republican Security Service. But as Bakatin envisions it, the service would also combat organized crime, terrorism and high-level official corruption. "We will coordinate the activities of the republics," he says.
Bakatin demonstrated a sure sense of public relations early on by firing his son from the K.G.B. ("I don't want him working under his father"), and permitting the wife and two daughters of the K.G.B. defector Oleg Gordievsky to join him in England.
Was it true that he liked the Beatles and Elvis Presley? "When I was younger. Now I like music of the 30's. I like American jazz, my favorite album is 'Blue Pyramid.' " (The K.G.B. chief has discriminating taste; the recording, from the mid-1960's, features Johnny Hodges, one of the greatest alto saxophonists, and two other artists from the Duke Ellington band.)
"I like tennis," Bakatin says. "I'm not a good player, but I don't like to lose. I try to fight, but I have an awful game." Bakatin's wife, Ludmilla, is a physician, a neurologist. He has two sons, Alexander, 32, and Dmitri, 26.
Asked what would happen to all the bad guys, the K.G.B. officials who suppressed dissent and bugged innocent citizens -- the people who exiled the Nobel laureate Andrei D. Sakharov to Gorky, for example -- Bakatin tries a lob. "Brezhnev had to be responsible for Sakharov. Can we accuse a colonel of the K.G.B. who took Sakharov to Gorky? He was accomplishing the will of the system. As for the bad guys, the whole collegium who presided over this table" -- he gestures toward it -- "they were dismissed. Nothing will happen to the others.
"We still have bugging of persons involved in intelligence or major crime. But I have decided to make reductions of 30 percent for bugging by the end of the year." Although Bakatin does not mention it, he fired Gen. Yevgeny Ivanovich Kalgin, chief of the notorious Department Twelve, the unit that actually performs the bugging and wiretapping.
Did Bakatin think the K.G.B. could be controlled?"Well, it can be," he replies. "The most complex problem is personnel. Old habits, customs. At the same time, I'm optimistic that all these people are military and will do exactly what they are told. If earlier they were taught to do bugging, they did bugging, but if today you tell them, 'Don't do it,' they won't do it. That's what makes me think its possible."
Old C.I.A. hands, of course, are skeptical. And Jameson, the former C.I.A. Soviet specialist, says he thinks the K.G.B. faces a real problem with its surplus operatives. "The K.G.B. may find jobs for some of their people in the Interior Ministry and the police," he says. "But there could be a lot of card shuffling going on without necessarily reducing the number of cards in the deck. Early retirement will be one option, whether willing or not."
FOR 74 YEARS, THE K.G.B. was much more than a spy agency. In American terms, it was the C.I.A., the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Security Agency, Border Patrol and other intelligence units, all rolled into one. To the Soviet people, it was the jackboot on the stairs, the instrument of terror that could, in an instant, pluck people from the safety of their homes and send them to some Siberian gulag. The K.G.B., especially under Stalin, was truly the Ministry of Fear.
Founded in December of 1917, two months after the Bolshevik Revolution, the Soviet secret police metamorphosed through a series of initials -- O.G.P.U., N.K.V.D., N.K.G.B., M.G.B. and M.V.D. -- before emerging as the K.G.B. in 1954. Abroad, its officers spied on the perceived enemies of the Soviet state, particularly the United States. Its gruesomely named Department of Wet Affairs (Mokriye Dela) assassinated its enemies abroad. In recent years, it has succeeded in recruiting an astonishing number of spies in United States intelligence and defense agencies, people like John A. Walker Jr., whose Navy spy ring passed cryptographic secrets to Yasenevo for 17 years.
In 1982, after the death of Leonid I. Brezhnev, Yuri V. Andropov became the first K.G.B. chief to lead the Soviet Union. His protege, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power in March of 1985. Gorbachev thus owed much of his own rise to the K.G.B., and he relied on the security apparatus for political support. In 1988, he appointed Vladimir Kryuchkov, another Andropov protege, to head the K.G.B.
Despite its role in the failed coup, it was the K.G.B., the most worldly part of the Soviet bureaucracy, that recognized most clearly that the system was falling apart and needed reform to survive. "The K.G.B. was dedicated to the idea that somehow the system could be made to work right," Jameson says. "Their increasing opposition to Gorbachev was because the K.G.B. thought he was destroying the system, not modifying it."
Although there is a notably freer atmosphere today, fear of a resurgent K.G.B. and a return of the hard-liners lurks not very far below the surface. Is the fear realistic? Jerry Hough, a Soviet specialist at Duke University, says it's not. The K.G.B. has splintered, he says, adding: "The split is permanent. What the coup showed was that the K.G.B. was capable of levels of incompetence that are hard to believe."
Even veteran K.G.B. hands are gloomy about the future. Mikhail Petrovich Lyubimov served as a K.G.B. officer in London and as resident in Copenhagen before he retired and became a novelist and journalist -- and a highly vocal critic of his former employers. Lyubimov does not see happy days ahead for his old service. Asked to predict what will happen to the K.G.B., he replies, "I think, frankly, it's over."
The coup starkly revealed that the K.G.B. was riven by the same ideological and generational fault lines that were weakening all the major Soviet institutions long before August. Early this year, in an effort to consolidate his power, Kryuchkov named his own team, weeding out much of the pro-Gorbachev leadership. But when the crunch came in August, Kryuchkov's orders to prepare to attack the Russian Parliament were ignored by the K.G.B.'s crack young Group Alpha and lesser-known Cascade troops. Kryuchkov never gave the actual order to attack, because he knew it would not be obeyed.
GEN. ALEKSANDR Nikolayevich Karbainov is the K.G.B.'s full-time public relations man. His large, sunlit office is on the third floor of Lubyanka, the nine-story ocher building that housed an insurance company in czarist times. Under Communism, thousands of prisoners were held and tortured in its dungeons.
I suggested to the general that the K.G.B. was a tough sell. General Karbainov smiled, showing gold teeth. Although formal in manner, he is an affable man of 46, an engineer with no background as a spy.
The P.R. office has been busy. In an attempt to create an image of a warmer, friendlier K.G.B., the spy agency, among other gambits, held a beauty contest and selected one of its employees, Katya Mayorova, as "Miss K.G.B." She is rumored to be a crack shot. More recently, Karbainov has permitted reporters to tour the Lubyanka dungeons, which have been converted to offices for the K.G.B.'s cafeteria staff.
With the aid of his deputy, Col. Oleg I. Tsarev, a smooth career spy, Karbainov detailed the wrenching structural changes that have taken place in the K.G.B. since the failed coup. Before August, there were 13 directorates. Now, there are only five.
The K.G.B.'s size is an official secret, but the best estimate is that it had 620,000 employees. With the removal of some 220,000 border guards, that figure will drop to about 400,000, and much lower as the K.G.B. breaks up. By early November, Bakatin was claiming that the total reporting to him would soon shrink to a little more than 39,000.
"The budget of the K.G.B. is 4.9 billion rubles," General Karbainov says, which would be $8.3 billion at the inflated official rate. "The budget of the U.S. intelligence community is $30 billion," he adds, smiling. "That's four times as high as the K.G.B." It occurred to me that General Karbainov would do very well on Madison Avenue.
THE ARCHIVES OF the K.G.B. may hold the key to a number of mysteries to which the world hopes for answers, ranging from whether President Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, had a relationship with the K.G.B. to whether the K.G.B. in cooperation with Bulgarian intelligence tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II in Rome in 1981. In time, the K.G.B. or its successor agencies may release information on these and other mysteries.
However, K.G.B. officials are quick to deny any link to Oswald or the plot against the Pope. One former high-ranking operative, Boris A. Solomatin, was in a position to know. Solomatin, 67, is a gray-haired man with hawklike features and an uncanny resemblance to Lyndon Baines Johnson. While the K.G.B. resident in Washington in the mid-1960's, he recruited the Navy's John Walker. Later, Solomatin was resident in Rome when Mehmet Ali Agca shot the Pope.
Was there a K.G.B. connection? "The answer is no," Solomatin says. He is smoking Pirins, Bulgarian filtered cigarettes. "It would have been idiotic to be involved. If anything was going on with the Bulgarians, I would have known."
Similarly, senior K.G.B. officials deny any link to Oswald, who lived in the Soviet Union for two and a half years before he returned to the United States and assassinated President Kennedy. I came away from these meetings thinking that K.G.B. denials of complicity in the assassination conspiracies might well be true. But I had the unsettling feeling that the K.G.B. would be saying exactly the same thing if it had been involved. As Kryuchkov once said: "Intelligence is a game without rules."
And did the K.G.B. have a mole inside the C.I.A. in the 1960's? The controversial C.I.A. counterintelligence chief, James J. Angleton, spent years looking for one, without success. "No," Artyomov says. "Mr. Angleton was one of the casualties of the cold war. You had McCarthyism inside the C.I.A." And is there a mole today? "Even I would not be told," he says. "And if I was told, I wouldn't tell you."
YURI MODIN LUMBERS into the little restaurant like a Russian bear. He is 69, a huge man who, with his gray hair and white goatee, looks more like Santa Claus than what he is, a retired colonel of the K.G.B. He is a legendary figure, Kim Philby's controller, the man who ran the K.G.B.'s greatest spy.
He has come for a rare interview with a reporter from the West. He is an old-line officer, not very impressed with the reformers who have taken over Lubyanka. But he is happy to talk about Philby, the MI6 mole who betrayed the secrets of British intelligence to the Soviets over a lifetime.
It was Modin, stationed in London, who arranged the escapes of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, the two Foreign Office spies for the K.G.B., as the net tightened on them in 1951. Their flight cast suspicion on Philby, who was subsequently fired by MI6 and was out of work.
"So in 1954, I made a special trip to London to give him money," he says. He did not dare to contact Philby directly. That had to be done through Anthony Blunt, the art historian and another member of the famed Cambridge spy ring. "It took me three months to find Blunt," Modin says. "I had to bump into him accidentally. I was haunting art exhibitions. I learned Blunt was to be at a large public gathering. I had a postcard with a Madonna on it. On the other side, I wrote the date, time and place for a meeting, a street crossing. After the meeting, Blunt was surrounded. I waited until only four or five people were left and went up to him and handed him the postcard and asked if the picture had been moved from one museum to another. He looked at the card, turned it over, saw the writing and said 'Yes, yes,' and handed it back. He met me two days later. We set up a meeting on the street with Philby in the western part of London. I gave Philby 5,000."
Modin was unhappy with the disintegration of Soviet power. "There should be an authority, some things to be obeyed whether you like them or not," he says. "But I was against the coup. It wouldn't have helped." The K.G.B.'s espionage arm will certainly survive, Modin says. "We are silly, but not that silly."
IF BORIS YELTSIN TAKES over the K.G.B., Sergei Stepashin will be his point man. At 39, Stepashin, a member of the Parliament of the Russian republic, was named by President Gorbachev to investigate the K.G.B.'s role in the coup and to recommend reforms in its structure. But the committee, although technically appointed by Gorbachev, was heavily stacked with -- and controlled by -- Yeltsin supporters.
If Stepashin has his way, the K.G.B. will be abolished and the intelligence directorate absorbed into the Russian security service. That scenario may not come about, now that Gorbachev has named Yevgeny Primakov to head an independent spy agency, the Central Intelligence Service. A shrewd, jowly, veteran diplomat, Primakov, 62, is moving at full tilt to take control in Yasenevo.
"Authority of the K.G.B. on the territory of Russia has been passed to the Russian Federation," Stepashin insists. "Yeltsin signed a decree on Sept. 30 doing this. But the same day, Gorbachev signed a decree separating the intelligence directorate from the K.G.B. This illustrates the problem in our country; on the same day, two conflicting laws."
Did he really think Kryuchkov would be executed? "I don't think so," he replies. "I would be against it myself. Personally, I would set him free and make him work on a collective farm. But people who violate the law should be punished in accordance with the law. He will get a prison sentence."
The intelligence operations of the K.G.B. may well be absorbed into the Russian republic. But a Yeltsin power grab would almost certainly bring strong opposition from the other republics, which aren't about to subject themselves to a K.G.B. run by Russia. Moreover, even a scaled-down K.G.B. is enormously expensive. At a time when Yeltsin has called for painful economic measures, how can he justify financing Gorbachev's K.G.B.?
THE STATUES OF Dzerzhinsky, Stalin, Kalinin, Sverdlov, Khrushchev and other Communist icons lie broken and scattered in a little fenced area near the new Tretyakov art gallery. People come to photograph them or just to stare.
As I watch, Olga Prokhorova, a 16-year-old schoolgirl with dancing brown eyes, climbs atop the statue of Stalin and, giggling, straddles his head. Is she afraid of a resurgent K.G.B.? "I think the repressive system has almost collapsed," she replies. "The people were afraid. But now there is nothing to worry about and to fear." She says this with absolute, nonchalant assurance.
Boris M. Bakhrekh, 51, an engineer, has his camera out but does not want his own picture taken. "What we are seeing here is our past," he says. "And our children must understand the past in order to understand the future. We lived as in a prison, and now we hope that this nation, which struggled for freedom, will get it." His wife, who declines to give her name, motions toward the statue of Dzerzhinsky and says, "The problem is that he is lying down, but a lot of them aren't."

Finding Bargains and Discounts on Ski Lift Tickets

BYLINE: By JANET NELSON; JANET NELSON writes frequently about skiing and other sports.

 BODY:
LAST year, Aspen, Colo., broke the $40 barrier for daily lift tickets, and this season, several other ski areas have followed suit. The daily price at Vail, Colo., and the weekend and holiday rate at Mount Snow, Vt., will be $40; at Deer Valley, Utah, it will be $41 every day ($44 over the Christmas holidays), while at Okemo, Vt., it will be $41 on weekends and holidays.
One notable exception to the increases is Aspen Highlands, Colo., which had a $40 ticket last season and reduced the price to $30 for this winter. "We're doing this to attract volume," said Mike Minarski, marketing director for the ski area. "Lift ticket price is extremely critical in getting people to ski." 
 This is understandable when the cost of five days of skiing is $350 or $400 for a couple -- before air fare, hotel and meals. But even as ticket prices are edging up, the number and variety of discount programs and ways to save on lift tickets is increasing every year. "Definitely, the most expensive way to ski is to walk up to the ticket window and buy a lift ticket," said Tom Meyers, marketing director of the Vermont Ski Areas Association. "But, with today's economy, ski areas realize skiers are more price sensitive than in the past. There's a trend to seek alternative strategies for skiers who are sensitive to price. We'll see this movement more and more over the next few years."
 
Frequent-Skier Discounts
 Among the strategies are frequent-skier discounts, relatively inexpensive midweek season passes and coupons that are sold in grocery stores or at gas stations. To find such deals, read brochures from the ski resorts carefully or call the area before starting a trip to find out about the possibility of lower priced tickets than those sold at the window. In addition, some airlines are selling discount packages for ski tours. Delta, for example, is offering a free one-day lift ticket to all United States and Canadian resorts served by the airline. (Blackout dates are Dec. 19 to Jan 5 and Feb. 14 to 19, 1992. More information: 800-872-7786.
Most skiers know that midweek prices drop by $4 to $10 at all but the busiest destination ski areas in the Rockies. Even bigger savings can be realized by buying tickets for 2-to-10-day periods; the more days purchased, the lower the daily cost. At Okemo, for instance, the two-day weekend ticket is $72, or $36 per day. Vail's nonholiday multiday ticket is $259 for seven days or $37 per day. Killington, Vt., has a seven-day ticket at $226, which works out to $32 a day.
Another way to save money, particularly for beginning skiers, is to go to a smaller area. The lift ticket prices are not as high because these resorts generally offer a shorter vertical drop, fewer lifts and trails and less extensive snow-making and grooming. The daily ticket for adults at Eldora, Colo., for instance, is $25 and for children from 7 to 12 it's $12. At Mount Cranmore, N. H., the daily adult ticket is $33 on weekends and holidays, $23 midweek; and for children the prices are $18 and $12. There is one major area known for its low lift ticket prices -- Alta, Utah, a large area where this year's daily lift ticket will be $21 for adults and children.
 
Post-Holiday Reductions
 Early season, before the Christmas holiday period, and late season, after mid-March and until the season ends, ticket prices are usually reduced by 20 to 50 percent. This year, Crested Butte, Colo., has pushed this concept to the limit, offering free skiing for the first three weeks of the season from this Wednesday to Dec. 14. At Telluride, Colo., skiers who book through the Lodges at Telluride management company will get free skiing until Dec. 20.
Skiing a half-day after 1 P.M. is a traditional way to save a few dollars on lift tickets, but afternoon bargains are growing. At Attitash, N. H., anyone can ski after 2:45 P.M. for $10 any day of the week on a Last Run ticket. A Sunday morning ticket at Okemo, good from 8:30 A.M. to 1:30 P.M., is $32, and skiers who arrive on Sunday for a ski week of five days or more can ski free all afternoon. Keystone, Colo., allows flexible pricing based on periods of the day. A twilight ticket, from 2 to 10 P.M. is $27 for adults; a night ticket, from 4 to 10 is $22; and a late night ticket, from 7 to 10, is $15.
Season passes can be money-savers for people skiing at the same resort for many days, and more areas are offering midweek-only and nonweekend- and non-holiday-only season passes. At Hunter Mountain, in upstate New York, where the adult ticket is $37 every day of the week, the season pass is $900 when purchased with a credit card or $875 for cash. A skier would have to ski there 23 or 24 times to break even, but midweek-only season passes are $725 and $700, with break-even points at 19 or 20 uses.
In the new wave of ticket deals, Vernon Valley/Great Gorge, N. J., hopes to fill slopes midweek from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. with a variety of discount coupon offerings. The coupons, which will be on products and in stores throughout the tri-state region, are worth $5, $6 and $8 off the midweek ticket, normally $35, or the night ticket, normally $15.
In Colorado, skiers who live in Denver and other cities in the Front Range often buy their lift tickets at supermarkets where they cost a few dollars less; Aspen's ticket, for instance, is $38 this season at King Super.
Frequent-skier programs have been gaining in popularity since they were introduced a few years ago. Each use of the Countdown Card at Waterville Valley, N. H., for instance, reduces the ticket price by $2 to $3 from $30 until the price is $14 where it remains for all future visits. Skiers 55 and over reach the $14 mark after only six visits. Stratton, Vt., with a $39 daily ticket for weekends, offers a frequent-skier card for $25 that gives $15 off any day up to Dec. 20 and after April 1; for the rest of the season it is $10 off on weekends and $10 off midweeks for 10 ski days and $15 off midweek after that.
Membership in ski associations provides varying discounts at ski areas. At Vernon Valley, skiers who belong to the American Ski Association or the National Ski Association receive $6 off midweek and with Ski Card International, two can ski for the price of one. Membership in these associations allows skiers to buy two-day tickets for $50 that are good at Aspen, Snowmass or Buttermilk until Dec. 20, and for $60 from Jan. 6 to Feb. 14. (The American Ski Association is at 64 Inverness Drive E., Englewood, Colo 80112, (800) 525-7669 or (303) 397-7669. Membership is $30 for the first person, $15 for the second and $10 for each person after that. The National Ski Association is at 1675 Larimer Street, Suite 710, Denver 80202, (303) 825-0944. Membership is $7.95 per person. Ski Card International is at Post Office Box 3369, Evergreen, Colo. 80439, (303) 674-0808. Membership is $30 for a single card; two cards, $27.50 each; three cards or more, $25 each.)
 
Limited Tickets
 Some areas sell lift tickets for limited sections of the mountain at lower prices. At Killington, an all-day ticket for just the Sunrise Mountain region with one lift is $19, while the East Ridge-only ticket for three chairlifts is $29. A pass for the lower intermediate and beginner trails and four lifts at Waterville Valley is $29 for adults and $19 for juniors on weekends and $24 and $15 midweek. Winter Park, Colo., has a Mini Mountain ticket good on five lifts with access to 200 acres of terrain for skiers of all abilities for $15.
Special rates apply to children at most areas, and Attitash is extending this on Sundays when children 12 and under pay a dollar for every year of age. At Purgatory/Durango, Colo., children 12 and under ski free when parents buy a daily or multiday tickets; one free ticket for each adult ticket. Two parents and two children 12 and under can ski for $60 a day at SilverCreek, Colo., a savings of $12 over individual tickets.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Dario Fo's Outraged Housewives

BYLINE: By LEAH D. FRANK

 BODY:
DARIO FO is Western Europe's most widely produced playwright. This phenomenally successful Italian satirist, actor, painter, musician, cinematographer, director, set and costume designer and political activist has been in the forefront of world theater for the last 40 years.
His creative social commentary has been condemned by groups as divergent as the Vatican, the Italian Communist Party and our own State Department, which continues to deny Mr. Fo a visa on the grounds that his presence is powerful enough to constitute a "clear and present danger" to the stability of the United States. 
 Free speech and a free flow of ideas are still paramount, so fortunately the fruits of Mr. Fo's labor regularly slip across our borders. If State Department bureaucrats attended the theater, they might be comforted to discover that in practice, at least in many American productions, Mr. Fo's plays may be the cutting edge of political bubble bursters, but they are often too long to sustain the passionate waving of the red flag of revolution.
In "We Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!" Mr. Fo's play at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale through Dec. 15, the working class expresses its dissatisfaction with consumer-price increases that are not keeping up with workers' wages.
This farce about outraged housewives had its English language debut in London in 1978, and what is both interesting and tragic at the same time is that the issues it raises seem to come right out of contemporary American newspapers.
"We Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!" may be set in Milan, but the economic problems facing two women and their overworked hubands are no longer defined by national boundaries.
Yet, as in so many political plays, the problems are defined, high cost of living and exploitation of the working classes, but solutions are given in amorphous terms. To suggest that Utopia will arrive when power is given to the people makes no more sense dramatically than it does economically or politically. In any case, a total suspension of disbelief is required.
It does not, however, take a Marxist bent or even that of a moderate Democrat to appreciate the broadsided political humor in a Fo play. Serious situations, in this case economic recession, are pushed to the limits of absurdity.
In this play, several women in a grocery store decide to stage an impromptu revolt against rising prices. They decide not to pay for their groceries, and in the ensuing confusion they walk off with any edible item they can grab.
Frederic De Feis, who has directed the Arena production, has trimmed the script to good effect and has chosen a gentle approach to the sometimes heavyhanded political farce.
The overall result is good fun, rather than left-wing theoretical bludgeoning, and although the approach dulls the satiric edge, it allows the genuine charm in the script to come through.
Sunny Taylor handles the role of one of the rebellious housewives with cunning and wit. Her Antonia is a fast-talking quick-thinking woman who does not allow idealism to interfere with her pragmatic approach to life.
Stephanie Bianca gives Margherita, the friend who follows Antonia into a cauldron of economic uprising, a fixed expression not unlike that of a deer caught in the headlights of a speeding automobile.
Joseph Senzone is the blustery, law-and-order-comes-first husband of Antonia, a man who finally sees the need for a people's uprising. Patrick Burchill as Luigi, Margherita's husband, is a mirror image of his stunned wife. Joseph M. Mantello gives a rounded, zesty performance in the dual role of a sympathetic police sergeant and his hard-hearted lieutenant.
"We Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!" is a delightful example of political theater and a gentle reminder that the more things change, the more they seem to remain mired in the same cliches.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: South Orange

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
SOUTH ORANGE, which is laid out along the side of New Jersey's Second Mountain, stands in sharp contrast to the high-crime inner cities east of it. Its expensive homes on large, heavily treed lots, keep their value, showing that integration can work.
"Thirty years ago, during the race riots in Newark, many people fled from the surrounding lily-white communities," said Harry W. Drum, a 15-year resident and businessman. "But South Orange, although posh, was an integrated community then. Because race was not considered a problem, people just stayed put." 
 This 2.8-square-mile community, although almost fully developed, retains some vestiges of village life, including gas street lighting. Utility poles are in back yards, rather than cluttering the streets.
Its houses reflect its economic diversity. Most were built between the turn of the century and 1940. Harriet C. Connolly, president of Raymond Connolly Realtors, said prices on streets such as Montrose Avenue or Grove Road in the Montrose section range from $250,000 for some four-bedroom colonials to $850,000 for a 10-bedroom Victorian on two acres.
The other expensive areas are Newstead and North Newstead in the northern section. Prices on Crest or Speir Drive in Newstead range from $250,000 for some four-bedroom ranches to $800,000 for seven-bedroom colonials. Split levels and ranches on Hill or Mountain Drives in North Newstead are offered from $250,000 for four bedrooms to $1 million for some six-bedrooms on large lots.
In contrast, in the center of town, on streets such as Park Place or Church Street, small colonials on 50- by 100-foot lots, built for the staffs in the large houses, can be had for $100,000 to $150,000.
The 28 apartment buildings, built between 1920 and 1970 and concentrated around the village center, have a total of 820 units that rent for $600 for some studios to $1,300 for three-bedrooms in some of the newer buildings.
There are four major condominium complexes, inluding the four-story, 75-unit Village Mews off Third Avenue. The red brick complex around an open green area was built in 1985 to blend in with the nearby firehouse and train station on Sloan Street and South Orange Avenue.
Although settled by Puritan farmers from Connecticut as early as 1666, South Orange became an independent village only in 1869. It started becoming the bedroom community it is today in 1858, when John Vose, a New York lawyer, moved to Scotland Road and began buying land in what is now the Montrose area and subdividing it for sale to New York City businessmen. Development was aided by the Morris and Essex Railroad, which had laid its first track through the area in 1836. Today, New Jersey Transit has two train stations in the village.
THE central business district, concentrated on South Orange and Vose Avenues and Sloan and Valley Streets, looks a bit shabby, with several empty stores. There are clothing stores, video shops and a small ShopRite. Many residents shop for food in the village's other supermarket, a Pathmark, in the southern section, or in nearby towns. They also go to the Short Hills Mall, five miles away.
The village has applied for a grant under the Federal Main Street Program to upgrade its downtown.
Among the popular places to eat are Neelam, an Indian restaurant on South Orange Avenue, Cryan's, an Irish restaurant on First Street, Toro Loco, for Mexican food, on Valley Street, and Bunny's, a hangout for students at Seton Hall University, in the southern part of the village.
Among the newer residents are the police director, Steven Palamara, his wife, Deborah, and their two daughters, 2 and 4 years old. Mr. Palamara, who started working in the village in 1989, said his family moved from nearby Bloomfield to a five-bedroom colonial on South Ridgewood Road in November 1990 because they needed more space and he was impressed with the community.
"In my job, you see the best and the worst," he said. "And I saw a safe community with a high level of service."
Those services include a recycling program recognized last year by the state's Department of Environmental Protection as one of the most cost-efficient, according to Village Administrator Joseph O. D'Arco. Among its innovations is the mulching of leaves and branches and their return, free, to gardening residents.
The village sponsors Fourth of July fireworks and Village Aglow, a nonsectarian mid-December event during which residents get together for hot chocolate in the 36-acre Meadowlands Park. On New Year's Eve, the village plans a nonalcoholic First Night celebration including dinner, dancing, fireworks and other entertainment in the village center.
There are 62 acres of parkland, two-thirds of which consists of Meadowlands Park and the adjacent Cameron Field. Together, the two parks have five baseball diamonds, 15 lighted tennis courts, a soccer field, a duck pond, playgrounds and the Baird Community Center. The center has meeting rooms, a game room, an amateur theatre and ceramics and art studios. Village residents also have free access to the Peter S. Connor Memorial Pool complex, which has wading, intermediate and olympic-sized pools.
"People complain that they pay a lot of taxes to live here," said Joyce Bryant, a village trustee. "They're right. And that's partly because we are in Essex County, which has a full-time court system, a jail and a large number of people on public assistance. Our job as elected officials is to try and make sure that they get premium service for their money."
BY FAR the most controversial issue is the grouping of children in the South Orange/Maplewood School District, which serves the two sister communities through four elementary schools, two middle schools and Columbia High School on Parker Avenue in Maplewood.
The elementary school classes are what Assistant Superintendent E. Everett Kline calls "heterogeneously grouped," meaning they include students at all levels of ability and achievement. From Grade 6 on, students are "homogeneously grouped" by achievement level.
A school staff committee is studying the class structure. Options range from tracking, in which students are grouped according to results of standardized tests and teacher evaluation, to total heterogeneous grouping, in which all classes include children at every level of performance. Complicating the issue is that most pupils in the system's lower tracks are black, leading to allegations of racism.
One of the most vocal advocates of homogeneous grouping is Mr. Drum, who last year formed a committee called Parents and Performance Grouping. "When you put all levels in the same class, the ability of the good student doesn't rub off on the poorer student," he said. "You just wind up knocking out the self-esteem of the poorer student, depriving the high achiever of the challenges to help him excel, and substitute a standard of mediocrity for one of excellence."
Despite the controversy, 89 percent of the students go on to higher education. Computers are introduced in kindergarten. Each middle school has two computer labs and the high school has seven, including a 20-computer network donated by I.B.M. The high school also got a $65,000 National Endowment for the Arts grant to introduce poetry into classrooms. The program, which began last year and will be completed this year, includes work with two Pulitzer laureates, Sharon Olds and Gallway Kinnell.
South Orange High graduates consistently win more than $100,000 a year in athletic scholarships. Last year, the school won Essex County championships in boys and girls outdoor track, and state championship in boys soccer and wrestling.
There are two Roman Catholic parochial schools -- Marylawn of the Oranges for girls in grades 9-12 and Our Lady of Sorrows Parish School, from pre-kindergarten through grade 8.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Japanese Benevolence, Low-Profile Indeed

BYLINE: By Nancy Marx Better

 BODY:
Yasuyuki Katoh and Ryosei Kojima are snaking their way through midday Manhattan traffic toward Harlem. It's a chilly fall day, and the two businessmen are snug inside a chauffered car. Dressed in dark suits and white shirts, they have an animated conversation in Japanese about the passing sights. As the glittering skyscrapers give way to vacant, worn out buildings, their conversation grows hushed, then halts.
At the corner of Broadway and 138th Street, a seedy strip littered with crack vials, the limousine glides to a stop near a big blue motor home parked at the curb. A line of small children clinging to their mothers huddles outside. Gingerly elbowing through, Mr. Katoh and Mr. Kojima board the vehicle. The crowd eyes them warily, glancing at their sleek briefcases and polished shoes. 
 This is one of three mobile medical units operated by the Children's Health Fund, which provides free care to homeless children. Founded in 1987 by the singer Paul Simon and Irwin Redlener, a New York pediatrician, the fund has already become one of the city's most visible charities. Its directors include Mayor David Dinkins, Time Warner chairman Steve Ross and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. The newest backer is International Business Communications, a fledgling Japanese group.
I.B.C. was set up last year by three trade groups that represent Japan's mainstay industries -- automobiles, electronics and computers -- which in turn represent 35 companies, including Nissan, Sony and Toshiba. I.B.C.'s goal is to boost the reputation of Japanese business through charitable contributions. While many individual Japanese companies have made significant gifts to American organizations, they have often been accused of trying to buy goodwill. The idea behind I.B.C. is to avoid embarrassing questions about Japanese motives by not associating philanthropy with specific companies or their products.
"We want to correct the confusion about our contributions," said Mr. Katoh, who runs I.B.C.'s New York office. "It's not just to improve the image we have here. We want to get involved."
And so, I.B.C. launched its campaign last month with a $350,000 gift to the Children's Health Fund. To demonstrate its committment, Mr. Katoh visits one of the mobile units twice a week, usually taking visitors.
"My colleagues have a picture of America that isn't true," Mr. Katoh said. "When they come to New York, they stay at the Plaza and shop at Tiffany. They think America is so wealthy. This is a real surprise to them."
Mr. Katoh leads a tour for Mr. Kojima, the Tokyo-based deputy manager of I.B.C., and several other executives. The tiny registration area is filled with wailing babies; screams come from the back where a patient is getting a shot. When Mr. Katoh gets to the doorway, he proudly gestures for the group's attention. There hangs a large brass plaque, bearing the inscription, "This Mobile Medical Unit Is Sponsored by I.B.C."
Back outside, Mr. Kojima puts on his trenchcoat and shakes his head. "It's shocking that these children have no health care," he said. "This is an excellent group for us to support."
To be sure, the fund is a perfect medium for Japanese philanthropy. It's small enough that a contribution under $1 million can make an impact. But it's prestigious enough that I.B.C. members get to rub shoulders with luminaries -- the glittering board includes Jane Pauley, Carl Sagan and Patrick Ewing, among others.
"Our No. 1 goal is to help the homeless," Mr. Katoh said. "But we hope to meet some people, too."
That shouldn't be tough. Next month, the Children's Health Fund will announce a corporate council for 100 top donors. I.B.C. will be offered a seat on the council, and invitations to regular meetings with top American executives. "It's a great opportunity for them to network with influential American executives," said Dr. Redlener, the project's founder. "But they're taking an understated approach. They aren't trying to plaster their corporate logos everywhere."
I.B.C.'s inception comes at a critical time for Japanese corporate philanthropy, spurred to action by the backlash against Japan's growing economic power. Five years ago, according to the Corporate Philanthropy Report, a Washington-based newsletter, Japanese subsidiaries in the United States gave $30 million to American nonprofit groups; in 1990, the figure hit $300 million. By contrast, companies from France, Germany and Britain together give about $60 million annually.
While the first wave of Japanese giving focused on elite institutions, the current trend is toward grass-roots groups. Mr. Katoh said I.B.C. deliberately sought a low-budget, needy cause rather than underwriting an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum, say, or endowing a chair at Harvard. "It's a smart move," said Robert Bothwell, executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy in Washington. "The Japanese know a contribution like this won't carry negative consequences."
I.B.C.'s next project hasn't been announced; according to Mr. Katoh, the group is still grappling with the basic concept of corporate philanthropy. "In Japan, the main mission for a company is to make money and pay taxes," he said. "The government takes care of social welfare."
But now companies are having to think about helping. Of course, giving money is one way. Will the Japanese go a step further and roll up their sleeves in the time-honored tradition of American volunteerism? Mr. Katoh doubts that ladling broth in soup kitchens is in the near future for I.B.C. "First, we have to get used to this," he said. "We have to walk before we run."

HEADLINE: FORUM;
The Economy as a Random Event

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. MITCHELL; Daniel J. Mitchell is senior fellow in political economy at the Heritage Foundation, Washington.

 BODY:
The President's market-spooking call for lower credit card interest rates and his quixotic attempt to cheerlead the economy out of recession hardly are encouraging signs for workers and families bearing the brunt of the current downturn. Comparisons of George Bush's recent behavior with Gerald Ford's "Whip Inflation Now" campaign and Jimmy Carter's infamous "malaise" speech leave many Americans wondering whether the Bush Administration has any idea what is happening in the economy.
Some attribute the White House's bizarre behavior to jitters over the upcoming election. Yet while election seasons often lead politicians to contemplate particularly inane policies, there is a growing sense that the Bush Administration truly does not understand what caused the recession and has no clue how to reverse the economy's slide. Nor is it simply the case that George Bush is blaming the recession on factors unrelated to the downturn or supporting the wrong policies to get the economy growing again. The Administration seems to lack any focused plan for the economy, even a bad one. 
 Without an ideology or an agenda, the White House has succumbed to an ad hoc process of labeling every possible policy as being part of the President's growth package. Some, such as President Bush's anemic capital gains proposal, would marginally stimulate growth. But others, like the highway bill, have little to do with altering projected growth levels. Still other policies, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, impose heavy costs on the economy's productive sector.
Some Democrats charge that this incoherent process is the result of government by poll taking. Whatever the President's flaws, however, he does not seem to be the kind of man who would put short-term political expediency ahead of the nation's long-term interests. The real problem is that the White House either does not know what policies will do the trick or simply believes policy does not matter. Indeed, some members of the Administration view the economy as a random event, with George Bush simply having the bad luck to be President during a period of economic decline.
This divorce between economic policy and economic performance partially explains growing conservative opposition to the Bush Presidency. Reagan loyalists understandably are resentful when members of the current Administration privately state -- and publicly hint -- that Ronald Reagan's tax cuts and deregulation had nothing to do with the record period of economic expansion and job creation during the 1980's. This building resentment is compounded when Administration officials imply that the recession is a legacy of Reagan policies rather than admit at least some correlation between the recession and President Bush's acquiescence to higher taxes and costly new regulations.
Part of the problem is that George Bush admittedly finds international affairs more interesting and rewarding than domestic policy. As a result, he has conceded many economic issues to his staff. Unfortunately, his senior economic advisers, notably Budget Director Richard Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, have little grasp of how the productive sector of the economy works. As a result, the White House has acquiesced to one proposal after another that imposes penalties on job creation and economic growth.
In recent years, the President has signed into law a 27 percent increase in the minimum wage, an extremely expensive Clean Air Act, a similarly costly Americans with Disabilities Act, a record tax increase, a civil rights bill that encourages racial quotas and an unemployment benefits extension bill funded by more taxes. Had voters been told in the summer of 1988 that this would happen, almost all would have assumed a Dukakis victory.
The moral of the story: High taxes and excessive regulations do not work any better for a Republican White House than for Jimmy Carter. Only when the President understands that economic policies affect economic performance will the White House realize that the recession is more than a public relations problem. Unfortunately for millions of citizens enduring lower living standards, and ultimately perhaps for George Bush, that day is unlikely to arrive unless the President breaks the stranglehold of bad advice he is receiving from his economic advisers.

HEADLINE: Organic Farming Increasing In State

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH farmland in New Jersey is the costliest in the nation and grocery store prices for farm products are considered high given the current recession, a small group of natural organic farmers and their supporters have begun carving out a niche for themselves in the state's agricultural market.
The modest but consistent growth of natural organic farming became evident recently when more than 2,000 people showed up on a rainy Saturday for the state's first Organic Farmfare, held in Pennington. 
 The event offered a cornucopia of organic produce and other health food products, as well as lectures and an organic garden doctor, who was inundated with questions by weekend gardeners and professional growers alike. They wanted to know about pesticides and soil preparation.
No one, including the organic farmers and those who regulate or research their operations, is asserting that the organic growers have begun giving conventional farmers a run for their money. At best, state agriculture experts say, there are only 70 farms and 1,000 acres involved in growing crops organically. This compares with the state total of 8,300 farms and 880,000 acres.
Also, New Jersey farmers of all descriptions reported $650 million in cash receipts last year, which was just over 8 percent more than the $600 million in receipts reported in 1986. In the absence of a specific economic survey on organic farming, however, no one knows for sure how much of the $650 million was earned by organic farmers.
 
'Quiet but Progressive'
 Organic farming refers to the use of natural substances, instead of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, to produce crops.
"The natural organic movement is quiet but progressive," said Dr. Mark Robson, the director of regulatory affairs for the State Department of Agriculture.
The fair was sponsored by the Natural Organic Farmers' Association of New Jersey, which represents several dozen farms as well as wholesale and retail outlets, and the Stony Brook-Millstone Watershed Association, a conservation group.
A speaker at the fair was Dr. Joan Goldstein of Princeton, the author of "Demanding Clean Food and Water: The Fight for a Basic Human Right" (Plenum Publishing, 1990). In an interview, Dr. Goldstein said that in relation to the farming industry as a whole, the organic market was emerging "as a specialty store compared to a department store."
The natural organic segment, she said, "will never overtake the agriculture industry as it now exists in the state, but over the long term it will greatly influence the whole industry by encouraging more judicious use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers and other farming methods."
 
A Market in the Region
 Ken Muckenfuss, the owner of the Mill Creek Organic Farm in the Burlington County community of Medford, said widespread reports on the misuse and excesses of synthetic pesticides had stimulated the growth of the organic foods industry by causing a public demand for wholesome foods.
He grows only 100 percent organic vegetables, grains and other products, which he sells to markets in South Jersey, Philadelphia and New York. At 138 acres, his is the largest organic farm in the state.
Mr. Muckenfuss said this was the first year in the family farm's 18-year history that it produced a large enough income for him to make ends meet without supplementing his income with construction work.
He said that he was optimistic about the future because of the public concern about pesticides in food and that organic farming would "increase dramatically in the next five to 10 years."
 
'Potential Niche' Seen
 Dr. Roger Wyse, director of the Agricultural Experiment Station at Cook College of Rutgers University, was more guarded but still positive about future growth, saying that organic farming "is still in its infancy, but there is a potential niche market for truly organically grown crops."
The executive director of the Natural Organic Farmers' Association of New Jersey, Jennifer Morgan, said the state had been slow to organize and certify organic farmers. The association began certification only in 1989 and consumer and industry guides to New Jersey's organic markets were published by the group for the first time this year, Mrs. Morgan said.
California was the first to certify organic farmers, in the mid-1970's, she said.
Marcia Hosteter, a certification administrator for the New Jersey association, said an applicant for certification had to fill out a questionnaire on practices and farming philosophy. Then, she said, an inspector from the association is sent to the applicant's farm to assure that the farmer meets association standards.
Ms. Hosteter said standards included not using prohibited substances like synthetic chemical pesticides and fertilizers and instead using materials like manure, alfalfa meal, such beneficial organisms as bacteria and wasps, nontoxic compost, kelp extract and unfortified fish meal.
Mrs. Morgan and others said uniform national standards were essential to promoting organic farming in general so that they could become more competitive and so that the public would not become confused about varying standards from state to state. The 1990 Federal Organic Foods Act calls for establishing uniform standards on certification procedures by 1993, they said.
The law applies to all producers and handlers selling more than $5,000 worth of products a year.
 
Differences in Definition
 Carol Shipp, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Agriculture, said that until a consistent and uniform definition of organic was arrived at, "what is considered organic in one state is not organic in another state." According to the association, the definition of "organic" food is "food produced on land where no synthetic chemical applications have been made within the previous three years."
Mrs. Morgan, Dr. Wyse and others pointed out separately that, among the impediments to the growth of organic farming in the state was the high cost of farmland, which at $4,912 an acre is the highest in the nation. The average nationally is $682 an acre, though it is higher in the Northeast. In Rhode Island, for instance, it is $4,827.
The New Jersey figure was down from the $5,321 an acre reported by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1987.
Although stifled somewhat by a general economic slowdown since 1987, developers in the northern two- thirds of New Jersey have been paying about $10,000 to as much as $200,000 an acre to buy farmland, the State Agriculture Department said.
With the average farm at 106 acres, and with heavy market competition, organic farmers have been pitted against conventional farmers who intensively plant 20 to 30 crop varieties each growing season to make the most of their land. Organic farming, on the other hand, is more labor and management intensive, the experts say, and crop prices can be anywhere from 1 percent to 30 percent higher than conventionally grown crops.
 
Increasing in Favor
 But many aspects of organic farming are gaining favor with conventional farmers, Dr. Wyse and several agricultural spokesmen say. They point to the popularity of the university's Integrated Pest Management program of the 1980's and the current trend toward what is called sustainable agriculture.
For example, the pest management program calls for a more careful assessment of when to use synthetic chemicals versus more organic weapons like the natural predators of specific pests like insects and molds. Sustainable agriculture includes integrated pest management in a more sound and calculated system to determine expenditures for irrigation, fertilizers and herbicides and other factors.
Dr. Robson of the State Department of Agriculture said that an increasing number of conventional farmers were already using organic methods "to grow one or two crops" and that "there probably is more organic farming in New Jersey than there are organic farmers."

Religious Bookstores Thrive As They Move to Diversify

 BODY:
The showroom has marbled floors, polished chrome and glass cases with blue neon trim. On display are hand-painted mezuzahs, Batman and Ninja Turtle yarmulkes, and gold and silver menorahs. J. Levine & Company is not the typical old-fashioned religious bookstore.
"I've found that people are looking today for presentation or atmosphere," said Danny Levine, the owner of J. Levine & Company, a Manhattan store that specializes in Jewish books and a variety of Judaica. 
 "I want the store to be the Henri Bendel of Judaica," he said. "People should feel, wow, this is Judaism at its best."
Mr. Levine said his sales had doubled over the last three years and estimated that sales were up 10 percent this year. Mr. Levine believes that diversification has made his store recession-proof.
The store, at 5 West 30th Street, also sells religious articles and furniture to synagogues and schools and operates a mail-order service.
"When one part of the business doesn't work, we can turn to another," he said.
In a time when many businesses have cut back, religious booksellers appear to be thriving.
"When times get hard and times get serious, people get serious" about religion, said William Anderson, president of the Christian Booksellers Association, which represents 2,750 booksellers in the United States, as well as hundreds of stores abroad.
 
800 Million Religious Items
 Mr. Anderson said the American stores had sold about 800 million religious items last year, of which about 40 percent were Bibles and other religious books. Other items included church supplies, music, cards, jewelry and videotapes. He estimated that the religious bookselling industry was growing 8 percent to 12 percent a year.
The American Booksellers Association estimates that $788 million in religious books were sold last year, an increase of 6.9 percent from the previous year and 46.8 percent from 1985. It projects a 5 percent increase in sales this year, to $827.9 million.
Last year, religious books accounted for about 5 percent of the estimated $14.9 billion book market in the United States. The books range from the Bible to "When Bad Things Happen to Good People" by Harold Kushner, "The New World Order" by Pat Robertson, "A Woman Named Damaris" by Janette Oke and "In the Eye of the Storm" by Max Lucado.
Among the Jewish books are a new translation of the Talmud, "Chutzpah" by Alan M. Dershowitz and "The Search for God at Harvard" by Ari L. Goldman, a reporter for The New York Times.
 
'We're Doing Surprisingly Well'
 "In light of everything going econmically down the tubes, we're doing surprisingly well," said Rabbi Michael Monson, executive vice president of the Jewish Publications Society, a nonprofit publishing house that publishes 15 to 20 titles a year.
One reason for this growth is the increasing types of Jewish books, expanding well beyond rabbinical studies. "There's a wide range of books," said Arthur Kurzweil, vice president of Jason Aronson Publishing Inc. "Serious theology, cook books, gay and lesbian Jews, intermarrages, Soviet Jewry, humor, photography. We publish a new book every two or three weeks."
Although there are no chains of Jewish bookstores, Mr. Kurzweil notes that there are many small bookstores, as well as larger booksellers with big Judaica sections.
But for him, J. Levine & Company and J. Roth Bookseller in Los Angeles are "the king and queen of retail Jewish bookstores."

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Suffer Fallout From Bank Bailout

 BODY:
To the Editor:
This year, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency created by Congress to manage the savings and loan institutions bailout, announced its policy to evict nonpurchasing, rent-regulated tenants of cooperative buildings in their portfolio, overriding longstanding New York State laws that protect tenants from such arbitrary evictions in New York City and neighboring counties. 
 In an obvious attempt by the Bush Administration to enlist the Resolution Trust Corporation in its assault on New York's rent regulatory laws, the agency began testing its authority on tenants of a co-op building it holds in receivership on East 57th Street in Manhattan. The state Division of Housing and Community Renewal and Attorney General Robert Abrams have sued the Resolution Trust Corporation over this issue, but it could take months, if not years, to resolve, leaving the lives of thousands of tenants hanging in the balance.
If the agency prevails, innocent law-abiding tenants who had no part in the speculative excesses of conversion sponsors and careless banking practices that contributed to the savings and loan crisis risk losing their homes. I cannot believe that Congress ever intended to afford such omnipotent powers to the Resolution Trust Corporation.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has introduced a bill and Representative Ted Weiss plans to offer amendments to the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing Act that limit the agency's power to undertake eviction actions only to those grounds allowable under state and local laws. The New York Congressional delegation must fight to assure that the final Resolution Trust proposal includes these essential limits on the agency's authority.

Need for Action by U.S. Is Debated

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
With long-term interest rates seemingly stuck around 8 percent, a long-dormant debate has revived about whether the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board should try to influence the bond market.
Talk about the issue has intensified as the yield curve, the interest rate differential between 30-year bonds and short-term notes and bills, has widened. Indeed, short-term interest rates have fallen to levels not seen since the early 1970's. 
 Moreover, the proliferation of proposals from Capitol Hill and the White House about how to stimulate the economy has injected a sense of urgency to the discussion.
 
A Record Spread
 Given the current gap between long-term and short-term rates, a strategy of bond-market intervention seems appealing.
At the end of last week, yields on two-year notes were more than 2.50 percentage points lower than yields on 30-year bonds, a record spread.
And the current spread of 3.45 percentage points between three-month Treasury bills and 30-year bonds is the second widest ever, according to Ramirez Capital Consultants, exceeded only by the gap of 3.74 percentage points after the stock market crash in October 1987.
Advocates of the intervention strategy argue that reducing the supply of new bonds to the market and issuing shorter-term maturities instead would lower the Government's borrowing costs and help bring down long-term interest rates. A decision by the Fed to buy outstanding coupon-bearing instruments in the open market would accelerate the process, they say.
 
'A Policy Instrument'
 "The fiscal policy ideas floated in Washington are at best neutral in their effect and at worst totally harebrained," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "The main thing we need to do to jump-start the economy is to get long-term interest rates lower. By issuing fewer bonds and 10-year notes, you have a policy instrument that is readily available and has the potential of lowering long-term rates."
But some analysts question whether long rates will indeed move lower. Moreover, they say it is unlikely that significant savings will be realized if the Treasury makes up for smaller sales of bonds and 10-year notes by raising the amount of shorter-term borrowings.
No matter how enticing, basing a change in debt management strategy on the current slope of the yield curve would pose risks for the Treasury, analysts said.
 
Hedging in Previous Recessions
 The yield curve has often been exceptionally steep in previous recessions as wary investors hedged their bets that monetary stimulus provided during the downturn might fuel inflation later on, said Paul D. Mastroddi, a vice president at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
During the recession of 1973-75, those fears were realized and inflation and interest rates rose. But in the 1981-82 recession, the yield curve flattened when it became apparent that inflation was moderating.
Based on that experience, "I don't think the yield curve really tells you whether issuing long or short is a good bet," Mr. Mastroddi said.
 
Deflationary Forces Seen
 Richard M. Kelly, chairman of the securities firm Aubrey G. Lanston & Company and a Treasury official during the Carter Administration, said that deflationary, not inflationary, forces were at work in today's economy.
Nevertheless, reducing the size of the Treasury's bond offerings in favor of more short-term borrowing would be a mistake, he suggested.
"If the budget were in balance or close to balance, then the Treasury could have a more flexible approach to debt management," he said. "But the Treasury issues a lot more short-term debt than long-term bonds already."
About half the debt issued by the Treasury over the last year matures in two years or less, Mr. Kelly said. Increasing the size of short-term obligations would probably drive up short-term rates.
"If the curve flattens by short rates moving up, that is very costly for the Treasury," he said.
 
Need Seen for Other Moves
 "You don't do this to save money," said Henry Kaufman, who heads Henry Kaufman & Company, a money management firm. "You do it to have a beneficial impact on the financial markets and the economy."
Mr. Kaufman said the approach would work only if a reduction in bond sales were accompanied by Fed purchases of coupon-bearing securities in the open market, as well as a willingness on the part of the Fed to lower short-term interest rates even further.
"If monetary policy stops here, with the funds rate at 4.75 percent, and Treasury then says we are going to decrease the size of the bond auctions, it will have a negligible impact," on the economy and long rates, he said.
Some analysts wondered whether a reduction in 30-year borrowing rates, a maturity that is almost exclusively the preserve of the Treasury, would really mean much to the economy at large.
 
Mortgage Rates Linked to Notes
"Very little private-sector borrowing is done at 30-year maturities, as few borrowers have the credit standing needed to sell that sort of debt," said Louis v.B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm, in a letter to clients.
As far as interest-sensitive sectors like housing are concerned, Mr. Crandall noted that while fixed-rate residential mortgages have nominal maturities of 30 years, they actually have weighted average maturities of less than 10 years because they are self-amortizing. As a result, fixed mortgage rates are based on the yield of Treasury notes, not bonds.
"This has been quite evident as 10-year and 30-year Treasury rates have diverged over the past three months," Mr. Crandall wrote. "Mortgages have rallied with the note sector rather than stagnating with bonds. If mortgage rates were not hurt by the underperformance of long bonds in the third quarter, there is no reason to think that mortgage rates would be helped by an improvement in long bonds relative to 10-year notes in 1992."

Little Enthusiasm For GTE Shares

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
THE GTE Corporation is the sixth-largest telecommunications company in the world with $18.4 billion in 1990 revenue. Yet it has had a difficult time getting the attention of investors, despite a return on equity that outperforms others in the telecommunications group and its strong growth prospects.
Of course, it could be something in the tone of the analysts' recommendations. "It's a weak buy," said Charles W. Schelke, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. "Nobody is pounding the table for the stock." And Joanne C. Smith, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute, said, "Sure, the company is doing everything right, but it's already reflected in the stock." 
 After a run-up in the stock price of most telecommunications companies throughout the late 1980's, GTE's shares have bounced around near $30 a share for nearly two years. It closed Friday at $31.125, down 12.5 cents for the day, and off from the 52-week high of $33.875 set earlier this month.
The ho-hum investor reaction partly reflects the grab bag of businesses GTE has and is trying to sort out. Last month, the company announced it would probably sell its $2.3 billion electrical products group, whose best-known product is Sylvania light bulbs, to concentrate on telecommunications. The sales price would be at least $1.4 billion.
GTE also has a 20 percent passive interest in U S Sprint, the nation's third-largest long-distance carrier. GTE plans to sell that holding as soon as it finds the right deal. Like growth in local phone calls, long-distance traffic has also been slowed by the recession.
As population growth has slowed and the recession has hurt the talkative white-collar professional classes, the phone industry has been struggling with the stagnant domestic market for plain old telephone service.
So, like other companies, GTE has looked abroad for growth. Earlier this month, a GTE-led consortium won the bidding for 40 percent of the Venezuelan national telephone company, Compania Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela. The consortium bid $1.9 billion. GTE would own up to 60 percent of the stake, with A.T.& T., two Venezuelan companies and the Spanish telephone company sharing the rest.
At bottom, however, GTE is still a heavily regulated local-telephone monopoly. Its units operate in 31 states, as well as British Columbia, Quebec and the Dominican Republic. In March, it paid $6.6 billion in GTE stock for the Contel Corporation, which is based in Atlanta and is the 10th-largest telephone holding company in the United States, with a large cellular telephone business. GTE's principal markets are California, Texas and Florida, where regulatory authorities have a decidedly mixed attitude toward GTE. In California, and to a somewhat lesser degree in Florida, regulators tend to reward operating efficiency and allow higher profits. Texas is more erratic, with the regulatory climate often chilly toward profits, analysts say. Ms. Smith of Nomura notes that despite recent layoffs, GTE has a long way to go in terms of cost-cutting and getting a long-term improvement in its earnings prospects as expenses decline and margins rise. It has announced a 6.5 percent cut in employees by 1992. GTE, though, has about 60 workers per 10,000 telephone lines; the comparable figure is 40 workers at the 40 workers at the typical "Baby Bell" regional telephone company.
Analysts say GTE's work force seems especially large in light of the fact that 72 percent of the switching network uses up-to-date digital equipment, rather than the slower analog variety; the comparable figure at the Baby Bells is roughly 40 percent. "Digital means you just don't need the same number of people as you used to," Ms. Smith said.
Analysts also say GTE's balance sheet is more debt-laden than that of other telecommunications companies, at 60 percent debt and 40 percent equity, compared with a more typical 55/45 split.
The situation will only tip further toward the debt side, with last week's Venezuelan deal and its $1 billion of additional debt. But analysts figure some of that borrowing will be offset by proceeds from the sale of the 20 percent stake in U S Sprint. That should be worth at least half a billion dollars.
GTE's recent results have shown a modest improvement. Third-quarter earnings were $453 million, or 51 cents a share, compared with $427 million, or 49 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1990. Analysts say they expect more improvement in 1992 and 1993, as the economy recovers.
The current signs are good. Mr. Schelke of Smith Barney figures GTE's return on equity, the profit divided by the company's net worth, a key measure of financial strength, will be 17 percent for 1991, compared with 14 percent for the telecommunications group as a whole.

HEADLINE: Higher Demand for Oil Is Expected

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will begin its annual year-end meeting in Vienna on Tuesday amid renewed indications that demand for oil will continue to increase gradually this winter despite the global recession.
And virtually all oil industry experts anticipate slightly higher oil prices this winter, in light of higher demand and a decline in Soviet oil output, regardless of any policy adopted by OPEC at the gathering. 
 As a result, many experts expect Saudi Arabia to press on with its year-old policy of maximizing its oil production and to continue to move to displace the Soviet Union as the world's largest producer.
Over the last two years, Saudi production has increased to 8.5 million barrels a day from 5 million. Soviet output has fallen to less than 10 million barrels a day, a decline of more than 2 million barrels.
Saudi Arabia has the ability to increase its production even more, while the Soviet Union is almost certain to experience more economic upheaval that will further depress its oil operations.
Analysts say world demand for OPEC oil, which now stands at 24 million barrels a day, will rise to 25 million barrels a day after January. The increased demand, they say, will be the result of gradual economic growth in the world -- particularly among developing nations -- even though the recession in the United States and elsewhere is limiting the overall pace of global growth..
When the recession ends, oil experts say, demand for oil will increase by more than 2.5 percent in the United States and more elsewhere.
 
Outlook for the Decade
 "From 1991 to the year 2000, oil demand will rise by 10 million barrels a day," says John Lichtblau, president of the New York Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. Some analysts even suggest that OPEC may not be able to pump enough oil to satisfy demand.
Joseph Stanislaw, an energy affairs expert with Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said, "If economic recovery is stronger than expected in the late fourth quarter, there may be even more demand for OPEC oil than there is technical capacity to produce."
In the weeks before the OPEC meeting, Saudi Arabia has been sending signals that it will increase its daily output to nine million barrels. That would raise the total Saudi share of OPEC output to more than a third of the total production by the organization's 13 members and make Saudi wishes tantamount to uncontestable decisions. Before the Persian Gulf crisis, Saudi Arabia's share of OPEC output was only 25 percent.
Saudi insistence on maintaining higher production levels is motivated by its need for revenue to make up for its enormous expenditures, estimated at $65 billion, during the gulf crisis. And the Saudi production policy, by helping keep prices lower than they might be under tighter production quotas, should insure continued growth in demand for oil.
With the decline of the Soviet Union as an oil power, experts say it is difficult to see how any other OPEC member can stand in the way of a Saudi decision to sell more oil and increase the country's share of world oil markets. Within OPEC circles, the evolution of Saudi thinking over the last two years has resulted in a "take it or leave it" negotiating strategy by Saudi Arabia.
At OPEC's last meeting, in September, Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister, Hisham M. Nazer, shocked many of the other OPEC oil ministers when he declared that Saudi Arabia regarded its current high production as a permanently acquired right.
The Saudi policy is strongly, but fruitlessly, opposed by Algeria and Iran. Both countries advocated that oil prices should be pushed higher and that OPEC should cut its production to bring this about.
Experts say the Saudis are comfortable with an oil price range of $18 to $23 a barrel. Algeria and Iran would much prefer a price that exceeds $21 a barrel.
Prices are now in the $20 range, and in the view of experts could stay there or slightly higher throughout the winter before facing what could be a steep decline in summer.
The agressive Saudi stance in OPEC assumes that despite a United Nations Security Council offer to allow Iraq to begin exporting oil to pay for food, the Iraqis will remain unwilling -- and unable, because of war damage -- to sell their oil for some time to come.
Iraq and Kuwait ceased exporting oil in August 1990, at the start of the gulf crisis, although Kuwaiti production resumed after the war and has recently picked up some momentum. But the Kuwaitis are exporting less than 300,000 barrels a day, meaning the country can play only a minor role in shaping OPEC policy.
Experts say these circumstances will favor the Saudi strategy to pump more oil, especially if coupled with a cold winter and a further drop in Russian oil exports.
 
Future of Quotas Uncertain
 In keeping with its increasingly assertive role in OPEC, Saudi Arabia has over the last five weeks signaled that it may even formally propose that OPEC scrap its quota system altogether. Such a move is unlikely to be accepted by others in OPEC, but is certain to increase bitterness about Saudi hegemony over oil prices and production decisions.
The Algerians and Iranians are likely to respond by advocating that OPEC should decide now how much Saudi Arabia would cut its output in the spring after demand for oil softens.
"We know there is a storm there, and I don't think we should go straight into it," said Nordine Ait-Laoussine, the Energy and Mineral Resources Minister of Algeria.
"The need to cut is inevitable," Mr. Laoussine said a few days ago in Paris. "We have to face up to the problem, and it is better to do it now."

HEADLINE: Fed Governor Is Confirmed Despite Regional Resistance

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The Senate has confirmed Lawrence B. Lindsey as a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, despite criticism by some members that as a New Englander he is not qualified to represent the First Federal District, which covers part of the Southeast.
Mr. Lindsey, a Harvard economics professor who has been on leave to serve as an adviser to President Bush, was nominated in February and approved by the Senate Banking Committee in July. 
 But a vote by the Senate was delayed because of resistance by a handful of senators from the Richmond Federal Reserve District, which represents Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
 
Debate Before the Vote
 In a debate before the vote late Friday night, Senator Terry Sanford, Democrat of North Carolina, argued that Mr. Lindsey had no practical experience in the region or direct knowledge of its particular agricultural and industrial interests.
"The people of the South deserve a representative who has been a participant and has been able to develop a clear understanding of their economic needs," he added.
Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, came to Mr. Lindsey's defense on the floor, predicting that he would work to pursue "growth-oriented, noninflationary monetary policy, a regulatory position which would not impede credit conditions, reform of the nation's financial system so that our banks can better compete internationally, and gradual reduction of inflation."
Mr. Lindsey has lived for the last three years in a suburb of Washington, across the Virginia border, fulfilling the statutory residency requirement for a governor. The Federal Reserve Board has six members, including the chairman and vice chairman.
But Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, charged that the spirit of the residency statute was being violated, adding, "I do not think that geographic requirement is something to be ignored or laughed at or simply brushed off."
Despite the criticisms, the Senate confirmed Mr. Lindsey by unanimous consent along with several other nominees as it tried to wind up its work before the Thanksgiving recess.
In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in May, Mr. Lindsey promised to work for long-term growth without inflation. He talked, as Fed officials often do, of achieving a balance in which growth is not so rapid and inflationary that it drives up long-term interest rates.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television;
Rivalries Give Way To Ratings

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
On Wednesday night, ABC will present what its executives consider to be its biggest and best special of the fall season. In fact, the network will be celebrating a competitor.
The special will mark the 10th anniversary of MTV, a cable network that competes for viewers every night with ABC in about 60 percent of American homes. But ABC's program executives say they have no hesitation about throwing a party for MTV, especially since MTV has the young audience that ABC and all of network television so sorely needs. 
 Certainly, it helps that the special is as star-smothered as an Academy Awards telecast, featuring Madonna, Michael Jackson, Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson, Spike Lee, Cher and Kim Basinger.
 
Open to Changes
But the special is also on ABC because that network, like NBC and CBS, is now open to almost any kind of arrangement that will bring creatively packaged and financed programs -- and a lot more viewers -- to network television.
"The business is changing so much the old rules just don't apply anymore," said Ted Harbert, executive vice president of ABC Entertainment.
Indeed, the boundaries that defined network competition in the past are being crossed -- and crossed out -- almost daily.
Last week, CBS announced a deal to buy a comedy series, "Davis Rules," that had been owned by ABC and was on that network's list of mid-season replacement shows. ABC allowed the producers to buy back the series so it could be sold to CBS.
In the first week of December, NBC will broadcast "Pearl," a fictional mini-series about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The program was originally broadcast as an ABC mini-series in 1978.
On Friday night, NBC broadcast the movie "Back to the Future III" for the second time in just a week. NBC believes audiences have been conditioned by cable channels like HBO and Showtime to expect the same movie more than once a week.
"We are going to be out there more and more pushing new ways to schedule television programs," Mr. Harbert said. "We have to. The old ways are what got us down from a 95 share to a 60 share."
Indeed, the willingness of the networks to take programs from each other and even from cable networks is directly tied to the economic pressures all of them are now facing.
In fact, there is some question whether the networks are acting desperate. Betsy Frank, a senior vice president of the ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi, said moves like rerunning a 13-year-old mini-series "make the networks look more like TBS."
TBS is a cable channel that specializes in old movies and repeats of series like "The Andy Griffith Show."
Peter Tortorici, the executive vice president of programming for CBS, said its acquisition of "Davis Rules" could not have taken place until now, when a network would rather recoup its investment in a show it might not use, even if that meant the show would go to another network.
"It's like two teams getting together because one has too much pitching and not enough outfielders," Mr. Tortorici said. In the past, he said, the networks would rather have taken a loss than see an unused show go to another network.
Certainly, NBC's decision to buy "Pearl," which ran twice on ABC, was inspired by the chance to get programming for a very low price.
Warren Littlefield, the president of NBC Entertainment, said he had been looking for some appropriate programming to mark the 50th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. He noticed that ABC and CBS had each scheduled documentaries about the attack and thought an entertainment alternative could work well.
But he found the most likely prospects, including the movie "Tora, Tora, Tora," were already taken. Then Mr. Littlefield heard that "Pearl" was available. "Pearl" was a big success for ABC in 1978, scoring the eighth-highest mini-series rating of all time.
He took it. Mr. Littlefield would not disclose the price for NBC, but he said, "Let's just say the terms were extremely favorable. "
So, for a modest price, NBC will get five hours of programming ("Pearl" was originally a six-hour series but NBC has cut an hour -- and does not believe anyone will notice).
"Pearl" will run for five nights, ending Dec. 7. The network will thus be able to pre-empt five hours of its regular, more-expensive dramas, which, Mr. Littlefield said, would have needed to run as repeats about that time anyway.
"Instead, we get something we can bill as an event," he said.
ABC's incentive for buying the MTV special was also economic, but not because it was inexpensive. Mr. Harbert said ABC paid "a very healthy" fee to acquire the show. But he said the network was assured it was going to be a show with "the kind of big names we probably could never have attracted to ABC on our own."
The MTV special will be shown at 9 P.M. Eastern standard time on Wednesday.
ABC believed the appeal of Madonna and Michael Jackson would translate into premium advertising rates. According to Tom Freston, chairman of MTV Networks, it has. He said the special has sold 30-second commercials for up to $250,000, the kind of rate the networks usually get for attractions like the Olympics.
Mr. Harbert said the network expected the special to be a significant profit maker, particularly because ABC will run it a second time between now and June, when MTV itself will finally get a chance to carry it.
All those positive factors easily put to rest any concerns that ABC had about advancing the image of a cable competitor.
"I really can't believe ABC's putting on this show will make MTV any bigger than it is," Mr. Harbert said.
MTV saw only advantages in the deal. "It's a chance to have our birthday party at our neighbor's larger house," Mr. Freston said. "This is a great promotion for both MTV and cable."
Citing the huge price advertisers are paying, he added, "They're paying $250,000 for 30 seconds; we're getting 48 minutes of that kind of advertising for free."
And it is not a bad promotion for ABC, either. "We are telling our viewers to watch ABC," Mr. Freston said.
The only real concern ABC has about the show is that Madonna's performance -- which Mr. Freston described as "theatrical" rather than a song or dance -- may test the limits of the network's standards and practices division.
In her act, Madonna presents a love letter to MTV.
"It certainly goes farther than this network has ever gone before," Mr. Harbert said.
Nor will ABC go this far often, he said. "We will still be in the business of making shows that are distinct from what independent and cable stations do," Mr. Harbert said.
But he added that these kinds of special deals and special shows are going to continue to "fill out part of the 1,144 hours we have to program every year."

HEADLINE: U.S. BANK BAILOUT HURT BY WEAKNESS OF INSURANCE FUND

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Federal regulators have had to move more slowly in seizing weak banks because of the depletion of the deposit insurance fund, the new chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said this weekend.
William Taylor, who was sworn in four weeks ago to replace L. William Seidman, also said that the premiums banks pay to the fund are likely to rise sharply next year. 
 Both comments reflect a sharp departure from previous remarks by top regulators, and each bodes ill for the public purse.
 
Raising the Costs
 The inability to deal promptly with large weak banks raises the cost of rescuing them. As big depositors move elsewhere seeking greater safety, the banks have fewer reserves when the Government eventually seizes them.
And the higher premiums for deposit insurance are passed on to banks' shareholders, as reduced profits, and to customers, who receive lower interest on deposits and pay higher rates for loans and other services.
Mr. Taylor, in a wide-ranging interview on Friday, seemed pessimistic about the banking industry and the real estate markets, in which banks have invested heavily. "Is it going to get worse before it gets better?" he asked. "Probably. I hope not, but probably."
Congress has been struggling to approve $70 billion in taxpayer loans to keep the deposit insurance fund afloat, and House and Senate conferees, who will meet on Monday, are expected to adopt a stripped-down bill bereft of all the Bush Administration's sweeping proposals to overhaul the banking industry. [Page D3.]
 
Holding Back on Seizures
 Mr. Taylor has been waiting in the wings to spend the money, which is intended to tide over the fund until it is replenished by bank premiums. Already, he said, Federal regulators have apparently begun to hold back on taking action against weak larger banks because of the condition of the insurance fund. As recently as last month, senior F.D.I.C. officials were saying that was not so.
"There's a general inhibition by the fact that the F.D.I.C. doesn't have much money," Mr. Taylor said.
Asked about the impact on other regulatory agencies, which consult with the F.D.I.C. about whether to seize banks, he said: "No orders have gone out or directives. But people throughout the organization say, 'We've got this $6 billion bank or $7 billion bank. Should we close it? We don't have any money.' The answer is: Probably yes, it has slowed it down."
The insurance fund administered by the F.D.I.C. stands behind more than $2 trillion in bank deposits. It currently has about $2 billion on hand and is expected to be out of money by the end of next month.
Mr. Taylor predicted that the annual premiums banks pay the fund would increase -- perhaps by as much as 30 percent -- to 30 cents for every $100 in deposits insured. Only five months ago, the premiums rose to 23 cents for every $100, a jump of 92 percent from 1990 levels.
When he succeeded Mr. Seidman, who retired after six years as head of the F.D.I.C., many people said Mr. Taylor had signed on to the most difficult job in Washington.
Mr. Taylor, 52 years old, arrived from the Federal Reserve Board, where he served as the head of the bank supervision division and the right-hand man and friend of the board's chairman, Alan Greenspan. Despite the added responsibilities, his new post pays him $35,000 less than his $150,000 salary at the Federal Reserve.
 
A Seasoned Professional
 Considered Washington's most seasoned professional on bank and savings and loan crises, Mr. Taylor recently served as the Government's senior regulator in London when authorities from around the world seized the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. He began the year as the Federal Reserve's top man for the rescue of the Bank of New England, which was seized in January.
Last year, he served a brief stint as the acting president and chief executive of the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Cabinet-level body headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady that sets overall policy for the bailout.
Mr. Taylor, whose sixth-floor corner office has a panoramic view of the Mall dominated by the Washington Monument, spoke enthusiastically of a wide range of ways he is considering to make it less costly for the Government to treat ailing banks.
 
A 'Hospital' for Banks
 One idea is a "banking hospital," with a staff of bankers who would take over weak institutions on behalf of the Government and nurse them back to health before they are sold.
"Instead of liquidating it, closing it and destroying the good loans that are in the business community, you just put it in the hospital and appoint people to run it," he said. "They'd take their time and look at the thing and throw out the bad loans; throw out the people who weren't doing right; scale it back down; put it back in health, and then they would send it out the door."
Another proposal that may get wide adoption next year involves Government agreements with the buyers of weak banks to share in any profits, as well as losses, that might be posted.
But Mr. Taylor's innovations will not have easy going. From the President and the Treasury and Commerce Secretaries on down, Administration officials have publicly chastised bank regulators for being too tough on banks, creating what they call a credit crunch that has been stifling the economy.
 
Replaying a Debacle
 At the same time, members of Congress and critics of the Administration contend that any easing by the regulators could lead to a replay of the savings and loan debacle, which by some measures could cost taxpayers more than $500 billion over the next 40 years.
Some lawmakers expect Mr. Taylor to exert the kind of independent judgment that often set Mr. Seidman at odds with the White House, despite the fact that the Presidential election looms next year. Mr. Taylor's term lasts only until February 1993, three months after voters go to the polls, and he said that he would like to be reappointed.
Mr. Taylor insists politics will not shape his judgments.
"It would be terrible," he said. "I would be disappointed with myself. How would it possibly be worth it?"
 
No Improvement Soon
 He said he would vigorously oppose any efforts to jump-start the economy by reducing current standards to let banks maintain a smaller cushion against losses. Banks and savings associations will have to have capital of 4 percent of assets, adjusted for risk, beginning in January, although some lawmakers, particularly in New England, have said that level should be reduced to help ailing instutitions and encourage them to lend more.
With the continued weakness of real estate markets in the Northeast and California, Mr. Taylor does not expect the condition of the weak banks to improve anytime soon.
One sign of his difficulties, Mr. Taylor acknowledged, is that he does not know if even the new money Congress will soon provide the insurance fund will be enough to cover possible future losses from banks.
"I have no idea," he said. "Not the foggiest. Tell me what the economy is going to look like. Tell me what interst rates are going to look like. Tell me what housing starts and real estate activities are like. Tell me what prices are going to be like, and I'll have a better view."

HEADLINE: In Aftermath of Deadly Fire, A Poor Town Struggles Back

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAMLET, N.C.

 BODY:
What happens to a place like this after disaster strikes and the television crews and investigators have come and gone?
About 8 A.M. on Sept. 3, fire flashed through the decrepit brick factory where Imperial Food Products Inc. cooked chicken for fast-food chains. With all means of escape locked or blocked, except the main entrance, 25 workers died and 56 were injured. The 164 other employees were left without jobs because the plant closed. 
 Remarkable things have happened since then, most good, some ugly. Welfare agencies report custody battles for a few of the 20 children orphaned by the fire, because people who are appointed guardians get the children's benefits. And big-city lawyers have arrived, promising pots of gold from lawsuits.
 
Signs of Compassion
 More important, the weeks since the fire have disclosed a resourceful and resilient community of the rural poor. Survivors say the churches, 22 in this town of 6,196 people, and the deeply rooted families who live here, brought hope and sustenance. The fire has also wrought compassion from bureaucracies -- the Social Security Administration, the United Way of Richmond County and Imperial Food's workers' compensation insurer, the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company -- that began getting help to survivors before many knew to ask.
In the end, though, the loss of a major employer, compounded by the deaths, exposes an industrial backwater here. Hamlet's economy is sinking, and its people are too poor, too locked to their unsalable trailers and weather-scarred houses, or too bound to their families to leave. Poverty and unemployment rise when factories leave towns like this and not enough else moves in to take their place.
The tenant of a building on Main Street here is a soup kitchen where 30 or 40 people have been getting a meal a day since long before the fire. Upstairs in one building is a home for battered women. About half the other establishments downtown are abandoned, including the movie theater and a Royal Crown Cola bottling plant. City Hall is new and well kept, but with the closing of Imperial Food, it has lost a major source of the revenues that pay for city services.
The fire victims' death certificates in the Richmond County Court House, five miles west of Hamlet in Rockingham, represent a cross-section of Hamlet's people. Fifteen of the 25 dead were born within a 15-minute drive of the plant, and only three were born outside the Carolinas. Just one, Elizabeth A. Bellamy, 42, married, mother of two children, had been to college. Thirteen of the dead were white and 12 were black. Eighteen were women, and 10 were black women.
The youngest person killed was Cynthia Marie Ratliff, who was 20, single and a high school graduate. The oldest was Josephine Barrington, who was 63, married, a mother of five who left school after the fourth grade. A son, Fred Barrington Jr., divorced father of a teen-age daughter, worked at the plant, too. People here say he died trying to get his mother out.
Special disaster aid for the survivors ranged from about $40,000 that the AFL-CIO and out-of-town unions contributed, to the five 29-cent stamps one woman sent in. But that help has about run out. Every weekday, 10 to 20 former Imperial Food employees or the victims' spouses, parents or children go to the United Way office in Rockingham for help. They get vouchers for up to $250 a month for rent, $150 for utilities and $100 for fuel.
But Yvonne Loury, executive director of the agency, said that its disaster fund, which climbed to $177,000 after the fire, was down to $40,000 by mid-November and that the rate of contributions had slowed to $3,000 a month. A similar fund of $45,000 collected by the Hamlet Ministerial Alliance of churches is exhausted, so the alliance has closed a center where survivors went for money.
 
Food Stamps Already Up
 As the aid runs down, applications for food stamps are likely to rise. Mikkel M. Todd, director of the Richmond County Department of Social Services, said that with the recession and other plant closings, the county's food stamp bill -- money the Federal Government will have to find -- was already running nearly 50 percent higher than last year's.
One example of how people and institutions responded to help survivors is the family of Mary Alice Arnold Quick. The three children of Mrs. Quick, who was 38 and separated from Martin Quick, have moved to the new double-wide mobile home of Mrs. Quick's sister, Peggy Brown, 42, a divorced mother of three grown children who is a deputy county clerk.
The day after the fire, Robby Lowry, the manager of the Social Security office in Rockingham, said he called undertakers to track down children of the workers who died. For Mrs. Quick's younger two children, Nakisha 13, and Martin Jr., 12, he arranged $550 a month in survivors' benefits, which they will get until they are 18, or 19 if they are still in school. "In cases like this," Mr. Lowry said, "some people would not know to come in."
The children's half sister, LaRonda Brown, was ineligible for the benefits because she is 18 and through high school. But she is getting other help. The morning of the fire, she was enrolling at Richmond Community College in Hamlet for a year's preparation for North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro. She had $100 her mother had given her to help pay for her first quarter tuition of $170 and for her books. Since the fire, the college has exempted her from the remaining two quarters of tuition payments.
 
Role for Churches
 The churches did their part. St. Peter's United Methodist Church in Hamlet gave each of Mrs. Quick's children $147. The Hamlet Ministerial Alliance bought new beds for the children and paid a $131 utility bill for Peggy Brown. The White Oak Grove Baptist Church in Greensboro "adopted" the children.
"We went up there to meet them," LaRonda Brown said. "We had to write down the things we would need. The women of the church got our sizes, and they're going shopping."
Said Flora Banks, 64, mother of Margaret Teresa Banks, 24, who died leaving a son, Michael, 6, and a daughter, Martika, almost 2: "When stuff like this happens, everybody comes together." Mrs. Banks, whose husband is a sanitation worker, has given up her job as a textile worker to raise the children.
Social Security benefits and workers' compensation will leave the family with less than when Ms. Banks was working, and more people to support. But she said some things were more important than paychecks. "I gave up my job because they're too small," she said of the children. "And I'm not going to put them in a day care center."
North Carolina, like much of the South, boomed in part because politicians helped create a friendly climate for business with low wages, low taxes and public indifference to unions.
Here, nothing compels an employer to curry community favor. Ms. Loury said the company, the town's largest industrial employer, never contributed to United Way or let her solicit donations from its employees. Lisa Blue, the acting Hamlet city manager, said the factory closed down owing $12,250 in back taxes, $8,207.22 in water and sewer bills, and $1,500 for police protection after the fire.
"I think they were very much a corporation in absentia," Mayor Abbie G. Covington, a Democrat, said. "It was not real well managed."
The state's occupational safety agency has acknowledged that because of short staff and modest resources, it did not inspecte Imperial Food in 11 years of operation here. But to protect consumers, the Federal Department of Agriculture stopped by daily to check for vermin and flies.
This month, newspapers in Charlotte and Raleigh disclosed that in June, an Agriculture Department inspector let the management stop an infestation of flies by locking a door to a trash bin outside the plant. In the fire, some workers tried to escape through the door and then fled to a cooler, where they died.
 
Company's Response
 A man who answered the telephone at company headquarters in Atlanta twice one day recently said Emmett J. Roe, the president of the company, was on another line but did not wish to comment.
A few days later, a woman who answered refused to identify herself but said Mr. Roe was not there. Asked about accusations of lax and irresponsible management, she said: "I'm sorry, I can't comment on that. I don't think anybody else would." Then she hung up. Mr. Roe and his son, Brad, who ran the plant, face 26 lawsuits in Federal and county courts.
Workers said they did not raise complaints about safety because they wanted to keep working. "People kept quiet for fear of their jobs," said the Rev. Harold C. Miller, pastor of the First Baptist Church in Hamlet and president of the ministerial alliance.
One of the plant's employees, Georgia Quick, 31, no relation to Mary Quick, may never work again. Mother of a 9-year-old daughter and pregnant, Ms. Quick barely escaped the fire. She spent 17 days in a hospital with collapsed lungs and damage to her vocal cords. "There could be some difficulty with the baby," she said.
For the present, Liberty Mutual is paying her $115 a month in workers' compensation. If doctors determine that she will be disabled for more than a year, she would get an additional $20 or so a month in Social Security disability benefits.
 
No Jobs Available
 In economic terms, the people hurt most are those who simply lost their jobs. Betty A. Dorsett, manager of the Rockingham office of the state Employment Security Commission, said not a single employer in the county is looking for people with the low-wage skills of the Imperial Food workers.
Audrey Teal, 36, a single mother of a 14-year-old daughter, escaped the fire uninjured. With wages of $500 a month, food stamps of $80 and child support payments of $100, she said she had no trouble paying the bills. She still gets the food stamps and child support, but with unemployment benefits of half her wages and with help from the United Way running out, she said she expected trouble making her $250 mortgage payment.
Linda Robinson, 44, is the mother of seven children, and the youngest three, aged 15, 19 and 21, are living at home. She earned $212 a week at the Imperial plant and she said now collects an unemployment check of $106 and vouchers from United Way.
Her husband is unemployed and does not get benefits, but he has ways of scrounging up money. "He'll help somebody rake straw or something like that," Mrs. Robinson said. "Straw" here means pine needles.
"They rake it up and bale it and sell it for mulch," Joseph G. Davis, a Rockingham attorney, said. "When you're trying to climb the economic ladder, that's about where you start."
To politicians in the capital of Raleigh, Hamlet's salvation lies in the offer of an enterprise they would not consider for Raleigh -- a 2,800-acre dump six miles from Hamlet. It would take low-radioactivity nuclear wastes from utilities in eight states. Over the dump's 20 years of use, Richmond County could collect $3.3 million a year in taxes and fees, about $1 million more than the wages Imperial put into Hamlet.
But the dump would produce few jobs, and most people in Hamlet say they have pride enough to say no.
"It's politics," said Jeanie Ederle, a volunteer in the soup kitchen. "You pick the poorest county in the state and stick it with it."

HEADLINE: ISRAELIS ANGERED BY AMERICAN MOVE ON MIDEAST TALKS

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 24

 BODY:
As Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir returned home today from an American journey, Israelis attacked the United States for his reception there, accusing Washington of having humiliated him -- and by extension, their country -- in the way it fixed the next round of Middle East peace talks.
Angry Cabinet members charged that the Americans had deliberately insulted Israel, demonstrating basic bad faith in the peace process. Phrases like "bullying tactics" and "double cross" were invoked by several officials to characterize Bush Administration actions. 
 On the political far right, ministers opposed to the peace process urged Mr. Shamir to reject the invitation the United States issued on Friday for resumed negotiations with the Palestinians and Arab states beginning on Dec. 4 in Washington.
 
Refusal Seems Unlikely
 Senior Government officials generally agreed, however, that there was almost no way Israel could turn the Americans down, certainly not when the issue is a procedural question of where the talks should be held. Although Mr. Shamir said he had asked Washington to reconsider the site, Government officials said that no matter how much they object to Washington and prefer a site closer to home, their options are limited.
But it seemed virtually certain tonight that the Israelis would not answer the United States invitation by Monday, as the Israelis said the Americans had asked in the invitation, and that when they do say yes, there will be conditions attached.
While the Israelis said Washington asked for a response by Monday, it was not clear if this was an etched-in-stone deadline and if there would be unpleasant consequences for missing it. In Washington, an Administration official said today that the United States had not set a firm deadline for responses but added that the Administration hoped to get responses soon.
Thus far, only Jordan has said yes to the Americans. Israel, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinian delegation have all said they need more time to think about it.
"We're not working according to an American stopwatch," a highly placed Israeli official said tonight. A decision, he said, was not likely until the Cabinet meets in special session, probably on Wednesday. Even then, he added, the Israelis would probably attach reservations like a request that the talks be moved as quickly as possible after a Washington session somewhere closer to the Middle East. Cyprus has been mentioned as a favorite Israeli choice in recent days.
For his part, Mr. Shamir returned this evening from his 10-day trip to the United States saying that he remained committed to the peace process but that he had also asked President Bush to reconsider Washington as a site and to keep talking with Israel until an agreement acceptable to everyone was reached.
In Washington, Administration officials said Israel had suggested holding the next round of peace talks in the Middle East and had recommended several sites. The American officials said that they would consider Israel's suggestions, but that the Arab countries had not accepted the sites recommended by Israel.
 
Visit Cut Short
 The Prime Minister's journey had been expected to continue for another day or two, and officials here said that he had cut it short because he was upset over the way he had been treated in Washington.
But at an airport news conference, Mr. Shamir sought to play down the dispute, insisting that, despite the obvious disagreements with Washington, "there is no crisis of confidence, not personal and not any other kind."
As a sign of his reluctance to further heighten tensions, he skirted a question about a remark made earlier in the day by a political ally, Police Minister Roni Milo, who called the American deadline "an impudent ultimatum" and said the Cabinet should take its time before making a decision.
Mr. Milo reflected how rankled many Israelis were by the way in which the Administration had sent out its invitations several hours before Mr. Shamir called on Mr. Bush. In fact, the Prime Minister and his traveling companions woke up in Washington on Friday morning, turned on the television news and, to their dismay, listened as Palestinian representatives said that they had already received the call to show up in Washington on Dec. 4.
Not that they were surprised that the Americans had taken action. The United States had been warning for three weeks that it would set a time and place if the Israelis and the Arabs did not agree on their own how to pick up where they left off on Nov. 3 in Madrid.
But to have it happen overnight, before Mr. Shamir got to the White House to argue his case once more for a location in this region, was deemed deeply insulting here. While some peace campaigners said that Mr. Shamir had only himself to blame, because he has tended to act only when the Americans apply considerable pressure, a widely shared view was that the United States ad heaped one more indignity on a pile that many Israelis find to be growing uncomfortably high.
Relations with Washington began to nosedive in September, when Mr. Bush insisted on a 120-day delay of an Israeli request for $10 billion in American loan guarantees to resettle Soviet emigrants. That was followed by leaked reports in Washington denigrating Israeli's economic capabilities and by Administration criticism of Israeli surveillance flights over Iraq, which Israel felt were justified given the three dozen Scud missiles that Iraq had fired this way during the Persian Gulf War.
 
The Last Straw?
 Taking all this into account, many Israelis found the latest perceived snub of the Prime Minister to be too much.
Mr. Shamir confined himself today to saying that the Administration action was not "appropriate." Others used stronger language.
"This is a bullying Administration, and they use bullying tactics all the time," a high-level official said, adding that "at the end of the day, we may not always say yes to them."
Another official referred to the American action as "a double cross." Still another, Health Minister Ehud Olmert, a Shamir loyalist, complained that "we are speaking of an Administration that doesn't try or pretend to show, even for appearances, some amount of friendship."
Even Israelis who hold little love for their right-wing Prime Minister and consider him an obstacle to Middle East peace argued that the United States had acted insensitively. "This was a clear humiliation," said Yaron Ezrahi, a political theorist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. "By doing this, they undermine the domestic resources for flexibility by this Government at the negotiations."
Israel would rather have its face-to-face talks with the Arabs alternate between this country and neighboring states because the presence of Arab negotiators here would amount to recognition of Israel. For that very reason, the Arabs do not like the idea.
As for Washington, Mr. Shamir argues that it is too far from here for easy logistics and that such a procedure would undermine the principle of unimpeded, direct negotiations. "The aim of the Arab side is not to negotiate with us but with the U.S. Administration, and with the help of the Administration to force unacceptable positions on us," he said today.
Israel has held out little hope for an agreement with Syria or Lebanon, but it sees a good chance for reaching accord with Jordan and establishing some sort of self-rule for Palestinians in the occupied territories.

HEADLINE: Once Abolished by U.S., Tribe Forges Future

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SILETZ, Ore., Nov. 21

 BODY:
Deep inside the coastal forest of Oregon, a small American Indian tribe is building the reservation of the future.
After clearing a swath in the woods, the Siletz Indians have constructed a new community of big homes and broad streets. Unemployment is well below the national average. Drugs and alcohol are not allowed. And the budget, enriched by tribal businesses and a portfolio of outside investments, is showing a healthy surplus. 
 But what is most remarkable about the Siletz is the simple fact that they exist, still holding millennium-old ties to this land. The Siletz, like nearly 70 other tribes and bands of American Indians, were offically abolished in the 1950's as part of a Government policy known as termination, which took their land, their sovereign status and their tribal identity. In return, the Government made cash payments to the Indians.
Since then, the 2,000-member tribe has waged a 35-year struggle for the restoration of what was taken. Reflecting the consensus view that the policy, which the Government said was intended to move Indians into the American mainstream, was a dismal failure, the Siletz say they are far better off with a reservation, even a tiny one.
But as they work to build a new reservation from the ground up, the Siletz are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past. There are no handouts or cash payments to individuals; they limit budget growth to 2.5 percent a year. They make some use of the old economic standbys, forests and fish, but are not afraid of trying new business ventures or investing in the stock market. And they still have ceremonies to the salmon god and teach children how to speak the tribal language.
"This tribe is a real prototype for the future because they are trying to take the best of both worlds," said Nelson Witt, an Oglala Sioux who was hired to manage the tribal business interests here. "They are a part of the outside world, but they have not driven the Indian from their hearts."
Most major tribes that were abolished under the policy from 1954 to 1970 have been restored by Congress. The Menominee, in Wisconsin, were the first to be brought back, in 1973. The Siletz, in 1977, were the second. Two tribal groups that were terminated, one in South Carolina and the other in California, have yet to win back their status as nations within a nation.
As they rebuild their nations, in some cases starting with nothing more than a one-room office in places where they used to own a third of a state, the tribes are trying to avoid the old cycles of despair. Many of the long-established Indian reservations, situated on land that was considered worthless by the Government, have unemployment rates in excess of 70 percent, bleak housing and minimal prospects for the future.
There is widespread feeling that the Siletz are a model for tribes whose status has been restored, like the Ponca Indians in Nebraska. The 1,200-member tribe had its status restored last year but has no land. Some of its leaders were on the Oregon coast this week studying the Siletz and the Coquille Tribe south of here that was restored in 1989.
The Coquille have but a single acre of land and a small tribal office in Coos Bay, a depressed Oregon mill town on the Pacific. The 600-member tribe adopted a new constitution in August and is working on a plan to be economically self-sufficient.
 
Change in Policy
 "It goes without saying that restoration will lead to a better life," said Don Ivy, a Coquille tribal leader. "But the fact is, we live in the 1990's and we need to try a modern approach. The Siletz, for us, have been a education."
Since 1960, the number of American Indians counted by the Census Bureau has tripled, to a current population of 1.8 million, mainly because the number of Americans who declare themselves as Indians has grown. A majority still live on or near reservations.
But it was not so long ago that Federal Indian policy favored removing reservations altogether. Oregon was particularly affected by that policy, as tribes like the Klamaths and the Siletz, who once had huge tracts of reservation land, were given cash payments and told that they no longer existed as a tribe. In the early years of termination, this was done without the consent of a majority of tribal members.
In their treaty of 1855, the Siletz were granted a reservation of 1.1 million acres. But the treaty was never ratified by the Senate, and land that was to have been set aside for them was given away in a series of Presidential decrees. This land includes some with the most spectacular scenery on the Oregon coast, where four-star resorts and art galleries now hug the cliffs of Highway 101.
When the Siletz were terminated in the 1950's, the Government gave each tribal member $560. In turn, the tribe lost 60,000 acres it still owned from the original 1.1-million-acre reservation. The tribe retained a small cemetery atop a hill in this town, the only visible landmark of a people who once lived from Northern California to halfway up the Oregon coast.
From the start, many in the tribe did not agree to give up its reservation, although some who lived in nearby towns told Federal agents they favored the idea.
"You never quit being an Indian just because your tribe has been terminated," said Delores Pigsley, the Siletz tribal chairwoman.
"Termination was a disaster, stripping us of language, culture, land, everything," she added. "It looked good to people who didn't live on reservations, so the Government would go to Indians outside the reservation to get their permission."
The Siletz spent two decades trying to get a Congressional declaration restoring the tribe. After 1970, when Congress and President Richard M. Nixon formally denounced termination, the path was cleared to bring back the tribe.
Parcels totaling 3,600 acres of Federal land were given to the tribe, and in 1977 it started anew. Members sold timber, built a community center next to the cemetery and made plans to construct new houses for Indians who began to move to the new reservation. They also revitalized the local community where their children attend public schools, non-Indians in the area acknowledge.
 
'Build for the Future'
 "Our goal was to build for the future, to always look ahead," said Manuel Rilatos, who is on the tribal council.
The Siletz decided, against the wishes of some here, not to give out individual payments from the proceeds of tribal enterprises. Instead, they elected to put the money into a community trust, and invest for the future. The timber enterprise grew, as did a business that sells native plants to nurseries. Money was put into the stock market. Last year, revenue of about $2 million was four times the size of the budget.
This year has been the best yet. The Siletz started a smokehouse that sells salmon to tourists in Depoe Bay. A medical clinic, serving Indians and non-Indians alike, has just opened. The tribe realized a longstanding dream and built 54 new houses, some of them with five bedroom, bay windows and two-car garages.
More than almost any other tribe that has been restored, the Siletz have prospered. But even tribes that have not done as well say coming back from termination has been a second chance at life.
"The significance of restoration is that this is the first time in American history that a major Indian policy actually began with Indian people," said Aida Deer, an educator at the University of Wisconsin who was instrumental in helping her native Menominees regain their reservation in Wisconsin.
Given the history of Federal policy, many Indians never thought they could get their tribal status or reservation returned, Ms. Deer said.
"The small tribes pulled this off, through strength and courage, and I think everybody was surprised," she said. "When termination occured, what people forgot was that Indians wanted to be Indians."
Don Miller, a lawyer with the Native American Rights Fund in Boulder, Colo., said restoration has been a rare success story in Indian country, but it should be placed in perspective.
"The tribes that were terminated have benefited greatly from restoration," Mr. Miller said. "But, of course, this doesn't mean they got very much of their land back. Only a sliver."
Looking at the big new houses here in Siletz, Mr. Rilatos, who was born here in 1923, said: "We went from a million acres to a graveyard, to this here. We are just now seeing some light."

HEADLINE: Talks on Haitian Crisis End in Impasse

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARTAGENA, Colombia, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Talks between Haiti's deposed President and his legislative opponents ended today in a stalemate, and with no concrete plans for further negotiations to resolve the country's crisis.
The weekend of meetings at this Caribbean resort marked the first occasion on which the ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has sat face to face with his foes since he was ousted in a coup on Sept. 30. 
 One issue proved insolvable: Father Aristide insisted that a joint statement by the two sides provide for his return to Haiti as legitimite President, while the opposition would only agree to more ambiguous phrasing. The Haitian lawmakers wanted simply to cite a constitutional clause stating that presidential terms last for five years.
Father Aristide, Haiti's first democratically President, had served only eight months when the military ousted him from power.
 
From Optimism to Failure
 The talks, mediated by the Organization of American States, had begun in a general atmosphere of optimism Friday evening. Today they dragged ominously past a noon deadline until both sides conceded failure at 6:30 P.M.
The two sides also clashed on ways of reversing a trade embargo imposed against Haiti in October by the 34-member Organization of American States to protest the military coup.
The embargo, which has aggravated the country's economic misery, lent a sense of urgency to the negotiations. Shortages of food and other necessities have prompted thousands of residents to flee the country, with many of them risking drowning by sailing toward the United States on rickety boats.
The Haitian legislative delegation demanded an unconditional and immediate end to the embargo, but Father Aristide said that its removal had to coincide with his naming of a new prime minister as a first step toward recreating his Cabinet.
"We were very surprised when Aristide's emissaries told us that he wasn't ready to do anything for the people that he loves if we don't agree to name him president," said Thomas Eddy Dupiton, who served as one of three Senate delegates at the weekend meetings.
 
Some Points of Agreement
 After the talks ended, Father Aristide assigned an aide to read a statement mentioning points on which the two sides had agreed: the creation of a police force under the jurisdiction of the Justice Ministry, steps to put the army under a central command answerable to the government, and efforts toward the immediate restoration of international aid.
The Organization for American States said after the meeting that it planned to send two delegations to Haiti to monitor human rights.
Though the outcome was viewed as a disappointment, the mediators suggested that the talks were at least a start. Observers emphasized that even a month ago, it seemed improbable that Father Aristide and his foes would meet to discuss the possibility of his reinstatement.
"The crisis won't be resolved in one day, in one city," said Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, who, as Colombia's O.A.S. delegate led the discussions. "We recognize that this is just the beginning in a long process toward achieving our goal."

Protest at Canadian Embassy
 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Nov. 24 (Reuters) -- A group of 19 Haitians who have occupied a small waiting room in the Canadian Embassy since Wednesday pushed their way into the main part of the building today, demanding political asylum.
 A pamphlet signed by three of the group's leaders called for the burning of the Canadian and American embassies and added, "Long live Qaddafi, long live Castro, long live Aristide!"
 A Western diplomat said the group's action seemed to be aimed at discrediting Father Aristide and paralyzing the Canadian Embassy, which has played an important role in the negotiations to return the ousted leader to power.
 The Canadian Embassy said it would not grant refugee status to anyone in the group, and a spokesman for Father Aristide denounced the occupation of the embassy building.

HEADLINE: U.N. Leader Seeks A $1 Billion Fund For Peace Missions

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 24

 BODY:
In an effort to resolve the latest financial crisis to grip the United Nations, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar will ask governments, private corporations and wealthy individuals on Monday to set up a $1 billion Peace Endowment Fund to help pay for future United Nations peacekeeping operations.
In addition, Mr. Perez de Cuellar will ask the General Assembly to authorize him to start charging governments interest on unpaid contributions they owe. He also plans to more than double the United Nations reserve fund and allow him and his successors to take out loans from commercial banks to plug budget gaps. 
 The Secretary General will also ask members for advance payment of their 1992 dues so he can pay December staff salaries. The United Nations now has enough cash on hand to pay its 5,000 or so employees through the end of this month. But the organization's Deputy Controller, Susan R. Mills, said last week that unless it could quickly find $100 million more, it would be unable to meet its December payroll.
Mr. Perez de Cuellar, in a report he will send to the Assembly on Monday, says, "It is a source of profound concern to me that the same membership which sees it appropriate to entrust the United Nations Secretariat with unprecedented new responsibilities has not taken the necessary action to insure that the minimum financial resources required to carry out those responsibilities are provided on a reliable and predictable basis."
The reason the United Nations is once again on the brink of insolvency is that members, principally the United States, continue not to pay their dues fully and promptly at a time when the organization faces soaring new bills for peacekeeping operations.
To improve the organization's financial health and meet the cost of new peacekeeping operations, the Secretary General will ask for $500 million in new contributions from the membership before the 1991 General Assembly session ends next month.
Under his plan, $300 million would go to the proposed new $1 billion Peace Endowment Fund, with the United Nations asking corporations, foundations and wealthy individuals to put up the rest. Income from this fund would be used for peacekeeping.

HEADLINE: Duke May Seem to Be Wallace of '91, But Both Times and the Risks Differ

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAFAYETTE, La.

 BODY:
The speaker and his agenda may be new, but the scene at the David Duke rally at Evangeline Downs here earlier this month provoked a sense of political deja vu -- the same angry white men in baseball caps and jeans, the same railing against out-of-touch big government and high taxes, the same thinly veiled racial appeals.
Mr. Duke is tapping into the same frustrations and same constituency that former Gov. George Wallace of Alabama did in his campaigns for President in 1968 and 1972. But significant differences exist between now and then, both in the degree of frustration and in which political party is most at risk. 
 "The issues George Wallace raised in 1968 are the issues Duke is addressing now," said Merle Black, a professor of politics and government at Emory University in Atlanta. "When you talk about affirmative action, preferential treatment, busing for school desegregation, these are issues which came up in the 1960's in which whites were in direct opposition to blacks, and these are issues that have never been reconciled."
 
Losing Votes in Louisiana
 Still, it is unclear how much can be read into the career of Mr. Duke, who was thrashed Nov. 16 in his race for governor and then announced two days later that he was considering a run for President.
Mr. Duke, a Republican State Representative from suburban New Orleans, got only 39 percent of the vote for governor, after getting 44 percent a year ago in a race for the United States Senate. And in the second campaign, his support among whites dropped to 55 percent, from 60 percent, and he was running against a scandal-tinged opponent who was the perfect foil for his angry, send-them-a-message call for radical change.
On the other hand, Mr. Duke did win 665,000 votes for governor, despite his background in the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups, the opposition of virtually every interest group and public official in Louisiana and warnings that the state would face economic catastrophe if he was elected.
He did best with blue-collar and low- to middle-income whites, picking up 68 percent of whites with a high school education or less. He got the vote of 62 percent of white Protestants, 69 percent of whites who say they are born-again Christians, 56 percent of whites with annual family incomes under $15,000, 63 percent of whites with incomes of $15,000 to $29,999 and 60 percent of whites with incomes of $30,0000 to $49,999.
Mr. Duke also gained support among upper-income voters -- 49 percent of whites earning $50,000 to $74,999 a year and 34 percent of whites earning more than $75,000 -- a group that largely eluded Mr. Wallace in his Presidential campaigns.
 
The Wallace Vote
 In 1968, when Mr. Wallace ran on a third-party ticket, he carried five Southern states, including Louisiana. In his bids for the Democratic Presidential nomination he did well in primaries in such non-Southern states as Michigan and Maryland.
Mr. Wallace was very much in a tradition of Southern populism, using race and economic issues as ways to channel the frustration of working-class whites, first in the South and then in the nation.
Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at Columbia University, said that Mr. Duke tapped some of the same anger but that he came from a more purely racial perspective. In the latter stages of Mr. Wallace's political career in a changed Southern electorate, he won sizeable black support in his campaigns for governor. Few expect that of Mr. Duke.
To some the main difference between Mr. Duke and Mr. Wallace is which political party the candidate put at risk.
"I don't believe there's a new populism," said Curtis Gans, chairman of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a research organization in Washington. "I don't see anything really new from the Wallace-Nixon days except this time it's going to split asunder the Republican Party instead of the Democrats."
The risks for the Republicans include not just the potential for a divisive Presidential primary fight, but also the degree to which Mr. Duke's association with conservative issues like opposition to preferential hiring of minorities could taint strong Republican issues.
"David Duke is probably the best thing that has ever happened for the Democratic Party," said Gary Jarmin, national political director for the American Freedom Coalition, a conservative organization. "He has neutralized those issues that Republicans could have used, but now everybody is going to scream 'racism' because they're associated with David Duke."
But if some see a reprise of the Wallace days with a different party, others see the possibility of broader-based racial politics. They say the longevity of the frustrations of white blue-collar and middle-class voters, the degree of social dislocation and pathology in inner cities and, most important, the lingering recession and the bleak prospects for blue-collar whites provide a fertile ground for racial politics.
"I think it's much more dangerous now," said Stanley Greenberg, President of Greenberg-Lake, a Democratic polling firm whose 1985 study of white voters in suburban Detroit reflected many of the intense racial resentments of the Duke voters in Louisiana. "Then, the country was in a period of rapid growth. What we have now is two decades of very slow economic growth, almost no income growth and for younger non-college graduate males, their income has gone down at least 25 percent. These people are natural material for a Duke-type campaign."
 
Divisions on the Message
 To liberals and most Democrats, Mr. Duke's rise reflects the failure of Republican economics combined with a Republican strategy that runs from Richard M. Nixon's Southern strategy of playing to white voters to George Bush's campaign advertisements playing on coded racial appeals.
"Duke's message is that if your life isn't what you want it to be, blame it on people who are black," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic political consultant. "I don't think it's much more complicated than that. I think that the great failure here is the failure of Reagan and Bush. Reagan made it socially acceptable and Bush made it politically expedient to play in this arena."
But others, including some Democrats, say Mr. Duke's appeal is more complicated. He may be advancing a racial agenda, they say, but by focusing on crime and welfare dependency he is also playing on real issues that reflect real failings in American life. And some, including conservatives who reject Mr. Duke personally, say that part of the failure is the degree to which those issues have been forced out of the political debate.
"This is a 25-year-old battle that if you say you are concerned about crime, and you want law and order, hey, you're really a racist at heart," said Richard A. Viguerie, chairman of United Conservatives of America. "You want to cut back on welfare, you're a racist. You don't want special privileges, affirmative action by the Government -- quotas, let's just call that what it is -- you're a racist."
Another leading conservative, Paul M. Weyrich, said: "The funny part of it is, the minorities that I've dealt with, not just in the black community but in the Hispanic community and so on, they don't think it's racist. They know that these problems are real, and they care about this stuff, and they're glad when somebody is honest with them."
To many, the problem with Mr. Duke in particular and racial politics in general is that they offer scapegoating, not solutions.
"Duke isn't interested in solving problems," said Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, who is chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a gathering of moderates in the party. "He's interested in feeding on them."
William Julius Wilson, a University of Chicago sociologist who wrote an influential book on poverty, "The Truly Disadvantaged" (University of Chicago Press, 1989), said that both the poor and the middle class had a common interest in meaningful economic reform rather than racial polarization.
"What's needed is a political leader who can identify the breakdown in our society that has created these problems, not just for the poor but for the middle class as well," he said.

An Early Report Card On the Democrats' Trail

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Democrats are now enjoying the unusual experience of watching Republicans in disarray, but sooner or later the Democratic Party will have to pre sent an alternative -- not a simple Bush basher, but a full-blown Presidential nominee.
This weekend, the six major contenders for the job engaged in a kind of rolling cattle show that began in Chicago, where the state Democratic leaders were meeting, continued in Des Moines before the Iowa Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner, and ended up at the South Dakota Democratic Party steak fry in Sioux Falls. 
 When the jockeying was over, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas seemed the candidate most ready for prime time, judging by the response of the party professionals in Chicago. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa remains the cruising-for-a-fight liberal, who can hit nearly every button imaginable in an audience of active Democrats. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who seemed to start the race with the most natural star quality, is still struggling for a message that uses it.
All six have their strengths and weaknesses, three weeks before a series of national television debates introduces them to the nation. Herewith, a preview:
 
Edmund G. Brown Jr.
Former Governor of California
Message: This is the candidate of rage, railing against the corrupting influence of special interest money, warning of continued national decline under a Government stacked against the people, urging term limits and a host of other measures to shake up the system. He gets increasingly apocalyptic as he goes along, warning of the consequences of business as usual. "This is not going to go gentle into that good night," he roared at Democrats in Chicago. "This is going to be an explosive ripping apart of the social fabric."
Problems: Mr. Brown's lifelong background in politics, including his stint as chairman of the California Democratic Party, tends to cut against his outsider message. He tries to present himself as a reformed sinner who truly knows how awful things are. "I'm not some academic," he told Iowa Democrats. "Even though you might not believe it, I didn't come in here off the moon."
 
Bill Clinton
Governor of Arkansas
Message: Mr. Clinton presents himself as the champion of the middle class, promising to reclaim the American Dream and restore the economy with a set of domestic policy prescriptions. What Mr. Clinton has acquired in his months of traveling -- which some think the New York-bound Gov. Mario M. Cuomo needs -- is a message that at least tries to reach out to the various parts of the Democratic coalition, North and South, left and right.
"I am a Democrat by heritage, instinct and conviction," he said in Iowa, where some look askance at his background as past chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group that often feuds with liberals. Mr. Clinton now argues that the party needs to be pushed neither right or left, but "into the future."
Problems: There is a fine line between coalition-building and muddying one's message. When Mr. Clinton misses the mark, as he has on other occasions, he can sound mushy.
Also, communism may have collapsed and Americans may be ready for a President who spends more time at home, but doesn't the nation still need a foreign policy? Mr. Clinton's speeches covered a lot this weekend, but not that.
 
Tom Harkin
Senator from Iowa
Message: No chance of a muddied message here. Mr. Harkin wants to cut military spending sharply and embark on a major new public works program, rebuilding roads and the like. He says he does not mind being be labeled a protectionist. ("Well, la-di-da," he says.) He says he laughs at those who accuse him of preaching class warfare. "What the hell do they think we've had over the past 10 years?" he asked in Iowa. "We had class warfare -- and we lost."
This is unrepentant liberalism. "It's time for us to quit apologizing for being Democrats," he said, and the party faithful keep cheering him on. "I haven't lost my heart and I haven't lost my soul, and the Democratic Party hasn't either."
Problems: Hearts and souls aside, some Democrats wonder whether traditional liberals make the best nominees. Mr. Harkin scoffs at the notion that the party must fundamentally refashion its image to regain the White House, but there are many Democrats who disagree.
 
Bob Kerrey
Senator from Nebraska
Message: Mr. Kerrey has been trying to present himself as the candidate of change; he uses his plan for universal health care as an example of the change he seeks. "It's not just a moral imperative, it's an economic imperative," he said in Iowa.
But Mr. Kerrey got his best response this weekend when he was taking questions from the audience and when he was talking about his values and his life. "Were it not for the values of the Great Society when I returned in 1969, I would not be standing here today," said Mr. Kerrey, who won the Congressional Medal of Honor in Vietnam for a battle in which he lost a leg. "Today, we're led by the values of a grim society."
Problems: Mr. Kerrey's life story and personal style were two of the major strengths many Democrats thought he brought to the campaign; yet those qualities seemed buried under a mountain of health care information this weekend. "Kerrey was best when he went to Q and A," said Bob Slagle, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party. "He sounded a little bit bored with his speech."
 
Paul E. Tsongas
Former Senator from Massachusetts
Message: This is the pro-business liberal, who says he wants Democrats to forswear corporate-bashing and adopt some serious measures, like a specific cuts in the tax on capital gains, to get the economy growing again.
He is professorial and earnest, urging his audience to read his white papers on health care and economic policy. He also urges his party to retain its traditional values on civil rights and women's rights even as it remakes its economics.
Mr. Tsongas is one of the wittiest of the candidates: On Saturday in Iowa, while arguing that the party must regain its credibility on economics to regain the White House, Mr. Tsongas said: "Let's try winning and see what it feels like. If we don't like it, we can go back to our traditions."
Problems: Bruce Babbitt, the former Arizona Governor who ran for the Democratic nomination in 1988, was also a witty, somewhat professorial man who urged the party to change; his candidacy did not last. Mr. Tsongas still has to convince many in the party that his candidacy is more than a very long shot.
 
L. Douglas Wilder
Governor of Virginia
Message: The Governor casts himself as the outsider who can reassert some fiscal discipline in Washington. He says it is time to "put America first," and proposes the Government give $35 billion in tax cuts to the middle class, with another $15 billion sent to cities for problems like crime.
Mr. Wilder, the first black American ever elected governor, has increased appeals for black support in recent weeks. And the very idea of his election continues to strike a powerful chord among many white voters. One of the strongest responses he got this weekend came when he was talking of the Framers and the inspiration he drew from their writings -- "those great Virginians who may not have envisioned me when they wrote them," he said with a slight laugh, adding, "Of course they didn't."
Problem: Mr. Wilder says his $50 billion "Put America First" program would be financed by eliminating waste in the Federal budget, but has yet to detail any cuts.
"I am telling you, based on my experience as Governor, I can find waste," he finally told reporters.

HEADLINE: Sununu Is Given Thumbs Up As Bush Returns to Capital

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
A smiling John H. Sununu was waiting to greet President Bush today as he returned to the White House from Camp David. The President gave a thumbs up when asked if he intended to keep his beleaguered chief of staff.
Mr. Sununu also got a kiss on the cheek from Barbara Bush, who earlier denied a report of having become disenchanted with Mr. Sununu. 
 The chief of staff usually is not on hand when Mr. Bush returns from weekends at the Presidential retreat. Asked why he was there, Mr. Sununu replied, "Just catching up."
There have been recent reports of bickering between Mr. Sununu and Mr. Bush's political advisers, including people who might be expected to lead a Presidential re-election campaign.
And Mr. Sununu had a confrontation on Thursday with a reporter he accused of erroneously blaming him for Mr. Bush's recent remarks on high credit-card interest rates.

HEADLINE: On Eve of Talks With Aid Donors, Kenya Is Under Pressure to Democratize

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov. 24

 BODY:
On the eve of a meeting between Kenyan officials and donors of vital foreign aid, President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, one of Africa's most prominent remaining autocrats, is facing unparalleled pressures for political reform both at home and abroad.
Domestically, an opposition newly emboldened by democratic movements elsewhere in Africa has seen its support grow visibly as it confronts the repression by the Moi Government. 
 Internationally, growing disgust with the corrupt practices of the Government has led foreign benefactors to pull back, a development likely to pose great peril to Kenya's fragile economy and heighten discontent.
 
Conditions for Aid
 On Monday in Paris, the Western donors and the World Bank will meet to decide the amount of aid they will grant Kenya next year. In the past week, the principal donors -- the European Community, Britain and the United States -- have shown rare cohesiveness in condemning Mr. Moi's clampdown on the opposition and have indicated that they are likely to condition aid on Mr. Moi's willingness to move toward political pluralism.
Yet thus far Mr. Moi has refused to yield. While few predict that he will remain obdurate indefinitely, he has in the past proven tenacious and adroit in the face of political challenges.
One of the arguments that Mr. Moi repeatedly uses to justify his one-party rule is that a multiparty system would degenerate into tribal warfare. There are three major tribes in Kenya -- the Kikuyu, the Luhya and the Luo. The 67-year-old, barrel-chested Mr. Moi is a member of one of the country's smaller tribes, the Kalenjin.
"We have been having ethnic groups all over," Mr. Moi said last month in a rare interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation.
 
Tribes and Parties
 "See what is happening in Somalia. It has 102 clans, which means you can have 102 parties. In Zaire, 265 parties to represent 265 tribes. You cannot really develop the country with such divisions."
But critics say that Mr. Moi exaggerates tribal divisions in Kenya by continually referring to his opponents as "tribalists." Kenyans who have worked closely with Mr. Moi describe him as "paranoid" about the possibility that Kenya's largest tribe, the Kikuyu, will unseat him and unravel his large, illegally gained fortune.
In a veiled attack on Mr. Moi, Simon Nyachae, a former political colleague and head of the civil service until 1987, suggested in an advertisement in a Kenyan newspaper last week that recent violence between Mr. Moi's Kalenjin tribe and the Luo, Kenya's second-largest tribe, was deliberately fomented by the Government, a view held by many others. Mr. Nyachae is a member of the Kisii tribe.
Many urban Kenyans, particularly those between 20 and 40 years old, say that tribalism is less pervasive in Kenyan society than it was 10 years ago. Advocates of a multiparty system also note that since no tribe has more than 25 percent of the population, there would be a need for coalitions in a democratic Government.
Mr. Moi came to power through tribal politics. He was chosen in 1967 as Vice President by Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first president and a Kikuyu. Coming from the Kalenjin, a pastoral people who inhabit the Rift Valley west of Nairobi, Mr. Moi was thought to provide Mr. Kenyatta a neutral screen against the tribal pressures of the Kikuyu and the Luo.
Unlike Mr. Kenyatta's first vice president, the charismatic Oginga Odinga of the Luo tribe, Mr. Moi was a rather bland personality who posed no threat to Mr. Kenyatta.
When Mr. Kenyatta died in 1978, Mr. Moi succeeded him. Many sophisticated Kenyans believed that he would not last long as President.
But on coming to power, Mr. Moi adopted a high-profile populist style, travelling into rural areas and identifying himself with the ordinary people.
At the same time, he organized the rapid promotion of his ethnic compatriots and he gradually stripped the Kikuyu, widely regarded as the entrepreneurial class, of their dominance in the Kenyan economy.
In 1982, Mr. Moi appointed a longtime Kalenjin friend, Nicholas Biwott, to the job of Minister of Energy, giving him command over a large section of the Kenyan economy, including many big development projects involving foreign investors. Over recent months, Mr. Biwott became a liability Mr. Moi could no longer handle.
Both American and British diplomats complained to the Moi Government about Mr. Biwott's personal profiteering from his job through kickbacks and expropriations. As the allegations of corruption against Mr. Biwott mounted, he was named by a British detective in testimony last week as one of two "prime suspects" in the February 1990 slaying of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko. Mr. Moi was forced to drop Mr. Biwott from the Cabinet.
 
Opposition Parties Banned
 Mr. Moi survived a 1982 coup attempt staged by the Air Force and thereafter did all he could to consolidate his power. His first reaction was to ram through a constitutional amendment that made law what was already reality: a one-party state with his Kenya African National Union as the only legal party.
"I would like ministers, assistant ministers and others to sing like a parrot after me," Mr. Moi said in 1984. "That is how we can progress."
In the 1988 parliamentary elections, Mr. Moi replaced the secret ballot with queuing, a voting system under which voters stand behind the picture of the candidate of their choice. Voter turnout was low -- largely because people were intimidated by the system of voting. Moi.
While strengthening his political power and enhancing his personal wealth, Mr. Moi has left the Kenyan military relatively untouched. By African standards, the army is quite small -- about 20,000 for a population of 25 million -- and quite professional, Western military experts say. Recruitment is heaviest among Mr. Moi's Kalenjin tribe, but promotions appear to be largely based on merit, the experts say.
How Mr. Moi is going to deal with the extraordinary pressures that are cascading in on him is not clear.
His decision last week to arrest 12 opposition figures and to send riot police with tear gas and truncheons to stop several thousand people from reaching an opposition rally angered already disaffected Western donors and strengthened a disorganized opposition.
The United States and Germany were further antagonized by the Kenyan Government's accusations that their embassies here had tried to take opposition leaders to the rally in embassy cars. Germany recalled its Ambassador. The American Ambassador, Smith Hempstone, called the allegations "lies." The current Foreign Minister, Wilson Ndolo Aya, , called the outspoken Mr. Hempstone a "racist."
As the political atmosphere has become more charged, the economic situation continues to deteriorate. Rural farmers are complaining about inflation and openly blaming the Government. In the cities, unemployment "is soon going to become a threatening problem of security," Mr. Nyachae warned.
Last week, The Weekly Review, a magazine that has been supportive of Mr. Moi, talked about the need to "manage change," a concept that it seemed to suggest was out of Mr. Moi's grasp.

Britain Puzzles Over a Peril: Crossing the Street

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
It is a familiar if somewhat chilling scene, played out regularly at intersections across London. A group of tourists approach a busy street, glance to their left and then confidently step off the curb -- and nearly into the path of a bus bearing down on them from the right.
With its right-hand traffic flow, this city has always been tough on foreign pedestrians, who can often be observed at street corners wearing the slightly startled look of deer edging alongside a freeway. It was for them, mostly, that London officals years ago began painting reminders along curbs suggesting that pedestrians "look left" or "look right" before venturing into the street. 
 Then, last month, beginning a new $2.1 million safety campaign intended to reduce the number of children killed or injured in pedestrian accidents in Britain, the Princess of Wales and government officials made it clear that foreigners were not the only ones imperiled by London's congested and sometimes disjointed traffic patterns.
According to government statistics, there are few places in the world where crossing the street can be so fraught with danger, a situation officials attribute to urban drivers who drive too fast and with too little care.
 
Traffic Fatalities Decline
 While the overall number of fatalities and serious injuries resulting from traffic accidents in Britain has declined steeply over the years, as a result of safer cars and the mandatory use of seat belts, pedestrians, and especially children who are pedestrians, remain at an unusually high risk.
Nearly one of every three traffic deaths in Britain involves a pedestrian run over by a car. In France, the United States and Italy, where the rates of traffic casualties in general are much higher, only about one in seven deaths involves a pedestrian.
Since December 1990, according to the United States Embassy here, five Americans have been killed in separate accidents in Britain when they stepped off the curb into the path of vehicles.
Two-thirds of all accidental deaths involving schoolchildren are a result of traffic accidents, most of them when the children are pedestrians, a record that Malcolm Rifkind, Britain's Transportation Secretary, describes as "dreadful."
While Mr. Rifkind noted that the average number of pedestrian deaths involving children had declined from 563 a year in the early 1980's to 417 in 1990, a fact that may be explained in part by the decline in overall numbers of children as the birth rate in Britain has dropped, the per capita casualty rate remained about the same.
The total number of people killed on the roads in Britain may fall below 5,000 this year, the lowest it has been since 1949. Over the same period, the number of cars on the roads has risen from 1.7 million to 24.2 million.
"On a per capita basis, we have one of the best overall road safety records in the world," said Simon Jones, a spokesman for the Automobile Association, a club that represents more than 7.5 million British motorists. "But we have one of the worst records in terms of pedestrian and children fatalities."
An analysis this year by the Policy Studies Institute, which examines social and economic trends, concluded that fear of traffic had become so great among parents in London that many no longer allowed their children to cross the road alone.
According to the report, a 1971 survey disclosed that 80 percent of 7- and 8-year-old children in Britain went to school on their own. Last year the institute went back to the same schools and discovered that the figure had dropped to 9 percent, a decline the analysts attributed mostly to fear of traffic.
"Although the environmental harm done by cars is increasingly conceded, there is a widespread reluctance to acknowledge the social damage they do," said John Adams, a professor at the University College in London. "As traffic increases, other opportunities are reduced. Children are prevented from playing in the street and elderly people fear to cross it."
To help reduce pedestrian deaths, the Government enacted new laws this year aimed at careless and dangerous drivers and began a new advertising campaign around the slogan: "Kill your speed. Not a child." Safety experts say that if drivers reduce their speed by 10 miles an hour, the chances of a child surviving a pedestrian accident are greatly increased.
Part of the problem also involves the growing number of cars in older residential areas in London and other cities, where there is little off-street parking. Government analysts predict the congestion will only get worse.
 
Danger at the Intersections
 Andrew Howard, the head of road safety for the Automobile Association, said motorists tend to drive too fast in urban areas along streets lined with parked cars, where there is limited visibility.
"We always tell people not to cross between parked cars, but often there is no other choice," Mr. Howard said.
In addition, fewer police resources are devoted to dealing with traffic violations and traffic rules involving pedestrians are much more ambiguous in Britain than in the United States.
A common complaint is that cars turning into an intersection will seldom yield to pedestrians already in the roadway, even if they are crossing with the light. "The Highway Code of Conduct says that pedestrians have the right of way," Mr. Howard said. But in practice, he conceded, it usually doesn't work that way.
"The sad fact is that any pedestrians who insist on their rights while crossing a street soon tend not to have anything left at all to argue about," he said.

HEADLINE: Environmental Rules: How They Dictate Region's Agenda

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
For decades they have been little more than fantasies: Automated people movers gliding swiftly between New York's airports, and electronic fare cards shepherding drivers effortlessly through the city's tolls.
Nice ideas, it has often been said, but hopeless. Yet, for an unlikely reason, the visions have recently come alive. They are now considered essential because rigorous new air quality standards demand them. 
 After years of indifference, the city has also embarked on a vast program to install water meters in hundreds of thousands of homes and apartment buildings. Again, the reason was indirect. Without them, punitive rationing measures would soon become inevitable. Almost by default, environmental regulations -- and the relentless advocates who use them most effectively -- have begun to dictate the physical shape and priorities of the region.
From the most ambitious bridges to the smallest playground, from airports and highways to shopping malls and boat slips, legal requirements and protests rather than planning now orchestrate nearly every decision a builder or government can make.
"We plan by not doing," said Robert J. Pirani, director of environmental projects for the Regional Plan Association. "The mechanism is all backward. Fear is the driving force. Instead of sitting around and saying what kind of place do we want to become, we are wondering what punishments we can avoid."
While laws with brutal sanctions provide handy ammunition for opponents of growth, so has the recession, which has dimmed the vision of many of the regions most ambitious developers.
 
Unfinished Projects
 The combined results are easy to see. From Westway, which never was built, to the contested Meadowbrook Parkway on Long Island, which was, projects have been delayed, scuttled, diminished. Often those that proceed -- like the huge Metrotech office and research complex in Brooklyn or the final stretch of Interstate 287 in northern New Jersey -- do so only after years of negotiation and a stream of concessions.
Except for Los Angeles, air quality does not get much worse than in the three states of the metropolitan region. Together, they have been violating the Clean Air Act for two decades. But a set of new sanctions that could ultimately force millions of drivers from their cars, has done more to promote mass transit -- and to discourage new highway construction -- than any politician possibly could.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, for example, has retreated from any serious plans to erect another bridge between New Jersey and Staten Island, even though many of its planners say traffic patterns argue for it strongly. The recession has played a role, of course. But the Clean Air Act, which gives this region 15 years to resolve some of its most intractable pollution problems, has proven far more compelling.
The New York metropolitan region already has nearly twice the permissible amount of ozone in its atmosphere. The area stands to lose all highway funds if it does not begin to comply with Federal standards. In southern California, Federal officials have already begun to take away people's barbecue pits and gas-powered lawn movers. New York could face a similar fate.
In addition, beginning this year, Federal law dictates that all new sources of pollution have to be more than compensated for by reductions nearby.
The practical effects could be significant. For every major road that generates 1,000 new miles traveled by automobiles each day, for example, local officials must find a way to eliminate 1,200 miles traveled elsewhere. If they fail, the ratio will nearly double in the next decade.
"We are all beginning to realize that we are going to have to make profound and continual adjustments to what we build and how we live," said Anthony E. Shorris, deputy executive director of the Port Authority. " It isn't just a question of whether it would be nice to alter our behavior. The regulations make it financially impossible for us to do anything else. All the incentives have changed, probably for good."
Federal and local statutes are not the only deterrents. Skillful campaigns by those opposed to development have become routine, and routinely successful.
 
Battle Over Airport
 In Westchester, local officials have long envisioned an expanded county airport as a fitting anchor to development in the area. But with opponents bitterly insisting that bigger runways would bring intolerable levels of noise, water and air pollution -- in addition to unwelcome new traffic -- planners wonder if even their most modest goals may be impossible to attain.
For more than a decade, the Postal Service has been trying to build a $100 million processing center in Westchester, to serve an area that the Postmaster General last year called the worst in the nation for mail service. Yet, after seeing its environmental-impact study assessing the risks to the region, New York City sued, contending the center would pollute important reservoirs. A Federal judge blocked its construction earlier this year.
"If you build and you ignore the environmental consequences," said Michael Gerrard, an environmental law expert at the Manhattan law firm of Berle, Kass & Case, "you do so at your own peril. We are now living with the consequence of generations of thoughtless development. It's time we learned our lesson."
Mr. Gerrard has interceded dozens of times, usually with success, on behalf of clients who say a project presents unacceptable environmental risks. He currently represents three towns north of Hartford that challenged Connecticut in an attempt to prevent the creation of a nuclear waste site in Ellington -- although the state will soon be unable to ship such waste to South Carolina, as it has done for years.
"If it needs to be done," said Mr. Gerrard, voicing a sentiment shared widely by those who oppose such projects, "this is not the place to do it."
The days of autocratic development, embodied most blatantly by Robert Moses, who sliced up neighborhoods and carpeted New York with highways, won't be back, planners, developers and environmentalists all agree. And few would argue that they should return. But people are starting to worry about what has replaced them. Without a coherent vision of where to place the roads, sewage plants, bridges and other essentials that all communities need -- those who scream the loudest have turned into those who make the rules.
 
Permissions the Hard Part
 Seeking permission to widen a road or build an incinerator has become more difficult than the actual construction.
The Bronx Lebanon Hospital will be the first to use a new $20 million incinerator in an industrial section of the Bronx when it is completed next year. If local residents do not revolt. The incinerator was designed to handle medical waste, and it was placed where it would do the least harm to neighbors. Few complaints were heard until recently, as the project nears completion. Without it, New York will have to continue to export waste at great cost.
To some this sort of activism is a telling achievement of the environmental movement. Yet, to others it is a disturbing combination of idealism and inflexibility. Many of those who worked hardest to guarantee that tough regulations would serve as a solid check on thoughtless expansion or greedy builders have been surprised by the speed with which opponents of development become "environmentalists."
"Growth has to be driven by decent environmental protections and increasingly it has," said Thomas C. Jorling, commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. "But we all hear the loud whine of people who use the environment to refuse to bear any responsibility for community well-being. I am just as scared by them as I am by polluters."
The balance between producing sensible public works and protecting the land has never been harder to puzzle out. Eventually, critics and even some environmentalists are starting to ask, where will we find all the places to put the glamorless necessities on which most of life relies?
"We need to respect the natural resources we have," said Ara K. Hovnanian, president of Hovnanian Enterprises in Red Bank, N.J., one of the nation's largest residential developers. "But if I only had a nickel for every person who opposes growth by calling themselves an environmentalist."
 
Real Concerns From Tirades
 Officials say they can have a hard time separating legitimate environmental complaints from standard no-growth tirades.
In Connecticut, for example, the relationship between a soaring rate of driving and dangerous levels of air pollution is easy to understand. Between 1970 and last year, Connecticut drivers increased the miles they traveled in automobiles by more than 63 percent, turning a once-quiet state into one of the most congested in the nation. Perhaps no highway in the state has become as impassable as Interstate 95.
Several proposals have been put forth to widen the highway at strategic points, but engineers from the state Department of Transportation have grown understandably wary because any such action will only increase their struggle over air pollution.
"All of the gains mandated by the Federal Clean Air Act would be wiped out in about six months by the increased traffic," said Donald Strait, legal director for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment. "How could you possibly do it?"

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Dinkins Lets His Bitterness Show

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins returned to New York City from South Africa last week buoyed and emboldened by the homecoming to the continent of his heritage, but also deeply embittered. He blamed the press for singling him out for unnecessarily negative coverage.
Mr. Dinkins typically speaks softly but sometimes seems to carry a big chip on his shoulder. Since his trip, he has pumped up the volume and more than once has given voice to deep resentment that he usually suffers in silence. 
 "The press has seemed not to understand the importance of the trip," Mr. Dinkins said last Tuesday. Yesterday, addressing congregants at the Rev. Herbert Daughtry's House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in Brooklyn, Mr. Dinkins elaborated, saying: "It was a bit of a shock for me -- and perhaps the Reverend Daughtry I think would agree with this assessment -- that the media attention we received on this trip had more to do with how many bodyguards surrounded me and how many guns they had and who in the Government I was scheduled to see, more things like that than the human tragedy that the apartheid regime has created."
Why did the media fail, he has wondered, to fathom either the potential economic benefits for the city or the profound personal experience that the journey represented for the Mayor? Why, in particular, had they been so much more accepting when his predecessors went overseas to tour their ancestral homes or to cultivate political roots in places other than Africa?
That question goes to the heart of Mr. Dinkins's litany. It suggests that he is being judged by a different standard. And to Mr. Dinkins, the major difference between himself and the nearly 100 New York City mayors who preceded him is his race.
"I try to be pretty careful before I call someone a racist or say someone's motivated by race, so with respect to why people criticize me for wanting to come to Africa, I don't know," the Mayor said on his final day there. "My answer always is, 'I don't know. You figure it out.' "
To Mr. Dinkins, the media are a daily irritant. Its representatives are also often the most visible manifestation of a society in which most social and economic power is still wielded by whites.
But the Mayor demonstrated that his mistrust, even antipathy, toward the press is by no means defined solely by race when he railed against Bob Herbert, a Daily News columnist, for once describing Mr. Dinkins as a "slick suit."
"There has been coverage of Dinkins that has been unfair, but there's coverage of all politicians that has been unfair," Mr. Herbert said. "He doesn't understand the adversarial relationship between the press and politicians."
Mr. Herbert also suggested a more fundamental conflict:
"I think Dinkins has a chip on his shoulder about race," said Mr. Herbert, who is black. "So do I. I think most black people have a chip on their shoulder about race. But it's one thing to have a chip on your shoulder and quite another to be a mayor of all the people of the City of New York."
The Mayor declined last week to be interviewed about press coverage. But his sentiments are no secret. They reflect his abiding belief that he is the victim of a double standard and that he and his administration are never given the benefit of the doubt.
"We never hear about the glass being half filled," said Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch. "In fact," he said, "if we found a cure for AIDS, I'd want someone else to announce it."
 
A Double Standard?
 Is there a double standard? Editors, reporters and columnists generally maintain that there is not; not one inspired by racism, anyway. Most say any differences are inspired by the vivid contrast in style between Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Koch; by Mr. Dinkins's misfortune in presiding during a recession, and by bruising competition among the tabloids.
"I am told by those who are close to him that he believes that the travails of his administration are based on two problems," said Jerry Nachman, editor of The New York Post. "One, horrendous timing, and I agree with him on that. And two, adverse coverage by a racist white press. I disagree with him on that. I think he only need look at coverage of Ed Koch's final term in which the press essentialy eviscerated him to know that what he's reading and watching are not unique to this mayoralty or to elected officials of color."
But one of Mr. Dinkins's political mentors, Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, maintains that most black elected officials are treated differently.
"The example of the Mayor's disadvantage is classically displayed by the tremendous political and journalistic advantage that a totally incompetent politician named Andy Stein has," Mr. Rangel said, referring to the City Council President, who is expected to challenge Mr. Dinkins in 1993.
 
Waiting and More Waiting
 "Andy Stein shatters the myth of white supremacy forever," Mr. Rangel said. "But David Dinkins ain't no Andy Stein when it comes to influence. Stein was raised at the feet of power. Dinkins got to where he was by waiting tables, waiting in line, doing public service and by waking up to be the Mayor of the City of New York." .
"David is not considered by most whites to be the Mayor," Mr. Rangel said. "He's considered to be the black Mayor. Every black that I know would be an outsider in that position."
To whatever degree Mr. Dinkins figures he has been singled out for criticism because he is black, some people argue just the opposite: that he has been spared a more severe verdict for the very reason that critics and potential ones are sensitive to the political, social and personal implications of ganging up on the city's first black mayor.
To be sure, some of the criticism of Mr. Dinkins seems race-related. And the proud and proper Mayor, scarred by criticism and questions that pre-date his mayoralty, hardly feels that critics have been holding back.
He has complained that his administration receives sparse or begrudging credit for having balanced its budgets on time, for promulgating an ambitious public safety plan, for luring the Democratic national convention to New York and for intervening aggressively to defuse racial tension in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
Instead, he has at his fingertips a litany of grievances on coverage, ranging from articles on personal finances to his penchant for tennis.
Then came the South Africa trip. Mr. Dinkins seemed unwilling or unable to understand why his initial failure to fulfill a mission that he had elevated to such emotional heights (the trip had to be postponed when fund-raising for it fell far short), questions about contributions from companies with city business and his insistence on traveling with a vast retinue might also constitute a metaphor for his administration. He berated more than one reporter about coverage. In complaining about coverage by The New York Times in particular, he said he held the paper to a higher standard than "the tabloids."
"We considered the details of the trip, like the number of people with him, a legitimate news interest and I don't think it implied a criticism," said Joseph Lelyveld, The Times's managing editor. "I don't see anything in our coverage that was unusual except the theme of the Mayor's sensitivity to the coverage of the trip.
"Any mayor with the fiscal problems this city faces would be getting just about the same coverage," Mr. Lelyveld said.
When some black mayors in other cities slumped, they rallied their political base by challenging the predominantly white-run media. Mr. Dinkins has generally not done so, by dint of personality and because he was elected as a healer.
Mr. Lynch, who is black, was more blunt. "When I have a race discussion," he said, "I never win."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Not Will Cuomo Run; Will He Stop?

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:

Tonight, I quit these walls,
 The thought my soul appalls,
 But when stern Duty calls,
 I must obey. -- The Pirates of Penzance, Or, The Slave of Duty 
 FOR weeks now, people have been asking whether Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is running for President, when the real question is, will he withdraw?
Yesterday, he displayed no withdrawal symptoms.
In fact, Governor (Don't call me Mario) Cuomo is already a candidate by most conventional standards, if one is defined by his enemies, by his increasingly confident forays into national economics and foreign affairs and by his stubborn refusal so far to be railroaded into a formal announcement just to satisfy party leaders and potential primary opponents.
The Governor has hurdled every potential obstacle that he had erected in his head except for one: New York's projected budget gap, which has assumed such gigantic proportions that, as one financial analyst said, the deficit will make it either impossible or imperative for Mr. Cuomo to seek the Presidency.
For New Yorkers, he said yesterday in a television interview, that his candidacy "could be good or better or not good at all." He seemed inclined toward good or better.
Already, he has convinced himself that he would be as good or better than the six declared Democratic candidates, that money is no object, that his family's reservations would evaporate once he announced (this time, though, his mother is too ill to weigh in with her customary savvy advice) and that President Bush is surprisingly vulnerable.
Also, Mr. Cuomo has all but decided not to quit as Governor, a decision that makes him more dependent on the state of his state.
After meeting privately last week with members of the state Financial Control Board, the oversight group that he heads, the Governor seemed more persuaded that New York City will avert fiscal calamity this year and that, in any case, his intervention will not be viewed as indispensable to the city's solvency.
Today, Mr. Cuomo is to confer with legislative leaders after presenting his reduction plan for the state deficit. Their response could be pivotal to his political calculations.
Forecasts being drafted by his staff to assess whether the Republican-led State Senate will hold the budget hostage may provide fodder for Mr. Cuomo's introspection, although when he thinks aloud it is not always clear for whose benefit he is speaking.
Mr. Cuomo is not up for re-election next year; New York legislators are. Will Republican incumbents running in reapportioned districts worry that they'll go down with the Governor if they balk at a multiyear budget compromise or exact too heavy a price?
Could a Cuomo Presidential campaign actually prod Republicans into a compromise on the budget, when their recalcitrance and its impact on New Yorkers might be perceived as a cynical plot engineered by the White House? Would some fear offending a Governor, much less a potential President, with a reputation for being unforgiving?
Prospective bond buyers learned last week that the state deficit might double. What did Mr. Cuomo know and when did he know it? When did he first suspect that the deficit's dimensions would prompt his impossible-or-imperative choice of rationales?
If the Governor is, indeed, grappling with whether the gap will be a potential political weapon or a crippling liablity, can anybody give him a definitive answer within the next week or so? Probably not.
Meanwhile, he has frustrated only his Democratic rivals, political reporters and gag writers whose comparisons of the Governor to a latter-day Hamlet -- when his behavior more often invokes Machiavelli's advice to a different prince -- may have peaked before Mr. Cuomo's popularity does.
Once again, he and Hamlet have gotten a bum rap. The Governor isn't agonizing. He is sifting advice, assessing the budget stalemate, enjoying the attention, honing his skill at transforming defense into offense, as his virtuoso performance yesterday on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley" demonstrated, and biding his time. He is typically accused of being indecisive. Rather, he procrastinates, delaying decisions until he believes it is absolutely necessary to make them. In this case, that could be months from now, except that party leaders are beginning to persuade him that to delay much longer harms the Democratic cause. (Should he withdraw, though, don't be shocked if he is importuned again next spring if no other candidate catches fire.)
From Mr. Cuomo's bullying of callers to a radio program earlier this month -- reassuring them that crime is worse in Dallas -- to fencing with Vice President (Don't call me Danforth) Quayle, his campaign so far sometimes seems less like tragedy than operetta.
It recalls Gilbert and Sullivan's "Pirates of Penzance," in which young Frederic was mistakenly apprenticed to a pirate instead of a pilot. He dutifully serves until his 21st birthday and is about to flee when he is informed that he was born on Feb. 29, which means that he is not 21, but "a little boy of 5." Frederic finally can run away once the authorities invoke a higher being, which may also be how Mario Cuomo achieves his majority.
Is Mr. Cuomo running? "Not at this moment," he said yesterday.

HEADLINE: Yugoslavia Sanctions Can Only Do Harm

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Serbia's Spiteful War" (editorial, Nov. 6): I would like to offer my opinion as a writer who is American and Yugoslav, and has just returned from months in Yugoslavia. My interest is not to discuss who is right or wrong in this sad, murky civil war. 
 I am against economic sanctions of Serbia (or Croatia) because they hurt people who most need it -- the poor, the old, the very young. The population of Serbia is only about 65 percent Serbian, so you would also punish Albanians, Croats, Germans, Hungarians, gypsies. Sanctions would stop the healthy process of establishing a multiparty system and freedom of the press, despite the war. In Belgrade, newspapers attack each other and argue as much as the people do on the street and at home.
The sanctions would stop the growing middle class and businesses just starting. They would add to the feelings of rage and injustice many have: Serbia lost a million people in World War I and was bombed again in World War II. The bulk of the anti-Fascist partisan army was Serb, only a small fraction of it Communist.
This is a family feud in which much patience and forgiveness will be needed on both sides. There are three million children of mixed marriages, and the United States should not increase rage and separations. Help everyone equally, or 20 years from now, you'll have a new generation raging with memories of injustice.
If you want to help, stop the arms deliveries on both sides. Yugoslavia has become a dump for outmoded West European machinery you can't get parts for. Serbs and Croats are killing one another with dumdum bullets, which were outlawed after the Vietnam War. Doctors in Belgrade told me they had never seen such wounds: the bullet explodes inside the flesh, tearing it apart.
Weapons are not in short supply in Yugoslavia, and somebody out there must be making a profit. So why economic sanctions on Serbia? Why not sell Serbians, at very low prices, what they'll need: food, medicine, a way to rebuild?

Clear New York's Bloodstream

 BODY:
New York City's incomparably complex transport system ties together its scattered population and maintains its contacts with the outside world. Without the vast network of air, sea, land and subsurface transportation links, New York's offices would be empty and its world trade and tourism would wither.
New York has made great recent strides in revamping its subways and streets. But key elements of the transportation network are still deteriorating. For the city to climb back to economic health, it needs, as much as anything, to clear its circulatory system and invest in transportation. 
 Streets. The city's 18,000 miles of streets and highways require periodic reconstruction and repair of the mains, sewers, pipes and conduits that run below. The city has reconstructed many thoroughfares that were in deplorable condition, like Manhattan's Second and Sixth Avenues. But bridge repairs now will force the limiting of future street repairs to simple repaving.
Many of the city's five tunnels and 872 minor bridges are also seriously deteriorating. The city estimates that it needs $5.2 billion over 10 years, but only two-thirds of that now seems available. The shortfall can only be met by finding new funds or by neglecting all but primary thoroughfares.
Manhattan Bridges. Three of the four bridges over the East River are in dangerous condition, and all eight bridges over the Harlem River need major work. Estimated cost: $1.6 billion. One promising source of funds is tolls on all bridges leading to Manhattan.
Subways. The subways, once feared and filthy, may now be the brightest link. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has replaced and rehabilitated its entire fleet of 6,200 cars and improved its shops, using much of the $16 billion it raised in the 1980's. The system still needs to modernize tunnels, tracks, switches, elevated structures, and signaling and control systems. It also seeks to rebuild stations that are unsafe, connect the 63d Street tunnel to the main Queens lines and start a new fare collection system.
The system is seeking $10.6 billion from the state, Federal and city governments to cover some 60 percent of its capital needs in the next 10 years. Where the balance will come from is a serious question affecting the future of the city.
Airports. The city's airports are strangling in congestion even as they face increased competition from other airports. At Kennedy airport, passenger movement between terminals is primitive and vehicle circulation is deplorable. Newark lacks an internal rail system.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey sensibly plans to spend $3 billion to improve passenger movement at both airports and $1.6 billion earmarked for transit systems to facilitate movement from central Manhattan to Kennedy airport.
Ocean Shipping. New York remains the largest port on the Atlantic coast, measured by value of goods shipped, but its lead is eroding. The Manhattan and Brooklyn piers are now almost totally useless because they lack storage areas for the big containers that dominate shipments.
Only the vision of the Port Authority in developing Ports Newark and Elizabeth, N.J., with ample storage, managed to save a share of containerized ocean freight. But competition remains severe. The Port Authority needs to keep the ports competitive and convenient and hold stevedoring costs in their present range.
New York, with as fine a natural harbor as can be found anywhere, continues to attract business because of the size of the vast population within 50 miles. No one who cares about the region can afford to take its ocean transport for granted. No one who cares about the return of the city to strength can tolerate skimping on transportation in general.

The Bushwhackers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Foot-in-mouth disease has become so rampant in the Bush Administration that Mikhail Gorbachev is trying to think of ways to help his friend shore up the center in Washington.
The White House counsel, trying to give conservative coloration to a surrender on quotas, circulates a policy that the President has not even seen; and the new Attorney General, after the political trouncing of the old, is shown to be out to lunch. 
 The tottering chief of staff, having suggested that the President zap the banks by calling attention to usurious credit-card rates, says publicly it was a Bush ad-lib -- turning the President into a lightning rod for the chief of staff, a political first.
The groundhog of American prosperity comes out, looks around, and decides to go back into its hole, presaging a winter of discontent.
As a result, a less cocky President retreats to Camp David to consult the Great Catoctin Spirit about ways to bring a second wind to his heavy-breathing Presidency.
The Spirit said: (1) Throw John Sununu off the sled to satisfy pursuing wolves; (2) show interest in health care and crime to prove you are not fixated on foreign affairs; (3) blame the Democratic Congress for the droopy economy and attack "liberal carping" as the source of bushwhacking.
That advice is defensive, other-directed and un-Presidential. Here is a better way to avoid following Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter into one-term Presidencies:
1. Recognize the New Hampshire Republican primary as your spring battleground, the result of which will color the coverage of all pre-convention politics and affect poll ratings.
This means your early theme should be to save the country from defeatist isolationism (represented by Pat Buchanan) and populist-coated bigotry (represented by David Duke). If these dark forces take over your party, they will not be stopped by the weak Democrats; insist that "only George Bush" can save the country from the America-firsters of the right and the government-firsters of the left.
Have John Sununu declare "I shall go to New Hampshire." Assign him the task of running your campaign there, providing him not only a face-saving exit from Washington but making use of his undeniable New Hampshire organizational talents.
You will, of course, lose in New Hampshire, just as President Johnson was deemed the loser even after winning numerically. That's because New Hampshire Republicans have a free vote to register their discontent in March before returning to the fold in November; and the headline sought by so many in the media is "Buchanan-Duke Forces Stagger Bush."
The trick is to turn that primary tactical "defeat" into a campaign strategic asset. Here's how:
2. Boldly grab and widen the safe right-of-center. You're an authentic moderate; this means the left considers you mean-spirited and the far right condemns you as unprincipled, and both are partly correct, but it also means that your real self is neither the Willie Horton-basher nor the new tax seller-outer.
Your closest aides are afraid to tell you that you sound whiny playing Reagan and shrill posing as Truman. But the real you is where the votes are; your Democratic opponent will know that and compete there, but that won't be the real him, and swing voters will sense that.
The economy will either react to low interest rates and stimulating deficits and turn up soon or it won't; cut out the losing combination of fretting and jawboning. Instead, rally the people to your cause, which can be more than tough love at home, spasmodic assertiveness abroad.
First, take advantage of a beatable challenge: Fight for the soul of your party against the Wrong Right, whose members always despised you and now seek your ruin. You can beat them on everything but abortion, where they can out-anti you, but you're stuck with your minority position there; so present it to centrists as an example of principle over popularity.
Then use your convention to declare war on both selfish isolation and intrusive statism. Your '88 strategy won't fly in '92; Democrats are preparing for a repeat, so cross 'em up.
If you run as a phony rightie against a centrist-appearing lefty, you'll lose. If you run as an unabashed moderate against the extremes of right and left, you'll win.

HEADLINE: Litton Profit Is Up by 5%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., Nov. 25

 BODY:
Litton Industries said today that quarterly earnings rose 5 percent on an 11 percent increase in sales. Improved commercial results more than offset declines in the company's military business, Litton said.
In its fiscal first quarter, ended Oct. 31, Litton earned $41.5 million, or $2.02 a share, compared with $39.6 million, or $1.76 a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose to $1.36 billion from $1.23 billion. 
 Orion L. Hoch, Litton's chairman, said the company was pleased that its investments in its industrial automation and oilfield services businesses were paying off, even during the recession.

Caterpillar Sets Additional Layoffs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: JOLIET, Ill., Nov. 25

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. said it would temporarily lay off an additional 200 workers at its Joliet hydraulics plant because of a strike at two of the company's assembly plants. The Caterpillar hydraulics-fabrication unit laid off about 600 people last week because the company did not want to build up a surplus of parts that are assembled at Caterpillar plants closed by the strike. 
 "These layoffs are the result of the company's labor dispute with the United Auto Workers," said a Caterpillar spokesman, Don Weir. He said the workers would be eligible for unemployment compensation and supplemental unemployment benefits. Mr. Weir said it was unknown when the workers would be called back to work. The new layoff takes effect Dec. 2.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Precious Metals Post Losses After a Week of Big Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metal futures prices fell yesterday as news of weak auto sales prompted traders to take profits from last week's strong gains.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery in December fell $1.30, to $368.30 an ounce, and December silver fell 6 cents, to $4.072 an ounce. Platinum for January delivery dropped $2.30, to $371.50 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 Some analysts said the metals were due for a downturn after six straight days of gains in the gold market and a week in which platinum's price rose more than $8 an ounce and silver's price climbed more than 10 cents.
The selloff may have been started by reports of weak United States auto sales during the mid-November period. Vehicle sales over all were down 18.6 percent, with Ford Motor reporting a drop of 33.6 percent and Honda's sales down 7.3 percent.
The auto figures carried two messages to metals traders: United States consumers are still not buying cars, and industrial demand for platinum, a crucial component of automobile catalytic converters, is not rebounding. The pollution-control devices account for about 40 percent of global platinum consumption.
Silver, another precious metal with industrial applications, also suffered from the implication of continued economic weakness. Gold was pulled lower by silver and platinum and by perceptions that inflation remains under control.
"It's all being underpinned by the fact that we have a recession and no real inflation," said James Steel, metals analyst with Refco Inc. in New York.
He said platinum futures were also under pressure from reports that a labor disturbance at an Anglo American Corporation mine in South Africa had been quelled.
Oil prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but refined petroleum product futures were mixed as traders awaited news from a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that formally begins today.
Some of the buying in oil came after Iraq's oil minister, Osama A. R. al-Hiti, said his nation would continue to resist the terms of a United Nations plan to allow Iraqi crude sales to resume.
Crude oil for delivery in January rose 21 cents, to $21.42 a barrel; December home heating oil rose 0.41 cent, to 62.47 cents a gallon; December unleaded gasoline fell 0.30 cent, to 62.18 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Lower Overseas, Then Turns Mixed in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
After settling lower in foreign markets yesterday, the dollar turned mixed in United States trading as dealers concentrated on other currencies.
The dollar fell against the Japanese yen and rose against the German mark, but the trading focus was each of the other two currencies. 
 The Japanese yen moved higher following comments overnight by Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, who said he preferred a stronger yen.
"The yen broke through key technical support levels, and the dollar came down sharply," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
The dollar rose, however, against the German mark. Analysts said Germany's Bundesbank entered the market to sell marks and buy the British pound, which was tumbling. The intervention was successful, and the pound began to strengthen again.
"The move was somewhat expected," Mr. Donney said. "There is an obligation on the part of central banks within the European Monetary System to come to the aid of other currencies to keep them supported."
The Bundesbank is considered a powerful force within the market, and the move had a deeper impact than similar moves by other European banks over the last few weeks.
Much of the day's action occurred overnight in Asian trading and in Europe. Trading became more subdued when activity shifted to domestic markets.
Traders in New York "really did nothing but lighten up on long mark positions," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.12 yen, to a closing 128.53 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 127.75 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 127.90 yen, down from 129.40 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7995, from $1.7975 late Friday. In New York it cost $1.7945 to buy one pound, unchanged from Friday.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose in New York to 1.5885 marks, from 1.5835 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.4125 Swiss francs, up from 1.4090; 5.4290 French francs, up from 5.4135; 1,201.75 Italian lire, up from 1,199.50, and 1.1383 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1390.

Push in Congress On Drug Prices

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
CONGRESSIONAL critics of pharmaceutical companies are again pressing them to slow the rapid rise in drug prices, which is running at 10.2 percent, or three times the general inflation rate.
The industry is divided on the issue. A few drug companies like Merck & Company and Pfizer Inc., which are rich in strong-selling products, favor moderating the increases to fend off criticism. But most do not seem to have changed their pricing policies, and no other drug maker has endorsed Merck's proposal to brake prices, with annual rises no greater than the Consumer Price Index. 
 Senator David Pryor, the Arkansas Democrat who initiated the 1990 law that requires drug makers to give rebates to state Medicaid programs, introduced a new proposal last week. The Pryor bill, co-sponsored by Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, would reduce a drug company's Federal tax credits for production in Puerto Rico if its prices rose faster than general inflation. The bill would also lean on the industry by opening an official study of Canada's drug price review board, which can restrain increases deemed excessive.
Urging the Senate to reject the Pryor bill, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association called the measure "unwise and discriminatory" and said it would hinder economic growth in Puerto Rico. The association also contended that prescription drugs, regardless of price, actually held down health-care costs by averting expensive surgery and hospital stays.
The Pryor bill is still more threat than reality and is unlikely to be taken up until next year, Senate Finance Committee aides said. For one thing, the Puerto Rico tax credit is a politically charged issue that touches nerves on the statehood and independence questions and on overall Federal tax policy.
Lobbyists predicted that the industry would be able to defeat the Pryor proposal, unless the Bush Administration supported it as a deficit-reduction measure, as happened with Senator Pryor's 1990 bill. But Senator Dave Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican who is a member of the Finance Committee's health subcommittee, warned in a floor speech last week that if drug "prices continue to rise, Government regulation will not be far behind."
Senator Durenberger said he was not ready to support Senator Pryor's proposal, but the Pryor bill was endorsed by 40 advocacy groups. They included the American Association of Retired Persons, Consumers Union, A.F.L.-C.I.O. and a number of other labor organizations, and National Small Business United.
On a related front, the Senate Labor Committee is negotiating with drug industry representatives for a compromise version of a bill sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. It would require drug price breaks for Government clinics operated by the Public Health Service and other agencies, using the 1990 Medicaid provision as a model.
The House Veterans Affairs Committee, meanwhile, has approved a bill to restore drug discounts for veterans hospitals, which some drug makers withdrew last year. Under the 1990 law, some companies would have been forced to give the state Medicaid programs the same price breaks they had given to the veterans hospitals.
Losing the discounts would raise the veterans hospitals' budgets at least $45 million this year, said Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota who is a consultant to several Congressional committees. Over the five years of the 1990 law, he added, the price increases may cut $250 million to $300 million from the $3 billion in projected savings on Medicaid drug prices.
In an amendment to the Veterans Affairs Committee appropriation, which the President has signed into law, Congress urged the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to try to get the discounts restored, and it removed the veterans hospitals' drug prices from the Medicaid computation.
Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, has introduced in the House the Kennedy bill on drugs for Federal clinics, but he said in an interview that it was time to try another tack. He suggested creating "a big pool of drug buyers," which would jointly represent the veterans hospitals, public health clinics and Medicaid. He said the purchasing pool could wield "Government clout and do some hard-nosed negotiating with people like the drug companies." Mr. Wyden's idea has already attracted some support. A staff member of the Senate Committee on Aging, which is headed by Senator Pryor, said that Senators Kennedy and Pryor, Mr. Wyden and Representative G. V. Montgomery, the Mississippi Democrat who heads the Veterans Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Health, would work together next year on "a comprehensive solution" to try to help all Federal and private drug purchasers. "The pressure is on the drug makers," the committee aide said. "They can't expect to be left out of the debate over health-care price containment."

Tenneco Sets $632 Million Sale to Enron

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Tenneco Inc. said today that it had agreed to sell its natural-gas liquids operations and some related assets to the Enron Corporation for $632 million.
Natural-gas liquids, which include ethane, butanes and propane, are derived from the processing of natural gas. They have been the only buoyant sector of an otherwise depressed natural-gas industry during the last two years, as both demand and prices have risen. 
 Many petrochemical and chemical producers have substituted natural-gas fuels for crude oil as a primary raw material, as natural-gas fuels proved more economical. The market expanded, too, as large chemical plants opened in Texas, along the Gulf of Mexico, this year.
 
Part of Tenneco's Revamping
 The deal with Enron marked a significant step in a fast-moving corporate revamping begun in September by Tenneco's new president, Michael H. Walsh, to raise more than $500 million in cash by the end of the year. Write-offs at the diversified company, mainly at the J. I. Case farm- and construction-equipment unit, could exceed $1 billion this year.
The selling price was higher than many analysts, as well as the company, had anticipated. As a consequence, shares of Tenneco, based in Houston, rose $1.875 each, to $34.75, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange today. Shares of Enron, also based in Houston, fell 25 cents, to $71, in Big Board trading.
The sale to Enron includes a plant under construction in La Porte, Tex., that will produce at least 15,300 barrels a day of a component for cleaner-burning gasoline, called methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE.
Contracts ranging between three and five years have already been signed for about 75 percent of the MTBE output, said Kenneth L. Lay, chief executive of Enron. Refiners could face a shortage of the component after tougher Federal anti-pollution laws take effect next year. Industry analysts estimate that demand for MTBE could surge to 400,000 barrels a day by 1995.
Enron was formed in 1985 in the merger of two big pipeline companies, the Internorth Corporation of Omaha and the Houston Natural Gas Company. It is the nation's largest diversified natural-gas company and the fifth-largest processor. But it has raised output this year and could rise to the No. 3 ranking among processors, said Diane Bazelides, an Enron spokeswoman.
 
A Captive Market
 In effect, Enron will have a captive market for 15,000 barrels a day of butane required at the new MTBE plant. Enron's current butane output is about 11,000 barrels a day, Ms. Bazelides said. The plant will also use large volumes of methanol produced by Enron, she said.
The company said it would finance the transaction by selling most of the assets, after they are acquired from Tenneco, to a syndicate of banks headed by Citicorp for $550 million. The balance of about $80 million will be financed directly from Enron's cash reserves. Enron has agreed to long-term leases covering most of the Tenneco properties being acquired by the Citicorp-led syndicate. Most of the properties are near the Houston Ship Channel.
Enron said it would pay $523 million in cash at the closing, set for Dec. 31, and would assume an estimated $102 million in costs related to completion of the MTBE plant, plus another $7 million in debt.
Mr. Lay said the deal should increase Enron's net income slightly in 1992, and by about $40 million in 1993, the first full year of operation for the MTBE plant.

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Forecasts Slow U.S. Recovery From Recession

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said today that the United States economy would recover far more slowly from its recent recession than it has from most other recessions of the last three decades.
The Paris-based organization predicted that the economy would grow by 1.4 percent in the second half of this year and by 2.5 percent next year, which compares with an average growth of 6 percent in the four quarters immediately after the last seven recessions. 
 In its annual report on the American economy, the organization said the expansion phase of the cycle is expected to be muted compared with those of typical recoveries.
The report said a shallow recession was likely to be followed by a weak recovery because not much spending was forgone in the downturn to fuel the upturn.
The organization, comprising 24 industrial nations, projected that by the end of 1993 the United States unemployment rate would fall to 5.75 percent (it was 6.8 percent in October) and the inflation rate would drop to 2.9 percent (from the 3.9 percent predicted for this year).
The organization said United States exports would continue to expand, but more slowly than in recent years. It forecast that exports of goods and services would grow by 4.7 percent this year and 7.1 percent next year, compared with double-digit jumps in 1988 and 1989.
The increases in exports will help stabilize the United States' current-account deficit at about $60 billion, the organization forecast, compared with annual deficits of more than $100 billion from 1985 through 1989.
It said the major components of private-sector demand were expected to rebound, but it added that the excessive supply of commercial real estate from the late 1980's would dampen activity in this sector for some years.
The organization praised the Bush Administration's banking proposals, which call for allowing unrestricted interstate branch banking and common ownership of commercial banks and investment banks. The report said the proposed changes would increase the efficiency of the financial sector as a whole by increasing competition, and should pose little risk to the stability of the financial system.
 
Stance on Deposit Insurance
 The organization questioned proposals to limit deposit insurance coverage, saying depositors might not be able to impose effective discipline on bankers. But proposals to increase capital requirements for banks were praised as a possible aid in restoring market discipline by insuring that the owners of a bank have a large stake in its financial health.
Discussing energy efficiency, the report noted that energy prices were far lower in the United States than in most other industrial countries and that the United States consumed far more energy per capita than most other nations. Gasoline in the United States sells for less than one-third the price in France, Italy and the Netherlands, largely because of those countries' high energy taxes, which seek to encourage conservation.
Raising energy taxes would be consistent with both environmental goals and enhanced energy security, the report said.

Unilever Shares Termed a Value

BYLINE: By Steven Prokesch

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
AFTER Unilever reported unexpectedly strong quarterly earnings this month, the price of the British-Dutch giant's stock surged. Although its shares and American depository receipts are trading near their high for the year, many analysts view them as undervalued compared with other consumer products companies.
With the shares trading at 11 or 12 times expected 1992 earnings, several analysts recommend buying them now. Even more see them as a good long-term investment. 
 Of the two types of A.D.R.'s trading on the New York Stock Exchange, analysts suggest buying those for the Dutch shares, which have been trading at a discount of 6 to 7 percent to the A.D.R.'s for the British stock.
One reason may be the historical relationship of the dollar to the Dutch guilder and the British pound -- a justification that analysts say should fade in coming years because the values of both the pound and the guilder are now tied in the European Monetary System. Also, A.D.R.'s for the Dutch shares are much more actively traded and therefore may have been more depressed by investor worries about the anemic American economy and swings in the value of the dollar.
A.D.R.'s for Unilever N.V. Dutch shares, closed yesterday at $94, up 25 cents, only slightly below the $95.25 reached last week. The A.D.R.'s for British Unilever P.L.C. shares, whose 52-week high is $60.25, closed at $60.375, up 37.5 cents. The A.D.R.'s have to be compared with the shares of the underlying companies, and not with each other.
"We like the long-term strategic direction and evolution of the company and think the discount it endures against other companies in the food arena is excessive," said Les Pugh, an analyst at Salomon Brothers International Ltd. For the short term, he recommends buying the Dutch shares and A.D.R.'s and holding the British shares and A.D.R.'s.
Analysts say that even if the American economic recovery stalls and the one believed to be starting in Britain is not robust, Unilever's profits should not deteriorate. On the other hand, they add, Unilever's progress in cutting costs and introducing new products should enable its food, detergent and personal-products businesses to benefit handsomely once those two markets recover. Products that are new or being expanded into new markets include Lever 2000 skin-care soap, Wisk Power Scoop powder laundry detergent and Elizabeth Taylor's White Diamonds and Calvin Klein's Escape fragrances.
"We think there are surprises on the upside in Unilever's profitability," said Tim Potter, an analyst at Smith New Court Securities Ltd. "Unilever has disposed of underperforming assets and made strategic acquisitions in higher-margin areas, principally personal-care products." The acquisitions included Chesebrough- Pond's, Elizabeth Arden, Faberge and Calvin Klein Cosmetics.
In the third quarter, Unilever's net profit rose 12 percent denominated in pounds, 11 percent in guilders and 2 percent in dollars. Analysts were especially impressed by the performance in North America, where Unilever benefited from lower extraordinary charges and cost cuts at its Lipton food unit.
"What we have seen is margins are recovering on the back of restructuring benefits," said Sylvain Massot, an analyst at Morgan Stanley International Ltd. Operating profit margins in North America rose to 8.8 percent, from 6.1 percent a year earlier. Mr. Massot says he believes Lipton has been increasing its share of the American market for margarines, oils and teas.
Some analysts also expect profits of the American detergent business to improve. "Clorox has dropped out of the business, and Colgate doesn't seem to be competing as much on price," Mr. Potter said. "Over the long run, that should mean it will be a slightly more profitable business for the industry leaders: Procter & Gamble and Unilever's Lever Brothers division."
Edouard de Boisgelin, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, foresees a profit surge from personal products once consumer spending picks up in big markets like the United States and Britain. "What they acquired was high quality," he said.
Analysts say Unilever's worldwide unit sales volume will grow by 2 percent this year and by 2 to 4 percent in 1992. They also expect more cost-cutting -- especially in Europe, which accounts for more than 60 percent of sales and operating profits.
Analysts expect Unilever to reduce its annual costs in Europe within four years by $300 million to $450 million as it achieves the economies of scale being made possible by the single market that the European Community is creating. Unilever is centralizing big portions of its manufacturing and distribution operations, especially for detergents and personal care products.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sales Of Vehicles Drop 18.6%

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks declined 18.6 percent in mid-November, the auto makers reported today. Analysts said the figures provided further evidence that the auto industry was in a second recession after slightly recovering from its slump earlier this year.
"It strongly suggests that a double-dip recession is taking hold," said Jack V. Kirnan, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody in New York. He said the industry was unlikely to muster a recovery until the second quarter of next year at the earliest. He also asserted that the Big Three American auto makers would probably have to pare down their optimistic production schedules for early 1992. 
 Recent sales reports have dashed industry hopes that were lifted in late summer by improving sales. The gains were later attributed to purchases by rental-car companies and other fleet customers.
 
Reluctant Lenders
 Several dealers and analysts said consumers' shaken confidence over the security of their jobs continued to hurt sales. Dealers also said that banks were more reluctant to write loans for customers than they were a year ago. "The banks are being very, very selective," said Ike Reinis, general sales manager of Balzekas Motor Sales in Chicago, which sells Chryslers and Plymouths.
Gordon Corey, general sales manager of Sam Galloway Ford in Fort Myers, Fla., figures he is losing about 5 percent of his sales because customers who would once have been creditworthy are being rejected by banks. Mr. Corey's sales have also been hurt by lower interest rates, which have cut the investment income of many older customers to the point where they are holding back from buying cars. "I'm just not seeing the retirees that I used to see," he said.
 
Car Sales Off 19.6%
 Some dealers noted that while showroom traffic was down, the shoppers they were seeing were committed to buying, largely because they had to replace high-mileage older cars. "The market is definitely need-driven," said Mark Herrmann, owner of Mark Buick in Yonkers. "Sometimes cars are in need of extensive repair."
Car sales fell 19.6 percent, to 159,461, between Nov. 11 and Nov. 20. There were nine selling days in the period, compared with eight in the period a year earlier. On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars made in North America, which are considered domestic models, sold at an annual rate of 5.9 million in mid-November. That compares with 7.1 million in the period of 1990. Sales of light trucks, which include pickups, dropped 17.1 percent, to 101,507.
The Big Three posted a collective decline of 21.8 percent in car sales in mid-November, while the Japanese companies that build cars in North America reported an overall drop of 7.8 percent. These "transplant" manufacturers raised their share of the American car market to 17.6 percent in mid-November, from 15.3 percent a year earlier. The Big Three's share of the market for domestically built cars declined to 82.4 percent, from 84.7 percent a year earlier.
Of the Big Three, the General Motors Corporation's car sales dropped 10.1 percent, adjusted to reflect the different number of selling days in the two periods, to 78,442. Its light-truck sales dropped 22.8 percent, to 38,341 units. G.M.'s best-performing car division in the period was Buick; its sales declined only 1 percent, largely because of the strong sales of its redesigned LeSabre model.
The Ford Motor Company reported a drop of 33.6 percent in car sales, to 36,901, and a 13.2 percent decline in light-truck sales, to 36,746.
The Chrysler Corporation's car sales dropped 36.2 percent, to 16,050, based on estimates by Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication. Chrysler's truck sales were estimated to have declined 15.4 percent, to 21,750. Chrysler reports its sales monthly.
The Honda Motor Company sold 11,747 American-built cars, a drop of 7.3 percent. The Toyota Motor Corporation reported a sales drop of 15.7 percent in the period, to 8,555 cars.

Banks Give the Maxwells Breathing Room on Debts

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Kevin and Ian Maxwell got some breathing room today, as officials from about 25 banks gave them at least 10 days to work out a plan for defusing the debt crisis threatening the global publishing empire their family controls.
Both sides described as constructive the tone of the meeting between the Maxwells and the bankers. And the bankers agreed to set up a steering committee of at least five banks to consider proposals made today by the brothers for dealing with the crucial issue: inadequately secured loans to the family's private companies. In a statement issued tonight, the Maxwells said the steering committee would report back within 10 days. 
 "We have had a meeting which was constructive, frank but in no way acrimonious," said a spokesman for National Westminster Bank. "The banks are actively exploring the way forward." The big British bank, which has one of the largest exposures to the Maxwell empire, will head the steering committee, whose other members are believed to include Midland Bank and Lloyds Bank in Britain, the Swiss branch of France's Banque Paribas and Sumitomo Bank of Japan.
 
Reprieve From Swiss Bank Corp.
 The Swiss Bank Corporation, which had been demanding that its 55 million ($99 million) loan be repaid or that it be provided with adequate collateral, said today that it would take no immediate action. The bank had threatened to push one of the Maxwell family's private companies into receivership if its demands were not met. If that happened, it could set off events that might cause the Maxwell empire to collapse.
Kevin Maxwell described the tone of the meeting as "extremely constructive, very helpful and frank." He and his brother assumed the helm of the family's collection of private and public companies after the death of their father, Robert Maxwell, on Nov. 5.
When asked in an interview whether there was a deadline for a plan, an adviser to the Maxwells who requested anonymity said it would take "weeks, but not very many."
 
Bond Proposal
 One of apparently several proposals made by the Maxwells to reduce bank debt was to issue a bond that could be converted into shares of the family's 51 percent owned Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd. if bondholders were not repaid on time.
There was no indication that the sale of The Daily News in New York was actively under consideration at the moment, bankers said.
Shortly after their father died, the Maxwell brothers said they would not sell The Daily News or The European, a pan-Europe weekly newspaper introduced last spring. But in recent days, Kevin Maxwell has said, "There are no sacred cows."
 
Notion of Auction Played Down
 There have been rumors that another proposal was to auction off the Maxwell Communication Corporation, whose operations are mainly in the United States. They include Macmillan publishing, Official Airline Guides and Collier's encyclopedias. But the Maxwell adviser seemed to play down both that possibility and the notion that they might sell some of Maxwell Communication's major businesses.
Maxwell Communication is itself heavily indebted, with a net debt -- or debts minus cash on hand -- of about 1.4 billion, or $2.51 billion. So, presumably, its lenders would be reluctant to allow its assets to be sold to reduce the debts of the Maxwell family's private companies.
The Maxwells said today that they had appointed N. M. Rothschild & Sons Ltd., the London-based investment bank, to work with the existing financial adviser to their private companies, the Bankers Trust New York Corporation.

Shift at I.B.M. Alters Succession Outlook

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
In what is expected to be the first step in a far-reaching shake-up at I.B.M., an executive widely viewed as a potential successor to the chairman, John F. Akers, yesterday was handed what many industry executives called a demotion.
George H. Conrades, senior vice president of I.B.M.'s struggling United States business, was named to what is considered a lower-ranking position, senior vice president for corporate marketing and services. 
 In his new position, Mr. Conrades will report to another senior vice president, C. Michael Armstrong. Until yesterday, the two men had been the most frequently mentioned candidates for the chairmanship of the International Business Machines Corporation, the world's largest computer maker.
Mr. Armstrong, who is 53 years old, now appears to have the inside track to succeed Mr. Akers, who is 56 and is scheduled to retire as chairman when he reaches 60. The only other I.B.M. executive ranked higher than senior vice president, Jack D. Kuehler, the president, is expected to retire before Mr. Akers.
Mr. Armstrong is a member of the management committee -- the five-man inner circle at I.B.M. -- and is chairman of I.B.M. World Trade, the subsidiary responsible for I.B.M.'s substantial foreign business. His office is down the hall from Mr. Akers's at the company's Armonk, N.Y., headquarters. Mr. Armstrong was a protege of another top I.B.M. executive, Kaspar V. Cassani, I.B.M.'s retired vice chairman.
I.B.M. is expected to make a broad set of changes next week that may include offering more financial autonomy to some of its divisions and trimming more employees from its payroll, particularly at the domestic field-sales level. Although the company has a no-layoff policy, it has become increasingly insistent that some of its employees depart.
Mr. Conrades, who joined the company in 1961, will continue as a member of I.B.M.'s corporate management board, according to a company announcement, but several industry executives said they were not certain that the 52-year-old manager would stay with the company.
An I.B.M. spokesman, Rob Wilson, described yesterday's management change as a routine rotation of executives. In his new job, Mr. Conrades will develop and manage strategic corporate and international marketing issues, the company said. Mr. Conrades was not available for comment on his new role.
Robert J. LaBant, who has risen to prominence based on the success of I.B.M.'s AS/400 line of minicomputers, will take Mr. Conrades's old position as senior vice president and general manager for I.B.M. United States, reporting to a senior vice president, Terry R. Lautenbach.
Mr. LaBant, who is 46, will be replaced by John M. Thompson, who has been named vice president and general manager for the application business systems line, reporting to Mr. Kuehler. Mr. Thompson, who continues as chairman of I.B.M. Canada, was a vice president for corporate marketing and services.
 
Reward for a Rising Star
 Mr. LaBant was praised yesterday by people who follow I.B.M. for his role in helping the company in a difficult economic climate. He is said to be a rising star who is being rewarded for his performance.
"The key to the whole thing is that he did a good job with the AS/400," said Sam Albert, a consultant and a former I.B.M. executive. "They've taken a very successful guy and they put him in the key marketing job. He's a seasoned performer."
Not every analyst agreed with the assessment that Mr. Conrades's fate was sealed in yesterday's shift.
"It's too early to call," said Rick Martin, an industry analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. "The corporate marketing position has always been one of the most powerful of the staff jobs. It's not a clear indicator that he's in the penalty box."
However, some people in the computer industry who follow I.B.M. suggested that Mr. Conrades was one of the first victims of the company's search for accountability for poor performance in recent years.
"Anybody inside I.B.M. recognizes that Conrades was basically publicly shot," said an industry executive who insisted on not being identified.
Others suggested that Mr. Conrades was paying the price for not having been in Mr. Akers's favor for some time.
"From a business standpoint, it's grossly unfair considering that 1990 was the first year in the recent past the U.S. has shown growth," said Robert Djurdjevic, an industry consultant who is president of Annex Research in Phoenix. "Conrades's efforts had finally started to produce results."
In a widely reported internal memo based on remarks that Mr. Akers made to a management class that was given to a number of newspapers this May, the chairman was reported to have called the performance of the company's United States business unsatisfactory. He was reported to have said that although the company had transferred 5,000 people into sales positions, there had been no evidence of financial return.
"Where's the beef? What the hell are you doing for 'me'?" the memorandum reportedly quoted Mr. Akers as saying.
Mr. Djurdjevic said he thought Mr. Akers's remarks had been directed at Mr. Conrades.

HEADLINE: Stocks Slip, With Dow Off 0.67, to 2,902.06

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed narrowly lower yesterday in choppy trading, as many investors moved to the sidelines. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 0.67 points, to end at 2,902.06.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was fairly heavy, at 175.9 million shares, down from 188.3 million on Friday. Losing issues outpaced gainers by 1,057 to 629. 
 Blue-chip stocks recovered somewhat from earlier losses, but many investors stayed away amid lack of confidence in the economy and the stock market. Even a 1 percent gain in the October sales of existing homes, after a 4 percent decline in September, was no spur to buy.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks slipped 0.80, to 375.34, as the Big Board composite lost 0.59, to 207.57. Moderate trading lowered the American Stock Exchange composite by 2.24, to 371.04.
Trading on the Nasdaq pulled the composite down 3.58, to 522.88, as the Russell 2,000 lost 1.25, to 176.12.
Blue-chip issues and the broader market were under pressure throughout the day, with the Dow a little stronger than the broad market. Some traders noted that equity mutual funds, which have posted gains all year, are beginning to increase selling.
John C. Brooks, a technical analyst for Davis, Mendel & Regenstein in Atlanta, noted that there was a moderate amount of program trading yesterday. "The real story, however, was in the advance-decline line, where we again had over 1,000 declines," he said. "I think the market is facing some problems."
Mr. Brooks said he thought it was a bit late in the year for professional traders to risk coming in and buying for a year-end rally. He saw them as more interested in retaining their current yields. "The 2,850 level is a more logical point were buyers would come in," he said.
Ford Motor reported mid-November car sales down 33.6 percent, and its stock fell 3/8, to 24 1/4.
The share price for Information Resources, which provides analytical information on consumer purchases, rose 2 1/8, to 22 3/8, after the company said it was buying back a stock purchase warrant from a unit of Citicorp and expanding its Infoscan business.
Continental Airlines Holdings, whose stock was halted on Friday at 1 1/8 a share on the Amex, said over the weekend that it planned to come out of bankruptcy by giving its employees and unsecured creditors a stake in the airline company. Its stock fell 1/2, to 5/8.
Kerr Glass Manufacturing said it had agreed to sell its commercial glass-container business unit to Ball for about $161 million, resulting in an after-tax loss of about $2 million. The deal is subject to approval by Kerr's board. Kerr stock was off 3/4, to 7 3/8, while Ball fell 1, to 31 7/8.

HEADLINE: Tax-Break Extension Now Seen as Probable

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Moving quickly and without dissent, tax-writing committees of the House and Senate voted this afternoon to extend a dozen expiring business and individual tax breaks for six months.
Unless some lawmaker mounts unexpected, last-minute opposition, the measures, which are identical and had been languishing for months, should clear Congress promptly and move to the White House before Thanksgiving, Congressional officials said. Although President Bush has not formally backed all of the items, he has endorsed many of them, they said, which should assure his signature. 
 The incentives, all of which are due to expire by the end of the year, would cost nearly $3.2 billion to extend. That cost would be offset by speeding the collection of taxes on large corporations.
 
'Welcome News for the Economy'
 The most significant items, as measured by their cost over five years, are credits ranging from 30 percent to 70 percent for investors in new or substantially rehabilitated rental housing for the poor, and a 20 percent credit for qualified spending on research and experimentation.
"These actions are very welcome news for the economy," said Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, who is a member of the Finance Committee. "The provisions serve important national needs and create jobs and economic activity," he said.
But Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Chicago Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, warned in convening a 70-minute session of his panel that this would be the last temporary extension for the measures.
 
A Plan for Case-by-Case Review
 Mr. Rostenkowski said that he would hold hearings on each item early in 1992 and that separate votes would then determine whether each was incorporated permanently into the tax law or abandoned.
The sudden revival of the legislation, which had appeared all but doomed last week, was at least partly spurred by the rapidly accumulating evidence of a fading economic recovery.
The 12 so-called extenders are generally supported by both parties but had been bottled up until now for fear that any tax measure would become a vehicle for other tax proposals, like a cut in the tax on capital gains. Mr. Rostenkowski pointed repeatedly to the risks of sending a bill to the Senate, where it is particularly difficult to control amendments.
He also insisted on rigid adherence to the principle that any revenue-losing measure be accompanied by a plan to raise money elsewhere in the budget.
 
5-Year Cost: $3.18 Billion
 The House and Senate's Joint Tax Committee estimates that if all the elements remain in effect for five years, the costs will be $3.18 billion and the revenue $3.20 billion. The Treasury would gain $405 million in the current fiscal year and $170 million in 1995 but lose money in the other three years.
The 10 tax breaks besides those for low-income housing and research and experimentation, ranked by their five-year costs, involve: foreign allocation of research expenses; exemption for locally issued mortgage bonds for housing; deduction for interest on bonds to finance small manufacturers; exclusion from taxable income for employer-provided educational assistance; credit for hiring people in nine targeted groups of the poor or disabled; deduction of 25 percent of the health insurance premiums of the self-employed; exclusion from income for employer-provided group legal services; credits for business use of solar and geothermal energy; a minimum deduction for the appreciated value of charitable gifts of tangible property like artwork, and a credit for developing so-called orphan drugs for rare diseases.
All would be extended until June 30, 1992, except for the foreign research-allocation provision, which expired on Aug. 1 and would run six months from then, to March 1.
The new revenue would come from requiring that corporations with taxable income of $1 million or more for any of the three preceding years raise their estimated tax payments to 95 percent of current-year liability by 1995. The current level of 90 percent would rise in the interim to 93 percent in 1992 and 94 percent in 1993 and 1994. Companies would retain the option, however, to pay on the basis of 100 percent of the preceding year's liability.

HEADLINE: Bush Threatens to Veto Crime Bill, Saying It's Too Soft on Defendants

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
President Bush vowed today to veto an anti-crime package that would extend the death penalty to many drug-related crimes and impose a waiting period on the sale of handguns, arguing that the legislation was not tough enough on criminals.
The veto threat came only hours before the House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on the bill, a compromise between competing House and Senate versions that was approved Sunday evening along partisan lines, the Democrats in favor and the Republicans opposed. 
 But Mr. Bush's action, combined with intense pressure from the gun lobby and groups opposed to the death penalty, forced a delay on the vote until at least Tuesday because Democratic leaders feared they might not have enough votes to pass the bill tonight.
 
Hopes for Tougher Rules
 Democrats accused the President of trying to thwart the strongest anti-crime bill to advance through the Congress in the last decade, and they said that the threatened veto would set the stage for crime as a major issue in the 1992 campaign.
Although the bill included a number of tough measures he had sought, Mr. Bush had hoped the legislation would include tighter restrictions on habeas corpus appeals, the hearings in Federal courts in which prisoners raise constitutional challenges to their sentences or convictions in lower courts, particularly for death-row inmates facing execution. Mr. Bush had also favored a provision in an earlier version that had allowed some evidence gathered without a search warrant to be introduced in trials.
But over the heated objections of Republican negotiators, a House-Senate conference committee approved the bill in Sunday night in a form that granted criminal defendants more rights than Republicans wanted.
"I would have to veto this bill because it would weaken our criminal justice system," Mr. Bush said in a brief aside in an address in Columbus, Ohio.
Later in the day he told reporters that he had just met with a group of police officers who "want to see a bill that supports the law enforcement officers, not one that gets watered down at the last minute and goes against what I've been standing for."
By pledging a veto, he put himself in the potentially uncomfortable position of having to explain how he could strike down an expansion of the death penalty to 52 Federal crimes, a provision he has long supported and one that is considered popular among voters. The death penalty is now allowed for only two Federal crimes: airline hijacking that results in death and certain drug-related murders.
 
Influenced by Gun Lobby?
 Democrats were quick to charge that Mr. Bush and the Republicans were unduly influenced by the gun lobby, which strongly opposes the Brady bill, a provision in the legislation that would require a five-day waiting period on the purchase of handguns. The provision is named for James S. Brady, the aide to President Ronald Reagan who was gravely injured in the 1981 assassination attempt on Mr. Reagan.
"Now he can whisper to the National Rifle Association, 'I did your bidding,' " Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said at a news conference called after the President announced his intentions. "It's going to be awfully hard for the President to convince the American people he is being tough. The veto will hurt him as much as the unemployment compensation vetoes, but he doesn't know it yet."
Mr. Reagan strongly endorsed the Brady bill last March, saying, "It's just plain common sense that there be a waiting period to allow local law-enforcement officials to conduct background checks on those who wish to purchase handguns." Mr. Bush said he would support the Brady measure, but only if it were part of a larger anti-crime bill that broadened the rights of the police to investigate crimes and limited defendant appeals.
The anti-crime legislation would provide more than $3 billion in Federal aid to an array of law-enforcement programs, including drug testing and treatment in local prisons, creation of neighborhood policing programs, and modernization of police equipment and training. It would also establish scholarship programs for college students willing to undergo some police training and then join a police auxiliary force after graduation.
Reinforcing the recent Supreme Court decision in McKlesky v. Zant that narrowed the circumstances under which defendants can appeal their convictions or sentences in Federal court, the bill sets a one-year deadline on habeas corpus appeals.
The bill has attracted much opposition from the gun lobby and local prosecutors, who want to do away with most habeas corpus appeals that can delay executions for years. But gun-control groups have strongly backed the legislation, even though provisions to ban the manufacture and sale of many assault rifles were defeated in the House.
Michael Beard, a lobbyist for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, sharply criticized the President's decision, saying, "The only people this veto will help are criminals and gun runners."
 
Bill a 'Retrenchment'
 Mr. Bush's announcement, however, was received enthusiastically by many Congressional Republicans. "His decision to veto is a wise decision because this is not a strong crime bill," said Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who is a ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said: "This is supposed to be a tough bill. It is a retrenchment. It is a stepping back." He called the conference committee that worked out the final language in the bill "a kangaroo court."
Republicans in the Senate, hoping to kill the bill this session by preventing a Senate vote before the holiday recess begins later this week, have threatened to filibuster when the bill moves to the Senate after House action.
In a letter to Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader, Mr. Bush explained that he could not support the conference bill because it violated Administration goals to "end frivolous post-appeal challenges brought by convicted criminals."
He objected to the conference committee's rejection of his appeal to allow for an exception to the "exclusionary rule" forbidding evidence derived from police searches without a warrant in cases where officers acted in "good faith," or without consciously abusing the rights of the defendant.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "On Crime: The Bill vs. Bush"
 
DEATH PENALTY
 The Bill: Expands the number ofFederal crimes punishable by death. Reinstates the death penalty for other Federal crimes that alreadycall for it but whose current language fails to meet Supreme Court guidelines for capital punishment. Crimes included are espionage, treason, political assassinations, drug trafficking on a large scale and terrorist acts that result in death.
 Bush Position: Provisions are similar to the Administration position.
 
GUN CONTROL
 The Bill: Imposes a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases while the police conduct checks to determine if the potential buyer has a criminal record. Sets up a program to update and computerize state criminal records to "instant checks" can be conducted by gun dealers connected to centralized computers.
 Bush Position: Would considersupporting a waiting period for handgun purchases if it was part of a package that included the President's other crime proposals.
 
IMPROPERLY SEIZED EVIDENCE
 The Bill: Allows introduction of such evidence in Federal court cases if the police conducting the search relied in "good faith" on a warrant that later proved defective.
 Bush Position: Favors giving the police wider latitude than the bill would allow.
 
HABEAS CORPUS
 The Bill: Sets a one-year deadline on habeas corpus petitions and bar5s successive petitions unless new facts emerge or a prisoner could not have reasonably included a claim in his first petition.
 Bush Position: Seeks to restirct even more thatn the bill prisoners' ability to file such petitions. (pg. A16)

HEADLINE: LAWMAKERS NEAR $151 BILLION PACT ON TRANSPORT BILL

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
After spending the weekend in legislative gridlock, House and Senate negotiators reached virtual agreement today on a compromise bill establishing highway and mass transportation programs worth $151 billion over six years.
Under the provisions of the bill, the Federal Government would grant the states about $32 billion for mass transportation and $119 billion for highways. The spending would begin immediately and grow steadily over the years. Most of the money would come from taxes on motor vehicle fuels. 
 The negotiations were stalled late today by wrangling over the allocation of money to individual states, with several lawmakers contending that their states would not get their fair share. But the prospects for final agreement still appeared to be good, with passage by the Senate and House likely before Congress adjourns for Thanksgiving. President Bush is expected to sign the legislation.
 
Thousands of Jobs Affected
 Hundreds of thousands of construction jobs would be affected by the legislation. Some states began to lay off workers after Federal highway aid stopped flowing on Sept. 30. Nobody in Washington wanted to be blamed for the collapse of a bill that sponsors said would stimulate the economy in the short term by putting people to work and in the long term by easing traffic congestion.
Across the political spectrum, lawmakers, lobbyists and Federal and state transportation officials said the bill would leave a permanent mark. It would make substantial changes in the structure of transportation programs, greatly diminishing the Federal role in determining how states spend transportation dollars, while substantially increasing the amount of Federal money sent to the states each year. It would also use transportation programs as a tool to achieve other goals, notably helping the states to meet the demands of the Clean Air Act, which passed last year.
The bill's broad outlines were slowly becoming known throughout the day, even as its finer points, including how much money each state would receive, remained open for negotiation.
 
Declaring Victory
 Exhausted by the struggle to bring as much of the money as possible home to their constituents, the House and Senate leadership as well as the Administration seemed inclined today to declare victory in the prolonged bout over the transportation bill and to endorse the compromise that emerged overnight.
House and Senate leaders put out the word tonight that the compromise was, as one highway industry lobbyist said, "a take-it-or-leave-it proposition."
Administration officials said that the bill would achieve their major goals of reshaping an array of Federal grant programs into a relatively few programs, giving the states more flexibility to choose how the money was spent. But they acknowledged that the compromise would allow more spending than the Administration had wanted and would not require the states to pay as high a proportion of transportation costs as the White House had sought.
But it seemed likely that the political imperative of generating jobs would overcome any lingering doubts over the legislation.
A principal question during consideration of the bill had been how much emphasis to put on highways rather than mass transportation and, in particular, whether to endorse the Administration's plan to concentrate spending on a coast-to-coast network of major highways, including the existing interstates and other primary routes. The Administration wanted to spend about $10 billion a year for this program, which it called the National Highway System.
As the compromise emerged, the bill would include nearly $38 billion over six years for improving and expanding these major highways, an amount that was close to what the House had passed and considerably more than what the Senate had allowed.
 
What Administration Sought
 The Administration welcomed this provision today. But lobbyists who opposed the Administration's highway goals said that Congress had not completely accepted the Administration's vision of the National Highway System.
For example, they said, the Administration had initially requested nearly $44 billion for this program over five years. They said the compromise also would require that Congress vote on the program again in 1995, after the states and the Department of Transportation defined what roads would be included. Further, they said, $17 billion, or half the money for the national highway program, would be set aside for maintaining existing interstates.
All these constraints could be seen as a victory for the Senate, where Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat who was a principal author of the bill, had sought a bill that would not give first priority to highways.
Mr. Moynihan said he was "immensely happy, hugely encouraged" by the outcome.
"What we have done here is to create the opportunity to move from a period of system building to system performance, and it is a tremendous opportunity," he said. "The bill says to people: Think harder about what you have got, what you might want, a better way of doing it. Think productivity."
 
Increase for Mass Transit
 The bill would include a big increase for mass transportation, although details of the mass transportation program were still being worked out today. The measure would also continue the practice of providing operating subsidies for big city transportation programs.
It also would set the Federal share of transportation programs at 80 percent, with the states providing 20 percent.
Both the increase for mass transportation and the cost-sharing provisions represented defeats for the Administration.
What delayed the compromise wasthe need to sort out differences on how the money should be allocated among states. No matter what formula was used, one state or another came up short. In the end, the negotiators designed a formula that would satisfy as many members as possible, inventing several new financing categories in the process. Then, to insure acceptance of the bill, a bonus was thrown in to satisfy powerful lawmakers in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Maine and West Virginia.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "How the Transportation Bill Shapes Up"
 
Financing
 $151 billion over six years, including $119 billion for highways and $32 billion for mass transit. The Administration wanted $17.8 billion a year for highways, and the bill provides $19.8 billion a year, on average. The Administration wanted $3.2 billion a year for transit, and the bill provides $5.25 billion a year.
 
Apportionment
 For many lawmakers, the crucial question was whether individual states would receive Federal aid equivalent to the amount of fuel taxes each pays. After repeated attempts to write a formula that would win enough votes, with grants linked to factors like gasoline consumption, highway mileage, state population and historical levels of financing, the negotiators decided simply to set aside chunks of money for several major states. Not everybody was satisfied, through, and the formulas continued to be debated today.
 
National Highway System
 The negotiators have allowed $38 billion for a 155,000-mile network of interstate highways and other major roads. The Administration had sought $44 billion, but over five years. Even so, the Administration said that it was satisfied since other money would probably be spent on related projects like bridges and highway maintenance.
 But those who did not want to commit money to the program are also declaring victory. They said that the highways have not yet been formally chosen. Theyalso said that Congress must approve the program again after the highways are chosen and that states have the choice of civerting up to half the highway money to other purposes.

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Nearly halfway through his term, Mayor David N. Dinkins's political support has slid sharply, with fewer than a third of all New Yorkers approving of the way he is handling his job, and two-thirds saying it is time to give someone else a chance, according to a citywide New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll.
Battered by the city's fiscal crisis, rising social problems and the dashing of many of the high expectations that greeted his narrow victory as the city's first black mayor, Mr. Dinkins has an approval rating of 29 percent, with 58 percent disapproving -- almost exactly the reverse of his ratings in mid-1990. 
 The new rating is roughly equal to the lowest marks ever given to former Mayor Edward I. Koch, in June 1989, when his approval rating was 33 percent. That was after 11 years in office and a major corruption scandal, and just three months before Mr. Dinkins decisively defeated him in the Democratic primary.
Polls are only a snapshot, subject to the vagaries of the economy and events. And after any dramatic development, the public can rally to its leaders and job ratings can rise. At the moment, other political chief executives around the region are suffering similar slumps.
More than half of black New Yorkers, 59 percent, still approve of Mr. Dinkins's performance, but about a third, 30 percent, disapprove and say it is time to give someone else a chance. That is a major erosion for a Mayor elected with more than 90 percent of the black vote. His standing among whites was starkly lower, with just 17 percent approving of his stewardship and nearly three-quarters disapproving of his performance and saying it was time for a change.
In one potentially ominous sign, given Mr. Dinkins's campaign on a platform of racial healing two years ago, most of those surveyed said he had had no impact or a negative impact on race relations in the city, with only 29 percent saying he had had a positive impact. A little more than half of both blacks and whites said race relations were worse in the city than five years ago.
"It is of concern to me, of course,"the Mayor said in an interview yesterday. But he noted that the steady drumbeat of bad budget news in the region had made incumbents lightning rods for dissatisfaction. He said he would rebound when judged against his opponents, instead of against an ideal.
"The poll that really matters is one that will be taken in 1993, in the primary in September and the general election in November, and I feel confident that we will do well," he said. "The reason is that people will be obliged to weigh those others who've suggested they can somehow or other do it better."
The poll was based on telephone interviews with 824 New Yorkers, including 482 whites and 208 blacks, conducted Nov. 2 to 12, the week before the Mayor's trip to South Africa and at the time that Mr. Dinkins announced his plan to keep the budget balanced by cutting the work force and freezing property taxes for two years. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 
Can't Blame Predecessor
 Political experts said the new ratings -- much worse than polls of 18 months ago but only slighter worse than those in other recent polls -- reflected not only the Mayor's accumulated political problems but also the natural cycle of a politician's term.
"He's been in too long to blame the previous incumbent, and it's too soon to start trying to proclaim his accomplishments in a campaign," said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. "So you're in that middle zone, which is the low ebb."
Dennis Rivera, head of Local 1199 of the hospital and health care workers union and one of Mr. Dinkins's earliest backers who has lately been critical of him, said: "Two years is a lifetime in politics. If he can rebuild his coalition, he will have a formidable chance of getting re-elected."
But that coalition of liberals, labor and minorities has been splintered by the fiscal problems that have forced the Mayor to forsake much of his agenda of social programs while spending to hire more police officers. The Times/WCBS-TV News Poll did not include a large enough sample of Hispanic New Yorkers to make their views statistically reliable, but other polls have shown Mr. Dinkins faring badly with that important segment of his supporters.
Mr. Dinkins's chief political aide, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, said of the new poll, "The only thing I would say about it is we're not taking it for granted or being cavalier about it, we'll just redouble our efforts, just work harder." He said the administration had not yet begun to do polling of its own in anticipation of the re-election campaign, but would do so in the coming months.
 
Still, Some Optimism
 Underneath the obvious bad news and strong disapproval ratings are some signs of a silver lining. While all New Yorkers' approval of the Mayor's job performance has slipped steeply, the percentage of black New Yorkers who have a generally favorable opinion of him is in the high 50's, the same level as before his election.
Some blacks who said they disapproved of the Mayor's performance in the poll said in follow-up interviews that he had a very hard job and had not always been treated fairly by the press.
"Well, it looks like things got worse and didn't get any better," said Mary Harris, a 66-year-old retired nurse from Harlem, who said she would have to think very hard before voting for Mr. Dinkins again. "It doesn't seem like he's helping anything. I voted for him, but I've been disappointed." But she added: "I don't think he's been treated quite fair. He had problems when he went in there, and there's been a lot of pressure on him."
Jan Zaccor, 43, a commercial real-estate broker in Flushing, Queens, who supported the Mayor in 1989 said she would vote for him again. "I don't think that job is doable for any one person," she said. "He seems to be a wise man, though very limited in what he can do. Let's put it this way: I don't think he's hurt anything."o
She added: "He has his shortcomings. I guess he's not as outspoken as maybe he should be. But I think black people expected him to crusade for black rights, which he didn't do to any great extent, and maybe they're angry at that. But that's one of the reasons I like him is because he didn't pick any one group."
Such comments distill Mr. Dinkins's problem as he tries to rebuild support among his core constiuency without alienating the liberal white voters who helped propel him to a two-point victory over Rudolph W. Giuliani. He returned from a week in Africa buoyed by his trip and bitter at his critics, vowing to "tell the truth" on those who had been "telling lies" about him.
Another poll, to be published in this week's issue of The New York Observer, had even more negative findings, with 75 percent of respondents rating Mr. Dinkins's job performance unfavorably and only 25 percent favorably. That poll was based on telephone interviews with 500 New Yorkers by Johnson Survey Associates. It had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.

How the Survey Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Nov. 2 to 12 with 824 adults throughout the five boroughs of New York City.
The New York City poll was part of a broader project in which 3,212 adults were interviewed across the entire New York metropolitan region.
The sample of telephone numbers called was generated by a computer, based on random digit dialing techniques. It was drawn by Marketing Systems Group of Philadelphia.
Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll.
The results have been weighted to take into account household size and the number of telephone lines into each residence. The results have also been adjusted for variations relating to race, sex and age.
In theory, in 19 of 20 cases the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult residents of New York City.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for black respondents in New York City it is plus or minus seven percentage points.
Besides sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes Aid to Soviets to Scrap Atomic Arms

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The Senate approved a stripped-down plan today to transfer up to $500 million from the Pentagon budget to help dismantle Soviet nuclear weapons.
The Senate also approved the treaty that cuts NATO and former Warsaw Pact non-nuclear forces in Europe. 
 House leaders and the Bush Administration have expressed support for the revived Soviet aid package, enhancing its prospects for final approval before Congress adjourns this week.
Senate approval of the Soviet aid plan capped a startling comeback for a proposal that nearly died two weeks ago after the measure's sponsors failed to line up broad political support and the White House balked at openly endorsing it amid charges that the Administration was paying too much attention to foreign affairs.
 
A Less Ambitious Plan
 The vote today was 86 to 8, with 52 Democrats and 34 Republicans in support. Eight conservative Republicans voted against the measure.
The revised plan is cheaper and less ambitious than the original version sponsored by Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, both Democrats, but is still aimed at averting instability in a crumbling nation that has 30,000 nuclear weapons. Mr. Nunn is chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee. Mr. Aspin is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
Focused narrowly on helping the Soviet Union store, dismantle and destroy its arsenal of nuclear and chemical weapons, the revised plan has a clearer and more persuasive payback for American national security than the earlier version.
Under the revised plan, the Administration has discretion to transfer up to $500 million from this year's Defense Department budget to Soviet aid, instead of $1 billion under the original plan, and deals mainly with assisting Moscow's efforts to destroy its nuclear and chemical arsenal.
"The former Soviet Union, still a nuclear superpower, is coming apart at the seams," Mr. Nunn said. "The danger of proliferation of existing weapons, weapons materials and the weapons know-how is growing as both the Soviet economy and traditional Soviet control mechanisms lose effectiveness."
The plan extends aid only to the Soviet Union or any republic that invests in dismantling its nuclear and chemical weapons, foregoes modernizing its military except for defensive needs and complies with arms treaties.
The revised plan eliminates incentives to American companies that invest in converted Soviet military industries and a provision to help the Soviet Union retrain its military officers. Both provisions drew heavy criticism from Republicans and Democrats, who feared a public perception of favoring the plight of foreigners at a time when the American economy is suffering.
Backers of the original plan worked in tight secrecy and consulted closely with few of their colleagues until the last minute. This time, Mr. Nunn enlisted influential Republicans, including Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana and Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, to broaden political support for the resurrected measure.
"It's not a question of aid to the Soviet Union," Mr. Lugar said, trying to dispel the notion of a giveaway. "It's a question of destroying weapons that we've spent a very great deal of time, effort and defense money over the past to destroy."
Several senators also credited warnings of impending chaos in the Soviet Union from the United States Ambassador in Moscow, Robert Strauss, with helping to break the impasse.
Later the Senate agreed, on a voice vote, to give the Soviet Union enhanced trade status. The granting of most favored nation treatment for imports from the Soviet Union, approved last week by the House, comes 40 years after that status was revoked at the height of the cold war.
The Soviet assistance package for scrapping weapons, which also contains a provision to use Air Force planes to transport humanitarian aid, was attached to legislation that carries out the provisions of the treaty governing conventional forces in Europe.
The House has already approved a similar bill, minus the aid plan. Lawmakers will now negotiate a compromise version that is all but certain to include the Soviet assistance.

HEADLINE: U.S. BUILDING CAMP FOR HAITI REFUGEES

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The Bush Administration dispatched a military task force to the Caribbean tonight to erect an emergency refugee camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for thousands of Haitians who have fled the political turmoil in their country and whose exodus by boats to the United States has been blocked by the Coast Guard.
Led by Brig. Gen. George A. Walls Jr. of the Marines, the military group, made up of hundreds of troops from all four military services, is to build a tent city at the American base on the eastern tip of Cuba to handle the more than 4,000 Haitians rescued at sea thus far and the hundreds more fleeing each day. 
 A senior Pentagon official said today's action could be open-ended and the size of the tent city was as yet undetermined. "We need to unload the Coast Guard and Navy ships because they are overwhelmed right now," the official said, referring to the Haitians being plucked from the sea by United States vessels.
The sudden response by the Administration reflects growing concern at the unfolding refugee drama prompted in part by an American-supported trade embargo against Haiti seeking to reverse the overthrow of the country's first elected leader, the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide.
 
800 Plucked From Sea
 The emergency response came after more than 800 Haitians were plucked from small boats by Coast Guard cutters on Sunday, the largest daily rescue toll since the exodus began nearly a month ago. More than 2,300 Haitians were said to be aboard 10 Coast Guard cutters today and more refugees were in custody on ships at anchor off Guantanamo.
The Guantanamo naval base, located on the southeastern corner of Cuba, covers about 28,000 acres. A total of 3,400 U.S. personnel are stationed at the base, which was ceded to the United States under a 1903 treaty with Cuba. President Fidel Castro's Communist Government came to power in 1958.
A United States District Court order to suspend the forced repatriation of Haitian refugees temporarily also caught the Administration by surprise last week and has led to unfavorable comments about how its policy in Haiti conflicts with American policy in Southeast Asia, where the United States opposes Britian's attempt to forcibly repatriate Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong.
United States officials argue that most of the Haitian are economic refugees and do not qualify for political asylum in the United States. Moreover, American officials said they do not want to encourage a mass exodus by allowing the Haitians into Miami.
About 120 of the Haitians have been granted asylum, a State Department official said. In addition, the State Department said today that of the 538 Haitians whose repatriation was monitoried before the court order went into effect, none were harasssed or arrested as they cleared the port of return, collected a cash stipend from the Red Cross and returned home.
"To date, we have received no confirmed reports of mistreatment," a department statement said. "Since we began this program in 1981 we have had no indication that any Haitians have been persecuted for trying to leave Haiti."
 
Announcement Is Surprise
 The Pentagon did not appear anxious to take on the additional refugee mission and many officials were surprised by the abrupt announcement of the operation. General Walls is not expected to arrived in Guantanamo until Tuesday, but officials said it would not be difficult to start getting tents up within one day.
"Clearly the best thing would be if they didn't leave Haiti at all because it is dangerous on the high seas," the senior Pentagon official said, "The answer is not to empty the country out, but to solve the problem there."
But there was anything but positive news on the diplomatic front today, as mediation efforts between the ousted Father Aristide and a delegation of Haitian legislators meeting in the Colombian capital failed to make any progress on a rconciliation that would pave the way for the return of Father Aristide, who was deposed in a military coup on Sept. 30. The Organization of American States condemned the coup in an emergency meeting in Washington and on Oct. 8 imposed the trade embargo.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
For Bush, the Kemp Thing Reappears

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Jack Kemp rarely ran the ball when he was a quarterback. Now he has it and is running for daylight. The problem is, he's going in the opposite direction from the White House team.
This has made the former Buffalo Bill who runs the Department of Housing and Urban Development a hero among conservative Republicans and a heretic among top White House aides. 
So as Mr. Bush plummets in the polls, Mr. Kemp -- who is a former rival of the President and who is widely regarded as one of Mr. Bush's least favorite Cabinet members -- basks in the approval of much of the Republican Party. Just Saturday, 81 Republican House members wrote to the White House asking that Mr. Kemp be appointed the "domestic policy czar" of the Bush Administration.
This means that with the Republican Party in turmoil over economic and domestic policy and the political competence of the White House staff, Mr. Kemp has seized the moment and decided to defy convention by speaking up about his differences with the President and his top aides on economic policy.
 
A Loyal Soul?
 Mr. Kemp says he is the soul of loyalty. The President's men are not so sure. But in any event, Mr. Kemp has become the epicenter of an economics debate that one White House official describes as "a battle for the soul of the Administration."
Mr. Kemp favors "a growth package" that would include the kind of tax cuts that Mr. Bush supports in principle but not as an instant remedy. Mr. Bush and his top economic advisers favor hunkering down and waiting for the economy to get better on its own.
While Mr. Kemp has been careful to suggest that his ideas are also those of the President and not to criticize Mr. Bush, White House officials say Mr. Bush's chief of staff and his budget director are "very annoyed" that Mr. Kemp is "off the reservation."
Mr. Kemp's supporters say he is trying to save Mr. Bush, even if it means hurting his standing at the White House; his detractors say that Mr. Kemp, who challenged Mr. Bush in the Republican primaries in 1988, is simply trying to set himself up as the true heir to Ronald Reagan for the 1996 campaign.
The split got even more embarrassing for the President over the weekend when the letter signed by 81 of the 166 House Republicans was delivered to Mr. Bush. "We need one leader with the energy, enthusiasm and national clout to tackle our domestic agenda," said the letter, co-written by Representative Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania and Dan Burton of Indiana.
The "one leader" they wanted, it turned out, was not George Bush. "We must declare war on our domestic ills," the lawmakers wrote. "Jack Kemp is the man to lead that war."
 
'I'm Flattered'
 Those close to Mr. Kemp said the Secretary was informed about a month ago that the members wanted to get such a letter in the works, but that he never heard more about it. Representative Burton said the group did not tell Mr. Kemp they were sending the letter this weekend, for fear that he would be accused of conspiring to "feather his own nest," as Mr. Burton put it.
"I'm flattered but I'm somewhat embarrassed," Mr. Kemp said tonight about the letter. "In reality, I think the letter was sent out of frustration, a sense that there isn't enough attention being focused on the issue of growth and what it means to jobs and opportunity and the poor and the inner cities."
Although the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, was said to have dismissed the letter as "grandstanding" by the House Republicans, some others in the White House and the party saw it as one more warning that Mr. Bush is drifting into a vulnerable position.
"Obviously, this has only happened because Bush allowed there to be a perception of weakness," said Edward Rollins, a Republican consultant who was chairman of Mr. Kemp's Presidential campaign in 1988. "No one would have done this to Reagan, Nixon, Johnson, or even Carter."
Some of those who signed the letter say their criticism is aimed not at the President, but at Mr. Sununu and the budget director, Richard G. Darman, both of whom have been very unpopular on Capitol Hill since what has been widely perceived by House Republicans as their high-handed and inept lobbying attempts on behalf of the 1990 bipartisan budget deal.
Mr. Sununu, Mr. Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady tried to muzzle Mr. Kemp two weeks ago, after he went on the CBS television program "Face the Nation," and proposed "a joint Bush and Congressional tax rate reduction, not to bust the budget, but to get America growing again."
 
Views on Economy
 Mr. Brady called a meeting of the Economic Policy Council, and Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman told Mr. Kemp that everyone was expected to keep a low profile until the President announced his own economic plans in the State of the Union Message in January. A participant said Mr. Kemp told the President's men: "I will not stop talking about growth and jobs and opportunity and housing. That's what the President picked me for."
A few days later, Mr. Kemp was back on television, on the "Evans and Novak" program on Cable News Network, making the same activist arguments about the economy and tax cuts on behalf of Mr. Bush.
Mr. Kemp apparently is not worried. He feels liberated, his friends say, because, after an unhappy year struggling in vain with the White House and Senate to get through programs for his agency, he is finally speaking out about something in which he believes.
In a sentiment echoed by many disillusioned Republicans, Mr. Rollins said that the problem stems from the insistence by Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman to stick to the 1990 budget deal they struck.
"Darman and Sununu cannot admit that they made a significant mistake in 1990, that world events have changed and that that agreement from a year ago is now bad economic and political policy," Mr. Rollins said.
Mr. Kemp's friends also point out that in a way, now that he has gone public with his criticisms he has more leverage. They say the White House staff would not want to fire him and make him a martyr to conservatives before the primary in New Hampshire, where Mr. Kemp got 12 percent of the vote in 1988.
Asked about those who see his outspokenness as an effort to position himself as a Presidential candidate in 1996, Mr. Kemp said: "Gosh! If I didn't speak out about poor people and minorities, they would complain I was being silent in the face of their distress. If I do speak out, people say I'm trying to position myself. The only thing I can do is tell the truth as I see it and let the chips fall where they may."

HEADLINE: Casting Doubts: Economy Stinging Bush

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
A striking loss of confidence in President Bush's economic leadership is leading Americans to reassess the Bush Presidency, setting the stage for a competitive election next year, according to the latest nationwide New York Times/CBS News Poll.
Only one American in four now approves of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy, a level of discontent unmatched since the days of double-digit inflation under President Jimmy Carter. Mr. Bush's overall job approval rating is now at 51 percent, a drop of 16 percentage points since mid-October. The declines seemed to reflect a month of bad economic news and turmoil in the White House. 
 Mr. Bush can take comfort from the fact that his overall approval rating is still well above the lows reached by Presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. Also, such ratings of Presidential popularity often swing sharply, and past incumbents with similar or lower ratings have gone on to win.
 
A Close Hypothetical Race
 Still, for the first time in the Times/CBS News Poll, Americans are evenly divided when offered a choice between re-electing Mr. Bush or some unnamed Democrat: 39 percent of registered voters said they would probably vote for Mr. Bush, while 37 percent said they would probably vote for the Democrat, according to the telephone survey of 1,106 adults, of whom 840 were registered voters.
Support for Mr. Bush's re-election has undergone a striking erosion among voters from the age of 30 to 44; among middle-income voters, earning $30,000 to $50,000; and among voters in the West.
These are all considered important swing voters in any Presidential election, and they are voters the Democrats are scrambling to peel away with promises of tax cuts and a new sensitivity to the middle class.
While Americans seem ready to give the Democratic Party a hearing, the poll indicates that they know little about the six major candidates vying for the party's nomination. More that half of those who said they planned to vote in the Democratic primaries said they did not have a favorite candidate.
The poll was conducted Nov. 18-22 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for the total sample, and five percentage points for respondents who said they usually vote in Democratic primaries or caucuses.
Recent history suggests other caveats for the Democrats: Ronald Reagan's approval rating was at 53 percent in a Gallup poll at this stage of his Presidency, but he went on to win 49 states against former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic nominee. President Richard M. Nixon was at 48 percent in the summer of 1971, 18 months before his landslide over George S. McGovern, and Harry S. Truman was at 36 percent in the spring of 1948, just months before his re-election.
Still, an election that seemed a formality last spring in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war, when Mr. Bush had a record 88 percent approval rating, now seems very real.
 
Indifference and Glee
 Charles Black, a top Republican adviser, said the President's decline in popularity in the poll was only to be expected. "There's no doubt that the economic frustration and pessimism are growing and he's been in a political slump," Mr. Black said. The Republican adviser said there was ample time to correct the President's problems, and noted that Mr. Bush would not be running against a generic, idealized Democrat next year. Unlike real Democrats, "that's something that has no negatives attached to it," said Mr. Black.
Democrats were gleeful at the latest poll results. "This is what free fall looks like," said Paul Tully, political director for the Democratic National Committee. "He wasn't elected to blame and scapegoat and pass the buck. They saw him do things back in the spring, with the war in the gulf, and they're asking, 'Where did that guy go?' "
The latest poll shows a public unconvinced by the Administration's contention that the recession is over and the recovery is under way. When asked to rate the condition of the economy, 74 percent said it was "fairly bad" or "very bad," while 24 percent said it was "very good" or "fairly good."
This measure of economic pessimism had risen 10 percentage points over the past month alone, and was the highest level recorded since the Times/CBS poll began asking this question five years ago.
 
'Better Off?' 'No'
 In another measure of discontent, 39 percent of Americans now say they are "worse off" than they had expected to be at this stage in their lives, while just 16 percent said they were better off. In contrast, in January 1986, when the Times/CBS poll began asking this question, 20 percent said they were worse off than they expected to be, while 38 percent said they were better off.
These findings are ominous for a party whose political strength rests to a large extent on its competence in managing the economy -- a party that returned to power in 1980 with Mr. Reagan's memorable question, "Are you better off today than you were four years ago?"
The level of approval for Mr. Bush's economic stewardship, 25 percent, is lower than any reading taken by the Times/CBS poll during the Reagan Administration, and 8 percentage points lower than in mid-October. Mr. Reagan's low point was 35 percent, and occurred in the recession in August 1982 and again in January 1983. The last time Americans gave an economic approval rating equal to or lower than Mr. Bush's was in July 1979, when just 15 percent said they approved of the way Mr. Carter was handling the economy.
Over the past month, one of the most significant erosions in Mr. Bush's economic approval rating occurred among Americans earning $30,000 and above.
Mr. Bush's overall approval rating, at 51 percent, essentially ties the lowest previous reading of his Presidency, in October 1990. Then as now, it was economics that was front and center, as Mr. Bush struggled to reach a budget agreement with Congress.
Mr. Bush's political appeal has long been tied to his foreign policy expertise, and while his approval rating dropped here as well, it is still at a healthy level for most Presidents, 57 percent.
Like many of the political professionals, the public seems to be reassessing just how competitive next year's election will be: 47 percent said they expected Mr. Bush would "definitely be re-elected President," while 42 percent said they agreed that "a Democratic candidate can win the election." A month ago, only 26 percent said the Democrats had a chance.
But the field of candidates remains little known, and the contest is still unsettled because of uncertainty about the plans of Governor Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who has yet to announce whether or not he will run next year. When likely Democratic primary voters were asked to choose among the six announced major candidates, 56 percent said they did not have a favorite; 11 percent chose former Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr., and the rest were in single digits.
When Mr. Cuomo was added to the list, he was the choice of 26 percent. Nearly half said they thought Mr. Cuomo should run for President, while 26 percent said he should not.
On another matter, only 7 percent in this survey said they had a favorable impression of David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan who ran unsuccessfully for Governor in Louisiana and is now considering a Presidential campaign next year; 56 percent said they had an unfavorable view. Just eight percent of those who identified themselves as registered voters said they would consider voting for Mr. Duke.

Based on nationwide telephone interviews with 1,106 adults conducted Nov. 18-22.
 
How the Survey Was Taken
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Nov. 18 to 22 with 1,106 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that calls would be placed to residences only. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for those who say they vote in Democratic primaries or caucuses, it is plus or minus five percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. (pg. A18)

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Congressional leaders in both parties are trying to adjourn this session by Tuesday night or early Wednesday, if they can complete action on a few remaining issues in both houses.
As this rancorous session seems to have run out of legislative steam, leaving town before Thanksgiving has been an increasingly attractive objective. Out of Washington, the lawmakers will rest, hold hearings, raise campaign money and generally plan for the next Congressional session as well as next fall's elections. 
 Moreover, only a credible deadline for getting home is generally considered to be a sufficient incentive to win passage of unpopular legislation like the bills replenishing the fund that insures deposits at banks and refinancing the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is managing the savings and loan bailout.
The most important other item on the short "must" list -- which means that failure to enact the measures would almost certainly bring Congress back to work in December -- is the $151 billion transportation program. Because that bill translates immediately into construction jobs, it is considered an economic and political necessity.
The compromise crime bill is regarded by most leaders as a step below the others in importance.
Some House Republicans have demanded that Congress remain in session to work on a package of tax cuts to spur economic growth, but Democrats have said they would only do so if President Bush asked them to stay, and he has not.
Any measures left unfinished will remain on the agenda for the second session of the 102d Congress in January.

HEADLINE: A Quick Trip to Columbus Provides Bush With a Break From Frustration

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 25

 BODY:
President Bush left behind the frustrations of the big economic picture today for the small-scale politics that he loves: shaking the hands of local dignitaries, watching pre-school children play "Fish Derby" on a computer and exclaiming as high school students drew fake blood from artificial arms with real needles.
Accompanied by Education Secretary Lamar Alexander, Mr. Bush swooped down on Columbus in his Boeing 747 for less than four hours. He sped through a visit to the Fort Hayes Metropolitan Education Center, a speech in a Veterans Memorial Auditorium filled with sleepy high school students and interviews with local television reporters. 
 After weeks in which Mr. Bush has tried to grapple with national economic and political problems in an effort to counter the impression that he is not engaged on domestic issues, today's trip, the first of four he will take around the country before Christmas, reflected a return to an older White House strategy of selling the President in small groups and to local news outlets.
 
The Value of 'Micro-Events'
 Mr. Bush's press and political advisers concluded early in his Administration that one of the President's greatest strengths is his ability to perform in "micro-events" like the ones today, which give him a chance to portray the avuncular President, not the partisan infighter who battles with Congress.
On today's trip, each of Mr. Bush's events seemed little more than a chance to appear before television cameras with friendly people or before a hospitable audience. For Mr. Bush, those must have been especially welcome opportunities at a time when the White House has been reeling from attacks by Congressional Democrats, Mr. Bush's sagging standing in public opinion polls and missteps by top members of his staff.
One of those aides, John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, who often travels with Mr. Bush, stayed in Washington today. The former New Hampshire Governor, who had undergone a bruising week in which there were new rumors that he was in trouble with the President, made a point of appearing at the White House on Sunday evening with his wife, Nancy, and one of their children, to greet Mr. Bush on his return from Camp David.
 
Computers and Dinosaurs
 In Columbus, Mr. Bush visited a child-care center at the Fort Hayes experimental education complex, where high school students in blue smocks were seated with their small charges at low tables in a room decorated with paper turkeys and a big sign welcoming the President.
Mr. Bush went from table to table, stopping for only a minute or two at each. At the first table, he smiled for the cameras as a teen-ager worked with four children who were identifying sounds that she played on a tape recorder.
The President put on his reading glasses at the next table to look at a colorful computer screen on which a small girl was playing "Fish Derby," a game involving different types of fish. He proclaimed his delight at a group of children who were gluing bits of colored paper in holiday designs and then encouraged two boys and a girl who were working at a small table filled with sand.
"You dug up a dinosaur," he told one proud little boy.
With a quick wave and a cry of "Good to see you guys," Mr. Bush went off to another room, where high school students were being trained as medical technicians.
Mr. Bush used the stop, where he watched two students push needles into false arms as an exercise in how to safely draw blood, as an example of what he said is the "flexibility" of his own education programs.
 
Echoes of the Campaign Trail
 Later, in a speech to an auditorium filled with high school students, Mr. Bush sounded more than ever as if he was on the campaign trail, although he has yet to formally announce his candidacy for re-election. He thanked more than a dozen people for their help in organizing the event and made a point of thanking the high school band that played "Hail to the Chief."
Seemingly mindful of the political trouble the President has been having, Gov. George V. Voinovich, a Republican, introduced Mr. Bush to the audience as "a President who cares deeply for the children of this nation" and "a President who has shown us the way through his unprecedented historic leadership."
The President's speech was devoted to a promotion of his "America 2000" education program, which Ohio joined today, providing a ceremonial occasion for the visit and thus making it possible for the White House to call it an official trip and not a campaign stop.
"Our schools were designed for another era," he said. "They must catch up with the times. We want you to have good lives and good jobs when you are adults."
White House advisers are counting on quick, small-scale trips like this one to help Mr. Bush send his message to voters. But the atmosphere seemed almost contrived at some of the stops, including his speech, during which at least a third of the high school students were clearly asleep in the overheated auditorium, waking up only to applaud politely.
Mr. Bush did not get through the day without a reminder of his larger problems. At the Fort Hayes laboratory classroom, a reporter shouted, "Mr. President, are you going to be able to stop the bleeding at the White House?"
Looking chagrined, Mr. Bush turned to the students, jerked his thumb over his shoulder at the reporters and said with a small laugh, "That's the way I make my living."

HEADLINE: Buchanan Seeks 'None of the Above' Vote in New Hampshire

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Nov. 22

 BODY:
Karen Hutchinson, a New Hampshire state legislator, has a message that she would like to send President Bush. She could send him a note, or even call his office, but she thinks she has found a more effective way to communicate her discontent.
"I am voting for Pat Buchanan in the primary," she said. "It's a protest vote." 
Ms. Hutchinson said she did not believe the President really understood how bad the economy here was. New Hampshire's unemployment rate, almost 7 percent in September, is the highest it has been since 1976.
"I think Bush has blinders on," Ms. Hutchinson said. "He's not seeing and he's not listening."
Last week, Mr. Buchanan, a conservative columnist and a former aide to President Ronald Reagan, said that he was giving serious consideration to entering the New Hampshire Republican primary but that he would not make a final decision until after Thanksgiving. Without even putting himself on the ballot, Mr. Buchanan already appears to have won a substantial following among many unhappy Republicans in New Hampshire.
 
Going for the Disgruntled
 Even supporters of the President are warning that Mr. Buchanan could make a strong showing here, and deal a significant public relations setback to Mr. Bush, simply by winning the state's disgruntled vote.
"I've already told the White House that they better get their act in gear up here," said Gordon Humphrey, a New Hampshire state senator who supports Mr. Bush. "Anyone who is running is going to get a big protest vote over the economy."
This protest vote, Mr. Humphrey predicted, could amount to as much as 40 percent of the total. "That," he said, "would be highly embarrassing for the President."
Many Republicans here and in Washington give Mr. Buchanan virtually no chance of winning the Presidency and say that what his candidacy represents is an effort to gain control of the party's conservative wing and to position himself for 1996.
But people close to Mr. Buchanan insist that his will not be a symbolic candidacy and that if he does enter the race, he will run a credible campaign against the President. They are not at all shy, though, about acknowledging that Mr. Buchanan's goal is to reassert the dominance of the Republican Party's right wing.
"He has said literally that this is an effort to take back the party, to release it from the kind of Rockefeller Republicans who control it now," said Greg Mueller, an aide to Mr. Buchanan. He said Mr. Buchanan would consider 10 percent to 15 percent of the primary vote here to be a good showing.
 
Other Challenges?
 Mr. Buchanan is not the only politician who could reap the benefits of an angry electorate. David Duke, the one-time Ku Klux Klan leader who recently lost a runoff for Louisiana governor, has said he, too, is exploring the possibility of running against President Bush.
Some analysts say that a bid by Mr. Duke would hurt Mr. Buchanan because the two would be lumped together as right-wing extremists. Mr. Buchanan appears to be anxious about any association with Mr. Duke, and recently went so far as to denounce "White House mites" who, he said, were trying to link him to the ex-Klansman.
But here in New Hampshire, a state so conservative that it is not uncommon to hear President Bush branded as a "liberal," Republicans insist there is no danger that Mr. Buchanan's brand of rightist politics will be confused with Mr. Duke's.
"We make a big distinction up here between Buchanan and Duke," said Hugh Gregg, a former Governor of New Hampshire whose son, Judd, now holds the office. "I can't think of a single Republican activist out there working for Duke, but I can think of several working for Buchanan."
Paul Nagy, a data processor who has devoted himself full-time to conservative politics since he was laid off last year by the state, is one of the Republicans laying the groundwork for a Buchanan campaign in New Hampshire. Mr. Nagy said he had not yet had time to make calls soliciting support.
"I've been too busy returning calls from people asking what they can do to help Pat," he said. "There just seems to be an outpouring."
 
Voices for Buchanan
 Indeed, Mr. Buchanan does seem to enjoy strong support among New Hampshire Republicans. In random interviews with Republicans who said they planned to vote in the primary, almost half said that if the election were held now, they would vote for Mr. Buchanan.
Thomas Maurice, a planner for an electric company, said he would vote for Mr. Buchanan just to vote against Mr. Bush. "I just don't think he really realizes what's going on," Mr. Maurice said. "I'm not very happy with the way the economy's going."
Bruce Gamsby, an engineer, said he would vote for Mr. Buchanan because "it sends a message" to the President. "I want to reinforce the idea that his base is derived from the right," he said.
If the prospect of a heavy protest vote is not enough to trouble the President, many politicians here say, the championing of Mr. Buchanan by The Union Leader should be.
 
An Influential Ally
 The Manchester newspaper, one of the nation's quirkiest and most conservative, is the only one in New Hampshire with statewide circulation. Studies by a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, David Moore, suggest that its cheerleading for Mr. Reagan was instrumental in helping him defeat Mr. Bush in the 1980 New Hampshire primary.
In recent weeks, the paper has taken up the cause of Mr. Buchanan in front-page editorials, urging him to challenge Mr. Bush and his "disastrous course of accommodation with the implacable liberal Democratic opposition."
On Friday, it ran an editorial denouncing Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York as "a sissy," and another praising Mr. Buchanan for being a "true believer in the mainstream conservatism that the President chose to disavow when he reneged on his 'no new taxes' pledge and signed on to a civil rights bill that deprives the accused of even the basic presumption of innocence."
Mr. Buchanan "will have an impact all right," Mr. Gregg, the former Governor, said, "because The Manchester Union Leader will support him."

HEADLINE: Behind Jobless Figures, A Rise in Poor Children

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
A disproportionate number of Americans who are losing jobs during the recession are under 25 years old, a study by a children's advocacy group says, adding that the trend threatens to push more children into poverty.
All in all, more than 1 million of the 1.2 million jobs that workers lost since the recession began in July 1990 were lost by workers 16 to 24 years old, according to the study, which was released today by the Children's Defense Fund and the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston. 
 "Job losses among young workers, often the parents of America's youngest and most vulnerable children, are creating a devastating cycle of declining earnings, declining family incomes and rising child poverty," said Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund.
Even though the recession did not start until mid-1990, 841,000 children were pushed into poverty last year, the Defense Fund said. In all, more than 13 million American children were living in poverty last year, it said.
In 1990 a family of four was considered to be living in poverty if the household's annual income was $13,359 or less. In 1989 the standard was $12,675.
The report, based on Labor Department statistics, noted that while hundreds of thousands of workers 25 years old and older have lost their jobs in the recession, those losses have been offset by the creation of jobs for other workers in the same age group. But there have been no such offsetting gains among workers 24 years of age and younger.
Douglas Besharov, a researcher with the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington study center that specializes in social policy, said he was skeptical that the net job loss for younger workers would amount to such a large chunk of the overall number of jobs lost since the recession began.
"I'm surprised at the report because it says the net job losses have been suffered almost totally by young workers," he said. "I thought the unemployment caused by the recession was much more widespread than that."
But Mr. Besharov added: "Young people, especially those who've dropped out of school, have been having a progressively tougher time in our economy. They have the lowest seniority and the lowest educational attainment, and many of them are competing with low-wage workers around the world for jobs."
James Weill, general counsel of the Defense Fund, said the losses could be accounted for by young workers who have lost low-paying jobs in the service industries.
The group recommended that Congress enact a children's tax credit to reduce taxes for middle- and low-income families.
Mr. Besharov, of the American Enterprise Institute, said he believed more money should be pumped into the country's schools.
"If we look at the nature of the underlying trend, which is fewer opportunities for those with lower educational levels, then we would realize we ought to be spending money and improving their schools so that they can compete in what has become a post-industrial Western economy," he said.

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH

 BODY:

American St. Tropez?
Greetings from Miami Beach, America's hottest new style center, where you can barely walk down the street without running into camera crews, models, hairdressers and fashion editors. It's practically fashion gridlock.
There was Jenny Capitain, a fashion director of Vogue, towing a group of hairdressers, stylists and the model Elaine Irwin (the one with the blond hair and black eyebrows), for a fashion shoot over the weekend. 
 Or Bruce Weber, the photographer, down to do some Ralph Lauren ads. Or Frederic Fekkai, the New York hairstylist, exchanging bon mots at Brasserie Le Coze, a branch of Le Bernardin that opened in Coconut Grove two weeks ago.
For all its reputation as a tacky retirement place, Miami Beach is emerging as an American St. Tropez, with new boutiques, chic restaurants and a rare blend of beauty, talent and converging cultures.
In addition to the wonderful light, which makes winter catalogue photography a piece of cake, the big draw has been the distinctive Art Deco hotels along Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue, streamlined odes to the last stylish American architecture before the numbing sameness of Bauhaus set in.
The South Beach area of Miami is a visual dream. Everything is pink and aqua and coral and sapphire, soothing by day and electric with neon by night. Against this backdrop unfolds a polyglot style parade like nowhere else: fresh-faced teen-age models in linen sundresses; tattooed bikers in studded leathers; ponytailed executives who look as if they've been lightly brushed with olive oil; sunburned Germans and Scandinavians in black nylon socks and sandals.
Tara Gilani, a Miami writer, calls it Touro-Style, a variation on Euro-Style, but based on local fashions and the influx of foreign tourists.
"You get everything from Linda Evangelista, fresh from the Milan collections, wearing a T-shirt, Levi's and a baseball cap," Ms. Gilani said, "to what I call a 'full Cleveland.' " That, she said, is a man at least 50, visiting from the Midwest, wearing white patent-leather shoes, white belt and white slacks with a colorful polyester shirt and sunburned head.
The amount of skin people show on the beach and on the street seems to be inversely proportional to how in shape they are. Large-bellied men seem to prefer to wear bikini-style briefs or even string pouches. Chiseled young men go for baggy surfer jams, almost to the knee.
The notorious thong bikini is more popular than one would expect, given the obvious visual hazards. People wear beach clothes on the street as well as coordinated exercise clothes. "Anywhere there is a big husband market, people wear expensive exercise clothes," said Susannah Shubin, the fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.
 
They Call It Agency Row
 So many modeling agencies line Ocean Drive, a 15-block strip of Art Deco buildings facing the beach, that one area is now called Agency Row.
Models sun themselves topless between shoots across the street at Glamour Beach. And the scene has attracted a new genre of nighttime barflies: the "causeway crowd," people who travel over the bridges linking Miami Beach with the mainland, the equivalent of New York's "bridge and tunnel people."
Zoli Management opened an office in the Park Central Hotel, a blue jewel right on the beach that also houses a branch of the TriBeca restaurant Barocco. Ford Models recently moved into offices above the popular News Cafe, a 24-hour beachfront restaurant that is perpetually jammed. Just down the street is Michele Pommier, one of several thriving local agencies.
"After Thanksgiving, there's no light in Europe, no leaves on the trees up north," said Colleen Goujjane, a booking executive at Zoli, explaining the Miami fashion phenomenon. "You know, this whole thing was started by Germans, who came here to shoot spring and summer catalogues, and ended up investing in real estate."
This is also the land of "baby girls," or models who have barely reached puberty.
"They start them at 12," said Justin Greenberg, a stylist. "I had a job with a 12-year-old recently. You could hardly talk to her. But if she's tall and wears women's sizes, she can get work."
Agency executives said their one concern was that editors would get tired of using Miami backdrops.
"Nothing at the beach, nothing at the hotels," proclaimed Ms. Capitain of Vogue, as she ate lunch with her crew by the Ritz Plaza pool. "I've done it all a thousand times."
 
Retailing's Latin Beat
 Miami has been called the northernmost city in Latin America. Along with its large expatriate Cuban population, the city is home to many wealthy Venezuelans, Colombians and Argentines whose spending power has shaped the retailing scene.
At Dadeland, one of the largest and most successful malls in Miami, 75 percent of purchases are made by Latin Americans, a recent article in The Miami Herald said. Nearly all the salespeople at Dadeland's Saks Fifth Avenue store are bilingual.
Hispanic clients represent about 60 percent of business at Martha, a branch of the New York store in Bal Harbour. Business in Miami has been good, retail executives said, but the recession is being felt.
"It has started, but it came much later than in New York," said Rosemarie Weisburger, the manager of the Martha store in Bal Harbour. "The high-priced merchandise moves slower."

HEADLINE: As a Double Opening Nears, A Studio Head Has the Jitters

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Nov. 25

 BODY:
As the holiday season approaches, are Mike Medavoy and the Sony Corporation about to enter Never-Neverland?
Mr. Medavoy is the chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, the studio that is producing "Hook," one of the year's most expensive and widely anticipated films, and "Bugsy," a risky and costly love story about a gangster and his moll. 
 For Sony, which owns Tri-Star as well as Columbia Pictures, the two movies are a chance to show that the company's multi-billion-dollar investment in the film industry is finally paying off. Their failure, on the other hand, could well shake confidence in Sony, whose huge investment in Hollywood has already been widely criticized as profligate.
"Hook," the Steven Spielberg extravaganza about a grown-up Peter Pan, stars Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts; it is to open on Dec. 11. "Bugsy," a Barry Levinson film with Warren Beatty as the doomed gangster Bugsy Siegel and Annette Bening as his girlfriend, opens two days later.
Mr. Medavoy, 50 years old, who has been the chairman of Tri-Star since early 1990, is very much in the spotlight in the insular, intensely competitive and often backbiting upper echelons of Hollywood. The success of the two movies would cement his position as one of the top executives in town. Failure -- ever present in Hollywood -- would leave him vulnerable.
"If both of these pictures are a bust, a lot of people will be unhappy, including me," Mr. Medavoy said with a smile.
"I hadn't been nervous until recently," he said in his elegant conference room at Sony Pictures Entertainment in Culver City. "I wasn't nervous during the process of making 'Hook.' But as we get closer to the opening date, it does provoke a certain nervousness. There are nights when I've lost sleep. But I know it's no longer up to me."
 
Equal Time for 'Bugsy'?
 The mounting intensity surrounding "Hook" was underlined today as weekly Variety reported that not only was the studio spending huge amounts of money to promote the fantasy adventure, but also that the makers of "Bugsy" felt short-changed by the studio. Both films are competing for advertising, theaters and promotion, Variety said, and "Bugsy" seems to be losing out.
There is also some concern among some Sony executives that audiences are weary of gangster movies -- especially after the flop "Billy Bathgate," starring Dustin Hoffman -- and that Mr. Beatty is miscast in "Bugsy." "The film is a love story about a man who had the vision to invent Las Vegas," Mr. Medavoy said. "It's not a traditional gangster story. We didn't even think of 'Billy Bathgate' when we designed the campaign."
Mr. Medavoy, a cherubic, 50-year-old executive with a fringe of red hair, spoke carefully this morning about the two movies. "I think the people from the 'Bugsy' set know we're giving a lot of attention to that movie," he said. "Each film has its own dynamic. 'Hook,' in some ways, is its own phenomenon. We can't go out and create a hype. We haven't. It's there."
 
Big Spending
 It is the finances of "Hook" that have, in some ways, stirred the most talk. The film will need to take in enormous amounts of money for the studio to earn a profit. Although the costs of the movie -- not including the salaries of Mr. Spielberg and the three stars -- have been estimated at $70 million, Tri-Star executives insist that the figure is closer to $62 million, but advertising and publicity will account for millions more. "Bugsy," on the other hand, cost about $32 million.
On "Hook," the studio, under a complex deal negotiated by the Creative Artists Agency, has agreed to give an unusually high 40 percent of the initial gross proceeds to Mr. Spielberg and the three leading actors. A number of film executives insist that the film must gross $120 million from all sources -- including the studio's share of box-office receipts as well as video sales and foreign rights -- to break even. To start making a profit, these executives insist, the movie will have to gross as much as such successes as "Rocky," "City Slickers" and "Total Recall."
Mr. Medavoy insists that the movie makes economic sense. "It's obvious that there are some special circumstances where certain movies, event-type movies, while risky, are worth making," he said.
Another reason, other executives say, is that while the film most certainly is financially risky, Sony is delighted at the notion of a splashy, big-budget Steven Spielberg movie underwritten, essentially, by the Japanese company. Mr. Spielberg is one of the most popular film makers among Japanese moviegoers, and Sony expects "Hook" to be a big success there.
So far, "Hook," and "Bugsy" have been kept under wraps by the company, although in recent days there have been some screenings. Many major exhibitors saw "Hook" last Friday, editors and writers from news magazines saw it last week and a preview audience saw it in Dallas. Early word on the film, which runs about 2 hours and 15 minutes, has been positive.
 
Responsibility on 2 Fronts
 Mr. Medavoy has a moderately good track record. In some ways, he is a member of a rather exclusive club of men who have dominated the film industry for the last decade, moving from lucrative job to lucrative job as studio chiefs regardless of their accomplishments.
Formerly a top agent, he has a reputation for leaving creative film makers alone and is especially popular among directors like Woody Allen, who is making a new film at Tri-Star. Earlier, as part of the senior management team at United Artists and then Orion Pictures for a total of 16 years, Mr. Medavoy played a central role in creating hits including "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Rocky," "Annie Hall," "The Sting," "Amadeus" and "Platoon."
But as one of the founders of Orion, he is also sensitive to accusations that his creative decisions involving films that failed may have played a role in the financial turmoil engulfing that studio.
"That's really unfair," he said. But he added: "I do bear a certain amount of responsibility under very difficult circumstances, both of the positive side as well as the negative."
Mr. Medavoy has a reputation for being a secure executive in a wholly insecure business, a man who does not have the sharklike qualities of some of his rivals. His background is relatively unusual. He was born in Shanghai to Russian immigrant parents, and moved to Chile with his family when he was 7 years old. He later majored in history at the University of California in Los Angeles and, while a student, began working in the mailroom of Universal Studios. As an agent with International Famous Agency, a predecessor of International Creative Management, he represented clients who included the directors Mr. Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, George Cukor, Phil Kaufman and Terence Malick.
In looking ahead to prospects for his two upcoming movies, Mr. Medavoy said the unexpected success of "The Addams Family," about a ghoulish family, was a positive omen. Paramount Pictures said the film grossed a huge $24.2 million this weekend.
"Business this past weekend was 7 percent above business at the same time last year," he said. "It augurs well for us, doesn't it?"

HEADLINE: City Wants Previews Labeled, but Producers Balk

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The city's Department of Cultural Affairs announced yesterday that it would meet with representatives of Broadway and Off Broadway producers next Tuesday to resolve a dispute about whether shows that have not yet been reviewed by critics should be clearly labeled as previews in advertisements.
Mark Green, the Consumer Affairs Commissioner, issued a warning letter to two producers' groups last Wednesday, saying, "Consumers are entitled to know exactly what they are buying when they purchase theater tickets." 
 Since ticket prices for previews and for performances after the opening are often the same, "Consumers should be put on notice when they are seeing a work-in-progress as opposed to a finished product," Mr. Green wrote.
He cited ads for the Broadway productions "Nick and Nora" and "The Crucible" that did not use the word "preview" or mention the official opening dates: Dec. 8 for "Nick and Nora," Dec. 10 for "The Crucible."
Mr. Green's letter said that if advertisements in the future did not declare that a play was in previews, and the date of the official opening, the department would impose fines of up to $500 per ad, "as well as restitution for aggrieved consumers." But the department said it would not take action until after next week's meeting.
 
Intervention Questioned
 Spokesmen for the League of American Theaters and Producers and for the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers, the two groups warned by Mr. Green, questioned the application of consumer fraud statutes to theater producers' marketing decisions.
"Where does it say the government can intervene in our industry's ability to freely promote its shows?" said Harvey Sabinson, executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers.
He said that Broadway previews cost more than regular performances because of the additional expense of daytime rehearsals and overtime for backstage workers. "The economics of the business often makes full-priced previews necessary," Mr. Sabinson said.
He added that he had asked The New York Times and other newspapers to lower the cost of their ads for previews, but that "they charge the same for previews, too."
Daniel Brambilla, an attorney for the league, said: "The next thing they'll be doing is ask us to publish the bad reviews. It's absurd. There is nothing deceptive about this. It's been going on for decades."
George Elmer, secretary-treasurer of the League of Off-Broadway Theaters, said that Mr. Green's letter opened up "the prospect of ever more intervention by government."
"Will the owner of a new restaurant now be required to say that the restaurant is in previews until it has been commented on by food critics?" Mr. Elmer asked.
Linda Sachs, the assistant commissioner of Consumer Affairs, responded. "I can't believe that a Broadway producer would compare a theater production to a plate of food," she said, and added that the lack of a preview designation would fall under the deceptive-trade-practices provisions of Section 20-701, Provision 2, of the New York City Consumer Protection Law.
Mr. Sabinson expressed surprise that Mr. Green would issue a threatening letter without any advance notice or consultation with the league. He said the city should be trying to support the theater industry in a time of economic recession instead of issuing reprimands. "After all," he said, "there has been no public outcry on this matter."
Ms. Sachs said that the agency had received no consumer complaints about unlabeled previews, but was responding "to complaints that were reported in the media." She mentioned a column by Linda Winer, the Newsday writer, protesting unlabeled theater previews.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Seeks Deeper Cuts In Fiscal Plan

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 25

 BODY:
In an announcement with implications for both state and national politics, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo called on the Legislature today to return to Albany immediately to make deep spending cuts aimed at closing a state budget gap he said had now grown to about $875 million.
Mr. Cuomo declared at an afternoon news conference that time had run out on his negotiations with the Legislature over an unusual multiyear budget plan. That plan was intended to close in a single step both the $875 million gap in this year's $30 billion budget and next year's projected gap of $4 billion, theoretically making it easier for Mr. Cuomo to run for President. 
 Although in his public comments, Mr. Cuomo seemed to abandon discussion of a multiyear plan, some legislative aides said they saw today's events as part of a calculated strategy to revive the negotiations. By proposing an alternative plan with something to offend virtually every lobbyist in Albany, Mr. Cuomo incited a riot of public reaction that will spread quickly to the offices of the state's 211 legislators.
 
Igniting Voter Discontent
 The legislators are up for re-election next November, and legislative leaders have paid close attention to the anti-incumbent sentiment registered by voters in elections earlier this month. Sometimes with gallows humor, top legislators said today that they dread the prospect of igniting voter discontent by cutting state aid to schools, firing hundreds of state workers and possibly forcing local governments to raise property taxes.
Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, a Democrat, took a break from his Federal fraud trial in Brooklyn to assess Mr. Cuomo's proposal. "I don't know what's worse," Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview, "jail or this."
Mr. Cuomo, who has repeatedly linked New York's fiscal situation to his ability to run for President, said little about what impact today's fiscal developments would have on his deliberations.
"I don't know how to calculate it," Mr. Cuomo said. "This has to come first."
 
Excruciating Process
 But the Governor predicted that passage of a revised budget would be an excruciating process that would then have to be duplicated early next year to close the gap in the 1992-93 budget.
"I suspect that doing it in two steps, at least, will prove more than twice as difficult," Mr. Cuomo said. "But I am left with no choice but to insist that we deal separately with our immediate problem."
Mr. Cuomo called on the Legislature to return to Albany as soon as Friday, but aides to Mr. Miller and the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, said it would be impractical to convene a special session the day after Thanksgiving.
In proposing his deficit reduction plan, Mr. Cuomo raised the amount of the budget gap projected for the fiscal year that ends on March 31, to $875 million. His budget office had released an estimate of $689 million in late October.
The Governor then published an austere plan to close the gap without raising taxes.
Mr. Cuomo's budget director, Patrick J. Bulgaro, estimated that the Governor's plan would cut $1 of every $5 remaining in the budget that is not legally required to pay interest on debts, entitlements for the poor and benefits for state workers.
The Governor's latest proposal would cut state aid to schools by $256 million, with the cuts for each school district averaging 3 percent of its total state aid package. No school district would bear a cut that would reduce its overall annual budget by more than 1.5 percent. That cut would come after the state's school aid budget has been cut by $660 million to $8.32 billion in the last 11 months.
Lawmakers warned that local property taxes might have to be raised to make up for the cuts.
New York City would lose $95 million in school aid, contributing to a net loss of $110 million for the city. The city's budget director, Philip R. Michael, said the burden for absorbing the cuts would be spread across city government.
Mr. Cuomo proposed that Medicaid and other social service programs be cut by $214 million through a variety of measures. The largest would save $100 million by indefinitely delaying one of the state's weekly Medicaid reimbursement payments to hospitals, doctors and other health-care providers.
Other savings would be generated by imposing co-payments for some Medicaid services, by limiting the number of hours that Medicaid recipients can receive personal care services, by eliminating dental services for adults from Medicaid coverage, and delaying increases in reimbursement rates for nursing homes and hospitals.
Mr. Cuomo also proposed to save $21 million through a complex mechanism that could lead private insurance companies to pass on increased costs to consumers. The Governor said he would double the state reimbursement differential that allows Blue Cross/Blue Shield to pay health-care providers at cost, while forcing private insurers to pay higher rates. The state would keep the money generated by the higher rates.
Mr. Cuomo's plan would eliminate 1,500 state jobs by April, including 500 through layoffs. During the next fiscal year, the Governor has proposed trimming the workforce by 6,000 employees, requiring up to 1,200 layoffs.
The Governor abandoned the idea of a three-day furlough for state workers after negotiations broke down with unions representing state employees. He proposed a 3 percent reduction in the budgets of the Executive Branch, the Legislature and the Judiciary.
Even these severe cuts would not close the budget gap completely. Mr. Cuomo said the state would have to borrow for the fourth consecutive year to close a deficit, this time by selling $95 million in short-term deficit notes.
The plan drew quick criticism from the state's legislative leaders, who retreated to their traditional positions on fiscal issues.
The Senate majority leader, Mr. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, L.I., said the plan did not go far enough to control spending on social services.
"I will not agree to any deficit reduction plan that cuts our schools and raises local property taxes in order to pay for uncontrolled growth in Medicaid and other social welfare programs," he said in a statement.
Mr. Miller, meanwhile, suggested that the social services cuts were too deep. "The Assembly continues to believe that the deficit cannot be closed solely by cuts in services for the elderly, the poor and the middle class, those most adversely affected by the national recession," the Brooklyn Democrat said.
It was the same fundamental difference that caused the breakdown of the talks on the multiyear budget, even though all sides endorsed the general concept of a two-year budget.

HEADLINE: Yes, Subway Nirvana Does Exist: Just Go to Newark

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
People have said for 20 years that wherever urban America is heading, Newark would get there first. Would that it were true in mass transit.
Through the heart of this city, commonly associated with images of urban despair, runs one of the country's most pleasant and efficient subways -- and one of the least well known. 
 "Completely charming" is how one commuter, Bob Hartman, a graphic designer, described the city subway. "Quaint," "clean" and "safe," said another user, Robert Salazar, a student at the Newark branch of Rutgers University.
A 12-minute trip from Pennsylvania Station in the heart of downtown Newark to Franklin Avenue, the end of the line near the border with Belleville, confirms these claims. While transit officials in New York and other cities struggle with aging equipment, huge deficits and potential fare increases, the managers of the Newark line oversee a system that runs like clockwork -- every two minutes during rush hour -- and manages to please passengers and even turn a profit.
 
Short, Pleasant Journey
 Part of the secret lies in the scale. The one-car trains travel a line that is 4.3 miles long, has just 11 stops and is used by 14,000 people a day.
To traverse the line is to recapture the past and imagine the future of urban rapid transit. It evokes the days when Newark was a bustling manufacturing and retailing center, with a network of streetcar lines that linked neighborhoods with grace, ease and speed. And it suggests the kind of simple, relatively inexpensive light rail line that could help untangle many contemporary cities clogged with cars.
There are few hints of the system's charm as one waits at the terminus, deep in the bowels of Penn Station, below the busy Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and PATH lines upstairs. Long before the subway car comes into view, it can be heard rounding a sharp curve, its wheels growling ferociously.
Then it appears, hardly threatening at all: oval shaped, with a black-and-white exterior with a bright, wide stripe of blue, purple and orange slashing down each side. Inside and out, the car is spotless. The seats are cushioned in beige and blue. Two sets of windows line the sides: one row for seated passengers, and above them another for those who must stand.
 
A Visual Delight
 There is much to see. At each of the first four stations, striking tiles that date from the Depression depict scenes of the construction of the Morris Canal; the subway runs in the old canal bed. The line heads west through the fourth stop, Warren Street, then curves north and rises from underground, running just below street level in a culvert. At Orange Street, the sixth stop, the line comes up to grade and crosses the street, the only time it does so, with the loud clanging of a bell and a smooth, silent rush.
The tracks then slice through Newark's northern neighborhoods. On the right is Branch Brook Park, a large, rambling oasis above which rises the spires of the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart. On the left are old factories, then small houses and apartment buildings.
The stations slip by. At Park Avenue, a man who has been munching french fries exits, depositing his $1 into the fare box next to the motorman. At Bloomfield Avenue, a woman with Sesame Street birthday balloons pays and steps down to a station with clean white tiles and glass-enclosed waiting areas.
At Franklin Avenue, precisely 12 minutes after leaving Penn Station, the car comes to a halt. Passengers walk toward buses waiting just beyond the small landscaped plaza to take them to the surrounding suburbs.
 
'Completely Charming'
 Stephenie Waller waits for a bus that will take her to Nutley, where she works as a data-entry operator. Mrs. Waller, who lives near downtown Newark, has commuted on the subway for two years. "It's very reliable, fast and on time," she said. "I don't think most people even know it exists. I didn't know until my job moved to Nutley."
Other passengers are caught up in the poetry of the subway: the cars, built in the late 1940's and refurbished in the early 1980's, when the state took over the line and spent $20 million to rebuild it; the cleanliness, and the small-town friendliness that pervades the system.
"It's completely charming," said Mr. Hartman, the graphic designer who begins and ends a commute between his home in north Newark and his job in midtown Manhattan with the subway. "It's small scale. People are always very courteous to each other, getting up to let others sit down. You don't get grumpy commuters."
Mr. Salazar has been riding the subway for three years as part of his regular trip between his home in Union and Rutgers-Newark. "It's dependable and clean," Mr. Salazar said. "I think it's safe."
Others were not so sure. Michael Magdziak, the superintendent of the subway, said there is very little crime on the cars, but passengers have to exercise caution going to and from the stations late at night. "We're in an urban environment," Mr. Magdziak said. "You have to be street savvy."
Since the state pumped money into rebuilding the subway in the early 1980's, the 55-year-old line has pretty much paid for itself, Mr. Magdziak said. It costs about $2.8 million a year to operate, and takes in about $3.4 million in revenues. The profits go to New Jersey Transit to help subsidize other bus and railroad lines.
Ridership of the Newark subway grew by 27 percent between 1986 and 1989, but it has fallen by 10 to 15 percent in the last year, presumably because of the recession, he said. The next major investment is scheduled for 1996, when the first of the system's 24 cars will be 50 years old and will require replacement. The cars were bought used in 1953 from the Minneapolis streetcar system, and similar ones are still in use in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston, Toronto and San Francisco.
But such details mean little to the line's loyalists, who would prefer as few changes as possible. Mr. Hartman, for example, describes his early morning subway ride as "by far the nicest part of my day."
Some of the motormen share that enthusiasm. "I love it," said Samuel Watson, who has worked in the subway for 10 years and who drove a bus in Newark for 12 years before that. "I have no problem with automobiles. When I start out in the morning, I know I'll be on time at the end of the day."

Marriott's Debt Is Downgraded

 BODY:
The senior long-term debt ratings of the Marriott Corporation, the hotel operator based in Bethesda, Md., have been downgraded by Moody's Investors Service to Baa3, from Baa2. The ratings agency also assigned a prospective Ba1 rating to Marriott's shelf registration covering $230 million in convertible preferred stock. 
 Moody's said that about $3.1 billion of securities were affected. It said it had lowered the ratings because Marriott's expected sale of some assets, mostly real estate, would take a longer time than previously believed because of the recession and the weak real esate market.

HEADLINE: Help Russia; Push Russia

 BODY:
For all his skillful management of foreign affairs, President Bush remains oddly limp on a crucial topic: economic aid to beleaguered Russia. True, Mr. Bush has proposed emergency food aid and debt deferral, and true, the Senate finally seems headed for enactment of a modest package to help dismantle nuclear and chemical weapons. But the gravity of Russia's circumstances, and the monumental opportunity for the West, beg for more than these pinched responses.
Americans, unprepared, ask why their scarce dollars should be sent anywhere abroad at a time of sinking fortunes at home. There are compelling answers, but the case has to be made at the top, by the President. So far he's been barely audible. 
 With collapse of the Soviet Government, Western attention naturally turns to Russia. The Russians are moving to democracy; they're about to leap to markets. The Western stake in these revolutions transcends Russia. If its economic reform bogs down, other republics will find their move to markets more difficult. And economic collapse in Russia could easily breed political collapse, with alarming possibilities for dictatorship, equipped with nuclear weapons at that.
The situation cries out for intervention. And according to Jeffrey Sachs, an economics professor at Harvard who advises the Russian government, it won't take much sacrifice by the West. He outlines a Western aid package costing $15 billion a year, about $3 billion of it from the U.S.
If the package succeeds in coaxing Russia into the world of free economies and away from further militarization, the U.S. will save many times $3 billion in defense spending alone.
In the Sachs plan, aid would be targeted and conditioned on market reforms. Based on the plan adopted by Poland, about $5 billion would be used for emergency food aid, $6 billion for imports to keep factories operating and $4 billion to stabilize the value of the ruble -- the first step in opening up to foreign trade and investment.
Such a coherent aid package shines by comparison with the piecemeal response of the Bush Administration, which is at once too generous and too stingy. It gives too little aid -- and it doesn't condition the aid it does offer on irreversible market reforms.
Indeed, the Administration's plan envisions handing over food aid without any requirement that the Russians privatize agricultural markets. That, however, is probably the only way to end a system that allows food to rot in the fields and black market speculators to siphon off much of the rest.
Russia's plans sound good. President Boris Yeltsin has announced a truly radical economic reform, and backs it by appointing economic advisers who are committed to markets. They've begun to put parts of the program in place and, to prove their commitment, invited the International Monetary Fund to supervise reform.
Still, so far the Russian economic transformation is talk and no leap. That makes it all the more important to push the Russians forward, for everyone's sake. To do that, the President needs to explain to a skeptical public why the best use of a few billion dollars is to send them far, far from home.

HEADLINE: Down With the Palace Guard

BYLINE: By Dick Armey; Dick Armey, a Texas Representative, is the ranking Republican on the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Bush is dangerously out of touch with the American public. Instead of listening to the elected people in his party most in touch with the average voter -- House Republicans -- he remains cloistered with aides who avoid action and favor blaming others for the nation's economic, and their boss's consequent political, woes.
House Republicans are increasingly frustrated with the White House's wait-and-see attitude on the economy. We hear our constituents' genuine concern about their prosperity and sense resentment that the Administration seems to show little regard for that concern. Unfortunately, our calls for quick action are rebuked by unelected officials like Richard Darman, the budget director, and John Sununu, the chief of staff, who advocate waiting for a more politically opportune moment to push for an economic growth package. 
 These are the same people who, when the House Republicans passed my "no new taxes" resolution during last year's budget summit, urged the President to accept a package that called for new taxes and to try to push it past us anyway.
Mr. Darman recently counseled the President to wait until the State of the Union Address in January to announce an economic plan, saying this timing would be better because "in the general public's mind, there's a ritual, a rhythm of renewal . . . to the State of the Union."
For uttering such an absurd statement, he should be thrown from the front door of the White House the way unsavory characters were ejected from Texas saloons. What "general public" does he have in mind -- the general public in the White House cafeteria? The real general public is more attuned to the prospect of a bleak Christmas than to rituals so dear to Mr. Darman.
Just to see how much this "rhythm of renewal" exists in the American mind, I conducted an unscientific but objective telephone poll, asking 10 people at random one simple question: "When is the State of the Union Address?"
Seven did not know: a Nebraska video store manager, an auto parts clerk in Missouri, a Pennsylvania financial planner, a San Francisco publicist, an out-of-work New Jersey car salesman, a Texas small-business owner and a Washington cashier. I'm willing to bet that the 70 percent of respondents to my poll who are not in rhythm with Mr. Darman's "general public" would closely match the results of a more scientific poll conducted across the land.
The House Republican conference on Friday endorsed immediate enactment of a comprehensive growth plan, including a partial restoration of passive-loss real-estate deductions to help bolster home values, a reduced capital gains rate, a repeal of job-killing excise taxes on boats, aircraft and jewelry, and a bill allowing families to tap individual retirement accounts for first homes.
Representative Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican, recently sent a letter signed by 113 of the 166 House Republicans urging Speaker Tom Foley to keep Congress in session until such a pro-growth package is passed. Representative Frank Wolf, Republican of Virginia, is seeking signatures for a similar letter urging President Bush to call Congress back if it adjourns without passing such legislation.
Regrettably, our message doesn't seem to be getting across at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. John Sununu recently lectured House Republicans that politics is "a matter of seasons" and that this is not the right season for the President to go on television to push a growth package.
It's no coincidence that the only person in the Administration pressing for action, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, was himself a House Republican less than four years ago. George Bush left the House more than 20 years ago, but he should remember how close a Congressional seat is to the people back home, and heed our call now, rather than later.

HEADLINE: Economy Needs Return to I.R.A. Deductibility

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Blame Bush for the Recession" (Op-Ed, Nov. 12), Jude Wanniski's argument for reducing or eliminating the capital gains tax to stimulate the economy is based on a specious analogy. We are asked to think of a horse race in which a 40-to-1 long shot wins but those who bet on it are stripped of all but $4 of their winnings by Internal Revenue Service agents, creating "an even-money payoff." 
 Using the approximately 30 percent rate assessed on higher incomes, including capital gains, the payoff would be more on the order of 28 to 1. Mr. Wanniski also fails to note that what created the long odds on his horse was the comparatively small number of people willing to bet on it.
The tax break that will bring a large number of people to bet through investing is not capital-gains related, but the return of deductibility to individual retirement accounts and Keogh-plan payments. This is the real world of the salaried middle-income American, not that of trickle-down tricks. Let me cite a case.
Thirty years ago, my twin brother decided to become a lawyer; I chose to go into teaching. We earned the same quality and level of graduate degree, but he now earns 20 times my salary. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 had the effect of greatly reducing the income tax rate paid by my brother; it increased my taxes slightly. I didn't like that, but I accepted it as part of the package designed to eliminate preferential tax breaks.
In 1986, I lost even the tax exemption on my annual $2,000 I.R.A. contribution. That money had been coming out of earned income and was therefore being introduced for the first time into the investment pool. The middle class's I.R.A.'s were truly the fresh influx of venture capital the President claims he seeks with his reduced capital gains tax. But what he would be getting in most cases would be merely a turnover of funds already in the investment pool.
Reinvestment or consumption of goods by the rich, who are too few to reduce the odds on long shots, will not bring new funds into the capital investment picture -- as they did not in the Reagan 1980's. They will not represent new savings the way our I.R.A.'s, when pooled in retirement plans by the millions, did and can.
It seems George Bush has intended all along that the kinder, gentler society puffed in his campaign would be kinder and gentler chiefly to speculators, to brokers and to those relative few with a lot of discretionary income.

HEADLINE: What Business Improvement Districts Can Do

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am pleased that "The Business of Business" (editorial, Nov. 2) recognizes New York City's Business Improvement Districts as examples of involvement by businesses in cleaning up commercial neighborhoods. 
 However, in citing only two of these districts, in the Grand Central and Times Square areas, you miss an opportunity to show just how successful this program has been. There are, in fact, 24 such success stories throughout New York City.
Most Business Improvement Districts exist not in high-visibility areas in midtown Manhattan, but in neighborhoods as diverse as Steinway Street in Queens, Brighton Beach in Brooklyn and Third Avenue in the hub area of the Bronx. Each district is tailored to be responsive to the needs of a specific community, no matter its size or economic profile.
Business Improvement Districts are financed by property owners, who pay special assessment fees, which are set by the local sponsors in consultation with the city. Through these assessments, Business Improvement Districts can provide a range of supplemental services, which include marketing and promotion, security, sanitation, maintenance, special street lighting and landscaping.
These improvement districts are the result of a partnership between the city and its communities. The New York City Department of Business Services works with each group to provide assistance and service aimed at strengthening individual communities and businesses.
Along with merchants associations and civic groups of all kinds, Business Improvement Districts play a key role in the economic vitality of New York City.

Cut Capital Gains Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Son of Kemp-Roth: Still Wrong" (editorial, Nov. 13) is your usual editorial against cutting the capital gains tax. You state that reform directed toward past investments "couldn't possibly spur future investment." Dead wrong. Capital for new investments comes from selling old investments, and right now $1 trillion of old investments is locked up by investors who won't sell under this tax rate (in New York City, it's 40 percent). A lower rate would encourage capital fluidity, and a rearrangement of assets between conservative and speculative investors would yield more funds for new ventures. 
 Then you object to the profit for rich families. Of course, the rich don't deserve anything; they got too much in 1986. But a capital gains tax reform could be crafted to help mostly the middle-class investors who were penalized in 1986. The House Democrats should be congratulated for their previous effort to provide a $100,000 lifetime exemption, which would help a small retiring businessman to salvage his life savings, but which would mean little to the wealthy. Any remaining benefit for the rich could be
recouped by a higher tax rate on their regular income.
Finally, you state that capital gains cuts will cost the Treasury revenue. Not so. The Treasury gets zero revenue from transactions that do not take place because the tax rate is too high. A low tax rate on many transactions yields more revenue than a high rate on few transactions.
A skillfully written capital gains reform would be beneficial; the simplest approach would be to go back to the situation before the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

Clean Air, At What Price?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IF Americans can land a man on the moon and even brew a decent cup of decaf, why can't they make city air clean enough to breathe? No good reason, most analysts would argue. But the current, high-stakes battle over reformulating gasoline shows it's not only a question of how clean you make it, it's how you make it clean.
While gasoline is a major source of hydrocarbons in urban air, the fuel's contribution to smog is plummeting because new cars are far cleaner than their predecessors. Thus James W. Kinnear, chief executive of Texaco, argues that Federal orders to squeeze the last few percent of hydrocarbons out of auto tailpipes in nine heavily polluted cities will make only a marginal difference to human health -- and will certainly not prove cost-effective. 
 Texaco's real worry, though, is what happens outside New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and the other six pollution capitals. If whole states voluntarily adopt parallel gasoline standards (as now seems likely), Mr. Kinnear believes that the economic waste will reach colossal proportions.
In the 1970's, cars spewed about nine grams of hydrocarbons per mile. But thanks to emissions controls achieved relatively cheaply, the average will be down to 1 1/2 grams by 1995, and hydrocarbons from all mobile sources combined will slip to just a quarter of total emissions in the typical city. Nevertheless, tough Federal gasoline regulations, aimed primarily at reducing the rate of evaporation of unburnt fuel, will go into effect that year in the nine offending cities.
The 6 cents a gallon spent on cleaner gasoline will bring the cost of removing an extra ton of hydrocarbons from the air to about $10,000 -- roughly 10 times the per-ton cost of removing the first 95 percent from urban air. But the 1995 gasoline standard may still prove a relatively efficient means of eliminating the next few percent, which computer simulations suggest will be needed to meet Federal air quality standards.
The next turn of the anti-pollution screw, however, is far more problematic. Unless the law is modified, gasoline will have to be reformulated again in the year 2000 at a cost of about 15 cents a gallon. And this time, the benefit will be hard won: Texaco reckons the cost per ton of hydrocarbons removed will exceed $200,000 -- 20 times as much as the first-round reformulation.
That is grim news for the nine cities, which must compete for business and tax base with less polluted places. Severely reformulated gasoline is almost certainly not the cheapest way to reduce their emissions, argues Robert Hahn, an environmental economist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. Nor is it even likely to be the cheapest way to put the squeeze on auto exhausts: Charging for the use of congested roads at peak hours is fast becoming a practical means of keeping traffic moving -- and would probably be worth doing if it did not slash emissions.
But super-clean gasoline could prove grimmer news yet if other regions follow California, which last week adopted a gasoline standard for the whole state that is almost identical to the Federal standard for the most polluted cities. Tens of millions of motorists living in places without serious air pollution could end up paying billions annually to no constructive end.
In the fight to ease the California standard and prevent its spread to other states, Texaco argued it would be far more cost-effective to scrap heavily polluting older cars. Mr. Hahn, who was part of the Bush Administration team in the Clean Air Act negotiations, would take an entirely different tack. He would set a cap on total emissions, and then leave the business of finding the least-cost method of reducing pollutants to the private market. Existing polluters would be given allowances to pollute, which would decrease over time; new polluters would be required to buy allowances from those already polluting.
This idea was raised by the Bush Administration in 1989, then quietly dropped. "We wanted to push for a market solution, Mr. Hahn laments, "but we couldn't find any industry support out there."
Most Americans assume that Big Oil is more than capable of defending its interests. Perhaps. But in this case, the companies were hardly prepared to go to the wall to fight gasoline reformulation since they will always be able to pass on the costs to motorists. ARCO actually championed Draconian standards for California, reportedly because the immensely successful oil company already has the technology and the refineries to reformulate at a lower cost than its rivals.
Environmentalists won a great victory in the Clean Air Act of 1990. It may prove Pyrrhic, however, if the price of regulating away pollution proves to be more than Americans can afford.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Sharply Higher After Drop Early in the Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar took a wild ride yesterday, first tumbling on gloomy news about the economy, then surging on word that Germany's top economics aide had said the dollar's value was too low.
Gold prices ended lower. The Republic National Bank quoted bullion at $365.25 an ounce as of 4 P.M., down $2.05 from Monday. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery was down $1.90 at $366.20. 
 Currency dealers said the dollar slumped early in the trading day on word that the Conference Board's widely followed consumer confidence index had skidded in November to levels below that of the 1982 recession.
"That brought us to the thinking that 'hey, this dollar has got to go down,' " said Zlatko Glamuzina, a senior currency trader at the Banco di Sicilia's New York office.
Traders reasoned that interest rates in the United States, which have been falling for months, must go lower still to stimulate lending and reinvigorate the economy. But lower rates hurt the dollar's value by making investments denominated in the currency worth less.
The dollar fell in Asian and European trading until traders heard that Germany's Economics Minister, Jurgen Mollemann, said in an interview that he believed the dollar's exchange rate against the mark should be about 1.6500 marks. The dollar was trading at about 1.5840 marks when his remarks hit the market.
Many traders were surprised, partly because the assertion seemed to go against the grain of German economic thinking. A more expensive dollar would mean a cheaper mark, which would tend to stimulate inflation, which Germans particularly dislike.
Traders who had sold dollars earlier in the day quickly scrambled to buy them back, heightening the velocity of the dollar's rebound. "People were caught short on dollars," said John Lyman, a dealer at the Bank of Tokyo's New York branch.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.23 yen to close at 128.30 yen. Later in London the dollar was quoted at 128.15 yen, before Mr. Mollemann's remarks. In New York trading, the dollar fetched 130.15 yen, up sharply from 127.90 yen late Monday.
The dollar was at 1.5795 marks in European trading, down from 1.5835, before the German minister's remarks were reported. But later in New York the dollar surged to 1.6115 marks, up from its 1.5885 exchange rate late Monday.
The British pound fell in London to $1.7975, from $1.7995 late Monday. Later in New York the pound brought $1.7730, cheaper than its $1.7945 value late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, were: 1.4265 Swiss francs, up from 1.4125; 1.1363 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1383; 5.4055 French francs, down from 5.4290, and 1,217.00 Italian lire, up from 1.201.75.

HEADLINE: C.D.'s and Bank Funds Dip

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts were moderately down for the week ended yesterday.
According to The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest-rate publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla., the outlook for yields is gloomy, with the slide definitely going into 1992. "Weak indicators and a public lack of confidence are hurting the ability to recover from the economic slump and in turn hurting bank savings yields," Robert K. Heady, its publisher, said. "The drop this week is surprisingly stronger than last week, even three weeks after a prime-rate cut." 
 Analysts noted that this week's decline in C.D. yields offered by banks in the New York market was about the same as declines in C.D. yields at other banks across the country.
 
Bill Yields Off Smartly
 At the Treasury Department's weekly bill auction held on Monday, the average discount rates for both the three- and six-month bills were off smartly and down for the fifth consecutive week. At auction the three-month bill fell 14 basis points, to 4.44 percent, while the six-month bill fell 8 basis points, to 4.50 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The largest yield changes in New York area banks this week were at Midlantic Banks, which lowered its money market account by 26 basis points, 4.60 percent.
European American Bank and Connecticut National Bank both lowered the yield on three-month certificates by 16 basis points, with European American's yield at 4.34 percent and Connecticut National's at 4.75 percent. For a six-month C.D., Connecticut National and National Westminster Bank had the biggest declines, each knocking off 16 basis points, to 4.91 percent and 4.39 percent, respectively.
 
Commercial Banks' Rates
 Yields at commercial banks were off slightly more than at savings institutions. An average commercial money market account was down 4 basis points, to 4.29 percent, while the average three-month certificate was down 8 basis points, to 4.36 percent. The longer six-month certificate was off 10 basis points, to 4.44 percent.
For depositors at savings institutions, the cuts were not as deep, but they hurt, one analyst said. The average money market was off 4 basis points, to 4.99 percent, while the average three-month certificate was down 6 basis points, to 5.02 percent. For the average six-month certificate, the decline was 8 basis points, to 5.20 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, November 27, 1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Sanctions On China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The Administration today announced the failure of trade negotiations with China aimed at stopping the piracy of American patents, copyrights and trademarks, and began the legal process for restricting some Chinese imports in retaliation.
The decision by the trade representative, Carla A. Hills, is the first time that the United States has sought trade sanctions because another country did not protect American inventions. It represents a further deterioration in American-Chinese relations. 
 The Administration's announcement today came after House and Senate staff members struck a deal late Monday night on which conditions to attach next year to the annual renewal of China's most-favored-nation trade status.
 
House Vote of 409 to 21
 The full House passed the compromise measure tonight by a vote of 409 to 21, with 1 vote of present, considerably more than the 313-to-112 margin by which the original House bill passed.
But Representative Philip M. Crane, the Illinois Republican who led opposition to the measure, said after the vote that the Administration had not put pressure on Republicans this evening to vote down the measure. The Administration has wooed enough Senators to prevent any override of a Presidential veto, he added.
The Senate is not expected to vote before it adjourns for Thanksgiving.
 
100% Tariffs Possible
 A list of restricted imports, which could be subject to tariffs of 100 percent, will be published on Wednesday, and that will immediately disrupt trade between the United States and China, said Richard A. Brecher, the director of business advisory services at the U.S.-China Business Council, a Washington-based group of companies trading with China.
Importers will be racing to change or cancel orders to avoid being stuck with goods that could end up costing twice as much as they anticipated, wiping out any profits, he said.
But with the restrictions possibly going into effect within two months, many importers may not be able to move fast enough, he said, adding, "Everybody's going to be scrambling."
Neither the total value of the imports to be affected nor the types of products involved were available tonight.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington had no comment.
The prohibitive tariffs allowed under Special 301, the legislation dealing with foreign violations of American inventions, would be even more devastating to importers than a revocation of China's most-favored-nation status, which allows Chinese products to enter the United States at the lowest available tariffs. Removing the trade status, as some Democrats proposed last summer, would have increased average duties on imports from China to 40 percent, from 8 percent, while Special 301 provides for 100 percent tariffs.
The final list of restricted products could be revised during a 30-day period of public comment beginning next week, during which negotiations between the United States and China could produce a deal canceling the sanctions. But six months of negotiations, including almost continuous talks in Washington for the last six days, have not resulted in any progress.
"The United States made every effort to reach an agreement," Mrs. Hills said in a statement. "However, China's proposals were ultimately insufficient."
 
Aiming at State Companies
 In choosing products for the sanctions, Administration officials have indicated that they would seek to inflict economic pain on the Chinese Government rather than entrepreneurs in China and Hong Kong, and cause minimum disruption to the American economy. So the American officials have been trying to select products made and shipped by state-owned companies in China.
Last year, the United States exported $4.81 billion worth of goods to China, particularly wheat, agricultural chemicals and aircraft, and imported $15.22 billion worth, especially toys, shoes, clothing and fabric.
Mrs. Hills began patent and copyright trade cases against China, India and Thailand on April 26, and was required by law to announce for China and India today whether she would assess sanctions, extend the negotiations for three months or drop the cases entirely. Mrs. Hills extended the negotiations with India for three months, citing some progress by negotiators and the complexity of the issues. The talks with Thailand are on a separate schedule, with deadlines in December and March.
 
Softer Compromise Bill
 The compromise bill is slightly softer than House and Senate bills passed in July; it gives the President a little more leeway in renewing China's access to American markets. But the President has promised to veto the legislation.
Congressional Democrats have used the China trade-status issue to make the President seem to take a position favoring China at a time when that country's human rights policies, large trade surplus and exports of missiles and nuclear technology to the Middle East are the target of international criticism.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Rise on Strong U.S. Sale

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved higher yesterday, pushed up by a successful auction of new five-year notes and two surveys showing that consumer confidence had fallen to its lowest level in close to a decade.
Dealers, who had expected demand for the new notes to be good, said the strong bidding at the 1 P.M. auction for $9 billion worth of securities muted the market's reaction to the surveys by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan. 
 The surveys showed that confidence, which had turned up after the Persian Gulf war, reversed course in November and fell to lows not seen since the 1982 recession.
"There is no precedent for consumer confidence to double dip like this," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. "It is hard to see how the recovery remains sustainable when confidence falls below levels we saw during the war. And it is particularly troubling when this is occurring against a backdrop of falling interest rates."
 
Chance of Contraction
 Mr. Yardeni, who had been cautiously optimistic that the economy would not fall back into recession, said there was now a 60 percent chance that growth would be flat or negative by as much as 2 percent in the current quarter and for the first half of 1992.
At the five-year note auction, the securities were sold at an average yield of 6.54 percent, well below the 6.92 percent average yield at the last five-year note sale on Oct. 24. The yield was the lowest on a new five-year Treasury security in more than five years. On Aug. 27, 1986, five-year notes were sold at an average yield of 6.51 percent.
The new five-year notes traded well after the auction, and by late in the day were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.52 percent. Rare
 
Rare Action by Fed
 During the day, the Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system by buying coupon-bearing securities rather than short-term Treasury bills. It was the first time since April 1989 that the Fed made such trades.
Analysts, who had been expecting the Fed to add reserves, said that the fact the central bank chose to do so by buying longer-dated issues had no policy significance.
"I consider this move to be primarily technical in nature, and not to affect the yield curve in any significant way," said Darwin L. Beck, an economist at the First Boston Corporation.
In recent days, some economists and credit market participants have speculated that the Fed and the Treasury may try to narrow the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates to help stimulate the economy. Purchases by the Fed of longer-dated issues would be one part of that effort.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 100 22/32, up 1/2 point, to yield 7.93 percent, compared with 7.98 percent late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.5 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 21/32, up 10/32, to yield 7.4 percent. And the outstanding 6 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 18/ 32, up 5/32, to yield 5.79 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved lower. In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.38 percent, down four basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 4.44 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Georgia-Pacific Corporation offered $250 million of new 20-year notes through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 9.5 percent securities, which mature Dec. 1, 2011, were priced at $99.875 to yield 9.628 percent, 1.65 percentage points more than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The issue is rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BB+ by Standard & Poor's.
The improved tone in the Treasury market had a beneficial impact in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds. Traders said prices of most issues rose from 1/4 point to 3/8 point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most widely quoted issues improved by about 1/4 point, dealers said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Is the Lowest Since 1980

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
American consumers' confidence in the economy has fallen beneath the lowest level recorded during the 1982 recession, the Conference Board said yesterday in a report that indicates growing unease over job security and general disbelief in the Bush Administration's contention that a recovery has taken hold.
The index of consumer confidence compiled by the board, a widely followed business research group, declined to 50.6 from 60.1 in October. The figure is more than three points below the worst rating of the 1982 recession, when the nation's output of all goods and service, as measured by the gross national product, dropped almost 6 percent in a single quarter and unemployment climbed over the 10 percent mark. 
 "We're about as low as historically we've ever been," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the board. "This is rock bottom in terms of the malaise of the consumer." Referring to the Federal Reserve Board's attempts to stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates this year, he added that "obviously, the use of monetary policy alone is not working."
The plunge in consumer confidence contributed to a big morning decline in stock prices, although the market later staged a recovery. In the credit markets, however, the gloomy news helped to raise prices of Treasury notes and bonds and to lower yields. [Pages D6 and D13.]
The report appeared to increase pressure on the Administration and Congress to act to stimulate a recovery through tax cuts and domestic spending programs, which have been used to overcome past recessions but until now have been shunned by President Bush for fear that tax relief could deepen the budget deficit.
"This unquestionably turns up the fire another notch on Congress and the President," said Robert D. Reischauer, chief economist at the Congressional Budget Office. "There is widespread despair out in the country, we've tried monetary policy, and the question now is, will the political system do something?"
Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover, also urged what he called "a good, old-fashioned fiscal stimulus." He suggested that the board's report showed that "we're not as depressed statistically as in the 1930's, but we're as depressed mentally, and you need pump-priming to break that vicious cycle."
But an Administration official, who insisted on anonymity, sought to play down the significance of the report. "The economy is not healthy," he said, "but it's growing inch by inch and we'll eventually get a stonger recovery." He declined to predict when that would happen but suggested that existing policies -- including the recent extension of unemployment benefits -- should be enough to spur stronger growth.
 
Similar Data in Separate Survey
 The sour consumer sentiment was reflected in the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index, the country's other main barometer of consumer feeling. The index fell to 69 in November from 78.3 in October, according to economists who have seen the unpublished report.
Such reports are widely thought to provide an accurate reflection of the consumer attitude but do not necessarily indicate where the economy itself is heading. "You get a good idea of where we are, but not necessarily where we're going," said Stephen Roach, the senior economist at Morgan Stanley.
Still, consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all national spending and is a crucial factor in the country's economic performance. With the vital Christmas shopping season approaching, consumer reluctance to spend seems likely to spell tough times for retailers and could act as a further drag on the economy.
 
Dim Outlook for Retailers
 "These figures come at the worst possible time for retailers, and they put the economy at risk for a renewed recessionary decline," said Richard T. Curtin, the director of consumer surveys for the University of Michigan.
In statistical terms, the recession ended last May, when the economy started growing again, albeit slowly, and employment levels began to rise. Growth, as measured by the gross national product, amounted to 2.4 percent in the last quarter.
But the erosion of consumer confidence -- far worse than what might be expected on the basis of the key economic indicators -- suggests that Washington has failed to come to grips with several factors that are darkening the moods of Americans, several economists said.
 
Insecurity About Jobs
 Chief among these is the issue of employment. Although the unemployment level in October was 6.8 percent, compared to more than 10 percent during the 1982 recession, and even though the growth of jobs resumed in the last quarter, an unease seems to have taken hold. Many people now know somebody who has been laid off.
"People who had raised their hopes earlier in the year have now given up on the prospects of improved hiring and income possibilities," said Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley.
Mr. Linden of the Conference Board said that the survey, based on questions sent to 5,000 households across the country, showed that only 4.8 percent of people thought jobs were plentiful, while 47.9 percent thought jobs were hard to get. Last month, 43.5 percent of people thought jobs were difficult to find.
He added that 20 percent of those interviewed had personally experienced a spell of unemployment in the past year and, of those, 48 percent found themselves making less money when they returned to work.
 
Other Measures of Doubt
 The survey also revealed that 49.1 percent of the respondents considered business conditions to be bad, the worst showing in more than a year.
The number of people planning to buy a car fell to 6.6 percent from 7.5 percent last month, while those planning to buy a house over the next six months fell to 2.7 percent from 3.3 percent. Both figures suggest that attempts to stimulate the economy through interest rate cuts are having scant effect.

HEADLINE: Dow Recovers From Drop to Finish 14.08 Higher

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Largely on the strength of a promised restructuring of the International Business Machines Corporation, the Dow Jones industrial average recovered yesterday from a 52-point tumble to finish the day 14.08 points higher, at 2,916.14.
I.B.M., one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, said yesterday that it would take a fourth-quarter charge of $3 billion charge and trim its ranks by an additional 20,000 people. The company said the moves would ultimately save it $1 billion next year and $2 billion annually thereafter. I.B.M., whose work force will shrink to about 330,000 after the cuts, had already eliminated 20,000 jobs this year. 
 On the strength of the announcement, the company's stock rose 2 3/4 points, to 97 7/8, pulling up the Dow average and igniting a modest rally in several other indexes as well, analysts said.
"Basically, people look at this as a positive step, which should improve the company's profitability," said Paul J. Kronlokken, a technical analyst with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood.
Although trading usually slows near Thanksgiving as people take off early for the holiday, volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a heavy 213.8 million, up from 175.9 million on Monday. Gainers narrowly outpaced losers, 869 to 779.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks finished 2.62 points higher at 377.96, while the Big Board composite index also posted a modest 1.20-point gain, closing at 208.77.
The other major indexes were down at the closing bell -- but only by a whisker. The Russell 2,000 finished at 175.58, down 0.54. The American Stock Exchange index fell 0.38, to 370.66. And the Nasdaq composite index dropped 0.65, to 522.23.
All in all, it was an up and down, then up again, day. Within the first few minutes of trading, the market rose 20.57 points, but seemed to lack conviction. Without warning, it did a sharp about-face and plunged 52.33 points by about noon.
Analysts attributed the sudden selloff to a worrisome monthly survey by the Conference Board, which showed that consumer confidence remained stubbornly below levels recorded in the 1982 recession.
They also cited comments made by President Bush at a picture-taking session yesterday, suggesting that he was now supporting an 11th-hour House Republican tax package that could raise the deficit. "Anything that increases the budget deficit just does not sit well with this market," said Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company.
I.B.M. alone accounted for 35 percent of the Dow's movement yesterday, according to Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm in New York. Other factors were six buy and six sell programs that Birinyi noted had a combined impact on the Dow of 19.65 points, and bargain hunters who sought to take advantage of recent bearishness. "A lot of investors have used 2,850 to 2,900 as their zone to do some buying," Mr. Jarrett said.
AIDS-related news continued to drive many stocks, as has been the case since Magic Johnson, the basketball star, disclosed that he had been exposed to the HIV virus. Shares of Proteus International P.L.C., a British company that uses computers to develop drugs, closed up on the London Stock Exchange. Analysts said the recent AIDS-related death of the pop singer Freddie Mercury had kindled interest in the company.
Merck & Company, on the other hand, saw its stock drop 2, to 143 1/4, after it said it had largely abandoned a once-promising AIDS drug after the virus developed resistance to it.

HEADLINE: Fewer Are Late On Mortgages

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The percentage of Americans behind on their mortgage payments improved slightly during the July-to-September quarter, but analysts warned that the improvement would be only temporary given the weakness of the economy.
The Mortgage Bankers Association said today that the proportion of mortgage holders 30 days or more late on their payments improved to 5.07 percent in the third quarter, compared with 5.28 percent in the April-to-June quarter. 
 The second-quarter delinquency rate had been the highest in nearly five years.
Analysts said they thought the improvement was a temporary pickup reflecting the fact that the economy began growing again during the July-to- September period after declining for three consecutive quarters while the country struggled with recession.

HEADLINE: Final Push To Finish Bank Bill

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
In the hours before Congress was to begin its Thanksgiving recess, lawmakers worked today to resolve differences on a slimmed-down banking bill that would provide new money for the bank insurance fund, as the Administration had asked. But the bill included none of the broad changes in the half-century-old laws governing the banking industry that the White House proposed in February.
By late in the afternoon, House and Senate negotiators had agreed to drop provisions in the Senate bill that would have eased barriers to interstate banking. The interstate banking measure had been the last significant White House recommendation left.
 
Measure Bogs Down
 But the bill bogged down in the evening over a variety of smaller provisions that would give regulators greater authority to take over weak institutions and limit the insurance coverage on bank deposits sold by Wall Street investment houses. 
 The key provision of the legislation emerging from the conference committee tonight would provide an increase to $30 billion, from $5 billion, in the credit line that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has with the Treasury. The loans would be repaid through higher premiums paid by banks to the fund.
The legislation would also provide tens of billions of dollars more in loans that would be used as working capital and repaid from the proceeds of the assets of ailing banks seized by regulators. The loan amount is unspecified.
 
Administration's New Tack
 Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady conceded today that the Administration had lost its yearlong struggle with Congress, and began to express a new Administration strategy charging the lawmakers with failure on the issue. "Continued Congressional inaction is a recipe for trouble," he said.
This kind of attack will doubtless be adopted by the White House once President Bush's re-election campaign moves into high gear, even though the President himself never really put any serious lobbying effort behind the Administration's recommendations.
Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Banking Committee and has been the Administration's strongest ally, moved swiftly to defend Congress. "We need the President's help," he said. Asked whether Mr. Bush had done enough for the legislation, Mr. Riegle said, "The answer is clearly no."
In the days leading up to the conference, the White House left the legislation entirely in the hands of the Treasury Department.
Congress has been prodded this week to move swiftly to refinance the rapidly depleted fund that insures bank deposits. The fund, which protects about $2 trillion in deposits, is worth about $2 billion and is expected to be out of money by the end of next month, battered by a wave of bank failures.
At a meeting on Saturday, the nation's top bank officials told Mr. Riegle that even after Congress provided new money, the insurance fund would still be unable to handle a failure of one of the nation's largest banks. They also expressed concern that a large bank collapse could lead to a regionwide financial crisis because the Government did not have the money to act swiftly and avert runs.
The meeting was called by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and its participants included William Taylor, the new head of the F.D.I.C., and Senate aides.
Aides said the meeting deeply concerned Mr. Riegle, who tried with no success to set up a meeting between Mr. Greenspan and the President to discuss problems in the banking industry.
 
Fund in Trouble
 On Friday Mr. Taylor also described the difficulties of the fund, saying in an interview that its depletion had begun to slow regulators in seizing bigger banks. At an emergency hearing yesterday, Mr. Taylor urged the lawmakers to lay aside their differences and quickly provide new money for the insurance fund.
Through this afternoon and into the evening the lawmakers haggled over the fine print of the legislation, going over it line by line in a room jammed with lobbyists representing banks, Wall Street, the insurance industry and consumers.
Other measures stripped from the Senate bill would have reduced the potential liability of lenders for environmental damage by borrowers and put a 14 percent cap on the interest rates that banks charge their credit card customers.
Since the Treasury Department issued its recommendations for a comprehensive banking overhaul in February, Congress has already rejected the proposals to permit banks to enter the insurance and securities business more freely, and to be owned by industrial enterprises. The lawmakers also rejected the Treasury's recommendations to combine four regulatory agencies into two and to put modest limits on the coverage of deposit insurance.
 
Seriousness of the Situation
 "It is shocking to me that some in Congress are only now coming to realize the seriousness of the situation," Mr. Brady wrote in a letter today to Mr. Riegle. "Fundamental reform of our banking laws, already delayed, is not a we-can-get-it-later issue."
Congressional leaders also said they expected the House and Senate to provide new money for the savings and loan bailout before Congress adjourned, although by early evening it was unclear how much would be provided and when decisive votes on a spending measure would be cast.
Key lawmakers in the Senate appeared close to an agreement that would have given the Administration the $80 billion it has requested to continue the bailout, which has already cost nearly $80 billion since it began more than two years ago.
 
Risks of Symbolism
 But in the House, a financing measure was still in question, because a wing of the Republican party, led by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, had sought to attach what it called a broader economic stimulus package to the legislation. The Bush Administration has praised the package, and thus found itself on the verge of perhaps losing the savings and loan bailout financing for the symbolic support of a program that it knew stood no chance of being adopted today.
The lawmakers have had enormous difficulty providing new money for the unpopular program, and some members of Congress today predicted that a spending bill might not be taken up until the early hours of Wednesday morning.
Last year Congress adjourned without providing additional money for the rescue effort, but regulators received $18 billion in new financing after the Adminstration found what it said was a drafting glitch in the savings and loan legislation that permitted the additional money.
In March, the House rejected four bills before it finally approved one that provided $30 billion for the bailout.

HEADLINE: Broker to Let Soviet Citizens Trade U.S. Shares

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 26

 BODY:
A brokerage firm here announced today that it had made an arrangement that would allow people in the Soviet Union to buy and sell the stocks of American companies for the first time.
The firm, Montgomery Securities, does not expect Soviet citizens to stampede to snap up shares of A.T.&T. or I.B.M. Still, by allowing Soviet investors to participate in one of the central institutions of American capitalism, experts said the agreement represented a significant step toward the development of capital markets in the Soviet Union. 
 Fledgling stock exchanges in the Soviet Union "have been reaching out to Western broker-dealers," said James L. Cochrane, chief economist and senior vice president of the New York Stock Exchange. He said that the Montgomery agreement was the first he was aware of, but that he expected others to follow.
 
Restricted to 8 Stocks
 Seth J. Gersch, chief administrative officer and a managing director of Montgomery Securities, said trading would begin this Friday and would at first be restricted to eight companies. They are A.T.&T., Apple, BankAmerica, Boeing, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and I.B.M.
Mr. Gersch said each stock had to be approved by Soviet authorities and were chosen because they were considered high-quality companies that would be familiar to people in the Soviet Union.
Under the new arrangement, Soviet citizens and institutions will be able to place orders for the American stocks with Sovlex Ltd., a two-year-old Soviet brokerage firm that has a seat on the new Moscow Central Securities Exchange. Sovlex in turn will place the orders with Montgomery Securities, which will buy and sell the securities on American exchanges and hold the stock in the United States.
Mr. Gersch said his expectations about how much trading would be done in the Soviet Union were so low that "it will be very difficult not to exceed my expectations." But the venture could give Montgomery a leg up in eventually selling Soviet securities to Americans, he said.
Dozens of stock exchanges have been springing up in the Soviet Union in the last year. The Moscow Central Securities Exchange, one of the largest, trades shares in about 20 Soviet companies, according to Benjamin Lyon, an adjunct professor of Soviet law at the University of San Francisco who first introduced Sovlex to Montgomery in September.
But trading has been slow to catch on. The concept of buying and selling stocks in the Soviet Union is new and there have been questions about the legal status of stock ownership. In addition, many of the exchanges are barely more automated than the New York Stock Exchange was 200 years ago when brokers first met under a buttonwood tree in lower Manhattan.
Since Montgomery will not accept payment in rubles, a big question is how much hard currency is available in the Soviet Union for stock purchases. Mr. Lyon said that one Soviet study estimated there was as much as $19 billion in foreign currency in the Soviet Union that people were reluctant to invest in Soviet companies.

HEADLINE: AID DONORS INSIST ON KENYA REFORMS

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The United States and other aid-donor nations told Kenya today to introduce political and economic reforms and improvements in human rights or face major cuts in aid in six months.
The warning to the Government of President Daniel arap Moi, which has been widely accused of corruption and political repression, amounted to a rare, publicly acknowledged intervention by aid donors into the domestic political affairs of a developing nation. Governments and international lending institutions that give foreign aid usually link aid strictly to economic reforms, although political motivations are often seen behind aid programs. 
The talks took place as Mr. Moi came under growing political pressure, largely as a result of a public judicial inquiry into the 1990 slaying of Kenya's Foreign Minister, an opponent of corruption. As officials met here, Mr. Moi today ordered the arrest of two close associates who have been linked to the killing. However, Mr. Moi also suspended the public inquiry. [Page A9.]
"We sent a very strong message," said John R. Westley, a member of the American delegation and head of the Nairobi office of the Agency for International Development. "I don't think it's ever happened before -- no performance, no money in certain areas."
The 12 donor governments, which include Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Japan, criticized what they called the Moi Government's misuse of public funds. They also called for respect for human rights and backed opposition demands for greater pluralism in the one-party state.
The donor Governments said that while Kenya would continue to receive aid, they were refraining from their annual practice of making specific pledges of assistance. Instead, they imposed a stern, six-month probation period on the East African nation, linking full aid to reforms and improvements in human rights.
 
$800 Million a Year
 Donor nations and international institutions like the World Bank have given Kenya about $800 million in development aid over each of the past two years -- a figure equal to perhaps a third of the Kenyan Government's annual budget, although not all aid counts as Government budget revenue.
This fiscal year, Washington plans to grant $48 million in aid for agriculture and other economic programs, but American officials say that aid next year could be less that half that level unless reforms are forthcoming.
Kenya has long been one of the largest recipients of aid in Africa south of the Sahara because in the past the former British colony was a bright spot for economic development and political freedom in Africa. But in recent months aid donors have reconsidered their aid to Kenya as repression has grown and economic policies have stumbled.
Foreign aid is considered vital to the economically struggling country of 29 million people, which has one of the highest population growth rates in the world. In recent years the assistance has helped Kenya compensate for its chronically large external payments deficit, which in 1990 amounted to $476 million.
Over the past month, the Moi Government has arrested top opposition figures and used guns and batons to break up a pro-democracy march. Mr. Moi and close associates of his in the Government are widely believed to have become wealthy men over the years.
 
Arrest of Two Colleagues
 Two of Mr. Moi's closest associates, former Energy Minister Nicholas Biwott and and Hezekiah Oyugi, a former head of internal security, last week were publicly named in the Kenyan judicial inquiry as prime suspects in the slaying of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko, who was reportedly investigating high-level corruption. Toward the end of today's meeting, delegates learned that the two men were arrested today.
In their communique, the donor nations said, "Delegates underlined that good government is a prerequisite for equitable economic development and would therefore be a major factor influencing aid allocations."
With economic growth slowing and inflation climbing, the donor nations called for slashing the budget deficit, reforming the bloated civil service and privatizing many state enterprises. They also called on Nairobi to reduce capital flight and increase private sector confidence.
 
Consultation in Six Months
 The donor nations said that in six months they would consult again about aid to Kenya. Several delegates said they were optimistic that President Moi, facing strong pressure at home and abroad, had finally become serious about political and economic reform.
"What Kenya's partners were saying was we would like Kenya to maintain its leadership position," said Callisto Madavo, director of the World Bank's Eastern Africa Department. "We think that some of these issues that came up in the recent past could undermine that leadership. The donors are not walking away from Kenya. What the donors are saying is that a number of areas must be addressed."
Kenya's Vice President and Finance Minister, George Saitoti, said he was "very much satisfied" by the meeting, commenting that it was helpful to have a frank exchange between donor nations and Kenyan officials about its policies and problems. He also said that he was heartened that the donor nations said they would continue granting aid to his nation, even though they threatened cuts in aid.
Mr. Saitoti is among the officials named in the Kenyan judicial inquiry as having demanded bribes from foreign companies seeking business in the country.
At a news conference, Vice President Saitoti repeatedly asserted that his Government was serious about introducing a multi-party system and rooting out corruption.
"The basic point is Kenya is not opposed to transformation to a multiparty system," he said. Later he added that it was clear that the donors "want us to speed up the reforms on the political front and economic front."

HEADLINE: Transit Bill Seen as Boon to Metro Area

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
With its heavy reliance on mass transit, the New York metropolitan region should be a major beneficiary of the six-year, $151 billion transportation bill nearing approval in Congress.
Although it is certain to cause temporary inconvenience, legislators from the region were ecstatic about the bill. They said it has many plums for the region and will jump start highway and mass transit construction throughout the area. 
 "Gone are the days when the mindset down here was to pave America coast to coast," said Sherwood L. Boehlert of Utica, N.Y., the senior Republican Representative from the region on the House-Senate conference committee. "Now we recognize the interconnections of all kinds of transportation. The concept of flexibility is everywhere you look."
The House and Senate are expected to approve the bill and the President is expected to sign it. The funds would begin to be available immediately since Federal transporation aid expired on Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.
In a radical philosophical change that should provide a major boost to mass transit, the bill ends the era in which superhighways were built to weave todether the country's regions into a nation and relegates the Federal Government to the role of a benevolent banker handing out money to the states, who are to decide how to spend it.
That will allow the region, which completed most of its interstate highway network years ago, to dedicate a greater proportion of its money to mass transit. While the bill retains Federal operating subsidies for mass transit at current levels, making a scheduled fare increase on New York City subways and buses almost certain, it almost doubles mass transit financing for capital spending, according to preliminary figures.
 
Rare Good News
 The Federal Government will also be giving much more money to New York and New Jersey for highway maintenance and construction. New York will receive $6.1 billion in the next six years, an average of $1.02 billion a year, compared with $3.647 billion in the last five years, $729.4 million a year, according to preliminary figures. That is an increase of 40.4 percent a year. New Jersey will do even better. It will receive $3.3 billion in the next six years, an average of $546.5 million a year, compared with $2.1 billion average for the last five, or $419.6 million a year, according to the preliminary statistics. That is a jump of 57 percent a year.
But Connecticut's share of Federal transportation money will fall. It will get $2 billion in the next six years, or an average of $333 million a year, compared with $1.9 billion in the last five years, an average of $390.4 million. That is a 14.7 percent drop.
Legislators emphasized that the figures released today provide little more than a basis for comparison with financing from previous years.
The bill is one of the few pieces of good news for a region buffeted by the recession and state budget gaps, which are forcing sharp cutbacks in services and thousands of layoffs. The first major rewrite of the country's highway program in 35 years, the legislation is expected to create thousands of jobs and should touch every family in the country, helping to set everything from the price of bread to real-estate values.
"Transportation is the bedrock of the economy; it's where everything starts and ends," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is credited by legislators from both parties with masterminding much of the legislation.
New York State will also receive $5.9 billion over the six years for mass transit, an average of $983 million a year, compared with $2.8 billion in the last five years, or $550 million a year.
"It's great for New York," said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York. "It brings in big-time dollars and that means real jobs. This is bringing home the bacon and not the baloney."
Connecticut officials were as jubilant as their counterparts in New York and Jersey. Legislators said the decline was deceptive since the state delayed spending on the interstate program. They said the bill gives Connecticut $1.70 for every $1 it sends here in fuel taxes and that the amount it receives in apportionments would jump to $2 billion in the next six years.
"We did wonderfully," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. "It's big money in tough times. It will produce lots of jobs. It's good medicine."


GRAPHIC: Besides general road and rail maintenance and upgrading work, the region's three states plan to use some of the money to be provided by the Federal transportation bill nearing approval in Congress yesterday for major projects. Here are some projects to be wholly or partly financed by the new Federal money.
 
NEW YORK
 
WIDEN LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY: Add a fourth lane in each direction in Nassau and western Suffolk counties.
 
REBUILD GOWANUS EXPRESSAY: Major rehabilitation in Brooklyn and Queens, including road resurfacing and viaduct work.
 
NEW IND SUBWAY LINK: Exjtend the 63d Street Tunnel, which carries the B and Q trains from Manhattan to Roosevelt Island before ending at 21st Street in Long Island City, Queens, to a new connection with the E and F lines near Queens Plaza.
 
NEW JERSEY
 
NEW RAIL TRANSFER HUBS: In Secaucus, a new hub station to allow transfers among five North Jersey rail line. In Kearny, a new track connection allowing trains from several additional lines to be routed directly to Penn Station. Currently the lines end at Hoboken, where riders must switch to PATH trains to cross the Hudson.
 
WATERFRONT TRANSIT LINE: A trolley and bus line along the Hudson waterfront from Edgewater to Bayonne.
 
HUDSON TRUCK ROUTES: Improved routes for the trucks that haul goods between rail terminals along the Hudson for shipment onto New York and New England.
 
CONNECTICUT
 
ROUTE 384 EXTENSION: Add 11 miles to Interstate 384 in Eastern Connecticut, from where it new ends in Bolton to a point near Willimantic, where it would connect with U.S. Route 6.
 
WIDEN I-95 AND ROUTE 1: Add capacity to both main roads serving the crowded coastal corridor in southwestern Connecticut, indluding high-occupancy vehicle lanes on the interstate.
 
UPGRADE METRO NORTH LINES: Station and track upgrades on the Metro North comuter railroad main line and branches in Connecticut.

HEADLINE: Compromise Is Reached on $151 Billion Bill Revising U.S. Transit Financing

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
House and Senate negotiators today unanimously endorsed a compromise on a transportation bill and said it was likely to have the support of big majorities in both chambers.
The Bush Administration also endorsed the bill, which is to provide $151 billion over six years: $119 billion for highway programs and $32 billion for mass transportation. 
 The breakthrough to a compromise, after what one participant called "a war of attrition" lasting two weeks, came when lawmakers who had been holding out for more money for their states accepted provisions guaranteeing every state a share of the transportation money equal to at least 90 percent of the Federal fuel taxes collected in that state.
In some cases, that meant that members of the conference committee shifted big blocks of money to one state or another. For example, it appears that Florida won an additional $300 million at the insistence of Senator Bob Graham, a Democrat. It is unclear which states were the losers in this particular shift.
The negotiating and trading were necessary because under Senate rules any senator could have blocked a vote on the bill long enough to thwart the leadership's goal of passage before the Thanksgiving recess.
 
How Money Will Be Allocated
 Of the bill's $151 billion total, $114 billion is to be apportioned among the states using complex formulas involving highway mileage, population, gasoline consumption and other factors. But the negotiators found it nearly impossible to devise formulas that would satisfy the necessary number of lawmakers in each house, and in the end they resorted to making bonus grants to a number of states.
Of the $114 billion to be handed out under the bill's highway allocation formulas, $6.1 billion is for New York State, putting it behind only California at $10.5 billion and Texas at $7.1 billion. New Jersey is to get $3.3 billion, and Connecticut $2 billion.
But the New York City metropolitan region will also be a major beneficiary of mass transportation grants that are not governed by the highway formulas. The bill nearly doubles the rate of transit spending nationally, to $32 billion over six years. How that money breaks down by state is not yet known.
The bill's eventual approval had been foretold Monday, mainly because members viewed it as an economic stimulus.
"This is a jobs bill as well as a transportation bill," said Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt, Republican of Arkansas.
But it took all night to massage the dollar figures from complex financing formulas so that its acceptance could be insured.
 
Praise From Administration
 Some refinements in the bill's language were still being made today, before the measure was sent to the floor of the House and then to the Senate.
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner praised the legislation. "Although this piece of legislation was long overdue, Congressional leaders from both parties deserve credit for passing a win-win compromise," he said.
Secretary Skinner said most of the Administration's main ideas were included in the final bill, if not in the exact form originally proposed. But he conceded that the Administration lost on some points, including its early insistence that the states pay a greater share of transportation costs.
"We lost that because the states are broke," Mr. Skinner said. "Had I known how broke the states were going to be, I might not have been as aggressive."
Federal aid to states for highways and mass transit expired Sept. 30, the end of the last fiscal year, and since then contractors for state projects have begun to lay off thousands of construction workers.
The new legislation departs from transportation programs of the past 40 years, the era that saw the construction of the Interstate highway system, by giving states vastly more flexibility in deciding whether to spend Federal money on highways or on mass transit. The bill also gives much more discretion on spending to local governments. In the past, such aid has been earmarked in Washington for one purpose or the other.
 
Aid for Air Quality
 The bill is also expected to give states $6 billion that will be specifically intended to ease congestion and help meet air quality standards established by the 1990 clean air law.
It includes $24 billion in one fund that can be used entirely for transit or highways, as each state sees fit, and most of this money must be spent in major metropolitan areas, where the cities will have the power to decide how the money is to be used.
William J. Roberts, legislative director of the Environmental Defense Fund, termed the legislation "a strong environmental bill and a strong energy bill, too."
"Congress finally put a stop to the backward policy that penalized states for using transit and other programs that conserve energy," he said. "Congress finally broke the highway interests' stranglehold on transportation funding."
Of the $151 billion total, $32 billion is for mass transit, nearly doubling the annual amount available for these purposes. There are new transit projects planned in many locales around the country, including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Portland, Ore., Northern California and New Jersey.
The bill also promises to pay for technological innovations, like $500 million for high-speed trains that would ride on magnetic cushions rather than steel wheels, a favorite project of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. It will also finance "smart" cars and highways equipped with computers to help speed the flow of traffic, a $660 million project backed by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey.
Safety provisions in the bill will make big differences in automobile design, including airbags for both drivers and front-seat passengers in new cars beginning with the 1998 model year.

HEADLINE: Without Wife at Side, He Loses Zest for Job

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 21

 BODY:
It started as a summertime romance between two college kids in the 1950's. He was working on the Oakland waterfront tossing boxes in a warehouse; she was keypunching computer cards in the office. He thought she was "cute."
They married in 1958 and ultimately rose to the top of the University of California, he as president of the nine-campus system, she as the official associate of the president, his constant companion in all matters private and official. 
 But last Feb. 8 when Libby Gardner, 55 years old, died of a rare bone cancer and the congestive heart failure it caused, the process of leaving one of the most prestigious posts in higher education began for David P. Gardner. On Nov. 14, after nine months of grieving, he announced he could no longer serve as president without the woman he loved.
"This job as an all-consuming position," he said in an interview a week later in the 22d-floor office near downtown Oakland from which he oversees the 166,000-student university. "I cannot find my way clear to reconstruct my life, to rebuild it, as long as I'm doing this job. What I am now doing alone, we had been doing together. And it's not the same thing."
He said he had not made any plans except that he wanted to remain active in education.
 
Rebuilt University
 The 58-year-old Mr. Gardner is widely credited with having rebuilt the university after about 15 years of suffering at the hands of governors and legislators resentful of its role in antiwar and other protests. He will leave office next Oct. 1 with the university once again in financial crisis, but this time because of recession.
"As I leave, there is not an unwillingness to fund it, but an incapacity to fund it," he said. "So even though we are confronting some perilous fiscal waters, it is for a completely different set of reasons."
He proudly catalogued his accomplishments since 1983: the university recovered just about all the state support it lost under Governors Ronald Reagan and Edmund G. Brown Jr.; faculty salaries, which had dropped to 16 percent below those at similar universities, are now comparable again; the construction of $3.7 billion in new buildings; plans started for a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley; an expanded education-abroad program, and a broadening of access to students from historically underrepresented minority groups. There were also conflicts, like his losing battle against the regents' insistence on divesting the university's stocks in companies doing business in South Africa.
His job is not to administer the campuses, which enjoy considerable academic autonomy under local chancellors, but to protect the system politically and deal with political leaders. If his style seems a little remote, imperial and moralistic to some, none can deny that Mr. Gardner is one of the most powerful university presidents in the land. He earns $243,500, which makes him by far the highest paid state official in California; he oversees a budget of more than $6 billion a year.
A moderate conservative politically, he is widely regarded as extraordinarily adept at the intricacies of California politics. Polished, unflappable and analytical, Mr. Gardner speaks extemporaneously as though he had written it all down and carefully edited his words.
"He is about as good at running big complex institutions as anybody I've ever seen," said Ira Michael Heyman, until recently chancellor of the flagship Berkeley campus, who had a number of disagreements with the president.
Mr. Heyman, now a professor of law at Berkeley, said he had sensed that Mr. Gardner would quit six months ago, when the president came to his home for dinner and discussed his mourning. "It's a very tough job to do all by yourself," Mr. Heyman said.
The job is likely to get tougher. The university's share of the state budget is declining, and its implied promise to accept the top eighth of all California high school graduates is in jeopardy, as are Mr. Gardner's efforts to expand access to minority students. Mr. Gardner said he had decided to stay on until October because he regarded the upcoming budget year as crucial, not one for a new president "unacquainted with the key players, issues and eccentric politics of California."
 
At His Side
 In all his jobs, Mr. Gardner was accompanied by Elizabeth Fuhriman Gardner, who worked as dental hygienist in Berkeley until the first of their four daughters arrived. His jobs, as a vice chancellor at the Santa Barbara campus, as president of the University of Utah and now at California, all involved of public relations and travel, and Libby Gardner was usually at his side.
"Instead of going off at night by myself, we would be together," he said. "We found it to be a very attractive set of employment conditions that caused us to come together rather than be pulled apart because of the demands of the position."
In 1987, the university conferred on Libby Gardner a new title, associate of the president, an unpaid position that recognized her supportive role. Numerous other universities followed suit, recognizing the supportive function of the spouses of their presidents.
After his wife's death in February, Mr. Gardner spent most of May in Asia on a mission for the Asia Foundation, hoping that the time away would help him recover. But he returned home to the empty house in Orinda, and matters did not improve.
He said he did not make his decision until Nov. 9, when he was in Hawaii for the dedication of the university's new Keck Telescope on the Mauna Kea volcano. After the dedication on the chilly peak, he returned to his hotel, suffering from a bad case of influenza, and wrote his letter of resignation. The words reflected his deep Mormon faith in an afterlife:
"Death has now dissolved our partnership, at least for this life, although according to our faith not forever; and it has become clearer with each passing month since Libby's death that without her I cannot remain as president of the University of California."

HEADLINE: Veteran Strategist and Outsiders' Champion Shows Up in Brown Campaign

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 26

 BODY:
They are the political odd couple of the year: Edmund G. Brown Jr., the ascetic former Governor of California who recently completed a seven-year sabbatical from politics, and Patrick H. Caddell, the political strategist who has made a career of trying to ride alienated outsiders to victory over the establishment and who also appears to be trying to make a political comeback after several years of self-imposed exile.
Mr. Brown, Jerry to friends, kicked off his third bid for the Presidency on Oct. 21 with an iconoclastic declaration that America was in decline, a blast at the two main political parties and greedy, corrupt politics and a pledge not to accept campaign contributions larger than $100. With him that day at Independence Hall in Philadelphia was the imposing bearded figure of Mr. Caddell, a man widely credited with devising a similar outsider strategy that Jimmy Carter used to gain the White House 15 years ago. 
 When Mr. Brown, a Democrat, announced in September that he was exploring a possible Presidential bid, Mr. Caddell said in an interview: "My role is nothing. I am a friend of his. I will never be a political consultant again."
 
An Increasing Role
 But since then, Mr. Caddell's role has appeared to be larger and larger. He often travels with the candidate, told reporters in Philadelphia that he helped craft the announcement speech, and helped arrange visits with potential supporters on a recent visit by Mr. Brown to the Boston area. And he gave to Mr. Brown a political treatise that has played a significant role in what Mr. Brown calls "our insurgent campaign to take back America."
The 145-page treatise was written in September by Richard N. Goodwin, a former speech writer and confidant of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson who is an old friend of Mr. Caddell. Titled "From the Concord Bridge: A Declaration," the unpublished document calls for a new movement to arrest what Mr. Goodwin saw as growing unfairness, political corruption, economic class divisions and "our slow descent from greatness."
In announcing his candidacy, Mr. Brown took significant passages verbatim from the Goodwin essay and paraphrased others without mentioning the source. They were part of a much longer speech that included other themes apparently not drawn from the Goodwin document.
Interviewed Sunday at his home in Concord, Mass., Mr. Goodwin said he did not know that Mr. Brown had used some of his words, but that he was pleased the candidate had given them wider currency.
"That's fine," he said. "I have to admit I'm delighted." Mr. Brown spent a night at Mr. Goodwin's home on the recent visit to Boston.
Mr. Goodwin said that earlier this year he had spent a few hours discussing his ideas with Mr. Brown.
 
'Thelma and Louise'
 The Brown-Goodwin connection underscores the guiding role of Mr. Caddell. He said that he has known Mr. Brown since 1974, but that he had grown increasingly close to him in the last year and a half as Mr. Brown at first announced his candidacy for a Unites States Senate seat, then dropped that in September to explore a Presidential bid.
Political commentators have dubbed them the "Thelma and Louise" of politics, an allusion to the film about two rebellious and self-destructive women.
The 53-year-old Mr. Brown, son of another California Governor, Edmund G. Brown, served from 1975 to 1983 and made two failed stabs at the Democratic Presidential nomination, in 1976 and 1980. He lost a Senate race in 1982. He then withdrew from politics, studying Zen Buddhism in Japan and working with Mother Teresa in India. He returned as chairman of the California Democratic Party in 1989, raising millions of dollars from the political fat cats he now denounces.
His is a grass roots campaign aimed at energizing average people and capitalizing on a perceived alienation from the political system. On television and radio talk shows he urges people to call a toll-free 800 number to pledge $100 each -- one-tenth the legal limit for individuals -- and volunteer their time.
 
A Professional Outsider
 If the outsider role is somewhat new to Mr. Brown, it is not to Mr. Caddell. Many who know him say he is a professional outsider and critic of the establishment. "It's always death to tyrants, down with the walls, burn and pillage," said John Gorman, a former business partner. "He's always wanted to have the French Revolution at his doorstep."
After Mr. Carter's loss in 1980, Mr. Caddell tried to ride two other Presidential horses, former Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, but they both went lame. By 1987, the assertive and often abrasive consultant had fallen out with many of his associates and he moved from Washington to California to go into television and film production, swearing off politics.
In an interview today, the 41-year-old Mr. Caddell said he remained only an unpaid adviser to Mr. Brown but left open the possibility of a more formal role. "I've give Jerry some advice as a friend," he said. "I've given the campaign some ideas, information, advice. That's the way I would define it.
"I don't do politics professionally any more. If I support a candidate I do it as an individual. If that situation were to change, I will say something. My dilemma is that I feel very strong about the message Jerry Brown is speaking. I am reluctant about the political combat. I understand what this business is about and the prospect of being more deeply involved that I had envisioned carries all the trepidation of going off the wagon. I'm a friend for the moment. That leaves the door ajar because it does not say. It implies that maybe something will alter, maybe not."
Mr. Caddell has the reputation of casting a Svengali-like spell over candidates with his forceful personality and keen intellect. But Mr. Brown's associates say they doubt that the intellectual Mr. Brown can so easily be controlled. Nathan Gardels, a former economics adviser to him as Governor, said that Mr. Brown deeply felt the alienation that he is expressing.
Joe Costello, Mr. Brown's press spokesman, played down the Caddell role. "Pat is a friend of the candidate," he said. "He has no official title within the campaign." He said Mr. Brown wrote his own speeches.
Requests for interview of Mr. Brown placed through both Mr. Costello and Mr. Caddell got no response.
The connection with Mr. Goodwin is a curious political twist. Widely regarded in his youth as a political thinker, Mr. Goodwin served as a speech writer and adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. He later went on to teach at Harvard University, where Mr. Caddell went to college.
 
A Cry for Change
 The treatise Mr. Brown used is to be published by Times Books, a subsidiary of Random House. He said he had sent drafts to a number of political leaders, including Governor Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a Democratic candidate for President.
The document amounts to an anguished cry over the state of the American political economy. For nearly a quarter of a century, he wrote, the basic American precept of opportunity and the chance to better oneself has been seriously eroded. "Instead increasing numbers of Americans must struggle to maintain what they have already achieved. And for many it is a losing battle," he wrote.
Strong echoes, some verbatim, of the Goodwin treatise can be found in the words of Mr. Brown. In his Oct. 21 speech, Mr. Brown stressed the "whirlwind of decline" facing America and denounced "an unholy alliance of private greed and corrupt politics."
"In reality, there is only one party: It's the Incumbent Party," Mr. Brown told his audience in front of Independence Hall, in one section that closely matched the Goodwin essay. "There are, of course, two major political organizations with different names, but at their core they are the same. They share the same world view and they serve the power of the same private interests."
Mr. Goodwin wrote: "The reality is that we no longer have a two-party system. There is only one: It is the Washington Party. There are, of course, two major political organizations with different names. But, with several honorable exceptions, members of both parties gratefully receive huge sums from the same corporate and individual oligarchy, serve the same interests."
 
Similar on Ideology
 There were also similarities on the question of the lack of partisan ideology. "When there are no substantial differences, there is no choice to be made," Mr. Brown said. "And without choices, there is no democracy."
Mr. Goodwin's essay said: "For without substantial divisions of ideology, there is no choice to be made. And without choice there is no democracy."
Mr. Brown does not appear to have adopted the full message of the Goodwin essay. The essay was far more radical than Mr. Brown's speech, calling, for instance, on the United States to erect protectionist barriers to shield its economy from foreign competition.
Mr. Caddell expressed anger that the similarities with the essay would figure in a news account. "Tell me one candidate who writes every word himself," he said. "Jerry Brown came up with this campaign. He is responsible for his own ideas. To suggest that he is not genuine about this is an outrage."
He demanded that other candidates' messages be given similar scrutiny. "If that is the level of concern, will it be applied to every other candidate, or it is a selective concern?" he asked.

HEADLINE: Son, Stepdaughter, 3 Others Held in Sergeant's Killing

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELVIDERE, N.J., Nov. 26

 BODY:
Five people, including a son and stepdaughter, were charged today with murder and conspiracy in the ambush slaying of a campus police sergeant outside his home on a country road in rural Allamuchy Township Saturday night.
The Warren County prosecutor, Richard C. Hare, said the five had plotted to kill the sergeant, Revell Quince, a 43-year-old shift supervisor on the police force at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, because in the 1980's he had been accused of sexually and physically abusing his stepdaughter, Cynthia Gregory, a 22-year-old supermarket cashier. 
 State officials, including the Division of Youth and Family Services, investigated Ms. Gregory's charges at the time, but were unable to substantiate them, said Lieut. Gary P. Dundon, a detective on Mr. Hare's staff, and no charges were brought against Sergeant Quince. Neither Lieutenant Dundon nor Mr. Hare would comment further.
 
Half-Brother Charged
 Besides Ms. Gregory, those charged today were her half-brother, William Quince, 20, a mailroom clerk; her boyfriend, Donald A. Lucas, 24, of Columbia, N.J., a foreman at a muffler shop; his brother, Jeffrey Lucas, 18, of Columbia, who is unemployed, and Brian C. Bastedo, 24, of Mount Bethel, Pa., who is also unemployed. Mr. Bastedo was identified as a boyfriend of Sergeant Quince's other stepdaughter, Susan Ahart. Ms. Ahart was not charged.
William Quince, Cynthia Gregory and Susan Ahart are the children of Mr. Quince's first wife. His current wife, who was at home at the time of the killing, is Diane Quince.
Christopher Quince, an 18-year-old son of the sergeant who was shot in the foot during the attack, presumably as his father tried to defend himself, also was not charged.
The five suspects were arrested at about 11 P.M. Monday after extensive questioning, the investigators said.
 
Second-Hand Rifle
 Mr. Hare said the five purchased a second-hand .308 rifle for $206 and a used .32-caliber handgun for $205 at a gun store in East Bangor, Pa., a few weeks ago.
Mr. Hare said Jeffrey Lucas, the gunman in the plot, hid with the rifle in a rocky outcropping 50 yards from the Quince home, waiting two hours for Sergeant Quince to return from work. As the sergeant approached his front door, he was shot three times.
Mr. Lucas then fled in a car driven by Mr. Bastedo, Mr. Hare said, and returned to the Lucas home, where the other three suspects were waiting. The five then devised an alibi, he said, and threw the rifle and two spent shell casings into the Paulinskill River near Columbia.
He also said the five, using the same plan, had attempted to ambush Sergeant Quince at his home on Oct. 25, but the rifle failed to fire because of a broken firing pin.
This morning, State Police divers recovered the rifle from 15 feet of water in the Paulinskill River, Mr. Hare said.

HEADLINE: Do Arrests Increase the Rates Of Repeated Domestic Violence?

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
WHEN the police arrest men who are assaulting their wives or lovers, it can sometimes lead to more attacks once the men are released, according to a major new study of domestic violence.
The new findings suggest that factors in the men's lives, like whether they have jobs, affect the likelihood that they will strike again. As a result, the findings call into question the current wisdom among criminologists, that arresting their attackers is the best way to protect battered women from further violence. The findings also challenge the effectiveness of recent laws in 15 states and the District of Columbia that require arrests in all cases of domestic battery. 
 But experts cautioned against wholesale legislative changes based on the new research. Some said the new findings suggested that lawmakers had moved too quickly after earlier research.
 
Role of Joblessness
 Those law changes were based on an influential 1983 study showing that arrests helped ease domestic violence. But the new findings, from 1,200 cases of domestic violence in Milwaukee, show that arrested men who were unemployed were 44 percent more likely to assault their mates during the year after being released from jail than were men who had jobs. The rate was 750 repeat assaults per thousand unemployed men and only 503 assaults per 1,000 employed men.
But among those who had jobs, being arrested led to a 16 percent lower rate of violence toward their mates over the course of the year. The rate was 599 repeat assaults per 1,000 men after a warning and 503 repeat assaults per 1,000 after an arrest.
"The evidence forces us to confront the fact that mandatory arrests in domestic violence cases may cause more violence against women in the long run," said Lawrence W. Sherman, a criminologist at the University of Maryland, who led both the current research and the 1983 study.
"In communities with high unemployment, the net effect of an arrest policy is more violence," Dr. Sherman said. "But in cities where there is little unemployment, arrests should lead to an overall decrease in domestic violence." He said police officers who intervene should have more flexibility in deciding whether to warn or arrest the offender, to have the man leave for several hours or to take the victim to a safe place.
Violence from men is a major cause of death and injury for American women. In about one-third of killings of woman, the killer is her spouse or boyfriend, said James Mercy, an epidemiologist at the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Homicide is the leading cause of death among black women from 15 to 34 years old, and the fourth leading cause of death among white women in that age range.
The Milwaukee study found that a woman had a 7 percent chance of being assaulted again immediately after the police left if they did not make an arrest and a 2 percent chance of being attacked by the man as soon as he returned from jail if he was arrested.
But the protective effects of arrests do not last long. Within two months of an incident of domestic violence, there was no difference in the rate of assaults between men who had been arrested and those who had only received a warning. And for men who were out of work, over the course of the following year they were 12 percent more likely to repeat the violence if they had been arrested than if they had only been warned.
"It sometimes may be better to have the woman leave the house in police custody and go to a relative's home or safe house where the suspect can't find her while he's angry," Dr. Sherman said. "But it's not always necessary or advisable to arrest the man to protect the woman."
Forensic experts have been uneasy about the substantial impact the 1983 study had in changing arrest laws in domestic violence.
"It's always premature to base a legal policy on a single study," said Dr. Albert J. Reiss Jr., a sociologist at Yale University who is chairman of the National Academy of Sciences panel on violent behavior. "If the mandatory arrest laws have a negative effect, it's a good reason to go back to discretion of local jurisdictions."
Dr. Sherman said he believed his 1983 study showed that arresting men who are assaulting their mates decreased later violence because it was done in Minneapolis, which at the time had a very low rate of unemployment.
The new findings are from one of six studies set in motion by the Justice Department in an attempt to verify the findings of the 1983 Minneapolis experiment.
In all the studies, the response of police officers to calls of "moderate" domestic violence, where there was no severe injuries, varied at random on whether they arrested or warned the man involved. Researchers later interviewed the victims and tracked police reports to see whether the man repeated the violence.
Studies in Omaha and Charlotte, N.C., whose results were announced last year, did not find that arrests had a deterrent effect in domestic violence. But when Dr. Sherman and colleagues later re-analyzed the Omaha data for the effects of employment, they found that arrests lowered rates of later violence for men with jobs, but not for the unemployed.
Other experts in criminology, however, are more skeptical about the new study's implications, saying it may be premature once again to change laws based on one or two research findings. "I'm not willing to say what conclusions you should draw until I can examine the findings from all six studies," said Dr. James Q. Wilson, a sociologist at University of California at Los Angeles, who is chairman of the Police Foundation, a private research organization in Washington.
"There are so many reasons you can be unemployed that I can't see why a grab-bag category like that would have a particular effect," Dr. Wilson said. "It might have to do with a hidden factor, like impulsivity. The whole question needs more careful study before the policy implications are clear."

HEADLINE: Is a Turkey Forgotten A Turkey Forgone?

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
THANKSGIVING doesn't exactly come as a surprise. It is always near the end of November, and always on a Thursday. But for some reason, a lot of people don't know until the very last minute -- like tonight -- what they will be doing or whom they will be doing it with.
Maybe there are so many Thanksgiving procrastinators because it's so easy to put off planning for the holiday. It's not like Christmas. You don't have to run around and buy gifts for people you rarely see or barely know. With Thanksgiving, you can decide at the last minute to celebrate, and you don't even have to cook. This is definitely why restaurants were invented. 
 More than any other holiday, Thanksgiving has remained uncommercial and true to a certain limited goal: to give thanks and eat. And for most people, it is a time to be with family. But eating isn't always so simple, and families rarely are.
"I'm absolutely terrified of being sucked into any family arrangement," said Corinna Harmon, who lives in New York near many of her relatives. "I get claustrophobic. You are expected to stay inside or go for a military walk. Then you are expected to eat at a time you've never eaten. Then you make yourself sick. Then you're so upset at how much you ate that you get drunk. And then you have a hangover. And somebody always expresses disapproval of somebody's husband."
It's not that she doesn't like her relatives. "I think they're all great," she said. "I like to visit them any other day of the year." But on Thanksgiving, she said, "too many dynamics are floating around." Over the years, she and her husband have trained their relatives not to invite them, though they have the option to show up at the last minute. They rarely do. Tomorrow, she will probably go to a movie, or maybe a Japanese restaurant.
But procrastination doesn't always stem from fear of family. A woman who works as a secretary in a Manhattan publishing house, and who insisted that her name not be used, said she and her boyfriend would like to have a traditional Thanksgiving, but they live in New York and the relatives and friends they really like all live far away. She said she finds that sad but, seeming not at all sad, she pointed out that "it's the post-modern malaise."
The woman, who wanted anonymity to avoid insulting the relatives who do live nearby, said she and her boyfriend would probably rent a car and go for a drive. "The question is where," she said. Going to a restaurant for turkey is out.
"We were at P. J. Clarke's last year," she said. "It was very depressing. Just the idea of paying for this family meal . . ." Cooking is out, too. "I wouldn't know how to," she said. "I would be completely overwhelmed."
She is not alone in being intimidated by Thanksgiving cooking. Most people, in fact, don't make their own turkey. Seventy-five percent of Americans will eat turkey on Thanksgiving, but only one in four households will actually prepare it, said Harry Balzer, who studies eating habits for the NPD Group, a market research company in Chicago. "The moral of the story is be a guest," Mr. Balzer said.
Everybody knows that someone, somewhere, is probably cooking a dinner, and that if they wait long enough, the right invitation will come. Arline Bronzaft, a professor of psychology at the City University of New York who has studied motivation, said procrastinators are often actually quite efficient, because they have discovered a clever way for someone else to take care of a problem. "It gets resolved because somebody else steps in and does it," she said.
That's exactly what Paul Wachtel is waiting for. Although not by nature a procrastinator, he decided this year that he didn't want to cook for Thanksgiving because he had just given a big birthday party for a relative. In the past, he said, his mother has offered to have him and his wife and daughter for Thanksgiving, and he has always said: "Oh no. Come to our place." Strangely, his mother hasn't made the offer this year.
"We've been waiting for her to ask and she hasn't said a word," said Mr. Wachtel, an economist who teaches at the New York University graduate school of business. If his mother doesn't come through, what will he do?
"That's a good question."
His 4-year-old daughter, Rachel, knows Thanksgiving is coming and expects to celebrate. "If my mother doesn't come through in the clutch," he said, "we'll have to do something for her."
Even for those who don't have a Thanksgiving tradition, the holiday can be a wistful time. Nina Newby is a native, but she was reared in New York by her grandparents, who were European immigrants. "They didn't celebrate Thanksgiving," she said. "It's always a weird time. You know the world is out there, doing something."
Slavko Slavov is from Bulgaria, but he said he considers Thanksgiving one of the best holidays. "You give thanks for being alive and healthy, all together," he said. But he has no family in this country. Although he is occasionally invited to someone's house, he usually doesn't go. "I feel like I'm a stranger," he said. "This is a family holiday."
So today, just as he did last year, he will probably call some friends and organize an impromptu Thanksgiving at a restaurant.
Even natives who have been dedicated followers of the rites become exhausted with the process. After years of cooking huge meals, with six or seven pies to top them off, Gloria Nicholson is finished with Thanksgiving. Her four children are grown and scattered all over the world.
Mrs. Nicholson, a homemaker in Queens, doesn't know exactly what she will do on Thanksgiving, but it will probably be something very quiet, like fixing a Cornish hen and having dinner with her husband. "After you do one thing for 20 years," she said, "you want something different."
This year, Lexann Richter definitely wanted to avoid days of cooking and crowds of people in her Manhattan apartment. "I'm pregnant, so I thought I'd give myself a break," she said. Ms. Richter and her husband decided to go away to an old inn in some quaint place like Nantucket or Sag Harbor, L.I. "We would tiptoe down this lovely staircase to a wonderful dinner someone else had cooked," she said.
But when they called around last week, "every place was closed for the season or fully booked," she said. Anxiously, she began querying her friends, but they turned up no appealing last-minute possibilities; one friend, in fact, was planning to have Chinese food.
Yesterday morning, growing desperate, she called the inns again, hoping for cancellations. There were none. Then, she said with the glee that every procrastinator knows, "a friend called out of the blue."
 
Fast Food It's Not, but Fast Enough
ALTHOUGH a Thanksgiving dinner usually requires hours in the kitchen, it is possible to make a good meal quickly. The menu might include turkey, stuffing, fresh cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes mashed with a little milk, frozen peas and a store-bought pumpkin pie. Shopping and cooking takes two hours or less. It may not be fancy -- we're not talking chutney or fresh roasted chestnuts -- but it will be tasty and traditional, and custom made for the most time-defying procrastinator.
 
The Turkey
 Buy a fresh turkey with a thermometer already embedded in the flesh. Most supermarkets have them. The thermometer simply pops up when the turkey is done. Cook the turkey at 325 degrees. Don't be foolish and decide to trust the clock instead of the thermometer. Check the turkey often. A nine-pound turkey was supposed to take three hours. The thermometer popped up 45 minutes earlier than expected, but the turkey was perfect. To double-check with a meat thermometer, insert into the thigh without touching the bone. The Federal Government recommends a temperature of 180 degrees to insure against salmonella growth.

HEADLINE: LACKING SUPPORT, DEMOCRATS GIVE UP ON CRIME MEASURE

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
House leaders abandoned an anti-crime bill Tuesday night in the face of President Bush's veto threat. And even though negotiators reached an agreement on a transportation bill and neared one on keeping the bank insurance fund afloat, House Democrats discussed extending the session into next month.
Speaker Thomas S. Foley said the House Committee on Ways and Means would hold hearings on tax proposals next week. He said it had not been decided whether the entire House would come back to work in December. 
 Mr. Bush's threat that he would veto the crime bill because it was not tough enough left it crippled, without support from House Republicans. Moreover, backing from enough Democrats to pass it was not available because of defections by liberals who disliked its death penalties, Southern conservatives who agreed with Mr. Bush and opponents of its handgun control provisions. Lacking the votes, House leaders would not bring up the bill.
 
Uncertain Schedule
 On the banking legislation, negotiators appeared to lose steam during the night after considerable progress during the day. They had scrapped provisions to ease interstate banking, the last of the changes in fundamental banking law the Administration has been seeking all year as it sought to strengthen the industry. They agreed to do little more than increase the credit line of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits and is nearly insolvent. [Article, Page D1.]
House Republican pressure to force a vote on tax cuts, which they said would stimulate economic growth, led to the uncertainty about whether Congress would adjourn before dawn today, as it had planned. Seeing an opportunity to make some political capital of their own, Democrats met for more than an hour late Tuesday night, discussing the advantages of a counter-offensive on tax cuts for the middle-class.
 
Senate Recesses
 The difficulty of getting all details of essential bills settled was also a factor in the delay. But Senate leaders from both parties publicly urged the House to finish its work and send the bills to the Senate so both bodies could leave for the year by morning.
They displayed much less interest than did House leaders in any December session. Shortly after midnight, the Senate recessed until morning, when it expected some legislation to have arrived from the House, starting with a $7.5 billion catchall spending bill, which included aid for the Soviet Union. That was the first bill on the House floor early today, with the transportation measure expected to follow.
The transportation bill, a six-year, $151 billion measure that would increase state leeway in spending decisions and double Federal spending on mass transit, made more progress than the banking bill. House and Senate conferees announced agreement Tuesday afternoon, and the Bush Administration endorsed their compromise.
At the Capitol Tuesday, the atmosphere was disordered and cranky, as if the Congress seemed bent on displaying in what it hoped was its last night all the major flaws, from fragmentation to bitter partisanship, that had dogged it after the heady days of January when it had voted to let President Bush make war on Iraq.
For most of what lawmakers had hoped would be a windup session, the pace was deadly slow. But they also moved quickly at times to finish work on an issue like extended unemployment benefits, that had taken four months of sharp debate, in a matter of minutes with voice votes in both chambers. They also handled bills dealing with Medicaid, a park in the California desert and enhanced trade status for China.
There was a note of frustration, especially in the House. Mr. Foley had told one Democrat a few days ago, "We're not going to leave with these guys shooting at our heels." A daylong series of skirmishes with Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, over adding tax cuts to a bill providing more money for the savings and loan bailout, which most leaders considered essential, plainly left him under fire. Democrats said it would be a mistake to leave town for two months and give Mr. Bush and the Republicans the chance to attack them unhindered.
But Mr. Bush's Tuesday morning endorsement of the Gingrich plan also gave them a sense of political opportunity. After he said, "Put me down as enthusiastically for it," the Democrats were plainly eager to renew one of their favorite themes from last year's budget fight, the argument that Mr. Bush supports tax proposals that would help the rich far more than the poor or the middle class.
 
Crime

Mr. Bush's threat on Monday to veto the anti-crime package appeared to sink it for this year. After polling members throughout the day, Democratic officials said they were 26 votes short of passage.
They saw no chance of overcoming the opposition of Republicans, liberal Democrats and the Southern Democrats who support stiffer restrictions on habeas corpus appeals.
Many other members oppose a provision that would require a five-day waiting period to buy a handgun. "Members are thinking of this as a gun vote," said Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico, a leading supporter of the legislation.
Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, who is the chief sponsor of the bill, suggested he would be willing to scuttle most of it in favor of a provision imposing the waiting period for handguns, known as the Brady bill. The measure is named for James S. Brady, the press secretary to President Ronald Reagan who was gravely wounded in the assassination attempt on Mr. Reagan.
"If the President says he'll sign Brady, we'll be quick to peel it off in the first days of next year," Mr. Schumer said.
Mr. Bush has said he would support the Brady bill only if it is included in a larger crime package that expands the rights of police to search for evidence without a warrant and limits the rights of criminals to appeal their state cases in Federal courts.
 
Tax Cuts
 In the House, Democrats and Republicans quarrelled all day Tuesday over a package of tax cuts that some Republicans proposed late last week in an effort to give a jolt to the economy. They wanted to attach it to legislation that most lawmakers agreed was essential, an already imperiled bill that would provide new money for the savings and loan bailout.
Among the Republican proposals were a lower capital gains tax rate, new tax breaks for small businesses and real estate investments, new tax incentives for savings and a repeal of the excise tax on expensive boats, cars and aircraft.
Democrats refused to agree to a procedure under which the tax proposal could be proposed as an amendment, saying it would cost the Treasury more than $25 billion over the next five years and releasing figures showing that the bulk of the tax savings would go to the wealthy.
This morning, Mr. Gingrich declared on the House floor that the Democrats would bear responsibility for the sorry economy because they were blocking the Republican tax plan.
Then Mr. Foley stepped down from the Speaker's chair where he presides over House debates, went to a microphone and said he would keep the House in session as long as needed to debate the tax plan if the President asked him to do so. "The time has come for an end to the gamesmanship," Mr. Foley said.
The dispute continued throughout the day and into the evening in floor speeches and news conferences.
 
Medicaid
 The Senate on Tuesday approved by voice vote a measure to allow states to continue their current Medicaid practices until Sept. 30, 1992. Thereafter, in line with a compromise negotiated by the Administration and the National Governors' Association, states would be less able to raise money for the program of health insurance for 27 million poor people by using money collected from hospitals, as either taxes or voluntary donations.
Last week the House approved a bill that imposed a moratorium, also until Sept. 30, 1992, on the Administration's ability to implement such regulations. The vote was a veto-proof 348 to 71.
A House-Senate conference committee will seek to resolve differences between the two bills.
Under the plan passed by the Senate, the Federal Government would not be required to match money donated to the states by hospitals. States alsowould be barred from imposing taxes only on hospitals that treated Medicaid patients, and no more than 25 percent of what the states put up for Federal matching could come from special taxes on those hospitals.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, said he supported the measure despite some reservations.
 
Aid to the Soviet Union
 House and Senate negotiators agreed on Tuesday to spend up to $500 million from the Pentagon's budget to help destroy Soviet nuclear weapons.
On Monday, the Senate approved a stripped-down aid package that resurrected a proposal originally sponsored by Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin. That proposal, which would have allowed the Pentagon to transfer up to $1 billion, died amid criticism that lawmakers were overly attentive to foreign problems amid growing troubles in the American economy. The House is still considering separate legislation.
Mr. Nunn argued that the revised plan was a valuable investment for American national security.
 
Unemployment Benefits
 Congress passed and sent to the President on Tuesday the final legislation to provide either 13 or 20 weeks of extended unemployment benefits for about three million people out of work at least half a year.
The bill, which President Bush has said he will sign, replaced an earlier version in which workers in 23 states were eligible for only six weeks of benefits.
Under the $5.4 billion measure adopted on Tuesday by the Senate and then by the House, workers in every state who exhausted their regular 26 weeks of benefits between March 1 and last week, and who are still unemployed, can claim those extended benefits. Under the earlier bill, workers in 16 states were not eligible for extended benefits unless they exhausted their regular benefits after Nov. 17.
Last night's action brought to a conclusion a four-month political battle in which President Bush twice killed earlier versions of the bill and Democrats charged that he cared more about foreigners than about destitute Americans.
The measure had been delayed for nearly a week by Senate resistance to including provisions for duty-free imports from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. The bill also extends most favored nation trade status to the three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and to Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
 
Budget
 Often, Congressional sessions wind down in disputes over the budget, but that has not been the case this year. Congress and the White House were bound by budget rules set last year that basically prevented any tax and spending initiatives.
The only pending budget issue was a supplemental money bill containing $4 billion for the left-over costs of the war against Iraq, and money for crop-loss payments for farmers and ranchers, and special assistance for a few communities that had been hit by a natural disaster.

HEADLINE: Why Aren't We Thankful?

BYLINE: By James Reston; James Reston is former chief Washington correspondent and executive editor of The New York Times.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
With the cold war over and with fears of another Pearl Harbor at rest, it's hard to remember a Thanksgiving Day when there were more reasons for the U.S. to give thanks than in this second year of the last decade of the century. But somehow there is little rejoicing. We seem to be at peace with everybody but ourselves.
How could this be? For 50 years since the invention of atomic weapons, we have lived in fear of a third world war. In the first two world wars, 70 million people were killed. 
 In the cold war against Communism, when the two political parties finally agreed on a nonpartisan foreign policy, the U.S. avoided a third world war with comparatively few casualties. Surely this was a cause for rejoicing, but that's not the way it is. Instead, we are engaged here in a series of mean and nasty arguments over abortion, racial politics, the cost of credit cards, who's to be blamed for the economic recession and unemployment, and what's the matter with George Bush and Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York.
You might have thought that at least for this one holiday week the President would have brought a sense of historical perspective to the national debate. But in this year, when the "the evil empire" collapsed, he proposed a five-year military budget that, in constant dollars, would be 25 percent higher than 20 years ago, at the height of the cold war.
No opposition party can really compete with the President in changing the thought of the nation during such a revolution in world affairs. As Woodrow Wilson said, the President's "is the only national voice in affairs. Let him once win the admiration and confidence of the country and no other single force can withstand him. His is the vital place of action in the system."
President Bush seemed to sense the truth of this for a time, and talked of "a new world order," which he started with a war that took the lives of more than 150,000 Iraqis and Kurds, which he barely mentioned.
There was a kind of jingoistic rejoicing after the painful liberation of Kuwait, but since then the object of his policies seems to have been his own re-election, and the Democrats have responded with their own brand of bush league politics.
Accordingly, it's easy to understand why the American people are not rejoicing this Thanksgiving Day, for they are also suffering from the consequences of these wars, hot and cold.
While paying for the threats to their security from abroad -- necessary as those payments were -- their children have been shortchanged in the schools; the problems of crime, drug abuse, health insurance and compassion for the homeless have been under-financed, if not neglected; and the nation's industries, once the envy of the world, have been losing their lead to our former enemies, Germany and Japan, whose budgets concentrate, not on military defense, but on research and development for products that are competing with ours and often beating us in world trade.
In short, we have changed the world, but haven't changed our minds, and this is not surprising.
For if the people are told for more than 12 years by their leaders that they should think about themselves and their own special interests, that they can spend their way to prosperity and happiness with borrowed money and that government is not the answer but the cause of all their problems, you shouldn't be surprised if they are disappointed in the pursuit of greediness, and ask, after their sacrifices in the cold war and Operation Desert Storm, "Where's the rainbow?"

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
To Cuomo or Not to Cuomo

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
There are three schools of thought on whether Gov. Mario Cuomo should run for President:
* Yes, not because he'd be a good President but because he'd raise the right issues and mop up George Bush in debates. 
 * Yes, not because he'd be a good President but because he'd be better than George Bush.
* No, because he might get elected and probably wouldn't be as good as Mr. Bush.
I have a foot in all three schools -- which leads me to break ground for a fourth. The Governor should wait until 1996 and run for the White House only after he's lived up to his promises to New York and actually demonstrated his unique promise as a leader. If he would do that, he'd have a much better chance of winning, and he'd deserve to win.
Here's the case:
1. Mr. Cuomo cannot beat Mr. Bush.
President Bush won't be weak next fall. He will take away a lot of the Democrats' thunder with his own proposals for health care and economic growth. Living standards will continue on a downward slope, but Mr. Bush will give the economy a little boost before election time.
New York will be pure dead weight around the Governor's neck, no matter what Mr. Cuomo says. He'll show that things are just as bad in California, run by a Republican Governor, and argue that this proves the problem lies in Washington. But that argument is too complicated to sell. He'll recite his ten-page list of accomplishments. But New Yorkers will be the first to tell the country of their Governor's spotty record.
Besides, there are already several strong Democratic candidates who can give Mr. Bush a race.
2. Governor Cuomo can beat Dan Quayle or almost anyone else in 1996, if he delivers leadership for New York in the meantime.
Non-incumbents are easier opponents. More important, the economy will be down the tubes in another five years. By that time, it will be landslide city for the Democrats.
Whether Mr. Cuomo will be chosen to lead the Democratic charge will still depend on his performance in Albany in the next three years. He has a reputation for making second-rate appointments. Let him show that he can attract the best and brightest to government and listen to them. He has just advanced a plan to fix New York City's infrastructure. Let him refine that and get it under way. He has a disappointing record on race relations. Let him use his magic to bring blacks and whites together. He says the country needs a comprehensive approach to economic growth -- tax fairness, investments, slashing government bureaucracy, better public education and the like. Let New York be the model.
3. Mr. Cuomo won't be able to accomplish these things, and be a good Governor or President, unless he first conquers his own demons.
His mind is awesome, somewhere between that of a philosopher-king and a lexicographer, between Descartes and Daniel Webster. On a TV talk show Sunday, he gave a strong critique of Bushonomics. Asked about his pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class, he answered, "it depends on how you define middle class . . . how many kids, what circumstances, do they have two children that need special equipment?"
His lofty and powerful mind often works its way deep into the black hole of immobility and indecision. Unlike leaders who concentrate on the rule and their goals, he is forever stymied by exceptions.
He transforms everything into an argument, and often seems more interested in winning arguments than governing. He turns the slightest slight into mortal combat.
His temperament wavers between street fighter and attack dog, between Jimmy Cagney and Cujo, killer pet. It's hard to feel sorry for Sam Donaldson. But when the ABC newsman asked the Governor about calling Vice President Quayle "Danny the cabin boy," Mr. Cuomo denied it and went for Sam's throat. Mr. Donaldson, not a meek man and dead right besides, had to say, "If you never used the name Danny, then I stand corrected." After the show, the Governor's staff recanted his denial.
Mr. Cuomo, brilliant and charismatic, has yet to master his temperament and mind, and has yet to make his record in office -- and cannot be a worthy Presidential candidate or President until he does.

HEADLINE: Don't Make the David Dukes News Media Stars;
Rights for All

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Little Comfort in Mr. Duke's Loss" (editorial, Nov. 18), you again miss the significance of David Duke. Mr. Duke lost because of his background as Nazi and Ku Klux Klan geek. If a known child molester with an innovative day-care program had got 40 percent of the way toward certification, we would heave a sigh of relief at his defeat. Would we also reject the innovations he proposed? 
 Many people in Louisiana supported David Duke, despite his background, because of his ideas. Indeed, several of his ideas are half baked. But he is, unfortunately, one of a very few politicians who -- for whatever reason -- advocate equal opportunity and civil rights for white males.
Most other politicians, including the President, seem to believe that rights are something you have only if you don't have power. If you are a rich black man, you belong to a group that has rights that must be enforced to the extent that they infringe on those of a poor white man whose group has power instead.
A prime example is the so-called Civil Rights Act of 1991. Without this law, if a black man did not meet the qualifications for a job, a white man could be hired because of his qualifications. With this law (barring certain exceptions), the white man's superior qualifications will be irrelevant, and the black man will get the job because of his race. If you are a white person who can envision imminent unemployment as a result of the economy, the prospect of facing de jure racial discrimination for your next job is a real issue.
David Duke got almost 40 percent of the vote because of the opposition's liabilities and because he fastened onto the burgeoning issue of equal rights for whites. If, by some miracle, he had been elected, any attempt on his part to legislate inequality against blacks would have engendered twice the backlash we saw Nov. 16. The antidote to David Duke is equal rights for every individual, regardless of group.

HEADLINE: The Dream of Land Dies Hard in Mexico

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TELPANCINGO, Mexico

 BODY:
For 74 years, the Mexican Constitution has promised land to any citizen who would work it. But there were a few catches: the land could not be rented, mortgaged or sold.
So when a Government functionary began telling local farmers here the other day how President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was going to change all that, the men might have been expected to applaud. They did not. 
 "What?" an older man bellowed over the din that rose in the ruins of a once-vast estate here, not far from where the peasant revolutionary Emiliano Zapata was killed in 1919. "Was the revolution worth nothing? What did all of those people die for? There is nobody, not even the President of the republic, who can take away our land!"
There were a few shouts of "Viva Zapata!" as the official tried to point out that the proposed law would merely allow peasants to rent or sell their plots or join with outside investors; it would not compel them to do so. But the confusion and mistrust was by no means unusual. Officials in Mexico City said they expected such explaining to continue around the country for months.
The tumult underscored how Mr. Salinas's plan to transform Mexican agriculture has quickly become the stiffest challenge of his quest to modernize the economy.
"This is touching the very heart of Mexican history of the last 70 years," said Luis Tellez, the Under Secretary of Agriculture who was a principal architect of the proposed laws. "It is the point of no return."
The "agrarian reform" that most Mexicans knew had been a seemingly endless process, the basic tool by which the Government redistributed wealth in the countryside and asserted political control over it. But early in November, with 2.5 million peasants still waiting for their plots, Mr. Salinas told the country what its leaders had realized for years: that there was no more land to hand out.
 
A Role for Foreigners
 In addition to legalizing the sale of redistributed land, he also moved to permit large-scale agribusiness ventures, with foreigners free to participate.
While there is little doubt that the Congress, dominated by Mr. Salinas's Institutional Revolutionary Party, will approve his plan, the debate reinvigorated the country's floundering political left to the point that the President took the unusual step of inviting opposition parties to propose amendments to the new laws.
"The only thing that will happen is that those who can buy will reconstitute the big estates," said Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leftist leader whose father, President Lazaro Cardenas, gave land to nearly a million peasants in the late 1930's. "Now, instead of the haciendas, it is going to be the great transnational corporations."
Mexican officials say the capitalization and modernization of agriculture are essential if Mexico is to compete successfully with the United States and Canada under the free trade agreement now being negotiated. But they do not doubt that the adjustment will be a wrenching one.
 
Meager Farm Investments
 While farmers and their families now make up nearly a third of the country's 82 million people, they produce less than one-tenth of the gross national product and have collected less than 1 percent of the billions of dollars in foreign investment flowing into Mexico. The great majority of the 17 million Mexicans who, by World Bank standards, live in extreme poverty live in the countryside. And within a decade or two, Mr. Tellez said in an interview, about half of the rural population will most likely be forced to move.
Many of the migrants, officials say, will settle in towns in the interior. Others will swell the already overcrowded and underserviced cities. But despite the new jobs that a booming economy should create, critics wonder whether a third destination is not most likely.
"Where is the support system for those people?" asked Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a political scientist. "It is on the northern border and in the United States."
Even the most passionate of advocates for the Mexican family farmer does not dispute the need for change in the country's system of community farms.
The ejidos, as both the communities and their lands are called, hark back to the land tenure of the Maya. Reconceived under the revolutionary Constitution of 1917, they have been carved from expropriated holdings until, under Mr. Salinas, they came to cover about half of the country's arable land. They may be worked communally or, far more often, as individual parcels, but can be transferred only from one generation to the next.
Divided among heirs, farms that were mandated to be at least 25 acres have typically shrunk to half that. Most lack irrigation, and with outside investment barred by law, their mechanization is usually a day's tractor rental at best. Under the weight of Mexico's huge foreign debt, credits to the ejidos nearly evaporated during the 1980's, while many private landowners stopped investing out of fear that land-starved peasants might invade their parcels in order to force the Government's hand.
Almost as a rule, ejido farmers must take on additional work to sustain their families. Some sell knickknacks or cut wood from outlying forests, and some pick vegetables in California or pack fish in Alaska. Thousands return to harvest their crops; others simply sell or rent their land illegally.
The system would have collapsed of its own inefficency long ago, economists say, had the Government not heavily subsidized farm loans and grain prices. And despite paying about double world market prices for its peasants' corn, for example, only in the last two years has Mexico not had to import corn and beans.
 
Higher Subsidies Asked
 In selling the new plan, the Government has essentially argued that "land and liberty" -- the slogan of Zapata's revolt and the chorus of Government oratory for half a century -- do not necessarily go together anymore.
By granting farmers the power to vote themselves titles to their land, officials contend, the Government will end its paternalistic control over the ejidos, undercut the power of the corrupt bosses who dominate many farms and free the farmers from the demands of Government banks that often condition loans on the planting of certain crops.
But critics of the plan are demanding that the Government raise rather than cut its subsidies. "The Government is backing away from its responsibility," said Ramon Danzos Palomino, the 79-year-old former Communist leader who is a sort of grand old man of the peasant left.
Far as such arguments might diverge from the mainstream of contemporary economic logic, some officials acknowledged that they might still be persuasive to millions of poor Mexicans.
"The worry," said a senior official who spoke on condition he not be identified, "is that you could have political unrest in the countryside at this stage, when we are negotiating a free-trade agreement with the United States."
After an initial flurry of leftist opposition to his bill, Mr. Salinas promised to soften the repayment terms on outstanding ejido loans and spend about $3 billion next year on new credits, technology and infrastructure to strengthen the farm system.
 
Different Reactions
 Like Mexican agriculture itself, the longer-term reception given the new law will almost certainly vary by region. In the north, where landholdings are larger and production agriculture is more established, farmers are expected to turn more quickly to the many potential investors whom Government officials say have shown interest. In the south, where plots are smaller, poorer and still disputed by thousands of peasants, the evolution will likely be much slower.
In visits to ejidos in the state of Morelos, just south of the capital, it was difficult to find a farmer even thinking about cashing in under the proposed laws. "As long as I have faith in God, I think I would not sell my land," said Clemente Torres, 40, who stood on one of the rutted dirt streets of San Jose de Pala. "It has always given me something to eat."
But the appearance of new crops in the fields belie the outward resistance to change.
On the ejido of Miacatlan, Valente Mastache, 61 years old, was still smarting from the loss of $670 he suffered when a Canadian company backed out of the pilot project under which he had abandoned his corn to grow Chinese vegetables. But keeping to his diversification, Mr. Mastache had sown peanuts and watermelons this year. And he did not rule out the possibility of another effort to grow oriental squash.
"We just have to make the contract a little bit better next time," he said.

HEADLINE: Where Shall We Find the Leaders We Need?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is chilling to hear Dick Thornburgh, former Attorney General, conclude on the occasion of his defeat in the Pennsylvania senatorial race that the economy and the cost of health care "obviously commanded much greater attention in the campaign than we anticipated" (news article, Nov. 6). 
 If public concern for the economy and health care comes as a surprise to the former chairman of President Bush's Domestic Policy Council, only months from that office and after almost two years of nagging headlines, what does this say about awareness and leadership in Washington? And what does it say about President Bush, himself so taken off balance by the news of voter discontent in Pennsylvania that he abruptly canceled an important visit to Japan to focus on the economy and to reinforce chances for re-election in 1992?
The Thornburgh incident, though it happened in one state (Pennsylvania), and though tied to just two issues (health care and the economy), speaks volumes about the larger question: the condition of leadership in the United States, and to the supreme question about our readiness to compete and to lead with Europe and Japan in the new global economy.
A majority of today's major domestic problems and a number of our global ones were foreseen, publicly discussed by think tanks and issues groups, with preliminary policy positions advanced for consideration by decision makers as early as the late 1960's and throughout the 70's. These were the big issues: energy policy, research and development objectives and financing, quality and productivity improvements, renewal of the country's physical infrastructure, water supply and purity, waste management, education and housing, the need to understand cross-cultural management, the pressing need in senior management in the business community for strategic information input to balance operational information input to capture the newer global and domestic realities.
Is 20 years of procrastination really leadership in today's fluid, fast-paced and competitive world, given the stunning cost of unaddressed problems? Can we credibly admonish
other countries to adjust their traditions, change their practices, restructure their economies, be more like us, when we ourselves are so conspicuously unwilling to give up practices no longer relevant on the global market frontier? Are we most credible when Europe and Japan have to tell the United States to turn in short-term goals and expectations for longer-range goals? Does it inspire confidence at home or abroad to hear on television a respected Republican Party pollster concede that "the White House is adrift."
If politics grows out of economics, one must look at business leadership. American business leaders, through cumulative decisions over more than 50 years, deserve credit for doing the most to create and usher in the global economy. Yet could it be that the devotion of many American senior executives to the perceptions and assumptions that helped them to positions of power and respect fetter their ability to grasp the new realities and retool for success?
In addition, we need to address the presence and spread of dishonesty, denial and "forgiveness" in leadership ranks in government and business, and even on campus, exceeding almost anything anyone can remember. It has become so commonplace that perpetrators feel quite at ease lecturing their examiners, putting their selfish interests above the public interest and brazenly pleading with authorities and the press to turn their attentions elsewhere so "I can put all this behind me and get on with my life and my career." Memory is becoming a scarce resource.
There is a growing recognition across this land that the best thing for America is to be a competitive equal with Europe and Japan in the global marketplace. This begins with strong leadership at home. Where are these leaders?

Gold Rallies Amid Worries On U.S. Inflation and Soviets

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices rallied yesterday, ending a two-day decline, amid worries about unrest in the Soviet Union and the possibility of higher inflation at home.
Gold for delivery in December rose $1.60, to $367.90, on New York's Commodity Exchange. December silver slipped 1.5 cents, to $4.06 a troy ounce. 
 About 55,000 gold contracts changed hands in relatively busy trading, partly in reaction to a report by the Kyodo News Agency of Japan that quoted Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze as saying another Soviet coup was possible.
 
Comments Clarified

A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vitaly Churkin, said later that Mr. Shevardnadze was referring to the threat of social instability because of the collapsing Soviet economy, not to a particular coup threat.
Nevertheless, analysts said the report caused buying of gold, which has traditionally held its value in times of political and economic chaos.
Gold is also a traditional investment hedge against inflation, which some analysts see as an increasing danger if the Bush Administration tries to stimulate the economy.
Yesterday's mixed bag of economic reports -- shrinking consumer spending, higher factory orders and fewer unemployment claims -- offered no clear signals on inflation, said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. in New York.
 
Could Be Inflationary

Nevertheless, she said, there is a prevailing perception "that the President will have to come up with an economic package that will wind up being inflationary."
Most energy futures advanced after a weekly American Petroleum Institute report showed a drop last week in United States crude supplies.
Gains were limited by an OPEC agreement to extend the organization's current production contract into the first quarter of 1992.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
False Rumor of Soviet Coup A Factor in Dollar's Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar's value rose against most key currencies today, strengthened at first by a false rumor of a second Soviet coup and later by better-than-expected news about the American economy.
Foreign exchange dealers said trading volume was thin because many participants quit early for the Thanksgiving holiday. But they said the market was predisposed toward the dollar. 
 Part of the reason stemmed from surprise remarks Tuesday by Germany's Economics Minister, Jurgen Molleman, who said the dollar was undervalued.
Mr. Molleman's statement was a key reason for the dollar's surge late Tuesday, and some traders said it might have undermined a belief in the foreign exchange market that the dollar's value would inevitably worsen in coming weeks.
"The dollar probably has taken a turn for the better," said Hillel Waxman, a foreign exchange dealer for the New York office of the Bank Leumi Trust Company. "The market is ready to shift its psychology."
Dealers started the day with an unsubstantiated rumor that the Kremlin plotters who overthrew the Soviet Government in August had done it again. That type of rumor usually tends to help the dollar, a safe-haven currency during times of political crisis.
"We got the initial pop on the dollar from that," said Peter Stern, a corporate dealer at Refco Inc., a commodity futures trading concern in New York.
The rumor evidently stemmed from misinterpretations of a report by Japan's Kyodo news agency, which quoted the newly reappointed Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze as predicting another coup. The Soviet Foreign Ministry sought to play down the significance of the Kyodo report, saying Mr. Shevardnadze was referring only to the general threat of social instability.
The dollar was helped later by economic reports that showed durable goods orders surged 3 percent in October, much better than expected, and that weekly unemployment-insurance claims tumbled in mid-November.
Mr. Stern said those numbers suggested the anemic American economy might be stronger than many market strategists had thought, which would tend to bolster the dollar. Still, he said: "I don't think anyone's buying that. We're still in a bearish mode toward the dollar here."
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.95 yen, to a closing of 129.25 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 129.55 yen. By the time trading concluded in New York the dollar fetched 130.05 yen, down from its 130.15 rate late Tuesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7665, from $1.7975 Tuesday. In late New York trading the pound fetched $1.7675, cheaper than its $1.7730 rate late Tuesday.

Money Market Fund Yields Fell Slightly in Latest Week

 BODY:
Yields on tax-exempt and taxable money market funds fell slightly in the week that ended yesterday, according to IBC/Donoghue's, the Holliston, Mass., publisher of The Money Fund Report.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue's, said the small change in yields showed that the demand for tax-exempt funds was keeping pace with the high level of money that is currently on the market. 
 "There was a large supply that came on the market this week, but the yields did not rise, as you might expect," he said.
 
Gains for Tax-Exempt Funds
 Total assets of the tax-exempt funds showed a moderate rise to $91.8 billion, up $524 million from the previous week. Mr. Frank said the average days to maturity on holdings in tax-exempt portfolios remained unchanged at 58 days.
The seven-day compound average yield for tax-exempt funds fell to 3.74 percent, down one basis point from 3.75 percent the week before. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The seven-day simple yield for the tax-exempts dropped two basis points, to 3.67 percent, from 3.69 percent the previous week.
The 30-day compound yield for the same period dropped to 3.83 percent, down four basis points from 3.87 percent, while the 30-day simple yield was at 3.76 percent, down four basis points from 3.80 percent.
The highest-yielding tax-exempt fund among those with assets greater than $100 million was Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, based in Milwaukee, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.79 percent, down one basis point from 4.80 percent the previous week. Strong has been the top-yielding tax-exempt fund for the last several weeks.
 
State-Specific Funds
 Among the tax-exempt funds that invest in individual state securities, the top-yielding New York fund continued to be Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.46 percent, down three basis points from 4.49 percent a week earlier.
In New Jersey, the leading fund was Fidelity Spartan New Jersey Municipal, reporting a seven-day compound yield of 4.30 percent, up from the 4.28 percent offered by the previous week's top performer, Prudential N.J. Municipal Money Market Fund.
Two funds were the leaders in Connecticut, with seven-day compound yields of 4.10 percent: Prudential Connecticut Municipal Money Market Series, and the previous week's top performer, Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Performer, which had a yield of 4.11 percent a week earlier.
The assets of taxable funds rose by $2.5 billion in the last week, to a total of $474.2 billion. Of that $2.5 billion increase, $2.2 billion came from institutional investors.
 
Competitive Yields
 "The institutional flow appears to be a combination of money which is coming out of the stock and bond markets," Mr. Frank said. "Money fund yields are still competitive for cash holders."
The average days to maturity on taxable holdings was a relatively long 63 days, unchanged from the previous week.
The seven-day compound yield on the taxable funds dropped nine basis points, to 4.81 percent, from 4.92 percent, while the seven-day simple yield for the taxable funds fell eight basis points, to 4.70 percent, from the previous week's 4.78 percent.
The average compound 30-day yield for the same period was at 4.94 percent, an decline of six basis points from the previous week's 5.00 percent. The 30-day simple yield was down to 4.82 percent, down six basis points from 4.88 percent.
The highest-yielding taxable fund for the week continued to be Riverside Capital in Columbus, Ohio, with a seven-day compound yield of 6.00 percent, up from 5.95 percent last week.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, a primary competitor of the money funds, fell to a yield of 4.70 percent, compared with 4.74 percent a week earlier, The Bank Rate Monitor reported.

HEADLINE: Experts Dismiss Big Drop in Jobless Claims

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Initial claims for unemployment benefits tumbled by 80,000 in mid-November, the Labor Department reported today. Although it was the biggest improvement in nearly a decade, the decline was largely dismissed as a holiday fluke.
"One should not conclude that the economy suddenly did a U-turn," said Robert Dederick, chief economist of the Northern Trust Company. He noted that on average, nearly 450,000 Americans had filed new unemployment claims each week for a month. 
 The Labor Department said 413,000 Americans filed first-time claims in the week that ended on Nov. 16, down from 493,000 in the previous week.
Fewer Days to File
It was the largest one-week decline since January 1982, in the middle of the last recession. At that time, claims fell 90,000 in a week, mostly reversing the previous week's surge of 105,000, the agency said.
The decline this month was largely dismissed because it came during the week of the Veterans Day holiday, meaning that people had fewer days to file claims. In addition, the mid-November decline followed three consecutive weekly increases. During that period, claims rose to nearly 500,000, from 406,000.
But Irwin Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover Trust was more upbeat about the decrease, noting that blizzard-related layoffs were partly responsible for a 39,000 jump in claims in the previous week. "In the latest week, construction activity resumed and some of these people were back on payrolls," Mr. Kellner said.
The claims numbers can vary greatly from week to week, and economists are wary of attaching much significance to a one-week movement. They consider a four-week average a better barometer.
The latest four-week average is 445,000, up from the previous average of 443,000 and far more than the 400,000 reached in the summer, when the number was improving.
The Labor Department usually releases the claims numbers on Thursday, but moved up the release because of the Thanksgiving holiday. Robert Brusca, of Nikko Securities, said the numbers might have been skewed in the rush to release them.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Americans' personal incomes barely grew in October, the Commerce Department reported today. The gain, of only two-tenths of a percent, followed larger increases of four-tenths of a percent in September and five-tenths in August.
Some analysts asserted that the economy needed help to avoid sliding back into recession. 
 "It is time to dial 911 for the recovery," said John M. Albertine, a Washington economist.
The Commerce Department noted that incomes were bolstered by several special factors in October, including a large increase in farm subsidies, bonus payments to auto workers and restitution payments to Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II.
In contrast, uninsured losses caused by a devastating fire in Oakland, Calif., reduced rental incomes.
Excluding these special factors, "personal income decreased $7 billion, or one-tenth of a percent, in October," the department said.
The White House has given its support to a Republican tax-cut proposal that is given little chance of passage. Hearings will be held during the Congressional recess on policies to try to stimulate the economy, but Mr. Albertine said those discussions would not make consumers more optimistic.
"It is foolish for Congress to adjourn in the middle of deteriorating economic conditions," he said, "especially when it is obvious that the American people are so worried about the economy."
Personal savings did rise during October, to $183 billion, or 4.4 percent of disposable income, from 4 percent in September.

HEADLINE: Chinese Goods Listed for Higher Tariffs in Trade Dispute

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, proposed steep tariffs on about $1.5 billion worth of Chinese imports today, while Chinese negotiators and American importers criticized the decision to seek the trade sanctions after patent and copyright negotiations failed.
Mrs. Hills said that the list of imports affected would be trimmed at the end of a 30-day public-comment period beginning Tuesday. A final figure of $750 million would be "in the ballpark," she said at a news conference this morning, and a decision on whether the tariffs are imposed will be made at the end of the comment period. 
 Chinese trade negotiators, who engaged in six days of talks here that ended on Tuesday, criticized the American decision to announce plans for retaliation. "This is not fair and not in the interest of either side, nor does it conform with normal international practices," the delegation said in a statement.
 
Inadequate Concessions

Mrs. Hills said that Chinese negotiators had not made adequate concessions on the protection of American inventions, particularly pharmaceutical patents. The United States is also concerned about the protection of trade secrets, trademarks and the copyrights of American works published outside of China.
Announcement of the planned tariffs will immediately disrupt trade of the affected products with China as importers seek to block the delivery of goods that could cost twice as much as anticipated, said trade groups representing importers. They said the announcement would also prompt political efforts to reduce the scale of the tariff measures.
"There's no question that there'll be lobbying, but it'll not be a China lobby; it'll be a lobby of industries that will be affected," said Eugene J. Milosh, the president of the New York-based American Association of Exporters and Importers.
"This is just one more problem placed on importers by the Administration," he added.
Mrs. Hills's office this afternoon released a list of imports that would be subject to the tariffs, including luggage, overcoats, pajamas, T-shirts, track suits, imitation jewelry and wristwatches.
Private experts have predicted that the planned tariffs would be 100 percent, but Mrs. Hills told the news conference this morning only that the tariffs would be "prohibitive."
 
First Use of Law

The list represented the first time that the United States has made specific preparations for trade sanctions under Special 301, a section of American trade law dealing with foreign violations of American patents and copyrights.
For importers of products on the list, the new tariffs will be more harmful than a loss by China of its most-favored-nation trade status, which allows Chinese goods to enter the American market at the lowest tariffs available.
The list's release today followed a vote on China's trade status in the House of Representatives on Tuesday night. The House approved, by a 409-to-21 margin, a compromise House and Senate bill attaching conditions to any renewal next year of the most-favored-nation status.
The conditions include an improvement in Chinese human rights policy and an end to Chinese missile and nuclear technology shipments to the Middle East.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Issues Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed yesterday, as credit market participants sifted through seemingly conflicting economic reports and worried that policy makers in Washington might return after Thanksgiving to consider quick passage of a package to stimulate the economy.
Reports that upset traders early in the session included news from the Labor Department that initial unemployment claims fell by a larger than expected 80,000 during the week ended Nov. 16, and that new orders for durable goods rose by 3 percent during October, the first increase in three months. 
 While traders focused on those numbers as signs of some strength in the economy that might discourage lower interest rates, economists were more interested in, and concerned about, a report from the Commerce Department showing that personal consumption spending fell by three-tenths of a percent during October. It was the second decline in three months and the biggest dip since April.
"The consumption data was on the weak side, even though it may rise in the months to come," said Kenneth Kim, an economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets.
Even if consumption expenditures pick up, Mr. Kim said the figures released yesterday do not improve the outlook for growth during the current quarter.
"Personal consumption spending will probably be down by 1 percent or so in the fourth quarter," he said. "That implies that overall G.N.P. growth will be pretty weak."
The price movement that followed the reports came on extremely thin trading. Activity in the Government securities market ended at 1 P.M. yesterday to prolong the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. The market will operate under a similar abbreviated schedule tomorrow.
Concern that Congress might not adjourn for the year and would return instead after Thanksgiving to consider a tax cut package intended to stimulate the economy was the major influence on bond prices, traders said.
Credit market participants are concerned that any package that Congress agrees upon will further swell the already-bloated Federal budget deficit.
At the close of trading, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 100 13/32, down 9/32, to yield 7.96 percent, compared with 7.93 percent late Tuesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were unchanged, at 100 21/32, to yield 7.40 percent. And the 6 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 19/32, up 1/ 32, to yield 5.77 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates inched lower.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.37 percent late yesterday, down one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.42 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 4.48 percent.
Activity in the corporate bond market was highlighted by a $240 million offering of high-yield bonds issued by the Stone Container Corporation.
The 11 7/8 percent senior notes, which mature Dec. 1, 1998, were priced at $99.415, to yield 12 percent.
The securities, which are noncallable for seven years, are rated B-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds was very slow, traders said.
Prices of most corporate issues were unchanged. Meanwhile, participants in the municipal bond market said that prices of widely quoted issues dipped by about 1/8 point to 1/4 point.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 16.10 on Blue-Chip Losses

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed yesterday, with blue chips bearing the brunt of the weakness. Sharp declines in I.B.M. and Philip Morris pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down 16.10 points, to 2,900.04.
For the most part, blue-chip issues traded in a tight range just below Tuesday's closing level, but the declines in I.B.M. and Philip Morris rattled the rest of the market. I.B.M. fell 3 5/8, to 94 1/4, and Philip Morris dropped 1 5/8, to 68 1/8. 
 According to Birinyi Associates, a stock market research company, the decline in I.B.M. accounted for 6.5 points in the Dow's fall, while Philip Morris represented 3.1 points, together accounting for 60 percent of the Dow's move.
 
Volume Down 21.5%

Volume on the Big Board totaled 167.7 million, down from a heavy 213.8 million shares on Tuesday. Losing issues outpaced gaining ones by a narrow margin of 879 to 739, showing the closeness in yesterday's trading.
The Big Board composite index slipped 0.55 points, to 208.22, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1.41 points, to 376.55. On the American Stock Exchange, trading took the composite index down 0.66, to 370.00.
On the upside of yesterday's trading, the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.55, to 522.78, with the Russell 2,000 index of small-company stocks just 0.06 points below its close on Tuesday.
 
Announcement Takes Effect
 Traders said I.B.M.'s shares were down as a few analysts adjusted their ratings after the company said on Tuesday that it was taking a fourth-quarter charge of $3 billion and cutting 20,000 jobs. The traders cited a lower rating given by Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch.
"You just don't take the saved earnings per share and add it to the bottom line in a difficult economy, and to a company in transition," Mr. Mandresh said. "In a still-very-tough industry, revenues are the critical issue."
And Clifford Friedman, of Bear, Stearns, reduced his rating on I.B.M. to a "buy" from a "strong buy," noting that the restructuring was a radical decision, but still an evolutionary process.
Philip Morris said it was taking $275 million charge in the fourth quarter to cover the restructuring of its Kraft General Foods unit, and said it planned to buy back up to $2 billion common shares over two years.
Despite the recent weakness in stocks, Gene J. Seagle, the director of research for Gruntal & Company, said the market did have some things going for it. One was that November, December and January are historically the strongest months of the year in terms of advances. Another is lower interest rates.
Finally, Mr. Seagle said, there is the coming Presidential market cycle, where the President and the Federal Reserve will do everything to turn the economy up and keep interest rates moving down.
 
BankAmerica Down to $31.50

In other stock action yesterday, the shares of BankAmerica were off 1/2, to 31 1/2, as Thomas Brown, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, lowered his 1991 and 1992 earnings estimates but repeated a "buy" on the stock. He said the near-term reductions did not take away from the long-term growth.

HEADLINE: OPEC Leader Looks Ahead, And Sees Possible Turmoil

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENNA, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, ending a two-day meeting here, decided today to keep its oil production at the current level. But its Secretary General issued a strong warning that next year would be filled with unpredictable developments for the world's oil markets.
The Secretary General, Subroto, said that among other uncertainties OPEC did not know when Iraq, once a leading oil producer, would be able to export again. 
 Other OPEC officials warned that if Iraq resumed large-scale exports, which are currently prohibited by the United Nations, the volume of oil it sold might well force the group to revise its decisions.
Baghdad is known to have discreetly exported a few thousand barrels of refined oil products over the last year, but those supplies have had a negligable impact on the world market. Before the United Nations embargo was imposed, Iraq exported three million barrels a day.
 
Uncertainty About the Soviets

Dr. Subroto, formerly the oil minister of Indonesia, also said that another big question was whether the Soviet Union's oil production, which he estimated at less than 9 million barrels a day, might fall further next year, creating a need for more OPEC oil on world markets.
OPEC officials also noted that the demand for their oil would depend on the degree to which the United States and several other industrial countries recovered from recession.
Dr. Subroto said that Iraq's failure to accept Security Council Resolution 706, which permits the country to export enough oil to generate $1.6 billion in revenues, was "a political decision," and that any decision to resume exports must be made by Baghdad. But he noted that Iraqi acceptance of the resolution could have a significant effect on OPEC's prices and production levels.
The United Nations barred Iraq from exporting oil after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Permission to export was granted only on a temporary and limited basis, a stipulation that Iraq has rejected.
In the view of oil experts, these uncertainties make OPEC's decision to keep production stable a tentative one.
 
'Living in a Dream World'

"In a way, OPEC is living in a dream world," said John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York, who was an observer at the meeting. Mr. Lichtblau said the near-total absence of Iraq and Kuwait from the world oil market, and the changing Soviet production profile, meant the organization would probably have to re-examine its policies soon.
The steady fall in Soviet oil exports, down to about a million barrels a day, from 1.6 million barrels two years ago, could also alter the market's supply-and-demand balance.
Similarly, OPEC officials said, Kuwait's ability to make a comeback as an oil producer is another factor that the group must watch and weigh. Kuwait has essentially been out of the oil-exporting business since the Iraqi invasion. But it has been slowly repairing oil operations destroyed by Iraq and has begun to pump more oil in recent months.
Kuwaiti officials say they will reach a production level of 600,000 barrels a day by the end of the year and 800,000 barrels a day in July 1992.
 
February Meeting Is Set
 OPEC said it would meet again on Feb. 12 in Geneva to consider these elements of uncertainty and "decide on a production ceiling" for the second quarter of 1992.
For the moment, the OPEC ceiling will remain where it has been in the last few months, at about 24 million barrels a day.
OPEC reiterated its desire to bring prices closer to its "minimum reference price" of $21 barrel, but the group refrained from specifying what measures it would adopt to lift prices to that level. The average price of OPEC-produced oil is now a little less than $19 a barrel.
Saudi Arabia has opposed any talk of trimming production to raise prices.

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
Soviet Debt Deal May Add To Problems of the Republics

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Can anyone spare a dime? The leaders of the Soviet republics, who were hoping for a coin or three in return for assuming the Soviet Union's debts, were left empty-handed last week. While the West agreed to a delay in repayment of the principal through 1992, the deal offered no money to slow the republics' perilous financial decline.
Indeed, the negotiation with the United States and its major economic allies in Moscow may have added to the republics' economic woes by highlighting both the division of interests between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine and Washington's indecision on aid. 
 Russian leaders, eager to put the best possible spin on the agreement, point out that it gives the West explicit leverage over plans for creating a market economy in the republics. And that arrangement improves the prospects for a "grand bargain" on the financing of reforms. "It was a willing surrender by Russia," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
By conventional yardsticks, the Soviet foreign debt is quite modest. Official Russian estimates put hard-currency debts to governments, banks and private businesses in the range of $80 billion. Planecon, a Washington consulting firm specializing in Eastern European economies, pegs the net debt -- Soviet obligations less sums owed to Moscow -- at about half that. But even the higher official number "would be the envy of most developing countries," said Darryl McLeod, an economist at Fordham University.
The $80 billion represents one and a half times current annual Soviet export earnings -- and just 7 percent of the Soviet G.N.P. Mexico, by contrast, owes 2.5 times as much as it earned from exports in 1990. Even South Korea owes foreigners the equivalent of 17 percent of its G.N.P.
The catch, of course, is that the Mexican and South Korean economies are stable and growing, while lenders doubt both the capacity and the will of the former Soviet republics to service a foreign debt. While Soviet hard currency earnings will actually be higher this year than last because former East bloc trading partners are now required to pay their bills in dollars, signs of the rapid deterioration in Soviet creditworthiness are still plain to those who care to look.
Soviet gold reserves, the former union's rainy day fund, now stand at 240 tons -- hardly enough to cover a month's worth of imports. The production of oil, along with natural gas and weapons, the Soviets' most reliable source of hard-currency revenues, has fallen by a sixth since the peak in 1987. And while David Johnson, an economist at Planecon, notes that the decline largely reflects poor physical management of the oil reserves, production problems are rapidly being compounded by organizational chaos. For example, critical oilfield machinery is desperately scarce because the factory in Azerbaijan has been plagued by the conflict between Muslims and Armenian Christians.
 
Spending on Imports

What is more, the pressure to spend foreign exchange earnings on imports rather than interest payments grows as domestic deliveries of consumer goods falter. Morgan Guaranty estimates that Soviet factories idled for want of parts and supplies will make 15 percent less this year than last. The 1991 harvest was also smaller than expected because farms were short of everything from tractor fuel to fertilizer. And farmers are shipping less of what they produce because they are less than eager to trade food and fiber for rubles that buy nothing.
It is thus no surprise that private foreign lenders are scrambling to trim their exposure, canceling short-term credits that had previously been renewed routinely. Even before the August coup attempt, Susanne Gehler of Morgan Guaranty in London predicted that Soviet short-term debts to Western banks and suppliers would be reduced by $5 billion this year. And with the cupboard otherwise bare -- hard currency reserves are reportedly down to a few billion dollars -- it was obvious the republics would be forced to default on billions in longer-term debts scheduled to be repaid next year.
What was not obvious, is that the response to the impending debt crisis from the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada would be so limited, said Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at Harvard and consultant to the Russian government.
The deal proposed by the Western finance ministers and signed last week by their counterparts from eight republics requires the republics to assume joint responsibility for Soviet debts and to keep current on all interest payments. In return, the Western governments agreed to look the other way when $3.6 billion in principal payments due this year and next fail to arrive. The finance ministers also implied that they would lean on Western (mostly European) banks that hold billions in Soviet i.o.u.'s to make parallel concessions.
 
Pawnshop Operation

But the only cash the West put on the table was a $1 billion line of credit, to be secured by $1 billion of Soviet gold. This pawnshop operation does spare the republics the embarrassment of selling the last of their gold, but as Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs said, the Western governments "certainly got a lot for their money."
One unintended result of the hard-nosed bargaining is a further fraying of the inter-republic fabric. While the Ukraine was reportedly willing to guarantee a share of Soviet debt, it balked at Western demands that each republic be responsible for the whole. That can only add to the temptation for the Russian Federation to go its own economic way, Ms. Gehler of Morgan Guaranty suggested.
Western economists are virtually of one voice in urging the opening of borders to inter-republic trade. But the path of least domestic political resistance for Russia, which sells more within the union than it buys, is to require all trade with other republics be settled in dollars at world prices. This would give Russia the ability to divert substantial amounts of oil for sale in the West much the way the demise of the East bloc market created a surge in hard-currency sales for the Soviet Union.
This might damage Russia's economic prospects almost as much as it damaged the oil-importing republics. After all, a substantial portion of Russian exports to other republics consists of manufactured goods that no one would buy if they had to pay hard currency.
But Ms. Gehler of Morgan Guaranty pointed out that it took a year for the former East bloc economies to have second thoughts and begin to reconstruct internal barter arrangements -- a year in which trade between the Soviet Union and its former satellites fell by half, stranding hundreds of thousands of workers in enterprises with nothing worth selling.
The best hope, said Graham Allison at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, is that the debt deal will suck Western governments into the elusive "grand bargain," rewarding a rapid Soviet transition to democratic capitalism with dollars, yen and Deutsche marks. While the agreement offers no money beyond the modest gold swap, it does say that the debt deferral would be renewed beyond 1992 if the republics follow the International Monetary Fund's advice on economic reforms.
Such leverage, Mr. Allison said, "is a step down a slippery slope," toward taking broader responsibility for the economic fate of the shattered Soviet empire.

HEADLINE: Congress Restricts Robot Phone Dialers

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Riding a wave of popular annoyance over telephone sales calls, Congress today approved and sent to President Bush a bill that would ban the use of automated dialing devices that deliver recorded messages to the home. The measure would also allow consumers to try to block calls from human salespeople by placing their names on a "do not call" list.
The bill, which passed on voice votes in the House on Monday and in the Senate today, was supported by both Democrats and Republicans, some of whom have recounted their own annoying experiences with unsolicited sales calls. Although the White House has expressed concerns about what it views as unnecessary regulation, the President has not threatened to veto the bill. 
 The measure, which combines provisions from several separate measures passed previously by both chambers of Congress, bans the use of autodialers for calling most homes. The few exceptions would be cases in which a person has explicitly agreed to receive such calls or in which autodialers are used to notify people of an emergency. Autodialers that are used to call businesses would be prohibited from reaching more than two numbers at a single business.
Many states have already passed laws that restrict autodialers, including about a dozen states that ban them altogether and about two dozen others that restrict their use in various ways. The state laws, however, do not stop a company from using an autodialer in an unregulated state to call homes in a state with regulations.
In an attempt to curb telemarketing by human sales representatives, the measure would instruct the Federal Communications Commission to either oversee the creation of a nationwide "do not call" list or issue rules ordering companies to maintain their own lists. The bill would allow people who placed their names on such a list to file suits in small claims courts against companies that persisted in calling. The suits could seek up to $500 for each unwanted call, up to a maximum of three calls from a single company.
Finally, the bill would ban unsolicited "junk fax" messages, which are advertisements transmitted to facsimile machines.
"This is a victory for beleaguered consumers, who in this piece of legislation have their declaration of independence from junk faxes and junk calls," said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, the measure's principal sponsor in the House.
 
Autodialer Companies Respond
 Companies that make or use autodialers glumly predicted today that the measure would put them out of business and would hurt small advertisers the most.
"I think it will put us out of business," said Mark Anderson, owner of the Telleshoppe Corporation, a New Orleans concern that uses about 160 machines for clients who sell everything from tanning products to health insurance. "What people don't understand is that a lot of mom-and-pop operations use electronic marketing and use it successfully."
Ray Kolker, president of Kolker Systems, the largest maker of autodialers, echoed those views. "Passage of this bill demonstrates that Congress just isn't as concerned about the economy as they think they are," he said. "This will destroy a multibillion-dollar business."
Quieting a Booming Business
Telemarketing has surged in recent years, as the cost of long-distance service has plunged and as consumers have become deluged by catalogues they do not read and envelopes they do not open. According to Congressional estimates, the volume of goods and services sold through all forms of telephone marketing has increased from about $72 billion in 1982 to $435 billion in 1990. Over all, an estimated 300,000 people are employed in some facet of telephone marketing.
Autodialers, which can each make about 1,500 calls a day, have become one of the most efficient but disliked forms of telemarketing. By one estimate, 20,000 autodialers are in operation at one time, with the capacity of making more than 20 million calls in a single day.
During hearings on the issue earlier this year, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, noted irritably that he had been summoned to the telephone only to hear a recorded sales message about winning a trip to Hawaii.
Support From Some Telemarketers
Today's legislation was not opposed by all companies involved in telephone sales. Many marketing experts have long deplored the use of autodialers as a sales tool, arguing that they are counterproductive because they generate more irritation than sales interest. The Direct Marketing Association, a trade group, has expressed cautious support for the legislation and already maintains its own, voluntary "do not call" list.
Beyond simply annoying people at home, the autodialers have been known to tie up telephone paging networks and the switchboards of hospitals and universities.
 
Questions About F.C.C. Options
 But it remains unclear how effective the "do not call" lists would be in practice, because the two options available to the F.C.C. differ greatly.
A national list maintained by the Government would effectively protect consumers from all unwanted sales calls. But a requirement that each company maintain its own list would be much more limited, because people might have to call each company to be placed on its individual list.
Congressional aides noted that the measure passed today strongly implied that the F.C.C. should set up its own list, because it provides two pages of detail on just how such a list should be created.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Drops 0.3%

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
The Commerce Department said yesterday that spending by American consumers, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, fell a sharp three-tenths of a percent in October, the biggest decline since April, when spending fell five-tenths of a percent.
Coming after two bleak assessments of consumer confidence released on Monday, the decline suggested a mood of extreme caution among shoppers at the start of the crucial holiday season. 
If that caution persists through November and December, several economists said, it could tip the economy back into decline in the fourth quarter. Growth of 2.4 percent in the third quarter was widely interpreted as a sign that the recession was ending.
 
Weak Christmas Could Linger

Moreover, said David Wyss, the research director for DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting firm, "a weak Christmas will mean it would be hard to get much action in the first quarter of 1992, because retailers will be overstocked and orders anemic."
Other reports released yesterday by the Commerce Department suggested that consumers were not buying because their income was not increasing, and that much of what they were purchasing was coming from abroad.
Personal income grew a meager two-tenths of a percent in October, the worst showing since July. And the country's trade deficit rose 33 percent in the July-September quarter, to $20.49 billion, the highest level this year.
"Buying imports may be wonderful for Chinese manufacturers, but it's more bad news for U.S. manufacturers," said Walter K. Joelson, the chief economist for the General Electric Company.
 
Jobless Claims Drop

Not all of the news was bad. The Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 80,000 in mid-November, the biggest one-week improvement in almost a decade. There were 413,000 people filing first-time claims during the week that ended on Nov. 16, down from 493,000 in the previous week.
Because of the Veterans Day holiday, there was less time to file claims in the mid-November week, and some economists dismissed the decline as a fluke. But others said the sharp drop indicated that the labor market was not as weak as the widespread reports of layoffs had suggested.
"The labor market is not unwinding as dramatically as many had feared, and that is really good news for an economy that is trying to stay out of double-dip recession," said Stephen Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment firm.
Orders to American factories for durable goods rose 3 percent in October after two consecutive declines, reaching $123.79 billion, seasonally adjusted. The upturn followed a 4.2 percent drop in September and a 4.1 percent fall in August.
But many economists discounted the slight rise, since it stemmed principally from a 53 percent surge in orders for military equipment. These orders had fallen 49.2 percent in the previous month.
"I just ignore defense business because it can swing so wildly," said Mr. Joelson of General Electric. "The relevant fact is that the numbers are very bad compared to a year ago, when they were not particularly good."
He noted that new orders in October for capital goods other than military items were down 16 percent from October 1990. In the third quarter, the orders were off 3.5 percent from a year earlier.
"My personal sense is that what we have here is a continuation of stagnation," Mr. Joelson added.
 
Consumers Are 'Tapped Out'

This view was shared by several other economists, who used expressions like "a sideways economy" and "an economy that is squeaking by" to characterize the overall situation suggested by the figures released yesterday. None expressed hope of a decisive upturn before spring, and several underlined the danger of a double-dip recession if consumers do not respond soon.
"The economy is basically doing nothing because the consumer is doing nothing," said Mr. Wyss of DRI/McGraw-Hill. "He's tapped out and he's seeing no income gain.
"Moreover, it seems that what demand there is is being sucked off by imports."
Irwin Kellner, the chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover Trust, added: "The economic pulse is beating, but it's very weak. I'm not prepared to throw in the towel on a recovery yet, but it's a recovery that seems to be just barely alive."

HEADLINE: Congress Votes $100 Billion Bank and S.& L. Aid

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
In a final burst of legislation before adjourning until January, Congress today approved two broad bailout measures that total more than $100 billion, one for the nation's banking industry and one to continue the Government's rescue of hundreds of savings and loans.
Along with the adoption of a $151 billion, six-year transportation program, the actions on financial bailouts were the most significant accomplishments of the final day of a Congressional session that began on the sober note of war with Iraq and concluded with a quarrelsome sitting that lasted 33 hours and 2 minutes. 
 Even though President Bush threatened to veto a similar banking bill several weeks ago, he is expected to sign both the banking measure and the savings and loan measure. Regulators say the insurance funds that protect almost $3 trillion in deposits at banks and savings associations are virtually empty, and the Government has already slowed its pace in seizing weak institutions. Together, the two bills are the largest spending effort by the Government for any financial crisis in American history.
There was considerable fear on Capitol Hill today that the bills -- while essential to the health of the nation's financial system -- would still not provide enough money and could come back to haunt the lawmakers politically. Facing a choice between being irresponsible or unpopular, House members took the unusual step of deciding not to record any significant votes but to approve the legislation and all key amendments by voice vote.
"This is an unpleasant task," said the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri. "But I hope everyone will remember that we're not bailing out anyone but our constituents, who have their deposits in institutions."
The Senate was headed on a similar course until Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, insisted that votes be recorded.
 
Direct Cost to Taxpayers
 The savings and loan bill would directly cost taxpayers at least $25 billion and increase the amount that could be borrowed for working capital by $35 billion, and Administration officials and lawmakers expressed new concerns this week that the mounting problems of the banking industry could raise those costs substantially if the economy and real estate markets around the nation remain anemic.
Because the money would come from long-term borrowing, it would have no immediate effect on the Federal budget. The proceeds would give regulators the wherewithal to mount a wave of seizures of banks and savings associations beginning in January.
The bank bill, which would provide more than $70 billion in taxpayer loans that are supposed to be repaid by the industry, was completed by House and Senate negotiators after a marathon drafting session that ended at 4:57 this morning.
It was stripped of all the recommendations the Bush Administration made in February to eliminate more than 60 years of Federal laws restricting banks from entering the securities and insurance businesses and from being owned by industrial enterprises, like General Motors and I.B.M. The Administration argued that banks could be strengthened by repeal of those laws.
Congress also rejected the Administration's recommendations to impose modest limits on the deposits that insurance can cover, and to combine four regulatory agencies into two.
After a subdued debate, the House approved the banking measure by voice vote with fewer than three dozen lawmakers on the floor.
The savings and loan measure was approved 44 to 33 in the Senate, with the support of 23 Democrats and 21 Republicans and over the opposition of 23 Democrats and 10 Republicans. While no recorded vote was taken in the House, 112 members were counted in favor of the bailout measure and 63 rose in objection.
The banking bill was approved by the Senate on a 68-to-15 vote. Voting for the measure were 36 Democrats and 32 Republicans. Voting against it were 13 Democrats and 2 Republicans.
The White House proposals fell victim to a combination of intense lobbying by some of Washington's most powerful financial interest groups, from Wall Street, the insurance industry and the nation's smallest banks. Critics asserted that the proposals, by deregulating the industry, would lead to greater bank losses that would ultimately have to be borne by taxpayers.
For his part, President Bush did little during the months leading to today's vote to promote the legislation, leaving most of the work to Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
In a statement after the vote, Mr. Brady repeated his view that taxpayers might ultimately be forced to pay for the bank bailout because the House and Senate had rejected his proposals on broad changes to the banking system.
 
Brady's Criticism
 "Congress failed to take the opportunity to strengthen the American financial system and enable banks to attract sufficient private capital to help insure that the possibility of taxpayers' paying for industry losses could be avoided," Mr. Brady said. But many lawmakers said imbedded losses in the nation's largest banks made a taxpayer bailout of them inevitable, and on Monday one of the nation's senior regulators, William Taylor of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said the Administration's proposals would probably have only helped to reduce losses "at the margins."
Administration officials, who had defended their recommendations on the ground that they would permit the banks to become more profitable and diversify their businesses, said today that there was virtually no chance that Congress would address these issues again next year.
"The only way to do it is with bipartisan support, and in the run-up to an election, it very difficult to imagine such support," said a senior Administration official who insisted on not being identified.
Earlier this month, the House rejected two other banking bills before it approved the measure that formed the basis for today's legislation.
The following provisions are also included in the bill passed today:
*Regulators would be given more authority to seize weak banks and monitor foreign banks. They would also be instructed to conduct more examinations of banks.
*Banks would be required to provide more accurate information about the interest rates they pay depositors.
*No banks would be able use new affiliates in Delaware to underwrite insurance, but banks that already have such affiliates, notably Citicorp and Bankers Trust, would be permitted to remain in that business.
*The Supreme Court's recent ruling in Lampf v. Gilbertson would be partly overturned so that it would not apply to cases filed before the decision. The case had sharply limited the statute of limitations for securities fraud lawsuits filed by shareholders.
 
Victory for Small Banks
 *Charitable organizations that had accounts of more than $100,000 at Freedom National Bank in Harlem and Community National Bank and Trust on Staten Island would receive complete deposit insurance coverage.
*The Federal Government would provide loan guarantees to assist depositors at Rhode Island credit unions and banks that collapsed and were not federally insured.
The clear winners in today's legislation were the nation's smallest banks, which had fought hard to defeat the Administration's proposal because they said it would give their larger rivals the ability to take them over and to compete more directly against them. Wall Street and the insurance industry, which had also opposed the Administration's proposals for fear that the banks would be able to enter their industries, also fared well.
The savings and loan measure would provide an additional $25 billion, enough to continue that bailout through March. It would also include an increase to $160 billion, from $125 billion, in the amount regulators can borrow for working capital for the bailout. Those loans are supposed to be repaid through the sale of assets from seized institutions, but they could add substantially to the taxpayers' ultimate bill if the Government is unable to recover all of the money lent on the underlying assets. The Administration had sought $80 billion, which it said would be enough to complete the bailout.
Congress has already provided $80 billion since the bailout began more than two years ago. Government auditors have forecast that the bailout could cost $500 billion over 40 years.
The legislation would also change the structure of the savings and loan bailout by merging the two boards that now supervise the rescue effort into one. The new seven-member board is to be led by the Treasury Secretary and includes the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the chief executive of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and two members from private industry.

HEADLINE: Congress Moves to Force Icahn to Insure T.W.A. Pensions

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Congress served notice today on Carl C, Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines, that he would be personally liable for the pensions of T.W.A.'s employees even if he proceeded with plans to restructure the ailing carrier.
Unions representing workers for the carrier, which has its hub in St. Louis, persuaded members of the Missouri delegation to sponsor a measure that would force Mr. Icahn to retain liability for the unfunded portions of T.W.A.'s pensions, even if his stake in the company dips below 80 percent, the legal limit at which shareholders assume that liability. 
 The measure was an amendment to a $6.9 billion emergency appropriation, which was approved by the House early in the morning in a 303-to-114 vote and by a voice vote in the Senate later in the day. The sponsors included Senator John C. Danforth, a Republican, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, a Democrat, who is the majority leader.
 
May Be a First
 Financial analysts and pension law experts said they knew of no previous instance when a company owner was required to retain his liability for pensions when his equity stake fell below 80 percent.
The unions feared that if Mr. Icahn was relieved of pension liability, he would sell the carrier's assets, shut the airline down and walk away.
"This gives Icahn, for the first time, a compelling economic interest in keeping T.W.A. in operation," a Republican Senate aide said.
Mr. Icahn has been negotiating for several months with the carrier's creditors to retructure T.W.A.'s debt, which the company says is $190 million. As part of that restructuring, Mr. Icahn is reportedly attempting to reduce his equity stake in the carrier from more than 80 percent to less than 50 percent, though he would retain control.
 
15.2% Not Funded

Company records indicated that 15.2 percent of the carrier's pension plan was not funded as of Sept. 30. At that time, the company estimated its pension liability at $193 million, but some independent estimates placed the figure as high as $900 million.
The Congressional action also means that even if T.W.A. went out of business, Mr. Icahn would be remain liable for the unfunded portion of the pension for up to six years. Under Federal law, former employees could attach up to 30 percent of his assets to make up the shortage in the carrier's pension plan.
Some legal experts said Mr. Icahn's other holdings -- in ACF Industries, for example -- could be at risk of being attached to pay for the unfunded portion of the T.W.A. pension plan if the carrier ceased operating and its former employees sought immediate payment of their pensions -- their right under pension laws.
"Depending on the size of the unfunded pension liability claim, he might have to sell his interest in his other business to make good those claims," said Julius Maldutis, director of research at Salomon Brothers.
The measure could make it more difficult for Mr. Icahn to borrow money since any assets he used as collateral could be attached because of the unfunded pension liability.

HEADLINE: U.S., TURNING FROM MOSCOW, WOULD GRANT RECOGNITION TO AN INDEPENDENT UKRAINE

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
President Bush has authorized a major shift in American policy away from the central Soviet Government and toward the republics, deciding to recognize an independent Ukraine "expeditiously" if the second-largest Soviet republic breaks with Moscow in a referendum on Sunday, officials said today.
Independence fever in the Ukraine is running high, and Administration officials say they expect the Ukrainians will vote to separate from the Soviet Union. In that case, Washington will start trying to strengthen its ties with the Ukraine immediately, but will delay formal diplomatic recognition for some time, perhaps weeks, the officials said.
 
U.S. Would Set Demands
 Instead, in hopes of setting a pattern for demands from other republics for similar treatment, United States recognition of the Ukraine will be timed according to the speed with which the Ukrainians move to ease American concerns on human rights, ethnic tensions, disarmament and control over nuclear weapons, officials said. 
 On Aug. 1, less than three weeks before the abortive hard-line coup in Moscow, President Bush delivered a peech in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, warning against what he called "suicidal nationalism" and saying that the United States would not choose sides between Moscow and the restive republics.
Today, Administration officials said that the President was prepared eventually to open an embassy in Kiev and establish diplomatic relations with an independent country that has its own foreign, military and economic policies. It is unclear, however, how far the Ukrainians will go in severing all of their ties to the central Government.
 
Challenge to Moscow
 Still, Mr. Bush's willingness to recognize full independence if the Ukrainians choose it represents the first real challenge from Washington to the central Soviet Government's ability to hold together its ragged union, which would be seriously undermined by the independence of the second-largest of the 12 remaining republics, one that supplies much of the country's industrial and agricultural output. If the Ukraine becomes independent, it would be the fourth-most-populous nation situated wholly in Europe.
American support for Ukrainian independence also threatens one of President's Mikhail S. Gorbachev's remaining threads of power: Mr. Bush's explicit, and hitherto often-proffered, endorsement of Mr. Gorbachev as the sole legitimate repository of sovereignty in the Soviet Union.
There was no formal announcement of Mr. Bush's decision, which officials said was made on Tuesday at an Oval Office meeting with his top foreign policy advisers and conveyed to a group of Ukrainian-Americans at a White House meeting today. Instead, details were provided by Administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
They said that President Gorbachev "is aware" of Mr. Bush's plans but that his reaction was not known. "We've spoken to the Ukrainians and the Russians about this and they're the ones that count," one official said.
White House officials said Mr. Yeltsin's reaction was also unknown.
After the vote Sunday, one official said, Mr. Bush will initially issue "a strong statement supporting Ukrainian aspirations." That will be followed by a strengthening of Ukrainian-American relations and "sooner rather than later" by full diplomatic recognition.
Administration officials said Mr. Bush was deliberately not setting any timetable for full recognition of the Ukraine to avoid the appearance of hesitation that marked his recognition of the Baltic nations and to see how Ukrainian policy develops in the areas outlined by the United States in recent contacts with Ukrainian officials.
 
Support for the Kremlin
 For months since the aborted Kremlin coup in August, Mr. Bush clung to a policy of supporting the central Government in Moscow, and in particular Mr. Gorbachev, despite growing evidence that Mr. Gorbachev's Government was losing its powers.
Officials were careful today to stress that Mr. Bush still supports Mr. Gorbachev. But they said American policy had been slowly shifting toward greater ties with the republics and a recognition that independence for some of them is inevitable.
In recent months, there has been a division within the Administration's top foreign policy councils over policy toward the Soviet Union, officials said. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had been pushing for some time for stronger ties to the republics, while Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, argued in favor of supporting the center, they said.
Mr. Bush's inclination was to stick to the established authority as long as possible, officials said.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bush met with Mr. Baker, Mr. Scowcroft and Mr. Cheney in the Oval Office and Mr. Scowcroft threw his support to Mr. Cheney's position, officials said. "That tipped the scales," an official said.
The White House said it was prepared to take this action despite lingering disputes over Ukrainian-Russian borders, and said the United States would leave it to the Ukrainians and the Russians to resolve those differences. Shortly after the coup, a statement was issued in the name of President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian federated republic in which the Russian republic said it would not let other Soviet republics secede form the union taking areas with heavily Russian populations with them. A Yeltsin spokesman said at the time that the statement referred to areas of northern Kazakhstan and to the Donets Basin region and the Crimea, both in the Ukraine.
Although White House officials said tensions over this issue seem to have subsided, one of the effects of the Yeltsin declaration was to galvanize the Ukrainians' separatist drive, by stirring old Ukrainian fears that Russia seeks to dominate its neighbor. About 20 percent of the Ukraine's 52 million people are Russian, with areas of Russian population concentrated in the eastern part of the republic.
In his meeting today with the Ukrainian-Americans, officials said Mr. Bush promised that Washington "will be prepared to salute Ukrainian independence" on Sunday and "that we will move forward on the issue."
In another sign of change in American policy, an official said today that this week, after the Senate ratified the treaty reducing conventional armed forces in Europe, known as the C.F.E. Treaty, that Washington contacted "both Moscow -- the Russians -- and Kiev -- the Ukrainians -- to urge them to ratify it as well."
The United States has been warning the Ukraine for some time against trying to gain control of the nuclear weapons on its soil for any purpose other than to destroy them.
The White House also has signaled that it would be reluctant to give aid to the Ukraine if it carried through on an announcement that it planned to develop its own, large-scale military.
President Leonid M. Kravchuk of the Ukraine sent Mr. Bush a letter recently reassuring him that the Ukraine did not seek to develop an offensive army, an official said. Mr. Kravchuk, the official said, asserted that the Ukraine's plans for a 400,000-man army represented a "demobilization" from the current 1.5-million-strong Soviet military force on Ukrainian soil.

HEADLINE: U.S. Base Is an Oasis To Haitians

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba, Nov. 27

 BODY:
In a dusty clearing ringed by double rows of concertina wire and patrolled by armed American guards, scores of Haitian refugees stood in long lines for lunch today at an emergency camp being built here to guard their welfare.
"We don't know how long we'll be here, but we know we can't go back" to Haiti, said Celius Pierre Williams, a 39-year-old math teacher, voicing a sentiment loudly seconded by several young men clustered around him. "The army would kill us." 
 The tent city springing up in a corner of an American naval base here aims to ease the burden on the overcrowded Coast Guard and Navy vessels that have plucked thousands of Haitians from the rickety vessels on which they left their country. The refugees were fleeing from the turmoil that followed the ouster of Haiti's first democratically elected leader, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on Sept. 30.
 
135 Tents Going Up
 Today about 240 refugees were being transferred from a Coast Guard cutter to an emergency center of cinderblock buildings and World War II-era Quonset huts at Camp Bulkeley, a former Marine training center at the Guantanamo Bay naval base.
By Friday, about 135 large green canvas tents will accommodate about 20 people each, or a total of roughly 2,500 people. Just over 1,000 refugees are living at the camp now.
More than 2,000 Haitians remained on 14 other Coast Guard vessels, and others were in custody in Navy ships offshore. Many of the refugees survived their perilous voyages with only the clothes they were wearing.
On a tour organized by the Pentagon, reporters were guided today through the emergency camp and to some of the cutters. "We're going to see a continued flow of Haitians," acknowledged the commander of the military task force responsible for building the refugee center, Brig. Gen. George H. Walls Jr. of the Marines.
General Walls said he expected to receive orders soon to maximize the shelter capacity on the base. American military officials said that such an order could mean beds for several thousand more refugees.
 
A Political Limbo
 The military and Coast Guard emphasize that theirs is a humanitarian mission. For the Haitians, though, the emergency camp at the American military base on Cuba's eastern tip is a political limbo, and a short-term solution to a difficult diplomatic issue.
United States officials argue that the Haitians are economic refugees and should not be granted political asylum. But the Bush Administration is facing criticism that this stance conflicts with its policy of opposing the forced repatriation of Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong.
Officials from the Immigration and Naturalization Service who were here to interview the Haitians told reporters that the refugees had fled to escape the indiscriminate violence that spread through their country after President Aristide's ouster.
"Some of my family was killed by stray bullets," said Ari Milot, a 26-year-old fisherman. "The army would come and knock down entire villages."
Aboard the Coast Guard cutter Legare, 285 Haitians were crammed today onto a helicopter flight deck, , huddled together under a patchwork quilt of canvas tarps lashed together by Air Force crews. .
Most of the refugees on the ship were young men and teen-agers. "Traveling is too difficult for the children," said Erick Chery, a 25-year-old day laborer.
In interviews conducted in French and English and in Creole through an interpreter, the refugees on the Legare said they received two sizable meals of rice, pinto beans and fresh fruit each day. Dressed in short-sleeved shirts, trousers and shower togs provided by the Coast Guard, most of the men and boys said they had no other belongings with them.
On another Coast Guard cutter, the Steadfast, the otherwise quiet refugees lined the top deck and sang a spiritual hymn, swaying and clapping to some of the refrains: "Glory to the Lord! Hallelujah!" and "The time has come."
 
Straining Guard's Resources
 General Walls said that the crowded conditions aboard the ships were taxing the Coast Guard's resources and made it imperative that the refugees be unloaded.
The refugees will receive more hospitable if still spartan accommodations on the site at Camp Bulkeley, which juts out into the Caribbean at the naval base's northern boundary. The transfer will also free up Coast Guard vessels to resume patrols.
At the windswept campsite, 18 to 20 cots are squeezed under each canvas tent, per United Nations specifications. Men and women live in separate quarters, and children stay with oneparent.
The food is better here too, the refugees said. The base commander, Capt. William C. McCamy of the Navy, said the military serves a hot breakfast, including scrambled eggs, oatmeal, fruit and juice.
About 2,400 personnel are stationed at the Guantanamo Bay base, which was first leased to Washington by Cuba in 1903. The base became a symbol of cold-war tensions after Fidel Castro rose to power in 1959. The United States pays an annual rent of about $4,000, but Cuba has never cashed the checks.

HEADLINE: In Medicaid Vote, Congress Limits How States Can Pay

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Congress today passed legislation that sets new ground rules for the financing of Medicaid, severely restricting the states' use of certain taxes and other devices to pay for the health care of 27 million poor people.
The bill follows the contours of an agreement negotiated last week by the Bush Administration and the National Governors' Association, which lobbied for the bill in the hope that it would slow the explosive growth of Medicaid. 
 President Bush is expected to sign the measure, which will curtail the states' ability to shift Medicaid costs from state governments to the Federal Government.
 
Effect in Region
 Officials in New York and New Jersey said the bill could adversely affect their states because it sets limits on Federal payments to hospitals serving large numbers of poor people, at a time when the need for such care appears to be growing. Connecticut expects no adverse effect.
Thomas A. Scully, associate director of the Office of Management and Budget, who represented the White House in negotiations with Congress on Medicaid, said: "I'm happy. It's a reasonable compromise."
Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors Association, said, "We are very pleased."
But Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, said that as a result of the deal struck today "it's going to be much more difficult for low-income patients to get the care they need," in part because there will be "artificial limits on reimbursement" of certain hospitals serving large numbers of poor people.
The bill limits the states' ability to pay their share of Medicaid through money collected from hospitals, as taxes or voluntary donations. States count these taxes and donations as part of their share of Medicaid and can get back in Federal matching funds as much as four dollars for every one collected. The Administration had called some of these fund-raising arrangements scams, because hospitals got back more than they contributed, and Washington bore most of the cost.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said: "These financing arrangements are, in effect, an open spigot in the Federal Treasury. There is virtually no limit to the amount of money that the Federal Government may end up pouring into these programs."
Thirty-eight states, including New York, New Jersey, Florida, Texas and California, have adopted such fund-raising arrangements to finance health care for poor people, especially children and pregnant women. Under the bill, states may continue using such techniques until at least Sept. 30, 1992, and some states could continue as late as June 30, 1993.
The Federal Government and the states share the cost of Medicaid. The state share rises with a state's per capita income, to a maximum of 50 percent in higher-income states like New York and California.
 
Types of Restrictions
 The bill approved today would eventually impose three types of restrictions on the states' ability to pay for Medicaid:
*States would no longer receive Federal matching money for revenue obtained from donations by hospitals or nursing homes.
*If states impose taxes on hospitals or nursing homes, such taxes may not account for more than 25 percent of the state share of Medicaid.
*Special payments to hospitals serving "a disproportionate number of low-income patients" must not exceed 12 percent of total national spending on Medicaid. Eighteen states are now above that level and the Administration says that some states have abused this provision of the Medicaid law by designating too may hospitals as eligible for these extra payments.
In September, the Administration issued rules that would have imposed much more severe restrictions on state fund-raising techniques. The bill approved today blocks those rules, which were to take effect on Jan. 1, 1992.
Until now, there have been virtually no Federal restrictions on how states pay their share of Medicaid costs. The bill adopted today, therefore, represents a fundamental change in the program, which was created in 1965.
Mr. Scheppach of the governors' association said the bill was good because it provided the "permanence and stability" that state officials need in planning Medicaid programs and budgets.
But Mr. Waxman, a longtime defender of the Medicaid program, said, "The governors made a mistake entering into this agreement with the Administration, and I think they are going to regret very soon allowing the Federal Government to interfere so heavily with their ability to run Medicaid and finance the program."
Mr. Waxman said that governors had "a gun to their head" as they negotiated with the Administration. The gun, he said, was the set of regulations scheduled to take effect Jan. 1.
Members of Congress wrote special provisions into the bill to soften its effect on a handful of states, including Connecticut, Texas and Georgia.
The bill was passed by voice vote in both houses after a conference committee worked out a compromise.
Senator Wyche Fowler Jr., Democrat of Georgia, initially warned that the bill would have a "potentially disastrous effect." But after talking with the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, he said that he would support the bill because he had obtained "critical changes that should prove beneficial to the State of Georgia."
Bruce Lesley, a Washington representative for the State of Texas, said tonight: "The Administration bought off states one by one, making concessions to address their specific concerns. We have been working on this issue for six months, but does the bill improve the health of anyone? The answer is no. It just sets limits on the Medicaid program."
The bill passed today does not effect a section of the Medicaid law that says payments to hospitals and nursing homes must be "reasonable and adequate." Many hospitals and nursing homes have sucessfully sued states to force them to raise their Medicaid payments, and such suits are likely to increase if states do not find new sources of revenue to replace those banned by the bill passed today.
Medicaid has grown rapidly in the last year because of the recession and because Congress expanded eligibility to new groups of people.
The Administration estimates that state fund-raising schemes will cost the Federal Government $5.5 billion in extra payments this year. Without the new restrictions, it said, the cost would rise to $10 billion next year.

HEADLINE: Strategy of a Tax Cut

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
After months of hesitation and often aimless economic debate, the White House and Congress have suddenly decided that now is the right time to talk about a tax cut, even if it is not the right time to enact one.
It remains unlikely that Congress will actually act on tax reduction until next year, even after completion of hearings on the issue that House and Senate chairmen today scheduled for December. There are strong pressures against a cut now, including economic arguments that it might not be the best way to speed the economy's recovery. 
 But there is no doubt that Washington has just gone through one of those peculiar moments in which all parties seem to have been stampeded at least into the appearance of action by a sudden political epiphany.
 
Critical Issue Unaddressed
 In this case, it seemed, both Congress and the White House came to the realization that lawmakers were about to go home for two months without addressing the one issue foremost in voters' minds -- the sagging economy -- and that it would get increasingly hard for them to keep blaming each other for the lapse.
Over a chaotic 24 hours, a last-minute economic proposal that a group of House Republicans floated as a short-term tactical measure suddenly galvanized the capital, even though it was not supported even by a majority of their own party.
After initially chastising the sponsors, President Bush reversed himself and reluctantly endorsed their plan, only to find himself assailed once again for flip-flopping in a way that Republican strategists found uncomfortably like his vacillation over taxes in the 1990 budget debate.
The Democrats, for their part, gleefully scheduled hearings next month on the Republican plan by the Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. The Democrats are expected to bring up their own proposals for tax cuts, while attacking the Republicans over tax cuts that Democrats say favor the wealthiest Americans. The Democrats also left open the possibility of returning to a session in December, rather than sitting at home and waiting for the broadside from the White House that Mr. Bush had warned would be forthcoming in the winter recess.
 
'Politician's' Holy Grail'
 The result will inevitably be a lot of punchy political lines, but perhaps not much sound economic policy.
"They're all searching for the tax cut that raises revenue -- the politician's Holy Grail," said Herbert Stein, an economist with the American Enterprise Institute, adding that it did not seem likely to him that the quest would bear fruit.
It all began with Republicans in the House of Representatives who, frustrated by the President's inaction, threw together a last-minute economic growth package, including a cut in the tax rate on profits from investments, to show they were concerned about the economy even if the White House did not appear to be.
Leading the charge was Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, who is one of the most vocal proponents of a tax cut and, by extension, one of the leading critics of White House inaction.
The Republicans dared their Democratic opponents to bring it to the floor before the Thanksgiving recess, knowing it had no prayer of passage but counting on attacking the Democrats later if they failed to take action.
 
Letter Inflames Bush
 At first, Mr. Bush was annoyed by the Republican move, Administration officials said, and a letter over the weekend from 81 of the 166 House Republicans urging Mr. Bush to appoint Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp as his domestic policy czar only served to inflame Mr. Bush further.
Mr. Bush is reported to have said he saw the letter and the growth package as the kind of challenge that would not have been made to President Richard M. Nixon or to President Ronald Reagan, and on Monday he told a group of House Republicans that he would not back their bill.
But Administration officials said Mr. Bush had been coming under increasing pressure from his own aides, from within the party and from supporters around the country, to take some action on the economy, if only to demonstrate that he is concerned about domestic issues and stem the decline in his public approval ratings.
The noise finally penetrated the White House on Tuesday morning, officials said, when Vice President Dan Quayle, who had returned from a trip to Massachusetts on Monday evening, told the President in the Oval Office that everyone in New England was talking about how bad the economy was and waiting for him to do something.
After an intensive discussion among Mr. Bush, Mr. Quayle, John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Richard G. Darman, the budget director, Mr. Bush decided to lend his support to Mr. Gingrich's Republican growth package.
In doing so, he strayed from the advice of top White House advisers, including Mr. Sununu, Mr. Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who had been telling Mr. Bush for weeks not to take action to spur economic growth and that, in particular, engaging in a bidding war with the Democrats over a tax cut would be politically suicidal.
"There had been an argument for weeks in the Administration about whether it was better to get Congress out of town or take the lead on our economic agenda even if that meant keeping them around a while," one official said.
"It happens that Brady and Sununu wanted to believe that a lot of our trouble had to do with Congress being around," the official said. "There was a certain amount of self-deception and self-justification there."
In the end, he said, "The President was convinced he could not fail to show support for a united effort by House Republicans, which embodies our own principles, on the ground that life is easier if Congress is not around. That's not a policy, it's an excuse."
 
Gambit Falls Flat
 While Mr. Sununu telephoned Mr. Gingrich to tell him the President had changed his mind, Mr. Bush told reporters at a photo opportunity that he was "enthusiastic" about Mr. Gingrich's plan and demanded that Congress vote on it that very day.
The tactic fell flat. For one thing, Mr. Gingrich's proposal was not even in legislative form at the time, and many Republican lawmakers and party strategists said Mr. Bush's endorsement was too tepid and too late.
Mr. Bush's endorsement also turned around the Democrats on Capitol Hill, focusing the normally confused closing days of a Congressional session on a single issue, emboldening their attack on the White House over the economy and leaving the White House open for another fight over the capital gains tax cut.
The Democrats have had success in portraying that proposal as a tax break for the rich, while the Republicans have struggled to make their argument that it would also benefit the middle class.
Meanwhile, nobody at either end of Capitol Hill missed the point that Mr. Bush seemed to be putting his economic agenda in the hands of Mr. Gingrich, who last year showed no compunction about breaking with the White House openly and dramatically when Mr. Bush broke his "no new taxes" campaign pledge from 1988.
And, even worse in the eyes of many Republicans, the President appeared to be flip-flopping on taxes again. One Republican commented that if a radio program were to be made about this White House, it would have to be called "Flipper McGee and Millie."

HEADLINE: Democrats Set Hearings On Taxes and Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Preparing the ground for a showdown with President Bush next year, Congressional Democrats announced today a series of public hearings next month on tax policy and the state of the economy.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the first witnesses he would call, in hearings that he scheduled for next week, would be the President's top economic policy advisers. Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas said he would try to get those Administration officials to appear before his Finance Committee as well. 
 No legislation would be drafted until next year. But the Democrats intend to use the hearings during what is usually a slow time in Washington to spotlight their proposals for tax cuts for middle-income families and to paint the President as the patron of fat cats.
 
Goal for Tax Legislation
 The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said he hoped a tax measure would be enacted early next year.
Mr. Rostenkowski scheduled hearings for Dec. 5 and 6, Mr. Bentsen set his for Dec. 12 and 13, and Mr. Rostenkowski scheduled two more days on Dec. 17 and 18.
In an interview, Mr. Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, accused the Democrats of trying "to get attention," but he said Administration officials would be pleased to testify next week.
The Democratic strategy is to control the political stage each week between now and Christmas.
The mood among Congressional Democrats today was one of utter relief. They had feared that Mr. Bush would have the political arena to himself for two months while Congress was out of session and would use that time to campaign against the Democratic Congress for leaving town without a plan for dealing with the economy.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bush endorsed a tax-cut plan hastily drafted late last week by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia and other conservative House Republicans. Until then, the White House position had been that the President would present a full-scale plan to deal with weakness in the economy in his State of the Union Message, probably in February.
The Democrats were having a hard time mounting an attack against patience, but once Mr. Bush sided with Mr. Gingrich, against the advice of some of his more moderate advisers, the Democrats seized the opportunity.
They believe they can win politically by demonstrating that Mr. Bush is behind a giveaway to the rich, while they favor middle-class tax relief.
"He got us off the hook," said Representative Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota.
The Democrats circulated a study by the theoretically nonpartisan expert staff of the Congressional Joint Tax Committee showing that under the Republican plan, taxpayers with incomes between $20,000 and $50,000 a year would get tax cuts ranging from $45 to $84, while those with incomes above $200,000 a year could count on a tax reduction of more than $11,500.
Mr. Gingrich challenged those figures, saying they did not take account of hundreds of thousands of new jobs that he said would be created by an economy stimulated by the Republican tax cuts.
But statistics like the Joint Tax Committee's proved to be a boon to Democrats in last year's budget negotiations.
A Congressional staff assistant said Mr. Rostenkowski called Administration officials today and invited them to testify on "the Bush-Gingrich tax plan."
Mr. Rostenkowski's staff said the first two days of his hearings would involve Administration officials and other politicians with tax plans. Prominent economists will testify at the hearings later in the month.
Senator Bentsen said in an interview that he had not prepared a witness list but that he hoped Mr. Bush's top advisers would testify. He has expressed frustration all year about the refusal of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, to appear before his panel to testify on tax policy.
House Democrats discussed their strategy at a caucus late Tuesday night. "Nothing unites the Democrats like Newt Gingrich," said a staff assistant who attended the closed session.
According to some lawmakers, Democratic leaders, including Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the party whip, argued that Congress should go back into session after Thanksgiving and pass a Democratic tax bill that Mr. Bush would have to sign or veto.
But cooler heads prevailed. Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the economy was so "fragile" that to pass a bill in haste would be irresponsible.
At the end of a news conference this evening, Mr. Foley said, "It's important we have the opportunity to examine a number of proposals fully and responsibly."
On the House floor today, Republicans continued to insist that their tax plan would give the economy a quick jolt and should be approved at once. "Our economy is hurting a great deal," said Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota. "Despite the fact that this is the 11th hour, we should act now."
Democrats have proposed a variety of tax measures, but all of them would have the effect of giving tax cuts worth hundreds of dollars a year to families with incomes in the range of $20,000 to $50,000 a year.
 
Taxing the Rich
 Mr. Rostenkowski favors paying for those cuts by raising taxes on the wealthy. Other Democrats have other ways, like cutting military spending to keep the Treasury from losing money.
Among the main elements of the Republican plan are a lower capital gains tax rate, new tax breaks for small businesses and real estate investments, a new form of individual retirement account, tax incentives for savings by families with incomes below $50,000 and an increase in the amount older people can earn from working without reduction in their Social Security benefits.
Democrats say the Republican plan would cost the Treasury more than $20 billion over five years. The Republicans say the revenue generated by the capital gains cut and the new I.R.A. rules would offset that cost.
 
 
A SAMPLING OF TAX CUT PROPOSALS

 
BENTSEN AND ROTH
 
Proposal: Am income tax credit of $300 for each child 18 or younger and, regardless of income or pension coverage, full deductibility of up to $2,000 in contributions to individual retirement accounts.
 
Plan for financing: A 5 percent reduction in military spending.
 
Sponsors: Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, and Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware.
 
 
ROSTENKOWSKI
 
Proposal: An income tax credit equal to 20 percent of the Social Security and Medicare taxes the worker pays, with a maximum of $200 for a single taxpayer and $400 for a working couple. The credits would last two years.
 
Plan for financing: A 10 percent tax surcharge on that part of income above $1 million and a rise in the top tax bracket from the current 31 percent to 35 percent, which would apply to incomes above $85,000 for individuals and $145,000 for couples.
 
Sponsors: Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois.
 
 
HOUSE REPUBLICAN<spade>
 
Proposal: A cut in the capital gains tax, to about 20 percent from the current cap of 28 percent, phased in over three years; adjustment in the value of capital gains to take account of inflation; withdrawal of I.R.A. funds without penalty for the purchase of a first home; a new form of I.R.A. in which earnings on accounts held at least five years would not be taxed; a deduction of up to $450 a year for savings by taxpayers with incomes below $50,000; an increase in the amount of income a person could earn and still receive Social Security benefits; tax breaks for investments by small businesses; tax break for real estate investments.
 
Plan for financing: According to the sponsors' reckoning, challenged by Democrats, the cost of the tax cuts, more than $20 billion over five years, would be offset by revenue generated by the reduction in the capital gains tax and the new form of I.R.A.'s.
 
Sponsors: House Repbulican Polciy Committee.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
3 A.M. in the Capitol, and Not Pretty

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
About 3 this morning, Representative Charles Wilson, the lanky Texas Democrat, could be found sprawled out on a bench just outside the House chamber, snoring away. Passers-by hardly noticed him.
Several other members were sitting nearby, eyes shut, in wingback leather chairs and in an anteroom off the House floor, and the couches in the cloakrooms were fully occupied. 
 Not so in the Senate, which had tired of waiting for the House to pass some bill or other and recessed for a short night's sleep.
Though some managed to fit in naps, they were not enough to restore good humor in the House.
As the morning wore on, members grew increasingly irritable. From time to time, they lost patience with their colleagues' speeches on things like the supplemental spending bill and broke into chants of "Vote! Vote! Vote!"
Nor were the substantive speeches calm, measured discussions, especially when the Republicans confronted the suddenly resurrected crime bill. Representative Lawrence Coughlin, Republican of Pennsylvania, said, "It is the most pro-criminal bill possible."
But despite his anger at the bill itself, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, could have been speaking for the Congress and the whole issue when he declared, "We come here today in a spasm of spurious macho -- to prove to our constituents that we are not soft on crime."
 
An Ironclad Delay
 Congress never seems to lack reasons for delay, but it may have found a new one this morning.
The House wanted to take up the transportation conference report, but it needed the original copies of the House and Senate bills.
About 4 A.M., lawmakers and members of their staffs were panicking outside the House chamber, trying to figure out what they could do. "Do we know where they are?" one in the group asked.
They were locked in a safe on the Senate side. No one had the key.
It was close to 4:30 when the House agreed by unanimous consent to waive the rules and begin preliminary debate on the bill even though they did not have the original documents. Perhaps they were recalling the tradition that maintains that during the legislative blizzard of the first days of the New Deal, the House once passed a rolled-up newspaper instead of a bill.
It was close to 5 A.M. when Charles W. Johnson, the House deputy parliamentarian, said officials rousted from bed a clerk on the Senate Public Works Committee who rushed to the Capitol to retrieve the bills, saving the day -- and the transportation bill.
"The House and Senate never act," Mr. Johnson said, "unless the documented papers are before them."
 
Recess From Art
 Some orators spurned invective for verse.
But in the relentlessly competitive world of politics, even would-be poets try to outdo one another.
First came Representative Jim Bunning, a Kentucky Republican who doubtless will remain better known for pitching a perfect game for the Philadelphia Phillies against the New York Mets in 1964 than for his verse.
On Monday he recited his poem, "The Eve Before Recess," to the Ways and Means Committee:
 
 Twas the eve before recess
 And throughout the House
 All the members were restless,
 They all wanted out.
 The conferences all hung
 In the member's cold stare
 In hopes that sine die
 Soon would be there.
Not to be outdone, Senator William V. Roth Jr., a Delaware Republican, weighed in Tuesday on the Senate floor with his own version, " 'Twas the Night Before Recess":
 
 'Twas the night before recess and all through the land
 The economy was stagnant, employees were canned.
 The Congress was wrapped up all tight in its words;
 At home angry voices of voters were heard.
 While lobbyists with smiles and special interests with grins
 Went off to vacation to boast of their wins.
Joseph Brodsky, the poet laureate of the United States, has nothing to worry about. Though they get credit for trying, the consensus on Capitol Hill was that the works of Mr. Roth and Mr. Bunning did not scan or rhyme well.
 
Punctuating the Session
 Always vying to get the last word, Republicans and Democrats staged their end-of-session news conferences today to snare attention for themselves and to sell the Congressional line of how "productive" they were this year.
Today, Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington pronounced the last year as "a signally important and significant session of the Congress."
Representative Vin Weber, a Minnesota Republican, spun it another way: "This is not a Congress that many people should feel proud of," he said. "The Congress has sort of fallen into a pattern of working very hard and taking credit for the speed with which we spin our wheels."
 
Borough Will Tell
 Early this morning, in the marathon, 15-hour negotiations to put together a banking bill, Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, popped into the room and began dining on Chinese takeout from boxes.
He disappeared and came back a few minutes later with a slice of pizza loaded with all sorts of toppings. His hearty appetite provoked more than a few snickers from many famished lawmakers, staff members and lobbyists.
But Mr. Schumer had a ready retort: "Hey, I'm from Brooklyn," he said between mouthfuls. "It's in my genes."
 
A Round of Planning?
 Not all lawmakers and their aides were concentrating on turgid legislative text before the sun rose over the Capitol this morning.
In the wood-trimmed offices of Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, and his staff could be found thumbing through catalogues, searching for holiday gift ideas during a break.
Mr. Michel was particularly interested in the gardening catalogues.
"He sat down and paged through one and said his usual, 'Hmm,' " an aide, Kerri Sattler, recalled. "He was interested in the kitchen compost, where you recycle your vegetable peels and egg shells."
His male aides went for the racier catalogues. The top choice: Victoria's Secret, a women's lingerie and sleepwear catalogue.

HEADLINE: After Senate Backs Bush and Blocks Anti-Crime Bill, Congress Goes Home

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Congress went home today fighting over crime after House Democrats suddenly brought up and passed an anti-crime bill, and Senate Republicans just as promptly killed the politically charged measure with a filibuster threat.
The Senate action represented a victory for President Bush, who had faced an emboldened Democratic challenge on his handling of the economy and other social issues. Mr. Bush had asked that the anti-crime legislation include tougher restrictions on criminal appeals in Federal courts and looser restrictions against police searches and seizures of evidence, but his differences with Democrats on the issue had taken on broader political meaning. 
 The House worked past dawn as Democrats considered how to deal with Mr. Bush's dare that it stay in session to pass an economic growth package sponsored by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip.
Democratic leaders had dropped the crime bill from the end-of-session agenda, at first sure that a coalition of liberals who disliked the death penalty and conservatives who agreed with Mr. Bush would kill it.
 
Action at 6 A.M.
 As late as midnight, Democratic leaders were privately saying they did not want to risk losing political capital by bringing up the bill for a vote that they figured would lose by from 6 to 25 votes.
But the delay over the economic package gave them time for an all-night lobbying effort that relied on appeals to party loyalty and arguments that the bill was, on balance, a strong measure.
About 6 A.M., they brought the bill up, still uncertain of victory but increasingly confident. With Speaker Thomas S. Foley watching carefully over any last-second switches, the Democrats passed the bill, 205 to 203.
Mr. Gingrich underlined the political link between the conflicts on taxes and crime during the pre-dawn debate on the floor when he attacked the Democratic position on the anti-crime bill. "The liberals in the House and Senate side," he said, "gathered together to perpetrate a hoax. The death penalty was written in such a way that it could never be used."
But Senate Democrats failed to follow up on the new aggressiveness displayed by their House colleagues, losing a vote to end debate on the bill and bring it to the floor for a vote. A 60-vote majority would have been required to avert a threatened filibuster, but Democrats could muster only a 49-to-38 vote. Three Democrats joined 35 Republicans in sinking the measure.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who was the main sponsor of the anti-crime package, said he and his fellow Democratic leaders had given up hope on the legislation because of the threat of a Presidential veto. Then late Tuesday night they noted an extreme exasperation among members at a party caucus. "The tax thing really got people upset," he said. "There was a feeling in the caucus that Bush is manipulating us."
Speaker Foley suddenly called swing members into his office, and even twisted arms on the floor during votes on less disputed measures to expand unemployment benefits, put conditions on the renewal of normal trade relations with China and set aside 8.2 million acres of desert as a nature preserve in Southern California.
In a spirit of party loyalty, about a dozen liberals suppressed their dismay over the anti-crime bill's expansion of the death penalty to more than 50 Federal crimes. Meanwhile, leaders persuaded a handful of conservative Democrats, who like the President had argued that the bill too easily granted habeas corpus appeals to death-row inmates, that the bill was tougher on criminals than current law. Some voted with the leaders; others simply cast no vote all.
 
Imparting a Positive Spin
 One hundred and ninety-nine Democrats and 6 Republicans voted for the bill, 53 Democrats, 149 Republicans and 1 independent voted against it. Those voting in favor of President's position included 149 Republicans and 53 Democrats.
The Congressional Democratic leadership, at a joint news conference this afternoon, tried to portray the ultimate death of the crime bill, along with various ethics scandals and the embarrassing hearings on the accusations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas, as irritating exceptions to an otherwise successful session.
Citing a sweeping transportation bill, protection of bank deposits, extension of unemployment benefits and passage of civil rights legislation, and the still incomplete campaign financing bills, Mr. Foley said, "We have a solid record of achievement."
He and Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, promised that the Congress would work to pass an economic plan that includes provisions for a tax cut as well as health care legislation when members returned to work next year. Mr. Mitchell took a swipe at Mr. Bush's embrace of Mr. Gingrich's proposal, calling it more of the same "trickle down policy." He added, "By contrast, we Democrats think the American people have been trickled down long enough."
Senator Robert Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, attempted to end the session on a bipartisan note. Turning to his Democratic colleagues on the floor, he said, "I think we had a pretty good year." He concluded his remarks with the hope that "by December both parties can work together to work out the right economic growth package. We want to make certain that what we do in Congress will make a difference in the lives of Americans."
But in what appeared to be a pointed insult, the Democratic leaders decided not to make the traditional telephone call to the President saying they were completing their work and going home for recess.
Mr. Bush had angered Democrats by pledging to veto the anti-crime bill Monday, explaining in a letter to Representative Robert H. Michel, the House minority leader, that "for too long, the scales of justice have been tipped in favor of criminals instead of law-abiding Americans."
Democratic leaders said Mr. Foley thought about making a full-court press to defeat the President. But his vote counts Tuesday afternoon convinced him he did not have the votes to pass the bill. Then at the Tuesday night caucus, the anger over the threatened veto merged with anger over the President's challenge to the Democrats to quickly pass a tax cut.
"There was a real fighting spirit in the caucus," recalled Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico, "that charged up a lot of members to take on the President."
 
The Habeas Corpus Debate
 Another factor in passing the bill was the vigorous lobbying of Representative Jack Brooks, the influential chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who persuaded a number of members in his Texas delegation to follow his lead.
Mr. Bush's supporters said he was upset that Democrats had detached a provision from the bill that would have given the police wider ability to obtain evidence without holding a court-granted search warrant.
The President's main objection to the bill was on its habeas corpus provisions. He contended the legislation would create loopholes for criminal defendants to needlessly appeal their cases in Federal courts, even when they had clearly received fair trials in lower courts. Mr. Bush preferred a Senate measure, abandoned in a Democratic-dominated conference committee over the weekend, that would have allowed Federal courts to dismiss appeals by ruling that defendants already received a fair hearing at the state level.
Democratic leaders said their version would have achieved the White House goal of averting endless delays in capital punishment cases by setting a one-year deadline on habeas corpus petitions and barring successive appeals. They accused Mr. Bush of opposing the bill to support the gun lobby, which strongly opposed a five-day waiting period on the purchase of handguns set forth in a provision called the Brady bill, named for James S. Brady, the press secretary to President Ronald Reagan who was wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt against Mr. Reagan.
 
Issues for '92
 President Bush had said he would support the Brady bill if it was included in a comprehensive anti-crime package that limited the rights of criminal defendants and expanded the latitude of law enforcement officers to search for evidence and arrest criminals.
House Democrats said they would consider introducing the Brady bill outside the crime package next year, and make crime and handgun control issues in the 1992 Presidential election.
Among the most controversial measures in the bill is the expansion of the death penalty to 52 Federal crimes, a provision that conservatives said did not go far enough but one that liberals said represented a deterioration of society's humanity.
More than 20 liberal and conservative Democrats decided to back the bill in the wee hours of the morning. "In the final analysis," said Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, "liberals realized that defeating the bill would destroy the chances for meaningful gun control. And more moderate members realized there was no substance to Bush's charges that this was not a strong crime bill."

HEADLINE: President's Proclamation

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Following is the text of President Bush's Thanksgiving Day proclamation.

The White House
 
By the President of the United States of America
 
A Proclamation 
 From the moment it was "conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal," our nation has enjoyed the mercy and protection of Almighty God. Thus, when we join with family and friends on Thanksgiving, we celebrate not only the many blessings that we have received as individuals -- including the gift of life itself -- but also our great fortune as one nation under God. On this occasion, Americans of every race, creed and walk of life are united by a profound sense of gratitude and duty.
As we continue the Thanksgiving tradition, a tradition cherished by every generation of Americans, we reflect in a special way on the blessings of the past year. When this nation and its coalition partners took up arms in a last-resort effort to repel aggression in the Persian Gulf, we were spared the terrible consequences of a long and protracted struggle. Indeed, the millions of people who prayed for a quick end to the fighting saw those prayers answered with a swiftness and certainty that exceeded all expectations. During the past year, we have also witnessed the demise of communism and welcomed millions of courageous people into the community of free nations.
Of course, as we give thanks for these and other developments, we also remember the less fortunate -- those who do not yet share in the promise of freedom; those who do not know the comfort of peace and security; and those whose tables do not reflect the prosperity and plenty.
Time and again, Scripture describes our Creator's special love for the poor. As the Psalmist wrote, "He pours contempt upon princes. . .yet sets the poor on high from affliction." In this great nation, we have a special obligation to care for the ill and the destitute. Therefore, recalling that much will be asked of those to whom much has been given, let us resolve to make food drives and other forms of charity an increasingly important part of our Thanksgiving tradition.
On this occasion, as we count our blessings and reach out to help the less fortunate, we also do well to remember that, in many ways, the poorest nations are those who neither recognize nor revere what our founders called "the laws of nature and of nature's God." Indeed, we have seen totalitarian regimes impoverish entire peoples, not just economically, but spiritually, by denigrating religion and by denying the inherent dignity and worth of individuals. The moral bankruptcy of communism should remind every free nation of the dangers of cynicism and materialism.
Similarly, can any individual be truly rich or truly satisfied if he or she has not discovered the rewards of service to one's fellow man? Since most of us first experience the love of God through the goodness and generosity of others, what better gift could we give our children than a positive example?
Finally, as we gather with family and friends on Thanksgiving, we know that our greatest blessings are not necessarily material ones. Indeed, perhaps the best thing about this occasion is that it reminds us that God loves each and every one of us. Like a faithful and loving parent, He always stands ready to comfort, guide and forgive. That is our real cause for Thanksgiving, today and every day of our lives.
NOW THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Thursday, Nov. 28, 1991, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I urge all Americans to gather together in their homes and in places of worship on that day to offer thanks to Almighty God for the many blessings that He has bestowed upon us as individuals and as a nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have here unto set my hand this 25th day of November, in the year of our Lord 1991, and of the Independence of the United States of America the 216th.
GEORGE BUSH

HEADLINE: A Lesson on AIDS Fight From Developing Nations

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The nation's fight against AIDS could benefit from lessons learned in developing countries where condoms are vigorously promoted, with American help, on television and in drug stores, a Federal official says.
The official, Dr. Jeff Harris, director of the AIDS program for the United States Agency for International Development, said Monday that modern marketing techniques based on research had increased condom use substantially in countries where the heterosexual spread of AIDS posed a serious threat. 
 The lesson for the United States, he said at a news conference at the State Department, is "that we can increase condom use" with programs based on a thorough understanding of what would motivate sexually active adults to use condoms and practice other sexual acts considered safe.
 
'Portray Condoms Positively'
 The human immunodeficiency virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread principally through sexual activity or the sharing of contaminated needles for the injection of drugs. Latex condoms have proved effective in decreasing the spread of AIDS through sexual intercourse.
Dr. Harris said efforts should be made in the United States to "portray condoms positively" and to work at a community or neighborhood level to promote their use.
While he said that research on sexual practices and attitudes was essential to accomplish these goals, Dr. Harris declined to comment about the Bush Administration's opposition to such research within the United States.
The National Institutes of Health has recommended that the Federal Government sponsor research among sexually active adults to learn how best to promote changes in sexual behavior to decrease the chances of contracting AIDS. But such research proposals have been turned down in the face of opposition from the White House and from some members of Congress.
Dr. Harris said programs of the Agency for International Development had promoted both sexual abstinence and safe sex practices. But abstinence, he admitted, has not been a widely accepted message and leaders of some countries recognize this.
 
Aiming at Specific Groups
 "In Uganda, the President and first lady say they would like a return to traditional values" of no sexual promiscuity, Dr. Harris said, "but they also recognize that condoms have a role." Condoms are widely promoted now in Uganda with advertising and distribution programs.
Television advertising, based on market research into how best to reach specific populations, has successfully promoted the use of condoms in such areas as Turkey, Ecuador, the Caribbean and south-central Africa. Dr. Harris said that in each area the program has to be based on a concept that make condoms acceptable.
For instance, he said, in Mexico, prostitutes were not insisting that their clients use condoms until a survey found that most of the prostitutes were also mothers. The campaign shifted to encourage condom use to protect the children.
A condom program in the Dominican Republic faltered until research showed that people did not know how to use the devices. Condoms became more accepted after a comic strip brochure was printed and counselors, in person-to-person interviews, began explaining how to use condoms.
Successful programs have borrowed sales techniques from consumer products, Dr. Harris said. "We market condoms like we would Coca-Cola," he said. This has included songs by major entertainers.

HIGH WIRE OVER THE DELAWARE
Since 1987, the Delaware River Water Commission and its member states -- New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware -- have thrashed their way toward tough new water-quality regulations, writing and rewriting terms and proposed policies and, in effect, trying to walk a high wire: maintaining first-rate water quality without choking development. B5.
 
THE NEW NEEDIEST 
 As the recession drags on and deepens, tens of thousands of working-class families have found themselves on the brink of poverty. For officials at the charities they are turning to in record numbers, this flood of "the new poor" comes on top of the vast problems of the chronically needy. Neediest Cases, B4.

AMERICA 101: LEARNING ENGLISH
Americans hold tight to the image of Thanksgiving: the extended family gathered around the dinner table to celebrate their lives together. On Thanksgiving, Americans are supposed to go home. But for the immigrant students in Donna Harkavy's English class, home is neither the new land nor the land left behind. Their best approximation of home is this class in an automotive trade school in Brooklyn. A1.
 
CRITICISM ON CONTRACTING
Three companies that lost a $1.9 million contract for electronic home surveillance of released inmates say that prison officials used an unfair screening process to eliminate them. They urged the city to reopen the bidding process. B3.
 
DISCIPLINING DOCTORS
The process by which New York State disciplines its doctors -- a process that resulted in the suspension of the license of a Lower East Side abortionist -- has long been criticized as slow, cumbersome and ineffective. B3.

NEW DIRECTIONS IN ALBANY
While its main purpose is to balance the state budget, the fiscal plan released this week by Governor Cuomo also plots new policy directions for the state in politically sensitive areas like Medicaid, insurance and corrections. B10.

While New Jersey awaits an answer to its request for $72 million in Federal funds to repair the damage left by an October storm that raked the shoreline, state officials are trying to find just $3.2 million to make emergency repairs before the next big storm. B6.

The dean of the University of Bridgeport School of Law was dismissed as the struggling university, nearly out of money, began fighting to block the law school's plans to separate and affiliate with another institution. But there were problems. The law dean refused to accept the letter of termination, and he refused to obey the president's order to leave. B6.

HEADLINE: More Changes Are in Store At City Hall

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Two top-level city officials have informed Mayor David N. Dinkins that they plan to leave their posts early next year as the administration approaches the midpoint of Mr. Dinkins's term, senior administration officials say.
The two are the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, and the Sanitation Commissioner, Steven M. Polan. 
 Mr. Polan, conceding that he was frustrated by budget cuts, announced yesterday that he plans to resign in January when the city's financial plan is completed. He said he will become general counsel to the Fischbach Corporation, an electrical engineering and construction company, which holds contracts with city agencies.
Mr. Polan said that he knew of no contracts that Fischbach had signed with the Sanitation Department and that, in accordance with city ethics rules, he would not represent the company in its business with the city.
 
Series of Departures
 Deputy Mayor Hernandez-Pinero, a 38-year-old lawyer, has told the Mayor that she would like to shift to a less taxing post in city government because she needs to spend more time with her young children, according to senior administration officials who asked to remain anonymous.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero would be the first Deputy Mayor to leave and would join a series of other Dinkins appointees who have departed this year. They include the city's Corporation Counsel, Victor A. Kovner; the press secretary, Albert Scardino; the labor relations commissioner, Eric J. Schmertz; the director of the Office on Homelessness and Single Room Occupancy, Nancy G. Wackstein; the Health Commissioner, Woodrew A. Myers, and J. Emilio Carrillo, the president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation.
Associates of the First Deputy Mayor, Norman Steisel, have said for some time that he is looking for work in the private sector, assertions that Mr. Steisel has shrugged off, saying that he has no plans to leave anytime soon.
 
Looking for Replacement
 If she departs, Ms. Hernandez-Pinero would leave as the administration's chief promoter of economic development even as the city struggles through one of the worst development crises in its history. After an initial period in which she was perceived by many in the business community to be weak and inexperienced, she gradually earned respect from many of those same critics.
Asked if Ms. Hernandez-Pinero had requested a different job, Mayor Dinkins said at a meeting with reporters yesterday: "When I am ready to make a personnel announcement involving Sally Hernandez-Pinero or any other official, I will let you know." She, too, said she had no plans to move.
Reports of her leaving the post first appeared in Newsday yesterday.
But Mr. Dinkins's aides said privately yesterday that the administration is looking for a replacement for the Deputy Mayor and is having serious discussions with New York business leaders.
 
A Sympathetic Ear
 Ms. Hernandez-Pinero's departure could raise an image problem for Mayor Dinkins because she is the only Hispanic member of the cabinet. Thus, some Dinkins aides said that she probably will not leave until Cesar Perales, New York State's Social Services Commissioner, assumes his role as the city's Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services early next year.
While many business leaders have expressed frustration with the administration's response to the city's economic problems, Ronald K. Shelp, president and chief executive of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, said that Ms. Hernandez-Pinero was viewed as a sympathetic ear in the administration and was credited with convincing Mayor Dinkins to limit tax increases in his latest financial plan.
Aides to Sanitation Commissioner Polan said yesterday that his resignation comes as little surprise given severe budget cutting at the Sanitation Department. Sanitation's budget dropped to $514 million in fiscal 1992 from $600 million in fiscal 1991, reducing recycling, street cleaning and dumping enforcement programs.
 
Frustrated by Budget Cuts
 Asked if budget cuts were a factor in his departure, Mr. Polan said yesterday: "I'm not going to pretend that budget cuts were not a source of frustration for this Administration and all the commissioners involved."
Environmental groups and the sanitation workers union praised Mr. Polan's work. John Ruston, an economic analyst for the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group, said: "Recycling was a priority for him, but it became clear that he received either overt hostility or indifference from City Hall on the key issues he needed to make it work."
Perhaps the most controversial issue that Mr. Polan has faced in office is whether the city should build huge garbage-burning incinerators to dispose of trash as its remaining landfills reach capacity. In a speech in September on how to resolve New York City's refuse problem, Mr. Polan said that he favored expanding recycling and building incinerators.
 
Joining Former Boss
 That position brought the wrath of some environmentalist groups like the New York Public Interest Research Group, which issued a statement yesterday saying that it welcomed Mr. Polan's resignation and that it hoped Mayor Dinkins would impose a moratorium on incinerator development.
At Fischbach, Mr. Polan, former general counsel of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, will join his former boss, Robert R. Kiley, who resigned as M.T.A. chairman last November to become Fischbach's president and chief executive.
Mr. Polan declined to say how much he would be paid at Fischbach, but he said that it is expected to be considerably more than his current salary of $110,000 a year. "Let's just say they made me an offer I could not refuse," Mr. Polan said in a meeting with reporters.
Dinkins administration officials said yesterday that a successor has yet to be found.

HEADLINE: U. of Bridgeport Dismisses Law Dean

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Nov. 27

 BODY:
The dean of the University of Bridgeport School of Law was dismissed today, as the struggling university, nearly out of money, began fighting to block the law school's plans to affiliate with another institution.
But the dean, Terence H. Benbow, refused to accept the letter of termination held out to him by President Edwin G. Eigel, who had come to Mr. Benbow's office to dismiss him. And he refused to obey Mr. Eigel's order to leave. 
 The university summoned Bridgeport police officers. A crowd of law students gathered outside Mr. Benbow's office window. And once again, as has happened so many times this fall, television news trucks began pulling up next to the hot dog stands at the center of campus.
 
Waiting for Lawyers
 Then everyone waited for lawyers for the university and Mr. Benbow to arrive.
The tumult came only a day after Mr. Eigel announced to hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students that the university would no longer offer degrees in their academic subjects after spring semester, ending their careers at Bridgeport.
The cutback eliminated liberal arts degrees at the university, leaving it with business, engineering, fashion, industrial design and law. But on Monday the faculty of the law school voted to take its 700 students to Quinnipiac College in Hamden, in a deal negotiated by Dean Benbow.
Today the chairman of the university's trustees, Colin Gunn, said the trustees had voted to dismiss Mr. Benbow, saying he had breached his fiduciary responsibility to the university by trying to sell its law school without its permission. The trustees, Mr. Gunn said, were furious.
That, however, confused the students and professors who gathered outside Mr. Benbow's office today to cheer him on, crowding around the overgrown yews under his window and packing the hallway leading into the dean's suite.
 
Seek a New Partner
 The trustees had passed resolutions authorizing the dean to seek a new partner for the law school, if that was necessary to insure its survival as the university thrashed about for a solution to its own deepening financial crisis.
"They told him to do something, he went and did it," said Craig McLean, a first-year law student from Washington, D.C. "They told him don't let the law school die, so he acted to save it.
"The guy's got commitment," Mr. McLean continued, "but his commitment is to the law school, not to the transient leadership this place has had."
Mr. Eigel, the university's provost, has served as interim president since the Nov. 11 resignation of Janet Greenwood, who had been president since 1987. He would not comment on his action today, except to say he had discharged the dean with the full support of the trustees.
Mr. Benbow has publicly been at odds with the administration since September, when he and the law school faculty loudly opposed a proposal by the Professors World Peace Academy, an institute financed by the Unification Church, to affiliate with the University of Bridgeport.
 
'Public Relations Disaster'
 Mr. Benbow said he had warned trustees that even entertaining the proposal would be a "public relations disaster," because the Unification Church's reputation was that of a "brainwasher of students." He subsequently called for Dr. Greenwood's resignation.
Mr. Benbow said Mr. Eigel, in his letter, accused him of insubordination and failure to follow his directives.
At the end of the day, lawyers for Mr. Benbow and the university had worked out a temporary arrangement: As a tenured member of the law faculty, he would have access to his office and law books, and on Monday the trustees would meet with him and the law faculty.
The law school is a relatively recent addition to the University of Bridgeport, existing as the independent Wethersfield School of Law until 1977. On Tuesday, the trustees of Quinnipiac College voted to accept the law school's proposal to affiliate, if the law school first regained its independence.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Hit the Suburbs, Touching Affluent Addresses

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., Nov. 27

 BODY:
This is a town of old money and new, bound together by country clubs, riding stables and costly water views in one of the wealthiest counties in the nation. But here in Greenwich, and in dozens of other towns across the metropolitan region, there are people who are having a hard time putting food on their tables.
They conceal it as best they can, as life in the suburbs often dictates. But left jobless by the recession, caught in the vise of their mortgages and with no more unemployment benefits available, thousands of men and women in the region who never sought assistance of any kind before are beginning to accept free turkeys, jars of peanut butter and boxes of spaghetti in an effort to make ends meet. 
 They are people like the woman from this town's tony back-country section, who showed up in tears earlier this week at the only food pantry in Greenwich. "She was obviously formerly affluent," said Betty Sheridan, a co-chairwoman of the program, called Neighbor to Neighbor, "and she hated to ask for help. But her husband had lost his job six months ago, and they were really in bad shape."
 
A Choice of Food or Clothing
 Directors of social-service agencies who oversee food programs in the New York area say they have experienced an increase in demand of at least 25 percent over last year. They are still feeding poor people who have long depended on them, but what is most remarkable, they say, is the appearance this year of large numbers of middle-class clients, who are finding themselves forced to choose between paying for housing or paying for food, and are further pressured by not wanting to admit that they are in financial trouble. These new clients range from clerical workers to company vice presidents and have have one thing in common: They have lost their jobs.
"We used to be able to just sweep it under the rug and say, it's those ne'er-do-wells on that end of town," said Audrey Triolo, director of the Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County, which collects and distributes food to various programs in Greenwich, Stamford, Norwalk, Darien and New Canaan. "But it's much more widespread now, and it's covering more people who used to be our donors.
"These are people who have paid their way all their lives and are now in difficult circumstances," she said. "They are not eligible for food stamps because they have a house or a car, and they're trying to hang on so they can hunt for work. They are at the end of their rope when they ask for free food."
 
'Helping Our Own'
 It is a shift that has devastating implications for the rest of society: People are being forced to redefine themselves as receivers rather than givers as their hope runs out. Instead of taking canned goods to church on Sundays for the anonymous lessfortunate, they are lining up for programs housed in churches in the middle of the week to collect bags of groceries to feed their own families.
"In this recession, we're really turning and helping our own congregants," said Rabbi Robert B. Lennick of the Greenwich Reform Synagogue. "In a community like Greenwich, people are less likely to admit that they are in trouble. It's in part a matter of appearances, and it's also a matter of pride."
As the demand mounts, corporations that once poured thousands of dollars into local programs are cutting back, if not leaving the area altogether to try to control their own costs. One Thanksgiving program in East Orange, N.J., had long counted on getting 150 turkeys from one corporation, the American International Adjustment Company. But the company moved away this year, "and now we have to scavenge for turkeys," said Connie Crawford, executive director of the East Orange Community Development Corporation.
In Manhattan, the Food and Hunger Hotline, founded in 1980, announced this week that it would be closing down because financing had dried up. Because of government cuts "we're all competing for the same private money," said Ellyn Rosenthal, the program's exective director. "We can't do it anymore," she said.
Cutbacks amid the recession have affected large donors and small ones. Many grocery chains that once gave their dented cans of food to charity now send them to reclamation centers, to recoup the cost of the can, Mrs. Triolo said.
"We're getting less donated to us, from half a million pounds of food last year to only 365,000 this year," she said. "When you've got hard economic times, that's also when the need in the community increases, so it's a serious mismatch."
Long Island Cares, a food bank based in West Brentwood, has already distributed twice as much food this year as last year. Its executive director, Catherine Bern, said: "Hunger's not supposed to happen in suburbia. But it certainly does."
Ms. Bern told of a mother who did not send her child to school one day recently, because she had nothing to give him for lunch, and of others who could not buy formula for their babies because their husbands had been laid off months ago.
Looking past the holiday season, several experts said they expected the situation to get worse. A recent study found that 67 percent of the people who use food pantries or soup kitchens in the Stamford area suffer from chronic hunger, with another 19 percent at potential risk for the same problem.
"It's just not working out for people," said Sheila Y. Oliver, director of the Essex County Division of Community Action in New Jersey. Utility companies, she said, "are already experiencing nonpayment of utility bills by customers who have good payment records. We're seeing people turn to us for that kind of help, middle-class and professional people in many instances, people we never saw here before. Many of the people who seek emergency assistance from us tell us they are one paycheck away from poverty."
This new clientele grew up thinking they were supposed to take care of the people below them, said social service administrators. Now many of them seem to feel that they need taking care of just as much.
"These are people who are not used to being on the receiving end, whose whole sense of who they are is that they are the people who make decisions, who do the giving, who help run the world," said Janet Evans, director of Person to Person, a community-service organization based at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Darien. "It's an enormous leap, psychologically."

HEADLINE: D'Amato Wins in Effort For Charities

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
As lawmakers struggled against exhaustion just before dawn this morning to piece together a bank bailout bill, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato asked colleagues for a small favor.
The New York Republican said he needed $6 million to help charitable groups that lost hundreds of thousands of dollars when two small New York City banks collapsed. It wasn't much, he said. And the recipients were worthy. A nursing home. The United Negro College Fund. 
 When the lawmakers had finally fashioned a compromise, Mr. D'Amato got his money. And while $6 million is a minuscule sum in a $95 billion piece of legislation, the decision to provide the money is fraught with symbolism. For most of that money would go to depositors of the Freedom National Bank of Harlem, a black-owned emblem of the economic struggles of America's pre-eminent black neighborhood.
The money writes what may well be the final chapter in a neighborhood dream of economic independence and the forces that combined to crush those aspirations. But the legislative maneuvering that won the $6 million, which includes $1 million for depositors at the Community National Bank of Staten Island, provides an unusual glimpse into the favor-trading and curious alliances forged by politicians running scared in the face of tough re-election campaigns and tough economic times.
 
Political Odd Couples
 The decision created such political odd couples as Senator D'Amato, a conservative Republican from Long Island, and Representative Charles B. Rangel, a liberal Democrat from Harlem. On most issues, one is the opposite of the other.
Other unlikely allies in the cause were Representative John J. LaFalce, an upstate New York Democrat who represents the district around Niagara Falls that sent Barry Goldwater's Presidential running mate, William Miller, to Washington; Representative Edolphus Towns, a Brooklyn Democrat and former teacher, social worker and hospital administrator, and Representative Charles E. Schumer, also a Brooklyn Democrat, and a Congressional powerhouse who could face a difficult election challenge because of redistricting.
But the $6 million amendment also shows Senator D'Amato's dedication to what supporters call constituent services and critics see as parochial pandering. Five years after he sought to win national recognition as a spokesman for conservative causes, and still bruised by a Senate ethics investigation that ended with no charges being filed, he is preparing for what certainly will be his toughest election campaign in a decade by returning to his roots as a local politician fighting before a national audience.
The strategy reaps headlines for the Senator. This week, for instance, his work in securing millions of dollars in increased Federal aid for mass transit, with New York as a prime beneficiary, was trumpeted around the state. At times it seemed to overshadow the accomplishments of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat widely seen as the mastermind of the transportation bill, which reverses 35 years of Federal transit priorities.
But as Mr. D'Amato prepares to declare his candidacy for a third term, his strength has also become his Achilles heel. The ethics investigation, in which he was accused of misusing his poffice on behalf of constituents, raised questions about whether constituent service sometimes crossed a line into cronyism or worse. And the New York fiscal crisis has led to fresh evaluations about his success in bringing home the Federal bacon. Critics say he must shoulder some of the blame for the fiasco since he was a key supporter of the Reagan Administration budget cuts, which cost the city billions and helped aggravate its problems.
The failure last year of the Freedom National Bank is in part an outgrowth of the policies the Senator supported, a cautionary tale of an incautious era. Most of the loans that bankrupted the bank were made between 1985 and 1987.
After years of growing loan defaults, Federal agents last fall strode into the bank, plastered the automatic teller machine with masking tape and padlocked Freedom's doors. It was an ignominious end for the bank that had been opened by Jackie Robinson and civil rights leaders who had been unable to obtain financing at white-run institutions.
 
Yearlong Political Battle
 The closing was also the opening of a yearlong political battle. When regulators marched into the 125th Street headquarters, charitable institutions lost all deposits in excess of $100,000.
The organizations pleaded with regulators and earlier this year were told they would be refunded 50 cents on each $1 in deposits over $100,000.
Senator D'Amato and Representative Rangel introduced legislation in the Senate and House to refund the money. The House bill stalled, while the Senate approved Mr. D'Amato's amendment as an addendum to a bill to provide $70 million for a nearly bankrupt Federal insurance fund.
The horse trading started at 5 P.M. Monday as legislators met in a conference committee. In the rush to adjourn for the year, House conferees offered their bill to their Senate counterparts. "The House came with a narrow bill," one staff member recalled. "We countered. They offered again. We countered again."
Progress was slow. Frustrated House Democrats began to consider adjourning and coming back to finish the banking bill and other items after Thanksgiving. But that unappetizing prospect paved the way for compromises. At 3:30 this morning, with conferees exhausted and their staffs collapsing, Senator D'Amato offered his amendment to the House.
"It was pretty touching," said Laura Unger, an aide to the Senator. "He made a really moving speech. It was compelling. These were charitable organizations. He said we have to protect people who have fallen through the safety net."
Representative Schumer supported the Senator, she said. So did Representative LaFalce. But Representative Doug Bereuter of Nebraska was opposed. He said some depositors in his district had lost money in a similar situation and had not been refunded. It was, he said, pork.
The debate lasted 10 minutes, or $600,000 a minute. The amendment was accepted by voice vote. By then conferees were so exhausted few can recall if the decision was unanimous.
This morning Senator D'Amato's office issued a press release trumpeting his success on behalf of the banks. But a clerical error almost cost him his victory. The staff forgot to include the amendment in the bill when it was retyped and brought to the floor.
The Senator had little trouble correcting the mistake in the Senate. But in the House, the process stalled, apparently because of rivalry among members seeking credit. But in its final decision before adjournment, the House also corrected the mistake.
"This was an emotional roller coaster, from ecstasy to agony to defeat and then, finally, gratefulness," an exhausted Senator D'Amato said.

HEADLINE: 4-State Commission Moves to Preserve the High Water Quality of the Upper Delaware River

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The upper 121 miles of the Delaware River, the playground of hundreds of thousands of canoeists, hikers, swimmers and anglers, runs clean and clear. Some call it pristine.
Not quite, the experts say, because man has intruded. Still, they quickly add, the upper Delaware's water quality ranks among the highest in the East. And that's the way they want to keep it. 
 The chore of maintaining the water quality has fallen to the Delaware River Basin Commission, a four-state agency created by Congress in 1961 to regulate water use and quality and flood control in a sprawling 13,000-square-mile region surrounding the river and Delaware Bay. Since 1987, the commission's staff and its member states -- New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware -- have thrashed their way toward tough new water-quality regulations, writing and rewriting terms and proposed policies and, in effect, trying to walk a high wire: maintaining first-rate water quality without choking off development in the basin.
 
Maintaining Quality
 The undertaking is rare for two reasons, the commission says. Few states have worked together to maintain the high quality of a common body of water. And, officials say, the effort is one of the first in the country to create a new anti-degradation policy pegged to existing high quality levels.
Usually, the officials said, if socioeconomic need is shown, high-quality rivers and lakes are allowed to degrade slowly until they reach the standards written to protect swimming and fishing. But the quality of the upper Delaware is 30 to 70 percent higher than the fishing and swimming standards, and the new regulations would prohibit any backsliding.
For instance, in the summer the upper Delaware's dissolved oxygen levels, vital to the health of fish and other aquatic life, average between 8 and 9 milligrams per liter of water. Officials want to retain that quality, though a level of 4 to 5 would be allowable under the Federal Clean Water Act.
A similar situation prevails for such other common pollutants as fecal coliform bacteria and phosphorous and nitrogen, two nutrients that come from treated effluent from sewage plants and storm runoff from farmland, streets, parking lots and building sites.
The new regulations would mean tighter restrictions on sewage treatment plants, possibly including more disposal of effluent on land, and finding ways to control "nonpoint" pollution, or storm runoff, which generally accounts for 65 percent of river pollution, officials said.
 
War of Words
 After four years of preliminary work, the commission hopes to conduct public hearings on the proposed regulations in January. Then the scholarly technical discussion in the commission's Water Quality Advisory Committee, which is helping draft the plan, will no doubt give way to a public war of words, with environmentalists demanding something tougher and developers seeking something weaker.
Each member state is represented on the advisory committee, along with the commission's technical experts and officials from the Federal Environmental Agency and the National Park Service, which has two parks in the area and owns much of the river bank and nearby land.
To the uninitiated, the committee's monthly debates at times seem arcane, filled with the jargon of science and engineering.
"There's a lot of semantical dancing on the head of a pin here," said Mary Ellen Noble, head of the Watershed Association of the Delaware River, an environmental group.
The association has been a major factor in the regulatory process. At first, the idea was to preserve water quality in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, which surrounds the southern third of the 121-mile stretch. Two years ago, the association asked that the commission add the river's northernmost 80 miles, ban new or increased discharges in the 121-mile area and create stricter controls on nonpoint pollution.
"That created pandemonium," Ms. Noble said. "None of the states could grapple with that."
The request for no new discharges led to a discussion on whether the new policy would require "nondegradation" -- no additional discharges -- or "anti-degradation" -- some new discharges from developments that are considered socially and economically justified.
The committee opted for an anti-degradation definition and an expanded monitoring system that it said would assure "no measurable change" in water quality. It also decided to extend quality rules to the mouths of tributaries. The one major unresolved issue -- curbing nonpoint pollution -- became a hot potato at today's meeting. Pennsylvania's delegate, Ed Brezina, called for tougher regulations for nonpoint pollution.
"That's a wrinkle that has to be smoothed out," said New York's representative, Al Bromberg.
The head of the commission's planning branch, David Pollison, suggested that the states take the lead on a policy to curb pollution from runoff. "We don't have one," Mr. Pollison said. "You go ahead. We'll define one and delegate it to you."
In the end, the issue was put over until December's meeting.
Curbing nonpoint pollution is a problem, officials said after the meeting. "Everybody's grappling for a solution," said Richard Albert, the commission's supervising engineer. "Nonpoint sources are tricky because the state of the art is not as advanced as waste-water treatment. And you get to some extent into land-use control, and land use is seriously guarded by local government."

HEADLINE: PARKCHESTER JOURNAL;
Risk Lures Teen-Agers To 'Surf' on the Subways

 BODY:
WEARING a purple baseball cap and a cocky smile, Elliott Ortiz stood between two cars on the No. 6 train as it rumbled over tracks 30 feet above the Parkchester section of the Bronx. He paused for a second, waiting for the wiggling 400-ton train to pick up speed. Then he hoisted himself to the roof and disappeared.
In less than a minute -- enough time, he said, for a windblown handstand -- he dropped down again, this time, one car closer to the train's front. Three passengers jolted to their feet in surprise, but he looked as nonchalant as if he had done nothing more unusual than offer up his seat. 
 At 22 years old, Mr. Ortiz is an old-timer at the dangerous stunt that he and other young people perform on the roofs of trains across the city, particularly along the elevated tracks in the Bronx.
It is called "surfing," or "hang on," and the transit authorities say it is the most perilous of the many games that threaten and occasionally kill young people, mostly teen-agers, on New York City's subways.
The risk is the lure. Mr. Ortiz, who is unemployed , said the danger was a test of himself and his place in his tough neighborhood, Clason's Point in the Bronx.
"I've got to learn not to be afraid of nothing; rats, cockroaches, a gang from one block to the other," he said. "It's like those people that do movies, they do it. It's like you are escaping from hell."
The stunt, like its cousin elevator surfing, is nothing new, but transit officials say it recently appears to be more popular. There are no numbers to back that up, though.
"Like anything else, things get trendy, unfortunately," said Bob Previdi, a Transit Authority spokesman. "This is certainly a dangerous thing to be trying."
Especially on a elevated line, said Al O'Leary, a spokesman for the transit police. "It's so incredibly dangerous it boggles the mind," he said.
Over the last decade, two deaths have been attributed to subway surfing. In 1980, a young man riding atop a J train was killed after he hit a girder on the Williamsburg Bridge. And in 1989, a 14-year-old riding on a train in the South Bronx was struck in the head by a beam.
Subway conductors, drivers, police officers and rescue workers say that just the sight of a teen-ager lying atop a speeding train -- in some cases standing, as if riding a surf board -- is horrifying.
"It's the kids, they pick dangerous ways to have fun," said one frustrated conductor.
More than a dozen teen-agers in northern Manhattan and the Bronx said in recent interviews that they had either seen someone ride on the top of subway cars or knew friends who did. They said people did it, occasionally even in tunnels, for thrills or to show their bravery.
"They get bored on the regular cars so they climb on top," said Julio Diaz, a 15-year-old student at Walton High School in the Bronx. "They do it just to show off. It don't make no sense. What if you fall?"
Joseph Araujo, a 17-year-old senior at Harry S. Truman High School in the Bronx, said that he and a few friends used to surf nearly every day two years ago, either on the No. 2 or No. 5 lines in the Bronx, or on the No. 1 train between Dyckman Street in Manhattan and 225th Street in the Bronx.
"It's mostly like a dare to see who is who, what you can do," he said. "Some people just do it to see how far they can go -- how close they can get to death without really dying."
He compared surfing to proving yourself on the street, where being tough and fearless is often more important than safety.
"Sometimes it's scary but after a while it just seems funny," he said. "That's what the street is all about."
Mr. Ortiz, who was surfing at the St. Lawrence stop in the Bronx, said he did it about four times a week, often with a group of four other youths, none older than 14, who call themselves "The Train Brothers." Aside from handstands, he said, he jumps from car to car and has even done forward flips.
The question of why he does it brings a tangle of answers. Raised in Minneapolis, he said that he always wanted to be a professional speed skater but that his family could not afford the training.
So he now wants to be a professional stunt man, he said, and he surfs from the Bronx to Rockaway with the hope he will become famous like his hero Chuck Norris.
Mr. Ortiz, who said he usually sneaks into the subway, has no plans to stop surfing unless he gets hurt or meets a woman who wants to marry him and begs him "to cut it out."
But Mr. Araujo stopped, and for a reason he does not like to talk about: The 14-year-old killed surfing in the Bronx two years ago was his friend.
"It was scary," he said. "If you've never done it, I'd advise you not to because you are going to get hurt."

HEADLINE: Remembering the Neediest in a Difficult Time

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
Last year at this time Alberto R.'s biggest worry was Christmas presents. Then he lost his job. Then came a winter without new coats for his wife and three children, macaroni in place of meat, months of a futile search for work and then -- inevitably, it seemed -- an eviction notice.
At his lowest moment he silently pleaded, "All I want is a hand to bring me up." He was desperate enough to try anything, the 44-year-old Manhattan resident recalled last week. "Anything to keep my home, anything to stay off welfare." 
 As the recession in the New York region drags on and deepens, tens of thousands of working-class families have found themselves on the brink of poverty.
For Alberto R. and many others, economic security vanished as suddenly as a pink slip. Others had been waging a paycheck-to-paycheck battle for survival that ended in an unexpected illness or the limit of a landlord's patience.
For officials at the charities they are turning to in record numbers, this flood of what one official calls "the new poor" comes on top of the vast problems of the chronically needy, and at a time when, they say, many New Yorkers have either become inured to the suffering around them or are too pinched themselves to give.
"People feel more vulnerable, more apprehensive, -- let's face it, more frightened -- than at any time I can remember," said Philip Coltolf, executive director of the Children's Aid Society. "It's as bad as it's been and the bottom isn't in sight yet.
"If it's a recession when someone you know loses a job and a depression when you lose your job," he said, "then for many New Yorkers, this is a depression."
 
Signs of the Times
 These are among the new signs of hard times reported by the seven charities affiliated with The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which begins its 80th appeal on Sunday:
*Requests to the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York for emergency rent relief are 10 times last year's, up to 1,000 a week this year.
*Requests for food packages at Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service's main office are running at triple the level of last year.
*The demand for clothing, especially jackets and ties for job interviews, has risen so greatly much at the Harlem Men's Shelter that volunteers from the Community Service Society of New York have called on manufacturers to supplement individual donations.
*Counseling provided by Catholic Charities in the Brooklyn Archdiocese is up by 50 percent from last year, primarily for problems related to the loss of jobs. The problems range from substance abuse to depression.
 
'Staring at Homelessness'
 Rescue for Alberto R. began with a call by his wife to the Community Service Society of New York. The society helped him obtain a one-shot rent relief check from a city bureaucracy that had previously turned him away and gave him $508 for food and clothing from its own funds.
"Me and my family were staring at homelessness," said Alberto R. last week on a break from his new job as an electronics-store salesman. "But their help pulled me through, let me keep my dignity until I found a job. Christmas is going to be happy again in my home."
Until August, Pegeen Nieves had a full-time job -- but a razor-thin margin of safety. "After I paid my rent and utilities and fed my three kids, I had $67 left over every month," she recalled.
Then the 26-year-old single mother had to take a leave of absence because of a difficult pregnancy. With no savings and no family to lean on, she wondered how she would support her family as she lay on the pull-out bed in her two-room Brooklyn apartment.
She miscarried in September.
"The doctor let me go back to work part time," she said, "but I was only taking home $800 a month, but the rent was $550 and the baby sitter was $720."
October brought an eviction notice from her landlord and a shut-off notice from Brooklyn Union Gas. It also brought assistance from Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Brooklyn. "The day I called they gave me food and two weeks later $150 to pay my gas and electric," she said. "They gave me some breathing room so I could get money to pay my rent when I started working full-time again in November. If it hadn't been for them I don't know where I'd be."
 
'The New Poor'
 Stephen D. Solender, executive vice president of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, calls people like Ms. Nieves and Alberto R. "the new poor." They are, he said, "casualties of the recession who need assistance for the first time in their life."
The struggle to avoid the abyss of poverty involves stark choices for families. "Adequate clothing is the first thing they do without, not getting the children the winter coat they need or wearing the shoes with thin soles another winter," said David Jones, executive director of the Community Service Society of New York.
For the charities serving them, the added pressures of the recession are forcing another kind of triage. The agencies were already pressed as city and state funds for foster care, job training, work with AIDS, drug abuse and teen-age pregnancy were shrinking.
Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese, for instance, has been dipping into its reserves for the last five years to subsidize its programs. But faced with a $2.9 million deficit, the organization has been forced to close three of its centers and to stop its homemaker programs, which had helped young mothers and newly housed homeless people learn how to take care of their homes and their families.
 
'A Vital Lifeline'
 Msgr. Timothy McDonnell, the chief operating officer of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese, said the many strains that his agency is under place a greater emphasis on the need for individual donations like those made to the Neediest Cases.
"At a time when more people are falling into need and less public resources are available, revenue sources like The New York Times Neediest Cases becomes even more of a vital lifeline," he said.
Last year the fund raised a record total of $4,439,093.47. Although the average size of the donations was smaller than in the previous year, more people gave -- at least 15,580 individuals and organizations. The New York Times pays for the campaign's overhead, giving the contributions directly to the seven not-for-profit agencies, which use the money for direct services.
Mr. Solender of the Jewish Federation said the charities recognize that many potential contributors may be feeling vulnerable themselves this year. Others may feel that no help can revive a city that seems sicker each day, but he said that is not the case.
"We are rescuing people each day!" he said. "It's crucial now that we provide the resources to people on the front lines who are helping them become self-sufficient while we still have that chance."
 
Persian Gulf Veteran
 And there is Louis Garcia, 33, a veteran of the Persian Gulf war who entered the Catholic Charities' Bronx office earlier this month. He lost his family, job and home while defending his country.
He returned from Army Reserve service in the gulf region on Sept. 20 and was discharged from active duty, but the security company where he had worked was out of business. His wife, who abuses drugs and alcohol, had been evicted from their apartment for nonpayment of rent and handed over care of their 4-year-old daughter to his mother. He had no savings and was told that he would to have to wait 30 days before he could apply for unemployment benefits.
He began sleeping on the floor of his mother's one-room apartment, but the landlord told him he would evict the family if he did not leave. He slept two nights on the streets before, wheezing and coughing, he turned to the Catholic Charities.
Corrine Malavase, a social service assistant in the Belmont Avenue office, helped him find an apartment and on Nov. 21 provided him with $500 for the first month's rent and $60 more for food.
"He now has pneumonia," she said. "We expect he will need more help and when he does, we'll be there for him."

HEADLINE: Fearful Consumers Cut Back Plans for Gifts

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
To save money, Rocky Nelson of Lincoln, Neb., plans to make most of her Christmas presents by hand this year, and she is giving each of her two married children a certificate redeemable for a night of free baby-sitting.
"It used to be 1,001 presents under the tree," she said. "This year, Christmas is going to be a little skimpy present-wise." 
 The sputtering economy has forced Mrs. Nelson, like many Americans, to curtail her Christmas spending plans this year. "I'm a big Christmas person, but I really have to learn to hold it down because I can't afford to spend what I have in the past," she said.
Although Mrs. Nelson and her husband both have jobs, they lost their home last year, after a real estate investment went bad and they filed for bankruptcy. "We're starting over," she said. "It's kind of scary."
Mrs. Nelson was first interviewed for a New York Times/CBS News poll, and she answered additional questions in a second interview.
With the vitally important Christmas shopping season starting today, frightened consumers are creating anxiety among retailers.
A number of recent consumer surveys have shown that consumers plan to spend less for presents this year than they did last year. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that 46 percent of the people surveyed planned to spend less on gifts this holiday season than in recent years. Only 12 percent of the people surveyed said they planned to spend more this year. The poll found a strong preference for buying clothing and educational gifts for children instead of toys and video games.
The nationwide telephone poll of 1,106 adults was conducted from Nov. 18 to Nov. 22, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The Conference Board, a business research group, is releasing its own survey results today that found that the average American household is expected to spend about $375 for gifts this year. The Conference Board said Christmas sales were likely to be down by as much as 3 percent this year.
In contrast, many retailers and retailing industry analysts are predicting that Christmas sales will increase about 4 percent this year. But Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center, called such projections "a fantasy."
Mr. Linden estimated that holiday spending would total $36 billion this year.
Other surveys had a similar grim message for retailers. Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a Chicago market research firm, said 53 percent of consumers recently polled planned to spend less this Christmas than last.
 
Damage of Unemployment
 Analysts say concerns over job security are putting a damper on consumer spending. Mr. Linden said nearly 20 percent of the nation's households had at least one family member who was unemployed in the last 12 months. "When you are out of work, you are damaged financially and psychologically for quite a while," he said.
For instance, Toni Nobles, a 34-year-old single mother of two in Bakersfield, Calif., has been unemployed for a year. "I'm not as optimistic as I once was," she said. Unable to find a job as a telephone operator, she is now on welfare. She said she would buy a few Christmas presents for her children this year. "They want specific things," she said, including Ninja Turtles figures and toy guns and trucks. She was first reached for The Times/CBS poll and answered additional questions in a second interview.
Many consumers simply have less money or higher expenses. "It's not just that people have a preference for spending less on Christmas," said Philip Johnson, president of Leo J. Shapiro. "They have to spend less because they are feeling really pinched."
"People are feeling economic pressure," he added. "That's why this thing won't go away."
Another damper, in addition to the bad economy, is that the Christmas selling season has six fewer days this year than last. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, there are 26 shopping days, this year, down from 32 last year.
Still, not all consumers are saving string. Colette Knowles, a 25-year-old engineer in Racine, Wis., said she and her husband recently bought a new house and were busy furnishing it. "We are in a spending mood," she said.
She recently got a raise and said the couple planned to replace one of their two cars next year. They recently bought a stereo system, a dining room set and draperies. Like the others, Mrs. Knowles was first interviewed for the poll and answered additional questions in a second interview.
But all is not rosy for the couple. She said her husband could not find a job matching his qualifications, and has been working the night shift at a factory repairing machinery. It took him six months to find the job.
Even people like the seemingly free-spending Knowles will not provide that much solace to retailers. Mrs. Knowles said she and her husband were going out of their way to look for bargains. "We're buying a lot of stuff, but we are looking for a deal," she said. "We don't buy anything that's not on sale."
