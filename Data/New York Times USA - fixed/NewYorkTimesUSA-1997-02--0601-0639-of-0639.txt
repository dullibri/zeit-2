HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Senate Testimony by Greenspan

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from testimony by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, given before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday: 
 Looking ahead, the members of the F.O.M.C. [Federal Open Market Committee] expect inflation to remain low and the economy to grow appreciably further. However, as I shall be discussing, the unusually good inflation performance of recent years seems to owe in large part to some temporary factors, of uncertain longevity. Thus, the F.O.M.C. continues to see the distribution of inflation risks skewed to the upside and must remain especially alert to the possible emergence of imbalances in financial and product markets that ultimately could endanger the maintenance of the low-inflation environment. Sustainable economic expansion for 1997 and beyond depends on it. . . .
The willingness of workers in recent years to trade off smaller increases in wages for greater job security seems to be reasonably well documented. The unanswered question is why this insecurity persisted even as the labor market, by all objective measures, tightened considerably. . . .
 Certainly, other factors have contributed to the softness in compensation growth in the past few years. The sharp deceleration in health care costs, of course, is cited frequently. Another is the heightened pressure on firms and their workers in industries that compete internationally. Domestic deregulation has had similar effects on the intensity of competitive forces in some industries. In any event, although I do not doubt that all these factors are relevant, I would be surprised if they were nearly as important as job insecurity. . . .
The F.O.M.C. has recognized the need to remain vigilant for signs of potentially inflationary imbalances that might, if not corrected promptly, undermine our economic expansion. The F.O.M.C., in fact, has signaled a state of heightened alert for possible policy tightening since last July in its policy directives. But we have also taken care not to act prematurely. The F.O.M.C. refrained from changing policy last summer, despite expectations of a near-term policy firming by many financial market participants. In light of the developments I've just discussed affecting wages and prices, we thought inflation might well remain damped, and in any case was unlikely to pick up very rapidly, in part because the economic expansion appeared likely to slow to a more sustainable pace. In the event, inflation has remained quiescent since then.
Given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, however, we cannot rule out a situation in which a pre-emptive policy tightening may become appropriate before any sign of actual higher inflation becomes evident. If the F.O.M.C. were to implement such an action, it would be judging that the risks to the economic expansion of waiting longer had increased unduly and had begun to outweigh the advantages of waiting for uncertainties to be reduced by the accumulation of more information about economic trends. . . .
Clearly, when people are exposed to long periods of relative economic tranquillity, they seem inevitably prone to complacency about the future. This is understandable. We have had 15 years of economic expansion interrupted by only one recession -- and that was six years ago. As the memory of such past events fades, it naturally seems ever less sensible to keep up one's guard against an adverse event in the future. Thus, it should come as no surprise that, after such a long period of balanced expansion, risk premiums for advancing funds to businesses in virtually all financial markets have declined to near-record lows.
Is it possible that there is something fundamentally new about this current period that would warrant such complacency? Yes, it is possible. Markets may have become more efficient, competition is more global, and information technology has doubtless enhanced the stability of business operations. But, regrettably, history is strewn with visions of such "new eras" that, in the end, have proven to be a mirage. In short, history counsels caution.
Such caution seems especially warranted with regard to the sharp rise in equity prices during the past two years. These gains have obviously raised questions of sustainability. . . .
Why should the central bank be concerned about the possibility that financial markets may be overestimating returns or mispricing risk? It is not that we have a firm view that equity prices are necessarily excessive right now or risk spreads patently too low. Our goal is to contribute as best we can to the highest possible growth of income and wealth over time, and we would be pleased if the favorable economic environment projected in markets actually comes to pass. Rather, the F.O.M.C. has to be sensitive to indications of even slowly building imbalances, whatever their source, that, by fostering the emergence of inflation pressures, would ultimately threaten healthy economic expansion.

HEADLINE: Job Insecurity of Workers Is a Big Factor in Fed Policy

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
For months now, the Federal Reserve has been poised to raise interest rates, but has held off. Why?
The answer lies mainly in what the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, describes as a powerful recent force in the American economy: job insecurity. In his testimony to Congress yesterday, he clearly elevated this insecurity to major status in central bank policy. Workers have been too worried about keeping their jobs to push for higher wages, he said, and this has been sufficient to hold down inflation without the added restraint of higher interest rates. 
 For more than a year now, Mr. Greenspan has been gradually building his case that downsizing and job insecurity have altered the normal workings of the American economy, and yesterday he spelled out this view more pointedly and in more detail than before. Other factors have contributed to "the softness in compensation growth" despite a low unemployment rate, he said, but "I would be surprised if they were nearly as important as job insecurity."
Job insecurity, in Mr. Greenspan's hands, is a rather complex monetary indicator. That workers are fearful of losing their jobs is not in itself a sufficient explanation for their failure to push for significant wage increases. The sense of job insecurity has to be rising; that is, getting worse. Once it levels off, and workers become accustomed to their new level of uncertainty, their confidence may revive and the upward pressure on wages resume. That is particularly true when the unemployment rate is quite low, as it is today, suggesting labor shortages that will foster greater competition for skilled workers. Inflation eventually rises as employers raise prices to pay for the higher labor costs.
Job insecurity is notoriously difficult to measure and a lot of people think Mr. Greenspan may be tilting at windmills. Some labor economists, like Henry Farber at Princeton University, say, "There is no direct evidence that job insecurity is higher than it was." Many traders in the bond market, who always seem braced for the next outburst of inflation, are impatient with the Fed's focus on job insecurity. "The whole concept has never sat well with Wall Street," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston. "It just seemed like a rationalization to explain why wages had not yet accelerated in response to full employment."
Others are convinced that American workers, whatever their past fears, have now moved beyond them. Referring to small recent increases in one or two wage measures, Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, insisted that American workers were already "giving off a classic signal" of wage inflation. "To the extent the Fed remains in denial on this point," he wrote in a newsletter mailed to clients this week, "the greater the ultimate risks to inflation and interest rates."
The Fed, however, persists in trying to measure job insecurity as a major, if "transitional," factor in the inflation process. The half-dozen or so polls and bits of information that Mr. Greenspan and some other Fed policy makers describe as indicators of job insecurity rose until recently, and now might be leveling off. Mr. Greenspan acknowledged this possibility yesterday, by saying that the transitional period "may be drawing to a close."
Even if it is, wages might not begin to rise immediately, says Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor. Once workers find themselves feeling no more insecure about their jobs from month to month, they might then need time to grow accustomed to the new, higher level of insecurity, taking weeks, perhaps, to feel sufficiently confident to push for wage increases again.
"We don't know whether job insecurity is still rising or not," Mr. Meyer said yesterday, "and if it no longer is, we don't know whether the effects of the earlier rise are still playing out."
Although he has never said so, Mr. Greenspan may be attempting to use job insecurity to recalculate the flash point at which wage pressures tend to kick in. Until 1995, most economists -- and Fed policy makers -- thought that when the unemployment rate fell below 6 percent, labor shortages would start to embolden workers to press for higher wages, and higher wages would lead in turn to rising prices and higher inflation. But the unemployment rate fell below 6 percent in late 1994 and below 5.5 percent early last year, and nothing happened to wages or inflation in either case -- encouraging Mr. Greenspan and others at the Fed to offer job insecurity as the principal explanation.
The unemployment rate, now 5.4 percent, has ranged between 5.2 and 5.4 percent over the last seven months, with little rise in wages.
Mr. Greenspan, in speeches and Congressional testimony, has emerged as the point man at the Federal Reserve in building the job insecurity thesis. Some other policy makers -- Mr. Meyer, for example, and Robert T. Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco -- have publicly echoed his views. One or two others have described themselves as agnostics. None of the Fed's governors or the presidents of its regional banks -- the group that meets every six weeks or so to rule on interest rates -- have publicly opposed the Greenspan concept, however doubtful some may be.
In trying to measure job insecurity, the indicators Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials refer to most often are public opinion polls; the decline in union strike activity; job security provisions in new labor union contracts; Labor Department data showing that downsizing had not eased off through 1995, despite five years of economic expansion, and the reluctance of workers, reflected in Labor Department data, to risk quitting their jobs.
"Some people have offered changing technology as a reason for job insecurity, the story being that a lot of workers have not kept up with the new skills required by the new technology," said Rob Valletta, an economist at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. "And there may be an erosion of trust between workers and firms."
Mr. Greenspan, who subscribes to the technology argument, cited in his testimony yesterday a survey of workers at large corporations carried out by a polling company, International Survey Research Corporation in Chicago. The survey, like others, shows a sharp rise in the level of job insecurity starting in 1990, and a leveling off evident last year.
The company's polling included the employees of more than 400 big corporations in the United States that hired International Survey to measure employee attitudes. International Survey then weighted and adjusted the figures in an attempt to make them representative of national feelings. Between 1979 and 1990, no more than 24 percent of those polled ever answered yes to the question "I am frequently concerned about being laid off." Then in the 1990's, the number shot up, hitting 46 percent in 1995 and 1996.
"If this leveling off continues for all of 1997," said John R. Stanek, president of International Survey, "then I am going to begin to take seriously" that job insecurity "has plateaued, but at a level much higher than in the 1980's."

GRAPHIC: Graph: "Layoff Worries" tracks the percent of workers who agree with the statement: "I am frequently concerned about being laid off." The findings were based on a survey of workers at 444 large companies that are clients of International Survey Research. Figures are tracked from 1986 through 1996.

HEADLINE: Journalists Prepare to Take On Serb President

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Olja Beckovic, one of Serbia's brightest journalists, was back at work today after a forced interlude, drawing up a list of guests for the comeback of her popular television program and thinking again about the sharp questions she would put to fractious politicians.
"I was told my program must be on this Sunday, but I don't know how it's possible because I haven't worked for four years," said an ebullient Ms. Beckovic, as she carried her 3-year-old son, Luk, into the offices of Studio B, Belgrade's city-owned television station, to plan the return of "Opinions of the Week." 
 With the installation of opposition forces in Belgrade's municipal Government last week, the city's once-independent television station, neutered four years ago by President Slobodan Milosevic, has returned to the control of reporters and editors.
They were wasting little time. The former editor in chief, Lila Ragdonovic, who walked out to protest Mr. Milosevic's merging of the station into his propaganda machine, was back at her desk on Monday. Zoran Ostojic, another top editor, was flying back from Chicago, where he drove cabs.
But the euphoria at reclaiming the capital's television station was tempered by the knowledge that Mr. Milosevic, whose network refused to cover the weeks of street demonstrations against him, remained master of the only nationwide television and radio network.
"It is as though they have guns and we have water pistols," said Milorad Ragdonovic, a former editor at Studio B. However poorly armed they might be, the journalists at the reborn station say they will try to wage a guerrilla war against the state-run news media.
Opposition forces have warned Mr. Milosevic that unless his network, Radio Televizija Srbije, gives the opposition a voice, the street demonstrations suspended 11 days ago will resume on March 9. The protests compelled Mr. Milosevic to recognize the municipal election results he annulled last November.
In a stiff letter delivered to Mr. Milosevic last week, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said Washington wanted to see objective reporting on the Government-run television in Serbia.
Washington and the Serbian opposition singled out the issue of television coverage because, along with the secret police, broadcast news programs, spouting incessant support of Serbian war aims and disinformation about political opponents, are considered to be a central pillar of Mr. Milosevic's power.
"The story of the tightly controlled state propaganda outlet is in many ways the story of Milosevic," said Dragan Cicic, a Nieman Fellow at Harvard, who is writing a book tracing Mr. Milosevic's ascent through the use of television.
Unlike almost everything else in the broken Serbian economy, state television remains flush with money, largely because the Government sees that television fees are incorporated into every household's electricity bill. The director of the state radio and television is traditionally a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Party, and is more powerful than a Serbian Prime Minister, Mr. Cicic said.
Apparently in an effort to appease the West, Mr. Milosevic recently appointed as the new Minister of Information Radmila Milentijevic, a Serb who is a professor of history at the City University of New York. A vocal supporter of Mr. Milosevic during the war in Bosnia -- and of the Bosnian Serbs -- Mrs. Milentijevic said in interviews in the United States this week that she is preparing a new media law.
But Mrs. Milentijevic's statements, including her declaration that significant freedom of the press already existed in Serbia, were treated warily here.
She has made a point of saying that those involved in the preparation of the new law will be "registered" radio and television stations and newspapers. Many of the provincial television stations in cities where the opposition has won political control were not granted licenses for news when they were under the control of the Socialist Party authorities and Mr. Milosevic.
The founder of the biggest private television station in Serbia, Bogoljub Karic, until recently one of Mr. Milosevic's most intimate confidants, said he expected problems with his broadcast license. After years of keeping the television news loyal to Mr. Milosevic, Mr. Karic, who also heads the largest private bank, insurance and mobile telephone company in Serbia, directed his news program to show the street protests against the President.
Further, Mr. Karic has indicated that he is considering running for the Serbian presidency against Mr. Milosevic, saying of Mr. Milosevic that "two terms are enough for anyone." For expressing such ambitions, Mr. Milosevic may decide to threaten Mr. Karic's television station, which is vulnerable, according to a Karic associate, because it has a license to cover economic issues and entertainment but not news.
In Kragujevac, an industrialized and increasingly restive city of 200,000 where the opposition has taken control, the new manager of the city-owned radio and television stations, Vidosav Stevanovic, was both bouyant and worried on Monday as he scurried around for money and fought off attacks from the Socialist Party.
The station is a skimpy affair: its total equipment consists of two cameras and one editing deck. "We are the first radio and television station to pull itself out of the iron hug of the regime," said a smiling Mr. Stevanovic after 19 days on the job. "But the regime in Belgrade will come up with many problems for us. I expect they will give us trouble on our license." Already, he said, the local Government-controlled radio had broadcast a false report saying he had dismissed scores of employees.
Mr. Stevanovic, 55, a distinguished novelist who has lived in France since 1993, said that to try and insulate itself against Mr. Milosevic -- and to be a model of fairness -- the station would invite Mrs. Milentijevic to appear on the new nightly call-in television program.
So far, Socialists have refused invitations to appear on camera, he said.
But among the reporters, editors and technicians, all of whom were inherited from the previous management and retained, there appeared to be considerable enthusiasm. Never before, they said, had their viewers had the chance to see foreign news broadcast from the BBC or the Voice of America.
But most importantly, reporters said, they could now cover what was going on in town. The lead item on Monday was a teachers' strike.
A reporter, Goran Milenkovic, said that he and a television crew would go to the mass demonstrations, but only twice were the demonstrations shown on the news. "In those cases I threw the report I had prepared in the wastebasket when I came back to the office," he said. "The editor--in-chief would prepare a 'commentary.' Now we just report."
The most popular new program appears to be a nightly call-in show. So far, guests in the studio have included union leaders from the local auto plant, professors from the university and members of various political parties. And, as part of telling what has really gone on in Serbia in the past, the station broadcast a tape of the head of the National Bank, Dragoslav Avramovic, addressing Parliament last year. He was forced out of his job at the bank after telling Parliament that he would not obey orders from Mr. Milosevic to print money.
Viewers were so hungry for information and so stunned by Mr. Avramovic's emotional address, that there were calls for a replay.

HEADLINE: New Report Dulls Shine Of Economy In New York

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Despite indicators of a renaissance in New York City, from a falling crime rate to a surging payout of bonuses on Wall Street and a rising tide of tourists, the city's overall economic performance lagged far behind the rest of the nation in 1996, a city report said yesterday.
Perhaps even more revealing, given the recent optimistic assertions from City Hall, is that New York was overshadowed by most of its peers: the nation's other major metropolitan areas. In three key measures of economic health -- unemployment, job growth and the local rate of inflation -- New York was among the nation's weakest urban economies, according to the study issued by the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi. 
 Of the nation's 20 largest urban centers, the study said, New York had the highest unemployment rate for the year, 8.6 percent, and was outpaced by all but five cities in the percentage growth of new jobs, which was up only seventh-tenths of 1 percent. Its inflation rate for the year, 2.95 percent, was surpassed by only two cities, Miami and St. Louis.
But the report -- the first major full-year economic assessment of 1996 -- also shows an economy that was deeply divided. Some economic sectors and residents were richly blessed -- especially in banking and the securities industry -- while many others were left behind. Personal income grew 13.9 percent -- more than double the national rate -- mostly because of Wall Street. Other areas that have historically employed low- and middle-income New Yorkers, especially manufacturing, government and health care, contracted.
"There is a disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street," Mr. Hevesi said. "While the experts and the specialists in the city are flourishing, unemployment remains the highest of any large city." He said that although there are still many signs of continuing improvement in the city's fortunes, the slow rate of job growth and the uneven distribution of economic rewards remain ominous portents for long-term health. "We have structural problems," he said. "It means that if you complete college and have computer skills, you will get a job; if you don't, you won't."
New York's Deputy Mayor for Operations, Randy M. Mastro, said he believed the main message of the report was that New York continued to grow and rebuild from what he called the "catastrophic job losses" of the late 1980's and early 1990's, and that the overall economic direction for the city remained positive.
"There is no question that the New York City economy is better off today than it was four years ago, and the Comptroller agrees with that," Mr. Mastro said. "I'd say this economy has turned around."
Mr. Hevesi said that the city did clearly benefit in 1996 from the effect of a record year in the stock market, as bonuses and salaries soared. In a two-month period in October and November, for instance, retail sales in the city were increasing at 10 times the comparable rate for the same period in 1995.
But just as clear, he said, was that the increases in income, and the resulting effects on things like retail purchases, were not enough to raise overall performance. The gross city product, for example, a measure based on total jobs and income that is similar to the national gross domestic product, still lagged in the nation, rising only 1.9 percent for the year compared with a national growth rate of 2.5 percent. The reason was that while income was up, job growth was weak.
Other economists said the numbers were more upbeat than they might appear. Eugene Spruck, the acting chief economist at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that no one should expect the mature economies of the Northeast to outpace Atlanta or Las Vegas because the population in places like New York is simply growing too slowly to make that possible, whatever the condition of the city's industries and employers.
The other key fact, he said, is that not all jobs are created equal. New York, even in creating fewer jobs, creates jobs with greater economic impact because of their generally higher salaries. An important reflection of that underlying strength, Mr. Spruck said, was that for the year, the city created a majority of the new private-sector jobs in the 17-county region of New York and New Jersey tracked by the Port Authority.
Mr. Hevesi's report concludes however, that most of that growth was in the first six months of 1996, and that since July the economy slowed dramatically. In the first six months of 1996, the city created a net 24,400 jobs, as industries like retail and wholesale trade, transportation and utilities and construction all increased their payrolls. But since June 30, the net gain has been only 2,200 jobs.
Those same three sectors -- trade, transportation and utilities -- all cut jobs in the second half, along with local government, which eliminated more than 5,000 jobs in the third quarter alone.
The final month of the year also offered a particularly turbulent picture. Though month-to-month figures fluctuate and are not considered trends, preliminary numbers for December suggest that 1996 ended on an off-note for the city's economy, perhaps in part because of a weak Christmas retailing season. Total employment fell from November to December for only the second time in five years, the other being 1994.
Retailers reduced employment by 1,900 jobs in December compared with their November totals. The sector of finance, insurance and real estate cut 1,000 jobs, the report said.
And even Wall Street was not immune. The securities industry cut 500 jobs, the only month in 1996 in which it reduced employment needs.

HEADLINE: Robert Kenneth Straus, 91, Heir Who Served in Agencies

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Robert Kenneth Straus, a member of one of New York's leading merchant families who turned instead to government service, publishing and, most recently, founded a center for the support of analytical thought in decision-making, died on Monday at St. Francis Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. A former resident of New York and San Francisco, he was 91 and lived in Santa Barbara.
While he was in California, Mr. Straus kept in touch with his New York roots as founder and continuing champion of the Barbara and Robert K. Straus Thinking and Learning Center on the Manhattan campus of Pace University. The idea for it grew from his interest in the teachings of Alfred Korzybski, the Polish-born scholar and fountainhead of general semantics. 
 The center opened in 1985, with Dr. Rachel M. Lauer, Pace professor of psychology and former chief psychologist of New York City schools, as director.
Mr. Straus tried to bring general semantics -- which involves the study of the ways in which people use and react to language -- into the curriculum at Pace University as a decision-making tool.
Mr. Straus was a mainstay and past officer of the Institute of General Semantics, now located in Englewood, N.J.
Born in Manhattan, Mr. Straus was a son of Jesse Isador Straus, who was president of R. H. Macy & Company and an Ambassador to France. His grandfather Isador Straus, a company founder, died when the Titanic sank on the liner's maiden voyage in 1912.
Robert Straus graduated in 1927 from Harvard College, where he majored in government and economics. He continued his studies in Cambridge, England; Paris, and Geneva and returned to Harvard to earn an M.B.A. in 1931. Together with his brother Jack Isador, another longtime chief executive of Macy's, he endowed a chair at the Harvard Business School in memory of their father.
He went to work for Franklin D. Roosevelt when Roosevelt was Governor of New York and also worked for him when he became President, serving in the New Deal's National Recovery Administration. In 1936 he began two terms as a Fusion-ticket member of the New York City Council.
As a United States Army officer in World War II, Mr. Straus worked at the Pentagon and was a government affairs specialist at the Allied forces' headquarters in England. Having worked as a magazine publishing executive before the war, he returned to the field once back in New York.
In 1958 he moved his family to San Francisco, where he bought a small newspaper, the San Fernando Valley Sun. From that developed a stake in a new venture he founded in 1961, Sun Litho Inc.
He and his partners built the company into a large commercial printer, one of the first in California to use phototypesetting and web offset printing to produce catalogues and other business materials. They sold Sun Litho in 1980.
Robert Straus is survived by his wife of 50 years, Barbara Flower Straus; a daughter, Penelope More of Olema, Calif.; a son, Christopher, of Santa Barbara; a stepson, Simon Flower of Kingston, England, and two grandchildren.

Prices Tumble On Testimony By Greenspan

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities tumbled yesterday, after traders took Senate testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to mean that a Fed tightening was probable.
The 30-year bond dropped 115/32 to a price of 985/32 to yield 6.77 percent, up from 6.65 percent on Tuesday. The day's decline cost investors $14.80 for each $1,000 invested in bonds. 
 While the bulk of the selling came on Mr. Greenspan's remarks, traders also noted that some of the losses might have resulted from dealers using Mr. Greenspan's bearish Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to do further selling, raising rates to make Treasuries more attractive to investors. But the results of yesterday's five-year Treasury note auction proved weak, with the note awarded at a high yield of 6.359 percent, which was higher than expected. Demand was the weakest in a year with a bid-to-cover ratio, or the total number of bids compared with the size of the sale, of 2.11 to 1.
In addition to the auction, corporate debt sales were priced yesterday, adding to the market's supply woes. The Chrysler Corporation priced $600 million of 7.45 percent 30-year debentures through underwriters, led by Salomon Brothers.
Rated A-3 by Moody's and A- by Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelps, the debentures are priced at 99.514 to yield 7.491 percent, or about 69 basis points more than a comparable Treasury. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) They offer a call provision when the yield is equivalent to 18 basis points above the current Treasury.
Investors sold on fears that a Fed tightening would cause their fixed-income investments to lose value, and traders say the market has begun to price in a rate increase of 25 basis points, or a quarter of a percentage point. In his testimony before the Senate, Mr. Greenspan called for caution in the stock market, but added that the country's economic prospects were favorable, with low inflation and appreciable growth this year.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, noted that while the chairman mentioned things he had said before, the language this time was more forceful and blunter. "Obviously Greenspan can tighten with words, as well as the Federal funds rate," he said.
The Fed chairman stressed a number of things. One is that inflation risks are biased toward the upside and that the Fed must remain alert to the possibility of rising inflation. "Clearly the bias toward tightening is firmly in place.," Mr. Fine said.
"Greenspan said the Fed must be pre-emptive, which means that if in their judgment conditions are such that inflation is likely to pick up some time in the future, action would be required prior to the actual event," he continued.
Mr. Fine said that the Fed chairman stressed that consumer spending would probably determine Fed actions.
The Fed chairman once again referred to "irrational exuberance" among stock traders, a phrase he used in December, and said there was reason to keep it on the table, suggesting that the Fed is clearly wary of continued increases in equity prices. "To quote chairman Greenspan," Mr. Fine said, "history counsels caution."
Mr. Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony will continue next Wednesday.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist of the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said he thought the Fed chairman was setting up the financial markets for a potential tightening, but not an immediate one.
The fact that the markets reacted the way they did is just indicative of the way financial markets operate, Mr. Chan said.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

HEADLINE: A Warning Investors Have Ignored Before

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
When the Federal Reserve speaks of overvalued stocks, investors usually don't listen. Or at least they don't do so for long. Only later do they regret that decision.
That is the history of the very few examples when the Fed has chosen to go public with concerns over the stock market. Generally, Federal Reserve officials are much more likely to discuss inflation, interest rates and Government spending than get into the question of whether markets are fairly valued. 
 Alan Greenspan, in Senate testimony yesterday, was more explicit than he has been in the past in questioning the rationality of current stock prices. "It's not markets that are irrational," the Fed chairman said. "It's people who become irrationally exuberant on occasion and take actions that induce what economists like to call bubbles, which eventually burst."
On Wall Street, the reaction was swift but brief. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged on the first word of his comments, falling nearly 100 points. But by the end of the day, it had made up a large part of that loss. It was reminiscent of the reaction in December, when Mr. Greenspan first stunned traders by using the words "irrational exuberance" in discussing the market. Prices fell, but recovered within days, and now prices are well above where they were then.
So it has been in the past. The Federal Reserve has been around since 1914, but only twice before Mr. Greenspan spoke out in December had Fed officials said things that could have been taken as warnings of overvalued stock prices. Those warnings, in 1929 and 1965, caused temporary falls but were followed by new highs. Then, about seven or eight months later, the market topped at prices that would seem expensive a decade later.
Why does Wall Street react that way? Some now do not believe prices are overvalued or think the overvaluation is only minor. And, in any case, professional money managers are judged by results, and in recent years the results have been poor for those who were cautious.
"Like almost everyone else, I am still pretty fully invested, albeit uncomfortably," Barton Biggs, the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a memo to clients last week. "The game is so hot you just can't afford to get out if you are in the luxuriant profession of running money for those who demand instant performance. Yet in my heart, I suspect it is all going to end very badly."
Mr. Greenspan did not say the stock market was a bubble yesterday; he has never been explicit on his view of valuations. But in comparing it to the commercial real estate market in the late 1980's -- a market that collapsed and left some banks insolvent in its wake -- he seemed to be sounding a warning.
The last time before Mr. Greenspan spoke that a Fed chairman alarmed the markets by seeming to hint that the stock market was overvalued came on June 1, 1965. William McChesney Martin Jr., then the Federal Reserve chairman, gave a speech referring to "disquieting similarities between our present prosperity and the fabulous 20's," although he did not comment on stock prices directly.
Stocks sold off, and by the time the market bottomed nearly a month later, the Dow was down 8.4 percent. But a rally then ensued, until prices peaked the following February, eight months after Mr. Martin spoke, with the Dow just under 1,000 and 8.4 percent higher than when Mr. Martin had spoken. That 1,000 level was to become almost mystical on Wall Street, and it was not until 1982 that the market finally topped that figure for good.
In the 1920's, the Federal Reserve was a far weaker and less prestigious body than it is now, and it has been roundly criticized by historians for not doing more to stem the speculative excesses that led to the October 1929 crash.
But the Fed did try, albeit weakly. On Feb. 2, 1929, it said in a statement that the law establishing the Fed did not "contemplate the use of the resources of the Federal Reserve System for the creation or extension of speculative credit." It was, in other words, telling banks to stop borrowing from the Fed at low interest rates and then lending the money to speculators at higher rates.
Bank credit had financed the bull market, and for a time people were scared. The Dow fell 7.2 percent the next seven weeks. But then bankers, led by Charles Mitchell of National City Bank, a predecessor of today's Citicorp, said they would keep on lending, and stock prices resumed their ascent. The Fed did nothing.
At the peak, on Sept. 3, 1929, the Dow stood 19.2 percent above where it had been when the Fed issued its warning. That was to be a level the Dow would not see again for a quarter century.
There is no reason to think that 1997 will be another 1929. The economy, as Mr. Greenspan emphasized in his testimony yesterday, is healthy, with inflation low and growth doing well. In 1929, signs of a faltering economy were apparent, and ignored, well before the stock market crashed.
But now, as in 1929, there is the question of what the Fed will do if its warnings are ignored. To some on Wall Street, Mr. Greenspan's comments yesterday served as a clear warning that the Fed will soon tighten credit by raising short-term interest rates. "He's giving you a head's up that that is what he is going to do at the end of March," said Byron Wien, the chief United States strategist for Morgan Stanley.
Others are not so sure the Fed will act. "I don't think he would raise rates solely on the basis of the current level of speculation," said Hugh Johnson, a strategist at First Albany, adding that he thought Mr. Greenspan would wait for more evidence of inflation in wages.
But few think that such a tightening, if it comes, will be severe, or have a lasting impact on the stock market. "There would be a feeling of discomfort" in the stock market, said Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs. But without much evidence of inflation, it would be limited, she said.
In sum, Wall Street thinks that while Mr. Greenspan may talk about high stock prices, he will not do much about them. After all, even after yesterday's drop, the Dow is 8.5 percent above where it was when Mr. Greenspan first warned of "irrational exuberance."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Speaks and Stocks Plunge

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan rattled the markets yesterday. Within 10 minutes of the Federal Reserve chairman's Senate testimony yesterday morning, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 102 points, before a partial recovery to close down 55.03 points at 6,983.18. Interestingly, that one-day loss mirrored the one that occurred the day after Mr. Greenspan's now much-quoted "irrational exuberance" remark last December.
Yesterday's session was marked by wild volatility. Throughout the day, the Dow seesawed -- down 100 points, then just 30, then an afternoon plunge that took more than 122 points off Tuesday's close, before a last-hour climb. In fact, at the end of a busy day, stock prices were still ahead of where they began the week. 
 The stock and bond markets both plunged after Mr. Greenspan warned of the possibility that the Fed might make a "pre-emptive policy tightening" that would raise short-term interest rates. He also cautioned that the current stock market environment might be characterized by "excessive optimism."
But some analysts said that the market once again showed its resilience yesterday, in part because it has developed its own internal momentum -- one that is being buoyed by what one analyst termed a "perfect backdrop" of heavy cash inflows into mutual funds, better-than-expected corporate earnings, moderate economic growth and low inflationary pressures.
"This market is up on sound fundamentals," said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards Inc. "People want to own stocks, and that's where it's at. I don't think Greenspan messed up the apple cart at all. His job is to try to keep everybody's hopes conservative, but the market doesn't work that way; the marketplace is an emotional animal."
Yesterday, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks lost 6.42 points to close at 805.68. The Nasdaq composite index was off 7.14, or about one-half percent, to close at 1,340.55.
Among the Dow's 30 component stocks, 23 fell with McDonald's, Texaco and Boeing taking the brunt of the losses. McDonald's was down 2 3/8, to 44 7/8, largely because of a report that the fast-food chain would slash prices. Texaco lost 2 1/4, to 101 7/8, and Boeing was down 2 1/8, to 104 1/8.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony hurt the interest-rate-sensitive financial services industry, in particular. Chase Manhattan lost 2 1/2, to 103 1/4, and Citicorp was off 1 7/8, to 121 7/8.
In the two months since Mr. Greenspan's rhetorical question last December about whether "irrational exuberance" had invaded the market, the Dow has gained about 10 percent and galloped past the 7,000-point level, extending what has been one of the longest bull runs in history.
Many analysts saw Mr. Greenspan's remarks yesterday as his most detailed expression of concern yet over high stock prices.
Still, bond prices tumbled yesterday, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 6.77 percent, up from 6.65 percent on Tuesday. It is generally believed that rising yields make bonds more competitive in relation to stocks, so yesterday's rising bond yields were a factor in the drop in stock prices.
In suggesting repeatedly that stocks might be riding a wave of "excessive optimism," Mr. Greenspan even conjured up a comparison to the real estate "bubble" that burst in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
"His comments are consistent with what he's said before," said Marshall Acuff Jr., a market strategist at Smith Barney. "But they are a bit more hawkish -- stronger. He's sort of throwing a shot across the bow."
Some suspect a rate rise could come as early as March or April.
Will stock prices moderate in the meantime? "Maybe that comment was positioned to constrain the market's rise, but that was going to happen anyway," Mr. Acuff said. Referring to the market's climb of nearly 10 percent this year, he said: "If you annualize that, it's mind-boggling. It can't continue to rise at that pace."
David Shulman, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers and a consistent bear, is almost certain the Fed will act. "When Greenspan acts, he's going to say, 'It's not like I didn't warn you guys,' " Mr. Shulman said. "You've got a real issue here between the market and Fed policy."
He said the market had not taken Mr. Greenspan seriously, noting that stock prices had surged despite the chairman's December warning, and that yesterday's losses were just, well, yesterday's losses. "One day doesn't make a trend," he said. "Compared to December, the market is even more exuberant."

HEADLINE: Torricelli in Spotlight and on the Spot

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
It took Senator Robert G. Torricelli just 50 days to find his way to center stage in the United States Senate.
Mr. Torricelli, the Democratic freshman from New Jersey, became the focus of attention today when he declared his intention to cast the deciding vote against the proposed constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget. In the process, he broke a campaign promise that he made in his hard-fought race last year. 
 Mr. Torricelli, a veteran member of the House who began serving his Senate term on Jan. 7, said in an interview that he could not support the Republican-sponsored plan because "it is simply not good enough."
The spotlight zeroed in on Mr. Torricelli earlier in the week, after Mary L. Landrieu, the Democratic freshman Senator from Louisiana, said she would support the measure. As reporters began staking out Mr. Torricelli, telephone calls from constituents began pouring into his office and leaders from both parties met with him in private to try to persuade him to vote their way.
Known throughout his legislative career for his headline-grabbing propensities, Mr. Torricelli did not seem to shrink from the attention.
His spokesman, Jim Jordan, said, "He has been as cool as the other side of the pillow." Still, one of his colleagues, Senator Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat who was the deciding vote when the same measure was defeated in 1995, said he was sure that Mr. Torricelli "was feeling very much on the spot."
Mr. Torricelli said he did not know until Monday night that he would be the final holdout. He said he waited so long because he shared "some sympathies" with both parties on the issue. At a news conference here today, the Senator said he had "struggled with this decision more than any I have ever made in my life."
A Torricelli aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Democratic leaders had wanted some undecided members to hold out so they could better control the final days of the debate and that among the freshmen, Mr. Torricelli was in the strongest position to withstand the pressure because he had won election by a convincing margin.
Richard A. Zimmer, the former House Republican who was defeated by Mr. Torricelli last November, criticized of his former opponent's decision.
"Bob Torricelli promised to vote for a balanced budget amendment," Mr. Zimmer said. "New Jerseyans have a right to be disappointed. They will remember."
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, a Republican, issued a statement urging Mr. Torricelli to rethink his decision.
"Keeping campaign promises is something New Jerseyans have come to expect," Mrs. Whitman said.
A vote on the measure, which would require a balanced budget by the year 2002, is scheduled for next Tuesday in the Senate. But the deadline for introducing amendments was today, and Mr. Torricelli spent nearly three hours on the Senate floor this afternoon, where he proposed an amendment to allow for spending on capital improvement projects and for provisions allowing deficit spending during economic recessions and national emergencies.
Mr. Torricelli's proposal was defeated by an overwhelming vote, 63 to 37, but it provided him a handy defense to explain why he would vote against a measure he had promised to support.
"I have voted for a balanced budget amendment on three previous occasions, and I want to be able to do so again," Mr. Torricelli said in debate. Without his proposals -- which never stood much of a chance -- "we are potentially putting a straitjacket on this Government," he said.
He said that as a member of the House it was easier to vote in favor of previous balanced budget plans because they were "a vehicle we used all these years to pressure the administration to tackle the deficit." But now, with the possibility of actually amending the Constitution looming larger, he said, "the level of seriousness has risen."
Mr. Torricelli said he had spoken with President Clinton earlier in the week, and "indicated" his attention to oppose the bill. He also credited his Democratic colleague from New York, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, as being "very persuasive" during a private meeting on Tuesday. Mr. Moynihan was clearly pleased by Mr. Torricelli's decision.
"Senator Torricelli did it and he did it by reasoning and listening," Mr. Moynihan said after the announcement. "And it's wonderful."
On Tuesday night, Mr. Torricelli also met for more than an hour with Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is sponsoring the measure.
"I told him I was very torn," Mr. Torricelli said in an interview.
With the announcement behind him, Mr. Torricelli sat and rocked in a brand-new gold-leaf rocking chair that his staff had bought. He watched on television as a dejected Mr. Hatch read from Mr. Torricelli's campaign position papers, which stated that the candidate "supports a balanced budget amendment."
As Mr. Hatch was reading on the television, Mr. Torricelli blurted out, "I do, but not yours."

HEADLINE: Republicans' Budget Amendment Is Headed for Defeat in the Senate

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Republican hopes for a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution were crushed today when Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, the last senator to state a position, announced that he would vote against the measure.
Senator Torricelli's decision leaves the amendment with only 66 supporters in the Senate, one shy of the two-thirds majority necessary, and probably kills the measure for this Congress. 
 "I have struggled with this decision more than any that I have ever made in my life," Mr. Torricelli, a freshman Democrat, said at a news conference."
Ultimately, he said, he decided that Congress should "meet the same high standards in writing constitutional provisions as both the Founding Fathers and those who followed them met."
"It's my judgment that that burden has not been met," Mr. Torricelli said on a day in which he was the focus of attention. [Page B9.]
The constitutional amendment has been a central part of Republican doctrine for years. All 55 Republican senators favor it, and the Republican Party's leaders made it the first important matter to come to a vote in the 105th Congress. Two years ago, an almost identical amendment also failed by one vote in the Senate.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chief Republican sponsor of the amendment, said that he had not given up and that he had two senators in mind, whom he would not identify, whose votes he hoped to switch. But Mr. Hatch conceded that "I believe it will be a 66-to-34 vote" and added that the issue was certainly dead for this year and probably for this Congress.
The final Senate vote is set for March 4. House Republican leaders said they would not proceed on the amendment if it failed in the Senate.
President Clinton opposes the balanced-budget amendment and helped round up votes against it. Mr. Clinton issued a statement tonight saying he was pleased about the outcome and adding, "Now it is time to get down to the hard work of balancing the budget."
The proposed constitutional change would require the Federal budget to be in balance two years after the amendment was ratified by three-quarters of the state legislatures and every year afterward, but in no case would the amendment go into effect before 2002. The requirement could be waived only by a three-fifths majority vote in the Senate and the House.
Senator Torricelli voted for the almost identical measure two years ago when he was in the House of Representatives, and he promised in his election campaign last year to vote for a balanced-budget amendment. But he said today that he had come to believe that such great strides had been made toward reducing the budget deficit that the discipline offered by a constitutional amendment was no longer so essential as it once was.
In addition, Mr. Torricelli said, he had begun to fear that the rigid requirement might prevent the Government from responding quickly to an economic or military emergency and might inhibit crucial investments in capital projects like roads, bridges and schools.
Before announcing how he would vote on the Republican measure, Mr. Torricelli offered a proposal to change it so that the requirement for a three-fifths majority vote to run a deficit could be waived in a military or economic emergency and so that a separate account not subject to the balanced-budget requirement could be created for capital expenditures.
Mr. Torricelli said he would have voted for the constitutional amendment if the changes he sought had been included. But like many others offered by Democrats over the last few weeks to give themselves political cover, the Torricelli proposals never had a chance, and they were rejected, 63 to 37.
Senator Hatch called the proposals "a charade" and said they would have "opened loopholes through which you could drive trucks."
Mr. Torricelli clearly enjoyed the spotlight only seven weeks after he first took his seat in the Senate. This afternoon, he gave a long, rambling speech to an empty Senate chamber as if he had been doing it all his life. And as the vote was being taken on his proposal, he moved about the well of the Senate like a veteran, slapping backs and shaking hands.
A few minutes later at his news conference, he suggested that his vote might not have been so crucial and that Democratic leaders had other votes in reserve if he had decided to go the other way. "Had I not done this," he said, "I believe there were other votes available."
But Senator Hatch said that was not the case. "No way," he said. "I had firm commitments."
In any event, Mr. Torricelli's decision may have been a reason Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, the next to last hold-out, announced on Tuesday that she would vote for the amendment. Mr. Torricelli said he had dinner with Ms. Landrieu on Monday night.
As matters now stand, 11 Democrats are joining the 55 Republicans in favor of the amendment, and 34 Democrats are opposing it.
The failure of the amendment once more was a victory for Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the former Democratic leader, a student of the Constitution and perhaps the most ardent defender in Congress of the work of the Founding Fathers.
Senator Hatch said he knew what Senator Torricelli had decided when he walked into the Senate this morning and saw the expression on Senator Byrd's face.
Well into the evening, Senator Byrd, wearing a crimson vest, was still sitting in his seat on the aisle, one row behind the spot where he presided for so long as his party's leader, as one Democrat after another came by to shake his hand.

Crime in Region Is Dropping, But Some Pockets Defy Trend

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
Serious crime in the ring of cities and suburbs around New York City has fallen to its lowest level since at least 1980, an analysis of data for the last 16 years shows. But it has not dropped nearly as far as it has in New York City, and it appears to be rising again in a few of the region's most troubled urban areas and the fastest growing suburbs.
The overall decline in crime rates masks increases in the rates of violent crime in the suburban areas of nine counties, including the densely settled Bergen County in New Jersey, a rapidly developing crescent of central New Jersey and high-growth areas of New York State. About three million people live in areas where 1995 crime rates are higher than their 1990 rates. Some 12 million others in the region, plus 7 million in New York City, live in suburbs or cities where crime rates are dropping. 
 Declines have been recorded from cities like Yonkers and Trenton to suburban areas like Suffolk County on Long Island and rural areas like Litchfield County, Conn. Over all, in the region that rings New York City, the numbers of reported serious crimes like murder, rape and robbery declined twice as fast as in the nation since a peak in 1990.
The decline has occurred, experts say, for the same reasons often credited in New York and the nation. They include demographic shifts that have left many towns with fewer of the young people who typically commit the most crimes, and with more police officers.
"What we are experiencing, we are experiencing as a region," said John S. Pritchard 3d, the Police Commissioner in Mount Vernon, N.Y., next to the Bronx. "The trends are regional trends."
In a pattern that is typical for urban areas outside New York, reported violent crime fell 21 percent from 1990 through 1996 in Mount Vernon, while the decline in New York City was 44 percent.
Illustrating the trend, while violent crime was falling in New York City to a rate of 1,324 incidents per 100,000 people in 1996, from 2,384 in 1990, there were declines throughout the region, although often not as fast. In Trenton, for example, during the same six years, the violent crime rate fell to 1,521 from 1,986, while in New Haven, it fell to 2,188 from 3,059.
An analysis of crime records by The New York Times found these developments:
*There are now seven cities in the region that are more violent than New York, compared with only one -- Newark -- that was more violent 16 years ago. And in two of them -- Bridgeport, Conn., and New Haven -- violent crime increased in 1996.
*If 12 urban areas near New York were a city of 1.6 million, it would have a higher rate of violent crime than New York, which was not the case in 1994. Today, those areas report 24 percent more violent crime than New York City and 73 percent more thefts and burglaries.
*Putnam County in New York, Hunterdon and Warren Counties in New Jersey and Litchfield County, Conn., are the least violent in the region, and all are safer since 1980.
*Putnam and Suffolk are the only counties in the region where violent crime dropped more sharply than in New York City from 1990 to 1995. Putnam's drop was 58 percent and Suffolk's was 54 percent, compared with 38.4 percent in New York City.
*Crime rates have fallen much faster around New York City than in the nation and are now much lower than the national average. And even counties with rising crime have fairly low crime rates. Despite the increases, most of those counties are still safer than the whole nation.

The Statistics
Over All, Outpacing The Nation's Drop
The computer analysis shows that in the New York-Connecticut-New Jersey metropolitan area, excluding New York City, the reported violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault fell 15 percent from 1990 through 1995, the last year for which data is available for every community in the region.
During the same period, violent crime fell 34 percent in New York City. But in the nation as a whole, violent crime fell just 6.5 percent from 1990 through 1995. By 1995, the area around New York had a violent crime rate 35 percent lower than the nation as a whole.
The property crimes of burglary, larceny and auto theft fell even more sharply in the region around New York City, by 21 percent.
As in New York City, murder is less a part of life in the metropolitan region than it used to be. In 1990, there were 610 murders reported in the 26-county region surrounding New York City, which has 12.6 million residents. In 1995, that number had fallen to 510, a decline of 16 percent. During the same period in New York City, with its 7.3 million residents, murder fell 48 percent, to 1,177 from 2,245.
The Times's analysis included computer comparisons of crime data in the 26-county area that the Regional Plan Association identifies as the greater New York area. The data included statistics since 1980 from every county in the region on the seven serious crimes that go into the F.B.I. crime index: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft. The analysis also included comparisons with crime rates in New York City and the nation, and data from 1996 for some cities in the region.
As in New York City, the falling crime rate has led to a debate about whether it is a result of new policing strategies or, rather, demographic trends that are likely to change.
"We are obviously doing something right because crime is falling," said John Kaye, the Monmouth County Prosecutor in New Jersey. "But the number of juveniles who are coming along tell us this is a momentary lull in the crime rate."
The computer analysis of preliminary statistics for 1996 shows crime continuing to decline in many communities. But in three cities where the numbers of serious crimes had been declining -- New Haven, Waterbury and Bridgeport -- 1996 numbers show crime beginning to increase again, by 17 percent in New Haven, for example.
Some police officials said they were not sure whether those statistics reflected local circumstances or a hint that crime rates may begin to climb again throughout the region.

The Cities
Places More Violent Than New York
Most cities in the New York metropolitan area have seen a drop in both violent and property crime since 1990. Among other cities, Newark, Jersey City, New Haven and Yonkers each reported fewer violent crimes in 1996 than they did six years ago.
But compared with the drop in New York City, the decline has not been as heavy in several of the region's largest cities. For example, in Newark, which has had the region's highest crime rate for many years, there were 100 murders last year, compared with 112 in 1990, a decline of 11 percent in a city of 260,000. At the same time in New York City, with a population of 7.3 million, there were 983 murders in 1996, down from 2,245 in 1990, a decline of 56 percent.
In 1996, Newark, New Haven, Trenton, Bridgeport, Jersey City, East Orange, N.J., and Irvington, N.J., each had higher violent crime rates than New York City.
Some experts said they feared that the recent emphasis on falling crime rates in New York City might create a false sense that the problem in smaller cities had been addressed. Marcus Felson, a professor at the Rutgers University School of Criminal Justice in Newark, said that Newark and other cities still had conditions that he said are inevitably linked to high crime rates: large abandoned areas, weak economies and a growing group of school-age children about to enter adolescence.
The emphasis on crime-rate improvements, he said, created the danger that those areas might be left out of a regional discussion about how to reduce crime. "When you have high crime rates," Mr. Felson said, "even noticeable improvements in crime rates leave you with a high crime rate."
Violent crime reported in Newark declined 13 percent from 1990 through 1996. But the violent crime rate, which is the incidence of crime per 100,000 people, was 3,364. That was lower than in 1980, but it was more than double the violent crime rate in New York City, 1,324 in 1996.

The Suburbs
Pockets of Crime Mar Safer Areas
More than 10.9 million people in the metropolitan area live in suburbs, and to the extent that some of them do so to escape crime, recent statistics validate that choice.
Suburban New York, Connecticut and New Jersey have much lower crime rates than New York or the region's other cities, and crime is declining, the analysis shows. When violent crime fell in New York City by 34 percent from 1990 through 1995, it fell 13 percent in the metropolitan area outside the big cities.
When the region's cities are removed from the calculation, 17 of the 26 counties in the metropolitan area showed declines in violent crime from 1990 through 1995, with the biggest drops in Putnam and Suffolk Counties in New York, and Monmouth, Warren and Somerset Counties in New Jersey. The property crimes of burglary, larceny and auto theft fell in 24 of the 26 counties during those five years. Only Rockland and Sullivan Counties in New York had rises in property crimes.
Even in the nine counties where suburban crime has increased, the level of crime is much lower than the big cities. When the cities with at least 100,000 people or high murder rates in 1990 were removed from the crime statistics, the remainder of the metropolitan area had a violent crime rate less than one-sixth the rate of the big cities in the region.
Still, local law enforcement officials say the suburbs have their own high-crime pockets with drug trading and violence.
Monmouth County on the New Jersey shore, for example, is a prosperous area of bedroom communities. County officials estimate some 30 percent of the largely middle-class population of 581,000 commutes to New York City or elsewhere.
Crime in Monmouth is much lower than it was in 1980 and declining rapidly. From 1990 through 1995, violent crime fell 25.7 percent. There were 103 reported rapes in Monmouth in 1995, down from 140 in 1990. Aggravated assault reports fell to 849 from 1,277 during the same period. Monmouth's violent crime rate of 248 incidents per 100,000 residents is almost identical to the average of 251 for suburban areas in the region.
But local law enforcement officials say the statistics disguise the stubborn crime problem in Asbury Park, N.J., the faded ocean-front community of 16,000. Several experts cited Asbury Park as an example of the type of small cities with serious crime that are dotted across comfortable suburbs of New York.
Mr. Kaye, the Monmouth County Prosecutor, called Asbury Park "one of the worst drug meccas in the state" and said there was frequent violence among competing drug dealers. Asbury Park's violent crime rate was 46 percent higher than the rate in New York City in 1996. While crime rates dropped across the region, the violent crime rate in Asbury Park increased 23 percent from 1990 through 1996.

The Region
A Ripple Effect From New York
With its hundreds of cities, towns and villages in three states, the New York metropolitan area is often seen as a group of separate communities. But some law enforcement officials say recent crime trends show how interconnected the region is.
In part, they say, the sharp declines in crime across the region show that social and economic forces may be more important than government in handling some problems. But they also said that New York City is such an important regional hub that changes in law enforcement policies there have had a ripple effect.
In some cases, that effect has added to the crime problem outside the city. In Mount Vernon last year, the police said they observed an influx of prostitution. When they investigated, they discovered that officers in the 47th Precinct in the Bronx had begun a crackdown. The prostitutes, the Mount Vernon police concluded, simply walked up White Plains Road and across the border into Mount Vernon.
In Rockland County, one of the suburban counties where both property and violent reported crime climbed from 1990 through 1995, District Attorney Michael E. Bongiorno said he had sometimes noted a correlation between crackdowns on drug trafficking in New York City and jumps in crime in Rockland.
But officials also say that New York City's influence has been much more profound than simply as an exporter of crime. Across the region, there are more police officers on the streets and a new eagerness to try new policing techniques, including "park and walk" programs and other plans to bring officers in closer contact with residents. Some officials say they have been influenced in such moves by the policies of New York's Mayors David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani and by Mr. Giuliani's first police commissioner, William J. Bratton.
In Suffolk County, on Long Island, where crime has dropped more sharply than in New York City since 1990, Police Commissioner John C. Gallagher said his department and many others grew while new York City was increasing its police force.
After freezing the Suffolk County police force at 2,000 officers until 1991, the department has grown to about 2,750 officers. Mr. Gallagher said the fact that reported crime declined as the Suffolk department was growing was a challenge to the assertion of some criminologists that the size of police forces cannot affect crime.
In some places, the echo of New York City's crime-fighting history is unmistakable. For example, Stamford, Conn., with about 107,000 people, which has long had one of the lowest crimes rates for a city its size anywhere in the nation, has a new Mayor, Dannel P. Malloy, who is a former New York City prosecutor.
When he ran for office two years ago, Mr. Malloy said he would make crime-fighting a top priority. In office he has worked closely with Police Chief G. Patrick Tully, in a quality-of-life campaign like the one promoted by Mr. Bratton in New York City to discourage panhandlers in the downtown area.
Chief Tully said the similarity was not entirely coincidence. "I believe," he said, in what he called "the precepts Commissioner Bratton articulated: Holding people accountable and concentrating on quality-of-life crimes because they contribute to the bigger crimes."
Violent crime fell 15 percent in Stamford in 1996 from 1995, to the lowest level since at least 1980.

Graphs: "Portrait of Crime"
 The declines in crime rates in the 26-county region surrounding New York City have not been as rapid as in the five boroughs. But the analysis by The New York Times shows a sharp, widespread drop in reported violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault) and property crimes (burglary, auto theft, larceny) since 1990, in both cities and suburbs. The picture is hardly a uniform one, though: in the suburban areas of nine counties, the violent crime rate increased from 1990 to 1995.
 To allow county-by-county comparisons of crime outside big cities, the map at right uses figures that were calculated excluding statistics for the cities shown below.

Indians Plan to Endure as Players Go

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: WINTER HAVEN, Fla., Feb. 25

 BODY:
Just because Carlos Baerga was traded last summer, Albert Belle left as a free agent this winter and Kenny Lofton has already said he will be a free agent next winter, the Cleveland Indians are not about to pronounce their grand experiment a failure. On the contrary, John Hart, the architect of the signing scheme, has proclaimed it an unqualified success.
Hart, sitting in a golf cart under the cypress trees on the shore of Lake Lulu, was asked today to assess the Indians' practice of signing their best young players to multiyear contracts now that some of those players no longer play for them. 
 "From a real broad look at this -- and we've analyzed it a great deal -- we wouldn't change a thing," the general manager said. "It's something we will continue. We're in the process of talking to several young players now. Without that stability, the cost predictability and the creativity to be able to get it done, this franchise wouldn't have the success it has had."
The Indians, a dormant franchise for four decades, have the best won-lost record in baseball over the past three years. In that period, they won two successive division championships and played in the World Series for the first time since 1954. They would not have achieved that success without the core of young players.
 Belle, Baerga, Kenny Lofton, Jim Thome, Sandy Alomar Jr., Jose Mesa, Manny Ramirez, Charles Nagy, Omar Vizquel, Julian Tavarez -- they represented three-fourths of the infield, the entire outfield, the catcher, the No. 3 starting pitcher and the top two relief pitchers.
"When we came in and did the multiyear contracts, it was very important to where this franchise was and where we've come from," Hart said. "It was a franchise that had no stability. That love affair between fans and team just wasn't there. There was a lot of turnover."
But the turnover is threatening to start again. Contracts, no matter when they're signed, eventually expire. Players who become stars and help create a championship team command large salaries, sometimes too large for a team to swallow.
"For the first time in this decade, we're dealing with baseball in the 90's," Hart said. "Albert wanted to be the highest-paid player. I think if we had elected to make him the highest-paid player, he would have stayed in Cleveland. Our loss of Albert Belle was more an organization philosophy as to what we feel a championship club is all about. It was just a philosophical decision that we could not put 20, 25 percent of our payroll in one player."
Hart has spoken with Lofton, the team's outstanding center fielder, about a new contract, but Lofton wants to test his market value as a free agent. Alomar can also be a free agent, but contract talks are ongoing. The Indians, disenchanted with Baerga, traded him to the Mets last season, and they included Tavarez in the package that brought them Matt Williams this winter.
They have Thome, Nagy and Mesa under contract through 1998, Ramirez through 2000 and Vizquel through 2002. In other words, the Indians' nucleus will not be swallowed whole by the alligator that was cruising Lake Lulu as Hart spoke.
"We're not slashing our wrists here," Hart said. "We feel good about our players. We've thought through where we're going."
Even so, Hart acknowledged, that the task of keeping a team together is getting tougher, "especially if you have a lot of marquee players." But, he added, "that doesn't mean you still can't meet your performance challenge in being a contending club every year."
That's his goal, and he pointed to the Atlanta Braves as the role model. "The world championship is everyone's goal," he said, "but to be able to provide for your fans a club that has a chance to compete every year makes for the essence of what this industry should be about. To me, success has been the Braves."
 Hart also cited the success Oakland, Toronto and Pittsburgh had in the past decade, and then their decline. "We don't want that to happen to us," he said.
 With the original core starting to melt, it's possible that the Indians' best chance at a world championship is past. Hart, however, refused to see the last few years as the team's only time to shine. "I don't think this window is going to close on us," he said. "Looking at how we measure success, I think we have the ability to be that contending type club every year. We just have to stay nimble and on our toes as far as keeping a championship club here within certain economic parameters."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: Youngsters' Ailing Shoulders Carry Concern for Mets and Yanks;
Ruben Rivera's Injury Worse; Surgery Likely

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 26

 BODY:
Ruben Rivera was slumped on a couch in a storage room next to Joe Torre's office, with a baseball cap pulled down tight over his moist eyes and a glum expression on his face. Rivera, the Yankees' elite prospect, had just been informed he would not play baseball for at least three months because of impending arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder. He did not have to utter a syllable to express his dejection.
After a magnetic resonance imaging test on Monday revealed a bone bruise and inflammation of Rivera's rotator cuff, Dr. Stuart Hershon recommended that the 23-year old outfielder undergo surgery. Rivera will get a second opinion from Dr. James Andrews, the orthopedic surgeon, in Birmingham, Ala., on Thursday, but the Yankees expect him to concur. 
 Because the injury has been lingering since September and there was an abundance of outfielders on the roster, Rivera was not expected to make the 25-man cut this spring, and Torre had planned to send him to Class AAA Columbus when camp broke. The manager said the injury was not considered career-threatening.
Rivera has had five m.r.i. tests since injuring the shoulder while making two flamboyant, but unnecessary, throws during a 19-2 pummeling of the Milwaukee Brewers last Sept. 25, the day the Yankees clinched the American League East. The Yankees were already ahead, 14-1, in the fourth inning when Rivera made one throw to third base and one to home plate to draw wild applause from a delirious crowd at Yankee Stadium.
When Rivera woke up the next morning, he had severe pain in his shoulder, and he has not been 100 percent since.
"At 56 years old, I can say it was a foolish thing to do," Torre said. "But when you're 22, I'm not sure you can really fault him for trying to challenge somebody. I've got a different perspective on this thing. It's easy for me to talk about it because it's over with. It irritated me before I thought about being in his shoes."
Dr. Hershon said Rivera's shoulder had shown "progressive improvement" during four m.r.i. tests over five months, but that there were distressing results in two areas of the procedure performed Monday. Hershon, who said there was "no evidence of a significant rotator cuff tear," said he was puzzled over why an m.r.i. test in December was positive and then Rivera "went downhill" this week. Rivera provided no insight about his decline other than telling the Yankees that the shoulder pain heightened last Saturday.
"It's hard to say," said Hershon, when asked about Rivera's setback. "When you come to big league camps, the demands are more. He certainly wasn't being rushed."
With Rivera's absence, the Yankees' murky outfield picture became clearer. Six candidates have been been reduced to five, with Mark Whiten now designated as the backup center fielder to Bernie Williams. General Manager Bob Watson said he did not expect Rivera to return to the Yankees until June or even July because he will have to rehabilitate after surgery. Rivera did not speak with reporters.
"He's mentally down right now," Watson said. "He's a young man we're going to have to keep a close eye on."
Rivera is a five-tool player who can run, hit, hit for power, field and throw, and the Yankees have deemed him an untouchable in trade talks. Despite Rivera's talents and a .284 average with 2 home runs and 16 runs batted in during his 46-game stint in the major leagues last season, he disappointed the Yankees with his attitude. He groused when he was assigned to Columbus in the spring, and was suspended after he left the clubhouse when ejected from a game. But there was sympathy for Rivera today.
"In his mind, right now, his career is in jeopardy," Torre said. "We'll do everything to keep his spirits up. I told him I'd make a trade with him. I told him I'd take his age and his sore arm and he could have my age. He wouldn't take the trade."
While acknowledging that there is concern any time a player has surgery, Torre stressed that Dr. Hershon feels Rivera should return and that his career is not in jeopardy. The manager mentioned how Rivera could heal in time to help New York in another march to the post-season.
But Rivera's forlorn expression indicated he could not think so positively today.
"He's an emotional guy, and whatever emotion it is, it's full bore," Torre said. "Whether it's elation or deflation. He's down because he has a physical problem. All he wants to do is play baseball, and he's not going to be able to do that for a while."
 
INSIDE PITCH
With the fate of HIDEKI IRABU, the Japanese pitcher, still unresolved, General Manager BOB WATSON said he was unaware of plans for the Yankees to try to acquire the right-hander if the executive council awards his rights to the San Diego Padres, as expected, at a meeting in Chicago Thursday. "I'm not in the loop on it," Watson said. . . . Although WILLIE BANKS was cuffed for three hits and one earned run in two innings in an intrasquad game Wednesday, Manager JOE TORRE lauded his velocity and his off-speed pitches. . . . Outfielder PAUL O'NEILL tested his strained left hamstring by playing five innings and going 1 for 2. . . . Catcher JOE GIRARDI worked out after missing two days with migraine headaches and said he should be able to play in the spring opener against St. Louis Friday. . . . DAVID CONE, on being designated the opening day starter in Seattle, "So I get RANDY JOHNSON, huh?"

HEADLINE: GREENSPAN WARNS AGAIN THAT STOCKS MAY BE TOO HIGH

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, bluntly warned investors today that stock prices might be unsustainably high. And he suggested that despite the economy's basic health, the time might be drawing near when the central bank would have to raise interest rates to head off inflation.
In his most extensive public statement to date about the risks from the rapid run-up in stock prices, Mr. Greenspan said it was not surprising given the nation's general prosperity in recent years that people had grown complacent about the economic and investment outlook. Against such a backdrop, he said, many people seem to believe that businesses and financial markets have entered a new era of low risk. 
 "But, regrettably, history is strewn with visions of such 'new eras' that in the end have proven to be a mirage," Mr. Greenspan said. "In short, history counsels caution. Such caution seems especially warranted with regard to the sharp rise in equity prices during the past two years. These gains have obviously raised questions of sustainability."
Mr. Greenspan's remarks, made to the Senate Banking Committee in his twice-a-year testimony to Congress on monetary policy, helped send the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 122 points at one point, although prices rebounded substantially by the end of the day. The Dow closed at 6,983.15, down 55.03 points. Bond prices also fell sharply, pushing interest rates higher as traders reacted to the possibility of a more restrictive monetary policy. [News analysis, page D1.]
Mr. Greenspan also rattled the markets by reminding investors that to maintain stable growth the Federal Reserve must sometimes raise interest rates before any clear signs of accelerating inflation show up in the economy.
The Federal Reserve last changed interest rate policy 13 months ago, when it trimmed the most important official rate, the Federal funds target rate, by a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent. Since then, the economy, now completing its sixth year of expansion, has continued to advance but inflation has remained quiescent.
Economists said that there was still no clear case for the Fed to raise rates at its next policy-making meeting on March 25 but that a rate increase later this year remained a strong possibility.
Several analysts concluded that Mr. Greenspan was preparing the markets for an interest rate increase in coming months and was going out of his way to take some steam out of the stock market now so that any rate increase would not cause the market to plunge when it comes.
"Either Greenspan would have had to capitulate to the new paradigm view that inflation was dead, " said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley, "or he would have to do the noble thing that every disciplined central banker does in the latter stages of a business cycle expansion, which is to pave the way for a monetary policy tightening.
"He opted to demonstrate that the Fed is very much alive and disciplined as a central bank, and he set in motion the process that will culminate in a fairly significant monetary policy tightening in 1997. He is fully aware that these are exuberant and highly leveraged financial markets, and that if he moves too quickly the damage could be substantial."
Mr. Greenspan's comments came at a time of widespread debate over whether the huge inflows of new money into the stock market, especially from individuals investing in retirement plans or putting more of their savings in mutual funds, have fundamentally changed the way equities should be valued. Analysts are also wondering how the hordes of relatively inexperienced investors will respond if the long bull market suddenly turns down sharply.
Other economists are less certain than Mr. Roach that the Fed will raise rates anytime soon. Indeed, the division of opinion among economists reflects the paradox for policy makers that Mr. Greenspan detailed in his testimony today: There are early warning signs of rising inflation, particularly increasing wage rates, beginning to flash yellow, but almost no signs of inflation itself and the economy seems to be settling once again into a period of modest growth that should allow price pressures to subside.
The core inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.6 percent last year, less than the 3 percent rate of 1995.
As a result, Mr. Greenspan said, the Fed has "taken care not to act prematurely" by raising interest rates and potentially choking off growth as well as inflation.
"Given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, however, we cannot rule out a situation in which a pre-emptive policy tightening may become appropriate before any actual sign of higher inflation becomes evident," he said.
Mr. Greenspan cited several indicators suggesting that one of the primary factors holding down inflation -- the willingness of workers to accept relatively small wage increases because they fear losing their jobs -- might run its course.
Economists generally agree that rising wages are the trigger for rising prices of goods and services as employers try to pass on their increased labor costs. But although the unemployment rate, which was 5.4 percent in January, is well below the level at which wages have tended to accelerate in the past, there has been only a relatively small increase in wages and few signs that those are spurring higher prices.
While some surveys show that large numbers of workers still fear losing their job, Mr. Greenspan said, other figures indicated that last month workers were somewhat more willing to quit their jobs to seek another than they had been.
Combined with continued strong levels of job creation, Mr. Greenspan said, the statistics raised "questions about whether the transitional period of unusually slow wage gains may be drawing to a close."
Mr. Greenspan has twice before raised public concerns about the stock market, first in early December when he questioned whether asset prices were being driven by "irrational exuberance," and then in a brief discussion in Congressional testimony last month when he characterized the market's rise as "breathtaking."
After his remarks in December, the stock market fell briefly but then continued its upward march. His comments last month had almost no effect on the market.
In his remarks today, Mr. Greenspan made no effort to hide behind the dense reasoning and obtuse language he often employs. Indeed, he analyzed stock valuations so directly that he often sounded more like an investment adviser than the head of the world's most powerful central bank. Mr. Greenspan said he believed the market was being propelled upward largely in response to expectations for rising corporate earnings. Even small changes in those expectations, he said, "could have outsized impacts on equity prices."
Mr. Greenspan also said that the perhaps lower-than-justified risk premiums attached to stocks relative to safer investments suggested that investors might have "unrealistically" optimistic views.
"It is not that we have a firm view that equity prices are necessarily excessive right now or risk spreads patently too low," Mr. Greenspan said. Rather, he added, the Fed "has to be sensitive to indications of even slowly building imbalances, whatever their source, that by fostering the emergence of inflation pressures would ultimately threaten healthy economic expansion."

Jewish Housing Approved For East Jerusalem
The Israeli Government approved the development of a Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem, drawing Arab and international complaints. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu portrayed the decision as a way to ease a housing shortage. The Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, made no immediate statement, but other Palestinian leaders warned of potential violence should Israel go ahead with the project. A1
 
French Blast European Body
The European Parliament, which meets in France, drew the rage of French officials when it criticized a French bill to crack down on illegal immigration. The Parliament, which has no power to legislate on immigration, called for the bill's withdrawal on the ground that it would require denunciations like the French were asked to make against Jews during the Nazi occupation. The bill was passed after the offending provision was eliminated. A4
 
Swiss to Share Control of Fund
The Swiss Government agreed, after 18 months of talks, to share control of a Holocaust memorial fund with leading Jewish groups. The bulk of the fund would be distributed to Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe. The agreement, effective on March 1, follows months of pressure on the Swiss to accept responsibility for their policies during World War II. A5
 
Rwanda Court Chief Dismissed
The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, dismissed the chief administrator and deputy prosecutor at the Rwanda war crimes tribunal, responding to criticism of mismanagement there. Mr. Annan named Agwu Okali of Nigeria as the new chief. A6
 
Kenya Students Protest Deaths
For the fourth straight day, thousands of students marched through Nairobi, calling for an investigation into the mysterious death of a student leader, Solomon Muruli. He was the fourth student leader to be killed in the last three months. The police department has appointed a panel to look into the killings. A6
 
Koreans Divided on Apology
South Korea's President, Kim Young Sam, appeared to have won sympathy from the public by apologizing for a scandal that has engulfed his administration. A telephone poll showed that 49 percent of the public thought his apology was sincere, but only 30.5 percent said it would help resolve the scandal. Mr. Kim's next step is a shakeup of the Cabinet and the governing New Korea Party. A10
 
Saudis in Washington For Talks
The Saudi Defense Minister, Prince Sultan, in Washington for talks with American officials, insisted that his Government was making progress in the investigation of a bombing that killed 19 Americans, but did not elaborate. He and his American counterpart, William S. Cohen, also discussed improved security for United States military personnel in Saudi Arabia. (Reuters)

Clinton Again Defends Fund-Raising Practices
President Clinton said newly released White House documents detailing his intimate involvement in soliciting money raised no "legal issue." He said that no contributor had been asked for money at the White House and that it was "entirely appropriate" to invite major donors for overnight stays there. A1
 
. . . as Does a Former Aide
Harold M. Ickes, the former deputy White House chief of staff, defended the Administration's fund-raising practices but acknowledged missteps of his own. They included, he said, inadequate vetting of some contributors and White House visitors. But he said the White House, in its fund-raising practices, had been operating within a "decades-old" system. B9
 
Torricelli Imperils Budget Drive
Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a freshman Democrat from New Jersey, crushed Republicans' hopes for passing a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution by declaring his opposition. Without him, the measure will fall one vote short of passage, barring a change of heart by some other senator. A1
 
Inquiry Ordered in Iraq Case
President Clinton ordered an investigation into whether, as Defense Department documents indicate, American soldiers who blew up an Iraqi ammunition depot in 1991 were not told about indications that chemical weapons had been stored there. Veterans groups and members of Congress have charged that the documents prove that the Pentagon and the C.I.A. tried to cover up evidence of chemical exposures during and after the gulf war; the agencies have denied it. A1
 
Immigration Service Criticized
The inspector general of the Justice Department said that a $2.2 billion project to automate work at the Immigration and Naturalization Service was in deep trouble and that the agency had serious problems. His comments were made to the House panel that controls the agency's financing. Some of the panel's members said they were worried about pouring billions of dollars down a sinkhole. A18
 
Drug Labels May Be Simplified
The Government proposed simplifying the labels on over-the-counter drugs like pain relievers and cough syrups and making the type larger. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, said the new labels would help buyers "choose the right medication and avoid harmful mistakes." A18
 
Dispute on Abortion Procedure
Advocates of abortion rights disputed a statement by the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, who said he had lied about the number of procedures of a particular form of late-term abortion. The advocates said that the issue was larger than one leader and that other groups felt their statements were truthful. A21

Serious crime in the cities and suburbs surrounding New York City has fallen to its lowest level since at least 1980, an analysis of data for the last 16 years shows. But the rates of violent crime have increased in nine counties. A1
 
Hispanic District Tossed Out
New York's 12th Congressional District, drawn in an awkward shape through three boroughs to form a Hispanic majority, is unconstitutional, a panel of Federal judges ruled. Redrawing it will likely give many other New York City districts new boundaries for the 1998 election. A1
 
Bad News on City's Economy
New York City's economic performance lagged far behind the rest of the nation in 1996, despite higher bonuses on Wall Street and larger crowds of tourists, the city reported. Its study said New York had the highest unemployment rate of the nation's 20 largest urban centers. B1

Mr. Torricelli's Turnaround

 BODY:
Senator Robert Torricelli of New Jersey swallowed an embarrassing campaign promise yesterday and vowed to vote against the ill-conceived balanced-budget amendment. His no vote will effectively bury the amendment for the foreseeable future. Had Mr. Torricelli decided to vote yes, the amendment would probably have carried the Senate and moved on to a closely divided House.
Mr. Torricelli based his opposition on the Senate's refusal to adopt necessary changes. He sought wording so that the amendment would not compel Congress to tighten fiscal policy at the worst possible moment -- when the economy is already heading down and tax revenues are falling off. He also wanted the amendment to protect the ability of Congress to borrow money to pay for long-term investments, such as mass-transit systems and higher education programs. These criticisms are apt. The Senator might have added that the amendment would create constitutional problems by leaving unspecified who would enforce its provisions -- perhaps leaving it up to the courts or the President to unilaterally make budget decisions during years in which deficits loom. 
 But these same criticisms applied with equal force to the amendment that Mr. Torricelli voted for as a member of the House and on whose behalf he campaigned last year for the Senate. Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana also campaigned last year in support of the balanced-budget amendment. She too knows its pitfalls. But this week Ms. Landrieu decided to honor her campaign pledge and vote for the amendment. Fortunately, Mr. Torricelli made the better choice, even if it costs him years of making amends to his constituents.

HEADLINE: Workfare Is a Job With Rights Like Any Other

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Don't Unionize Workfare" (editorial, Feb. 21) makes some compelling points regarding the importance of enforcing humane conditions in workfare jobs, but is too glib on the issue of displacement. 
 Unionized workers, and for that matter all workers in the lower-paid sectors, should be wary of the impact of welfare reform on their jobs and wages. They risk being implicitly forced to subsidize the new program through lowering their own labor-market prospects because of the low-paid competition from workfare participants. In this regard, the strategy of the unions -- to organize their potential competitors -- makes sense.

HEADLINE: Birth of a Salesman;
New Directors at Regional Theaters Find Scrounging for Money Is Part of the Job

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
When Douglas C. Wager announced in November that he would step down in 1998 as artistic director of the Arena Stage in Washington, he left its board of trustees on unfamiliar ground. Never before in its 47-year history has the Arena, one of the nation's first regional theaters, had to look outside its own family for a leader.
Mr. Wager, who in 1991 had succeeded the theater's founding artistic director, Zelda Fichandler, has worked at the Arena in one job or another since 1974. The board hadn't a clue where to look. 
 Mr. Wager, who is leaving at the end of next season, said the job of running a theater had become too complicated for him to handle along with his own work.
"These days, there is no road map," said Mr. Wager, 47, who recently directed the Arena production of Tom Stoppard's "Arcadia." "I would pick me for the position if I didn't want to spend so much time in the rehearsal room."
The unsettled situation at the Arena might well serve as an emblem for the whole of the American regional theater movement, which, in half a century of development, has grown out of being a novelty and into having the headaches of a mature industry.
It was in 1965 that the National Endowment for the Arts came into being, spurring the greatest period of growth in regional theater. But now Government financing is on the wane and audiences have been fragmented. Even as many theaters are cutting staffs and scaling back their productions, according to a 1995 survey of 215 nonprofit theaters, 98 were operating at a deficit.
Consequently, nonprofit theaters are facing an era in which their creativity in financial management and marketing must equal their creativity in stage presentations if they hope to prosper. More often than not, these new burdens fall most heavily on the artistic director.
And indeed, nearly four months after Mr. Wager's announcement, the Arena board still is not sure what to look for in a replacement. Another working theatrical director, who might suffer, like Mr. Wager, from divided loyalty? A celebrity -- like Placido Domingo, who heads the nearby Washington Opera -- whose acclaim might attract both theatrical talent and donations, but whose schedule would keep him away from home much of the time? An impresario, like Andre Bishop at Lincoln Center Theater, or someone with a business background, like Todd Haimes at the Roundabout Theater? Or perhaps a new model, like the one decided on by the Portland Stage Company in Maine, which last June hired Christopher Akerlind, a lighting designer, and Anita Stewart, a scenic designer and costumer, as dual artistic heads?
"We're still in the discovery process," admitted Steven Bralove, an investment adviser who has been the Arena's board chairman since last June. "The first thing we had to ask ourselves was, what are the values we hold dear? What qualities do we want? One thing we know is that whoever we choose, there will be things he or she can't do, or won't like to do."
"Nobody," he added, "will be perfect."
At the Arena or anywhere else, no small part of the problem confronting regional theaters throughout the country is that the founding visionaries are largely gone. With the exception of Gordon Davidson, who in 1967 became the first, and is still the only, artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, the pioneers from its first quarter-century -- Margo Jones in Dallas, Ms. Fichandler in Washington, Joseph Papp at the New York Shakespeare Festival, Tyrone Guthrie in Minneapolis, Theodore Mann at Circle in the Square in New York -- have all given way to second-generation or, in some cases, even third- and fourth-generation leaders, who are no longer selling a brand-new idea. Their task -- keeping audiences and contributors happy -- requires a different, more pragmatic brand of salesmanship.
"The job has changed, and I have to say it isn't as much fun," Mr. Davidson said.
All arts organizations face similar problems, but the departure of so many founders has complicated the task facing regional theaters. "These days, we have to be administrators and evangelists," said Joe Dowling, former director of the Abbey Theater in Dublin, who took over the artistic directorship of the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis in 1995. "Forty percent of my time is spent talking to community groups. And as funding becomes harder and harder to find, the artistic director has to articulate a vision, well, more articulately. Funding follows vision more than anything."
In the last two years, such established institutions as the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago, the Guthrie in Minneapolis, the Long Wharf in New Haven, the Seattle Repertory Theater, the Berkeley Repertory Theater and the La Jolla Playhouse have all had to replace their artistic heads, many of them of long standing. Last month, Peggy Shannon, for three years the artistic director of A Contemporary Theater in Seattle, announced that she would not renew her contract, which expires in March.
 
Less Elbow Room In the Director's Job
"This really is the most challenging moment for any institution," said John Sullivan, executive director of the Theater Communications Group, a trade association representing more than 300 nonprofit theaters. "And as an industry we are new at it."
Traditionally, the artistic director's responsibilities have involved scheduling a season, hiring directors, casting productions, serving as dramaturge and generally overseeing a theater's artistic output. The job often has elbow room in it, and artistic directors (still directors themselves more often than not) frequently take charge of individual productions, further putting their stamp on the theaters.
In recent years, however, the artistic director's portfolio has increasingly included participation in fund-raising, budget balancing, community relations, educational outreach, advertising and marketing oversight and public speaking.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for theaters to say to artistic directors: 'Just do your work,' " said Gregory Kandel, a partner in Management Consultants for the Arts, a headhunting firm in Cos Cob, Conn., which has conducted 24 searches for artistic directors for nonprofit theaters since 1983 and is now working with the Arena.
"So what's happening is that artists are wondering, 'Is running an institution the best way to do my work?' " Mr. Kandel said. "At the same time, trustees are asking the same question from their end: 'Are we making them miserable?' "
Indeed, Mr. Wager at the Arena is not the only one who is leaving to look after his own artistry. So is Arvin Brown, who is leaving the Long Wharf after three decades to start a new career in television.
After a decade at the Guthrie, Garland Wright is now a full-time director, and Daniel Sullivan, who at the moment is in New York to direct "Psychopathia Sexualis," by John Patrick Shanley, at the Manhattan Theater Club and "An American Daughter," by Wendy Wasserstein, at Lincoln Center Theater, is leaving the Seattle Rep after 17 years simply because, he said, "I've just become generally weary of it."
Mr. Wager's experience at the Arena affords a closer look at the current state of affairs in the nonprofit theater. By the time he ascended to the artistic directorship in 1991, the Arena had long ceased to be the renegade place it once was; rather, it had ascended to the status of old fogy, with a middle-class, middle-aged constituency, high professional standards and substantial ticket prices. Alone in its first two decades in the capital as a place for original, professional theater productions, it had, by the 90's, a dozen competitors.
 
Making Up Deficits As Donations Drop
Since Mr. Wager took over, the budget of the theater has remained relatively constant, between $8.7 million and $9.7 million. But foundation contributions have been halved, and government contributions cut by two-thirds. One of the Arena's gradually diminishing assets has been its acting company, once a pride and joy, which in the mid-70's had as many as 20 performers and in the mid-80's was able to hang on because of a special Arts Endowment fund. This season there is only one performer on a full-time contract.
Of course, production costs have continued to rise, and subscriptions are down, requiring more aggressive marketing and more specific programming to make up the deficit in single-ticket sales.
The Arena now offers make-your-own subscription packages of as few as three productions. Each show is individually marketed, and many shows are produced with a target audience within the local population in mind. Ten of the last 40 productions at the Arena, Mr. Wager said, "were chosen to be of interest to the black community."
Mr. Wager was adamant about not cutting back on the number of productions, which have remained at eight or nine a season, but he had to cut back on their size: in the theater's 40th-anniversary season, 1990-91, there were 120 roles for actors in Arena productions. This season there are 70. Those kinds of numbers make a difference in programming. "Voir Dire," a drama opening at the Arena next month, takes place in a jury room with a cast of just six jurors. (It involves a civil trial.)
"We couldn't afford a criminal case," said Stephen Richard, the Arena's executive director. He was joking, but the point is well taken; the size of a production has much to do with whether the theater will stage it.
In addition, more than half of the Arena's shows this year are co-productions of some kind; that is, the shows are being put together or underwritten in cooperation with other nonprofit theaters.
"Ten years ago, artists were not interested in sharing," Mr. Wager said. "Co-production was a word never uttered in the room." Now, though, he speaks enthusiastically of projects like the Arena's co-production of "Sunday in the Park With George" this spring with a much smaller group in suburban Virginia, the Signature Theater, as an indication that the future is not so bleak after all.
 
Necessity, Mother Of Artistic Initiative
"What was born out of economic necessity has now become an artistic initiative," he said. "You're seizing an opportunity and bringing to your audience something that you alone couldn't do."
At virtually every one of the regional theaters in transition, the fundamental concern is how to take part more fully in the life of the local community. Thirty years ago, when regional theater was new, the reasoning goes, communities hungry for culture saw theaters as welcome additions. Now it is the theaters that are established and the communities that seem new.
"At the beginning you'd kind of operate on the notion of, if you build it they will come," said Mr. Davidson, the elder statesman in Los Angeles. "Now it's a different audience universe."
The priorities cited by boards all over the country are these: how to build new audiences, how to attract younger audiences, how to educate and program for local populations, how to enlist local business support. That holds true from the Seattle Rep, where there are a brand-new $35 million second stage and a national reputation of substance, to the Long Wharf, a once-prominent theater that has lost its luster and has shut down its second stage to save money.
It is a strategy, of course, that spans the cultural spectrum, adopted by orchestras, dance troupes and the like. John Sullivan of the Theater Communications Group refers to this as the next wave in arts management, not nonprofit institution building, but nonprofit culture building, the aim being a national habit of cohesion between local commerce and local art.
 
A Vision That Goes Beyond Finances
"We don't need to be dependent on the marketplace," Mr. Sullivan said. "Just savvy about it."
Interestingly enough, both Sharon Ott and Douglas Hughes, the new artistic directors at the Seattle Rep and the Long Wharf, respectively, are working stage directors. The presidents of both boards said in interviews that they had considered nonartists but had made their selections because in spite of economic exigencies, it is still artistic vision that powers a theater.
Should the Arena take the same path, one interested party will be pleased.
"Money follows where imagination leads," said Zelda Fichandler, who now runs the graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. Long an advocate of training programs for artistic directors, she was asked if circumstances now make it more difficult to run a theater from largely artistic concerns.
"It felt just as hard 40 years ago," she said. "It felt impossible, actually. Anxiety about economic survival and audience growth has to be kept in check. It's like happiness; it's a byproduct."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Suspense-Filled Puzzle Draped in a Dark Mood

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
A sullen young roustabout slumped outside a diner off a desert highway near Las Vegas is approached by a well-dressed older man with bags under his eyes and a poker face who offers to buy him coffee. Suspicious but hungry, the young man, John (John C. Reilly) accepts, and over breakfast, Sydney (Philip Baker Hall), the grimly formal stranger who accosted him, poses a question, "If I were to give you $50, what would you do with it?"
As "Hard Eight" tracks the mentor-protege relationship that Sydney cultivates with a gravity befitting Rod Serling introducing "The Twilight Zone," the movie smells like one of David Mamet's fiendish stories of grifters embroiled in tricky games of cat and mouse. But Paul Thomas Anderson, who wrote and directed the movie, which is his first feature film, has other things on his mind. Sydney's motives aren't revealed until the film is almost over. Let it suffice to say they have to do with guilt and with a warped, grandiose sense of honor. 
 One of the many strengths of this beautifully controlled, slow-moving film is that the revelations come as a complete surprise at the same time that they make psychological sense. Not only that, but Mr. Hall's portrayal of a mysterious father figure whose air of unbreachable solemnity borders on caricature is in keeping with who Sydney turns out to be.
After their coffee klatch, Sydney drives John back to Las Vegas, where he gives him $150 to gamble in an elaborately specific way that enables John to secure himself free hotel accommodations for the night. The story then jumps ahead two years. By now, Sydney and John have become a team of low-rolling gamblers working their way around the Nevada casino circuit, and John idolizes Sydney to the point of trying to dress like him.
In Reno, John has befriended a cocky security guard named Jimmy (Samuel L. Jackson) who is cynical and profane and likes to drink. Although Sydney can't stand his protege's new friend, he swallows his distaste. But Jimmy still senses Sydney's contempt and chafes under it.
John has also fallen in love with Clementine (Gwyneth Paltrow), a cocktail waitress and occasional prostitute with smeary lipstick, chipped nail polish and too much kohl under her eyes. Sydney, whom Clementine deferentially refers to as "the Captain," cautiously supports the relationship. Then, one evening, John, in a panic, summons Sydney to his motel room, where a man he describes as a hostage lies unconscious, copiously bleeding from his head onto a pillow. Clementine sits in one corner, her head in her hands. Instead of walking out on a scene that spells disaster, Sydney, the unflappable problem solver, sets to work cleaning up the situation.
To give away any more of the story would spoil the suspense that "Hard Eight" works so diligently to sustain. This is a film in which every beat of dialogue, every camera angle and every note of slinky background lounge music has been calculated to create a mood of faintly sleazy cool. The story is set during Christmas. And in one scene the sound of a dead-voiced lounge singer groaning "O Little Town of Bethlehem" leaks into the corners of the film, adding just the right note of queasiness and bad faith.
"Hard Eight" is not a movie that wants to make a grand statement. It is really little more than a small resonant mood piece whose hard-bitten characters are difficult to like. But within its self-imposed limitations, it accomplishes most of what it sets out to do. And the acting is wonderfully understated, economical and unsentimental. Mr. Hall's Sydney is a sleek 90's version of an Edward G. Robinson character playing his cards extremely close to the vest without even a hint of vulnerability on his ravaged face.
Mr. Reilly and Ms. Paltrow play impulsive, not-very-bright people who are too buffeted by life to be able to plan ahead or even to think clearly in moments of crisis. But instead of telegraphing their characters' limitations, they allow us to discover them for ourselves. The role of Jimmy is one of Mr. Jackson's scarier characters, and this brilliant actor inhabits all four corners of his jittery, avaricious personality. When he and Sydney finally clash, the movie makes its darkest, cleverest turn into film-noir nightmare.
"Hard Eight" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or guardian). It has profanity and violence.

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology;
Electric-Powered Car Is on Drawing Board

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
One of the most promising technologies to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy in cars and trucks moved a step closer to reality this week as two American auto companies entered into an unusual partnership.
The Chrysler Corporation and Delphi Automotive Systems, the giant parts division of the General Motors Corporation, will collaborate to build a prototype car that would derive its power not from an internal combustion engine, but from fuel cells that produce electricity. 
 The appeal of fuel cells is simple: They are virtually nonpolluting, and, even when gasoline is used as a power source, achieve much better fuel economy than power plants currently in use.
A fuel cell is a device that produces electricity directly from a chemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. The cells are stacked to produce enough electricity to run the electric motors that turn the car's wheels.
Last month, at the North American International Auto Show here, Chrysler displayed a model of the concept design on which it will collaborate with Delphi. Many auto makers are working on fuel-cell technology, but Chrysler's approach is distinctive in that it uses gasoline -- and, potentially, other readily available fuels -- instead of a fuel like hydrogen that is more difficult to acquire and store. Chrysler engineers have devised an on-board fuel processor that converts gasoline to hydrogen, carbon dioxide and water. The fuel cells use this hydrogen to produce the electricity that runs the vehicle.
Chrysler engineers think that by using gasoline to produce hydrogen -- instead of storing hydrogen within the vehicle, as most existing fuel-cell designs have done -- a decade could be shaved off the introduction of fuel cells as a practical power source. Indeed, Chrysler says it could have a fuel-cell car in production by 2010.
"The infrastructure for gasoline already exists, and consumers would still fuel their cars in the same way as they do today," Christopher E. Borroni-Bird, advanced technologies specialist at Chrysler, said. "We wanted to make this as transparent to customers as possible."
Chrysler has been working with Arthur D. Little, an international research consulting firm, in refining the process and developing the operating hardware. Now Delphi has stepped in to join Chrysler in building a running prototype that will test the concept within two years.
If the prototype performs as Chrysler predicts, the fuel-cell car, similar in size to the midsize Dodge Intrepid sedan, could travel 80 miles on a gallon of gas and be virtually emission-free. Borroni-Bird said it would perform as well as conventional gasoline cars, dashing from 0 to 60 miles an hour in less than 7 seconds and traveling up to 400 miles on a tank of gas. The car would operate more quietly, have lower maintenance because of fewer moving parts and could operate at any temperature.
Auto makers with active fuel-cell programs include Mercedes-Benz A.G., General Motors, the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Mazda Motor Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and BMW A.G. Some, including Mercedes and G.M., are working with Ballard Power Systems Inc., a research company in Vancouver, British Columbia, that is trying to commercialize auto fuel cells.
Mercedes, in fact, has demonstrated a second-generation fuel-cell vehicle, a full-size van that carries two stacks of cells in the back and hydrogen canisters on the roof. Engineers at Mercedes's parent company, Daimler-Benz, say their fuel-cell car is 40 percent more efficient than a conventional design, with virtually no emissions. They say the cells could be used to power city buses.
Chrysler engineers cite the high cost of fuel cells, which have been used in spacecraft, as the main drawback. The company estimates that fuel cells are now 10 times too expensive to be practical. But the costs are dropping; they were once considered 1,000 times too costly.
Still, auto makers say this is among the most promising technologies for the future. "Fuel cells have the potential to become the ultimate power source if we can satisfactorily address the challenges," Borroni-Bird said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Platinum and Palladium Rise On Doubts About Supplies

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Platinum and palladium prices jumped yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange on heightened concerns about supplies from Russia. The surge pushed gold and silver prices higher as well.
On other markets, coffee futures retreated from 23-month highs. 
 Since December, Russia has not granted export licenses to ship platinum and palladium, forcing Japanese buyers and other Western nations to seek more of the metal on the open market.
Russia last year produced two-thirds, or 3.8 million ounces, of the world's palladium, which is used in components of electronics, computers and automobiles. It is second in platinum production only to South Africa. That metal is used to make jewelry and is in electronics and automobile catalytic converters.
Negotiations normally scheduled for late December between Russian export officials and the Japanese have not been held and are not likely to begin until mid-March, Dave Esrig, senior economist at the Platinum Guild in New York, said.
"Platinum and palladium supplies are extremely concentrated, basically to one mine in Russia and to South Africa," he said. "This shows that just one disruption in either of those two and you've got a serious problem on your hands."
Yesterday, these concerns were increased by talk that workers at the giant Norilsk mine in Russia might strike in mid-March if they do not receive back pay. The workers will vote tomorrow on whether to strike.
Platinum for April delivery rose $9.60, to $396.30 an ounce, the highest since Sept. 5. The contract has risen by $40 since early February; June palladium jumped $7.20, to $157.45 an ounce.
April gold rose $5, to $361 an ounce; May silver rose $4.70, to $5.30 an ounce.
Coffee prices retreated from 23-month highs on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York after Colombia's coffee-growing federation reaffirmed the nation would harvest 10.5 million bags of quality coffee this year.
That contradicted an earlier report that the production estimate had fallen to 8.3 million bags. Each bag weighs 132 pounds.
The May coffee contract fell 1.75 cents, to $1.71 a pound.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops to Lowest Point In Four Weeks Against Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell to a four-week low against the yen yesterday on growing expectations that Japanese companies and investors would sell dollars to bring yen home before March 31, the end of the fiscal year.
"You've got repatriation of yen going on, and short-term speculators are trying to jump on the trend and sell dollars ahead of the Japanese," said Russ LaScala, manager of currency trading at Citibank. 
 The rebound of Japan's stock market, and particularly bank stocks, is also helping the yen as foreign investors buy the currency to acquire Japanese shares. The Nikkei index of 225 leading Japanese stocks has gained almost 10 percent since dropping to a 17-month low on Jan. 10.
Declines in United States stock and bond markets also hurt the dollar yesterday, traders said. Global investors who sell American securities frequently convert the dollar proceeds into other currencies.
In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at 120.69 Japanese yen, down from 122.13 yen on Wednesday its lowest level since late January. The dollar slipped to 1.6875 German marks from 1.6902 marks.
The British pound fell amid expectations the opposition Labor Party would win a special election today to fill a Parliament seat, which could lead to a vote of confidence against the ruling Conservative Party. The pound fell to $1.6258 from $1.6343.
The Mexican peso fell sharply yesterday after the Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, warned that any move by the United States to decertify Mexico as an ally in the war on drugs could damage the economy.
In addition, anticipation of higher interest rates in the United States has raised concerns about money being drawn out of Mexican markets. The peso fell to 12.5786 cents, from 12.8320 cents on Wednesday.
The prospect of higher rates in the United States is expected to bolster the dollar, traders said, especially after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned on Wednesday that the Fed might raise interest rates soon.
"There is a strong case for U.S. rates to be tightened, while foreign rates remain low," said Bill Sterling, global investment strategist at BEA Associates. "Interest rate differentials could be supportive to the dollar for some time."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Says HUD Needs Added $5.6 Billion for Subsidies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo told a House subcommittee today that the agency needed an additional $5.6 billion in 1998 to avert the "greatest crisis HUD has ever faced," the possibility that millions of people would become homeless if they lost their housing subsidies.
In his first testimony in Congress since his Senate confirmation hearing this month, Mr. Cuomo said the extra money, which the Administration is seeking in its budget for the next fiscal year, is needed to cover expiring contracts that enable low-income, elderly and disabled people to receive rent subsidies. 
 Without the additional appropriation, he said, more than six million people could lose housing by 2002, and many more would have to to seek inferior accommodations.
"This is not an inside-the-Beltway story," Mr. Cuomo told the Human Resources Subcommittee of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. "This affects every city across the country."
Although Mr. Cuomo's plea fell on generally sympathetic ears of lawmakers from both parties, the matter of increasing the agency's overall budget 30 percent, a huge leap at a time when most lawmakers favor reductions to balance the Federal budget by 2002, will be taken up this year by the House Budget Committee.
Nonetheless, Mr. Cuomo laid out a somber, if hypothetical, picture of the country without a program that makes millions of housing units available to people on the lowest rungs of the economic ladder.
The program in question, commonly known as Section 8, provides individuals, landlords and public housing authorities with vouchers for reduced monthly rents, none of which can exceed 30 percent of a family's monthly income. Some vouchers are valid for specific buildings. With others, renters can choose where they live.
The Federal Government now has Section 8 contracts in effect through 2002 that cover 6.4 million adults and children who are living in 2.7 million rental units. Congress appropriated $3.6 billion for the program last year.
But, Mr. Cuomo said, with nearly two million contracts that expire in the 1998 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, 4.4 million people could be made homeless over the next year if Congress failed to appropriate the additional request.
Throughout his testimony and in answering questions, Mr. Cuomo, son of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, emphasized that the problem would affect cities of all sizes. But the data he gave lawmakers showed that New York City would suffer worst of all, with 133,785 people who live in 55,453 subsidized units in jeopardy of losing their housing if the appropriation is not approved.
Mr. Cuomo said if Congress forced HUD to cover the contracts with its existing $19.2 billion budget, most of its major programs, including Section 8 and grants to spur economic development in urban areas, would suffer cuts of 35 percent.
In leading a hearing that lacked any partisan tension, the chairman of the subcommittee, Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, praised Mr. Cuomo for calling attention to a potentially dangerous problem. Later, Mr. Shays told reporters that even by using a worst-case scenario, Mr. Cuomo was not necessarily playing the role of an alarmist.
"Not at all," Mr. Shays said. "I believe this is the worst crisis the agency has faced, and over the years, both parties, as well as the House and the Senate and Congress and the White House have been putting this problem off. There are no good guys here."
Those sentiments aside, Mr. Shays pressed Mr. Cuomo to explain how he planned to manage an agency that was racked by corruption and scandal in the Reagan Administration and described as "high risk" in a General Accounting Office study in 1994 for programs fraught with waste, fraud and abuse.
"Clearly," Mr. Shays said, "this is a massive undertaking."
Mr. Cuomo responded by telling the lawmakers that the agency was in the midst of vast reductions in personnel, now operating with 10,000 employees, 3,000 fewer than when President Clinton was elected in 1992. Mr. Cuomo said the goal was to reach 7,500, with a majority of the cuts in Washington, rather than field offices.
He also said the agency was trying to shift power to give more decision-making responsibilities to "high-performance" local housing agencies, those that operate efficiently without constant vigilance from Washington.
"I'd like to see more devolution," he said. "Then we can deal with the handful that really require attention."

Bonds Extend Losses to 4th Day on Fear of Rate Increase

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bonds extended their losing streak to four consecutive days yesterday as a stronger-than-expected report on orders for durable goods in January intensified investors' concerns that the Federal Reserve would push up interest rates.
Bond prices skidded on Wednesday after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said in Senate testimony, "We cannot rule out a situation in which a pre-emptive policy tightening may become appropriate" to head off inflation. The trend continued yesterday, with the 30-year bond falling 10/32 , to a price of 97 25/32 , pushing the yield up to 6.80 percent, from 6.77 percent on Wednesday. 
 Durable goods orders rose 3.6 percent in January, reversing declines of 1.8 percent in December and 1.7 percent in November and returning orders to around their October level.
A more reassuring outlook came from the Apics Business outlook survey. Its index rose to 47.8 in February from 45.9 in January. The report said output and employment rose significantly in February but new orders remained weak, suggesting the economy was not overheating.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the economic statistics released yesterday continued to support the notion of a vibrant and growing economy, but he attributed the market's reaction mainly to investor concern over the Fed chairman's testimony.
"While durable goods orders, and particularly orders for nondefense capital goods, are clearly much healthier than they appeared a month ago," Mr. Fine said, "the fact remains that the growth in orders on a trend basis, while sustainable, seems to be slowing."
Initial jobless claims in the latest week rose more than expected, by 11,000, but it did not change the notion of a somewhat tighter labor market, Mr. Fine said, as the four-week average continued to decline and was at a rather low 313,000.
Today a parade of numbers are lining up for market participants, including January home resales and the February data for the Chicago purchasing managers index and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey. Also, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product will be revised. "But when it comes to G.D.P.," Mr. Fine said, "one thing is certain, despite all the upcoming revisions to the data, economic growth during the fourth quarter of 1996 will still have been strong." The more crucial issue, he says, is the pace of growth at the moment.
Greg Jones, an economist with MMS International, says the feeling among some market participants is that Mr. Greenspan's tough testimony may eventually force the chairman to tighten up just to back up what he said, making the market increasingly cautious.
The Treasury sold $19.25 billion of new one-year bills and $23 billion of 45-day cash management bills. Traders said the one-year auction went well, with the average rate 5.36 percent, only a bit higher than the 5.34 percent last month. Demand for the 45-day bill was decent, with the average rate 5.16 percent.
In the corporate market, Seagate Technology Inc. priced $700 million of debt securities in four parts through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
Rated Baa-3 by Moody's and BBB by Standard & Poor's, the offering, which has various put and call provisions, was divided into $200 million of senior notes due 2004 at a price to yield 7.157 percent, $200 million of senior notes due 2007 at a price to yield 7.37 percent, $200 million of senior debentures due 2037 at a price to yield 7.45 percent and $100 million of debt securities due 2017 at a price to yield 7.85 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of a new one-year bill, which matures on March 5, 1998, and a 45-day cash management bill:

HEADLINE: Wise Warnings to Giddy Investors

 BODY:
That latest warning from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that stock prices might be unsustainably high is rooted in a statistical dilemma. The economy -- jobs, production and income -- has been growing at a steady but unexciting pace. Yet stock prices, which should be tied to the growth of corporate earnings, are soaring to breathtaking levels. The rosy scenario is that investors are betting correctly that earnings growth will rise further, justifying high stock prices. The ominous scenario is that stock prices will prove irrationally high, collapse and drag consumer spending and the economy down with them.
To ward off the bad outcome, Mr. Greenspan gently reminded investors that stock prices fall as well as rise, and that they might want to think twice before pouring more money into stocks. He also reminded them that the Fed will not shrink from raising interest rates -- which will draw money out of stocks -- if it sniffs inflation building up. What Mr. Greenspan wants to avoid is a replay of October 1987, when stocks fell by an astonishing 20 percent in one day, a frightening collapse unlike any other since the great crash of 1929. 
 To be sure, Mr. Greenspan flooded financial markets with cash, which prevented the 1987 Wall Street collapse from spreading to Main Street, except for New York's economy. There is every reason to believe that he could similarly insulate the economy today from a turnaround on Wall Street, but he would prefer not to be tested.
The unanswerable question is whether stock prices are truly out of line. If so, they are probably not wildly high. In the 1970's and 80's investors had to pay about $15 for a share of stock that laid claim to $1 worth of corporate earnings. Today that number has risen above $20. But the number was also about $20 during the early 1960's. Yes, share prices are high, but they are not astronomically high and thus are not poised to take a gigantic nosedive. Besides, the economy that underlies stock prices is remarkably healthy. Unemployment is low, yet inflation remains smothered. Productivity is rising at about its expected pace. The budget deficit is low by international standards, and falling. Monetary policy is rock-steady. The private and Government sectors are in good shape, giving investors reason to be at least mildly optimistic.
There are those on Wall Street who dispute Mr. Greenspan's cautious warnings and contend that the American economy is headed toward unprecedented prosperity. Corporate profits will reach new highs, powered by the painful restructurings of many companies and by a new global reach of American corporations. But like any story that says the future will be unlike the past, the predictions are probably wrong. Corporate earnings have comprised an unchanging portion of the national economy for the past 60 years. Investors are betting that those earnings will now fly higher. That's not impossible, but Mr. Greenspan gently asks investors whether that is a bet they are prepared to lose.

HEADLINE: On Bosnia's Ethnic Fault Lines, It's Still Tense, but World Is Silent

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The local Croatian authorities insist that the two huge pits being dug along the old confrontation line in the center of Mostar will hold the foundations of a theater and a Catholic cathedral.
To their Muslim enemies on the other side of town, they look like the beginnings of fortified bunkers and an attempt by the Croats to seize territory in the desolate no man's land that separates east and west Mostar. 
 The international peacekeepers here say they suspect the Croats are building forts, but they show no inclination to do anything about it.
It used to be that such questions, typical of the dizzying contretemps between ethnic Croats and Muslims in Mostar, preoccupied and concerned the outside world, which invested tens of millions of dollars to unify this divided city of 70,000 people.
But no more. Exhausted and frustrated by the repeated refusal of Serbs, Croats and Muslims to honor the December 1995 peace agreement, the international organizations have begun a silent retreat from Bosnia.
An international peacekeeping force, 30,000 strong, remains in Bosnia, but its commanders insist that the force will leave as planned in the spring of next year.
The European Union, which donated more than $150 million in reconstruction aid, withdrew in disgust in December. The United States, which brokered a federation of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia, has yet to get it to function. And the Spanish peacekeeping force stationed here, which lost 17 soldiers in the Bosnian war, recently received orders from Madrid to avoid violence, senior NATO officials say. Those commanders say Spanish patrols, which have been fired on twice this month, have begun turning away when confronted by groups of armed Croats.
Mostar, a city split down the middle between ethnic Croats and Muslims, has always been one of the country's most visible and dangerous fault lines. But its current crisis, rather than an anomaly, exposes what by general agreement is the failure of the international effort in Bosnia.
The World Bank spent only a third of the $1.8 billion it raised for Bosnia because of repeated failures to institute economic reforms or honor the terms of the peace agreement. And the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was able to raise only a third of the money it solicited for this fiscal year because of what refugee agency officials described as "donor fatigue."
"We have been abandoned," said Ivan Prskalo, the Croatian Mayor of west Mostar. "The European Union rebuilt the infrastructure but didn't give us the money to maintain it. International aid has virtually ceased. Things are beginning to fall apart. We are in crisis. The world needs to come back and finish the job."
But the days when the international community saw this as its job are over. International officials say that, at best, Bosnia will limp along with a tense partition, as in Cyprus, and at worst will plunge again into war.
Mostar saw savage fighting in 1994, when Muslims and Croats battled house to house, leaving some 2,000 dead and the city's center a desolate, gutted wreck. Muslims are now bottled up on the eastern bank of the Neretva River, which divides the city; the Croats control the west and access to Croatia and the coast. Nervous Croatian and Muslim troops eye each other along the opposite banks, often just a few hundred yards apart.
The Croatian construction activity along the dividing line speaks volumes about the attitude of confrontation that prevails here. The Croats have filled in the windows in the old high school and several other roofless hulks with cement blocks. But the builders have left narrow gun slits in each bricked-up frame.
Abandoned Muslim homes in the no-man's land west of the river, although already heavily damaged, are flattened in nightly explosions. And in defiance of the outside world, the Croats in west Mostar have renewed a campaign to evict the dwindling and elderly population of some 3,000 Muslims from their sector.
In late November, the Croatian police seized the municipal building, renovated with half a million dollars of European Union money, and have locked out the Muslims who under the federation agreement should share offices with them. West Mostar officials refuse to speak or meet with their Muslim counterparts.
On Feb. 10, Croatian police officers opened fire on a peaceful crowd of Muslims who walked into west Mostar to visit a cemetery during the Muslim holiday of Id al-Fitr. Spanish troops, stationed at the crossroads where the shooting took place, withdrew moments before the firing began and ignored pleas by unarmed United Nations police observers who witnessed the attack to return to restore order, according to an internal International Police Task Force report.
The United Nations police monitors have released a series of color photographs showing Croatian police officials, including west Mostar's deputy police chief, Ivan Hrkac, firing pistols at the fleeing Muslims. But they have been unable to get the Croats to remove the police officers, who killed one man and left more than 20 wounded.
"We interviewed the police officers who fired on the crowd," said the international police commissioner, Robert Wasserman, "and every single one of them lied to us. They told us they were not armed, even though we have photos of them firing on the retreating crowd."
The Bosnian Croat leadership, who defend the police action, say the Muslims were carrying knives and were preparing to "attack Croatian children."
NATO officials say the orders they get from Washington and most European capitals is to maintain the current cease-fire and stay out of disputes that could draw peacekeeping soldiers into a local conflict. This greatly emboldened the defiance of militants on all sides.
"The situation has become ludicrous," said a senior Western official in Mostar. "We are handing out pictures of Croat police shooting women in the back and nothing is done. It illustrates how weak and futile our presence has become. It exposes where not only Mostar but Bosnia and Herzegovina is headed."
The Muslims, who say the shooting is too egregious an act to ignore, warn that it will end their attempts to reach out and build a united city and a workable federation.
"If these Croat police officers are not arrested and charged for firing into an unarmed crowd, it will end any hope of cooperation between us and the Croats," said Dziho Sefkija, east Mostar's police chief. "This, however, is probably their goal."
The Croatian leaders in Mostar, backed by Zagreb and closely linked with organized crime gangs that deal in drugs and prostitution, seem beyond caring what the outside world wants or thinks.
The sprawling aluminum factory five miles outside the city, set to begin operation next month after being closed for five years, is perhaps the most visible symbol of why the Croats have no desire to link themselves with the rest of Bosnia and will protect their de facto integration with neighboring Croatia.
The $650 million plant, which was hooked up this week to the Croatian electrical grid, should be the property of the federation government. Instead, it looks set to become the property of the local Croatian political leadership.
Miro Brajkovic, who was director of the plant before the war and is one of the highest-ranking politicians in west Mostar, dismissed the protests by the Muslims that under the federation agreement they should also share in the ownership of what was once a Yugoslav government plant that employed 5,000 workers.
"The Muslims have their own factories," he said. "This is ours. I have seen these reports by the international police and others about our police, about our city. We are tired of the international community always taking the side of the Muslims. If there is another war here it will be the fault of all these international groups."
For those caught in the middle of the fracas there is little hope that much in their lives will be impartial or fair. In the last year more than 80 Muslim families have been driven from their homes and apartments, often by uniformed Croat police or military, who then swiftly sell the apartments to friends. The suffering of those driven from their homes is a small reminder of the widespread terror that gripped this city during war and could, with just a spark, grip it again.
Sadeta Rebac, a 64-year-old invalid, sat wrapped in a blanket in her sister's tiny apartment in east Mostar. She was dragged by her arms from her apartment in west Mostar a few weeks ago by three young Croats in military uniform. They dumped Mrs. Rebac, a widow, with her crutches on the dividing line and left her to find her way at night, with none of her belongings, into the eastern part of the city.
"I hear from neighbors that my apartment, where I lived for 20 years, was sold by these men to a Croat soldier for $3,000," she said. "He and his family live there now. The rest of my life will be spent here."

HEADLINE: Big Rebound For Durables; Gain is 3.6%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Orders to factories in the United States for big-ticket goods rebounded in January, rising a larger-than-expected 3.6 percent and setting the stage for continued economic growth.
The data, released by the Commerce Department today, could increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool the economy. The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, warned on Wednesday that a monetary tightening might be necessary as a pre-emptive strike against inflation. 
 Still, economists cautioned against making too much of one month of data for durable goods, as the big-ticket items are known. Also, the Labor Department said in a separate report today that the number of American workers applying for state unemployment benefits rose last week for the first time in more than a month.
The increase in durable-goods orders was the first in three months and was led by orders for electronic and electrical equipment, which had fallen in the previous two months. Orders also increased for primary metals, motor vehicles and parts, and aircraft.
The 3.6 percent increase over all was well above analysts' forecasts for a gain of 1.2 percent. December's decline was revised to 1.8 percent from 1.9 percent.
Excluding the often-volatile category of orders for transportation equipment, January's durable-goods orders rose 4.4 percent, the largest gain in two years. Excluding military hardware, orders increased 5 percent, the largest advance in almost four years.
 "The economy is doing well -- it's bordering on very well," said Kenneth Mayland, chief economist at Keycorp in Cleveland.
The strength of the January data and the implications for higher interest rates extended the losing streak of bonds to four consecutive days. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 6.80 percent from 6.77 percent on Wednesday.
The reason economists say that a month's worth of data should be viewed with caution is that orders for durable goods tend to be volatile from one month to the next because of the erratic pattern of orders for commercial jetliners and military weaponry.
January's report also showed that unfilled orders, a gauge of pent-up demand, increased eight-tenths of 1 percent after having been unchanged in December. Shipments of goods, a gauge of current demand, rose 1.2 percent after having declined 1.9 percent in December.
The report about first-time jobless claims showed that claims unexpectedly increased by 11,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 316,000. In the prior week, claims had fallen by 3,000 -- a revision from the increase of 1,000 reported originally -- to 305,000, the lowest level in seven months.
The four-week average for jobless claims, which smooths out the volatile weekly data, fell to 313,250 last week from 317,250 the previous week.
A three-week strike at two Johnson Controls Inc. auto-seating factories could have contributed to last week's increase, analysts said. The walkout caused the Ford Motor Company to run out of seats and halt production of some of its hottest-selling models. United Automobile Workers union members have ratified a new contract and are now back at work.
Looking ahead, "Job growth is still going to be pretty robust," said Joe Carson, an economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York. "Companies are stepping up hiring, and the claims numbers tell us the unemployment rate is likely to fall back to about 5.2 percent this month." The unemployment rate for February will be issued next week.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Dancing the Balanced-Budget Waltz

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
In 1986, a proposed constitutional amendment to balance the budget fell one vote short in the Senate. The House rejected it by seven votes in 1990 and nine votes in 1992. In 1994, it lost by four votes in the Senate and 12 in the House. The measure fell one vote shy in the Senate in 1995, and last year it lost there by three votes.
Now Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a freshman Democrat from New Jersey, has said that after searching his soul, he has decided to cast the decisive vote this year against the balanced-budget amendment. His decision, announced on Wednesday, left proponents of the amendment with 66 supporters, one fewer than the necessary two-thirds majority of the Senate. 
 The pattern has been essentially the same each year. Lawmakers say during their campaigns that they favor a balanced-budget amendment. Republicans put it at the top of their legislative agenda. Democrats play their Social Security card.
Then the Democratic leader counts noses. If there are votes to spare, lawmakers who would have special political problems if they voted "no" are given what is known as a pass. That is apparently what happened this year with two new Senators, Max Cleland of Georgia and Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana.
And a lawmaker who enjoys the spotlight is designated to cast the deciding vote. Two years ago it was Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota. This year it was Mr. Torricelli.
The Senator acknowledged at his news conference on Wednesday that his position as this year's swing vote was somewhat contrived. "Had I not done this," he said, "I believe there were other votes available."
The word in Democratic circles was that if Mr. Torricelli had decided otherwise, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, who was re-elected last November with 60 percent of the vote and was one of 11 Democrats who had declared support for the amendment, could have been prevailed upon to switch and vote against the measure.
If this sounds like raw politics, it is. Changing the Constitution is a serious matter. Strong arguments on economic grounds can be made for and against the balanced-budget amendment. But as has been the case in the past, the motives and arguments this year were driven largely by politics, not economics.
The starting point was the opinion polls. For more than a decade, when voters have been asked whether they favor a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget, 75 percent to 80 percent have said they do.
That, more than anything else, is why Republicans keep pushing the matter. But for all their talk about the dangers of the rising debt, when it comes time to cast an actual vote the Republicans are much more interested in keeping taxes down than in balancing the budget.
In debating the amendment, Republicans tended to argue that running deficits was irresponsible, bordering on immoral. If states and cities and companies and families were as profligate as the Federal Government, the Republicans maintained, they could not survive.
But of course, states, cities, companies and families do not balance their budgets. State and local governments issue bonds -- in other words, go into debt -- to build their roads and sewers and schools. Companies borrow to purchase machinery and other equipment, and families take out mortgages to buy houses.
The Democrats focus on a different poll question. When voters are asked whether they would prefer balancing the budget or preserving Social Security benefits, only about 25 percent opt for balancing the budget.
So this year the Democrats trotted out once more a preposterous proposition that has worked splendidly for them in the past. They would amend the Constitution, they said, to require a balanced budget, but they would exclude Social Security receipts and expenditures from the calculations.
The Democrats never said, of course, how they would accomplish this feat. Balancing the budget early in the next century would be a daunting task. It would be impossible without counting the large surpluses the Social Security system is running nowadays. But the Democrats' counterattack allowed them to say they favored a balanced budget as long as Social Security was protected.
And it allowed them to make arguments like this one from Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada: "People have paid into a Social Security trust fund for purposes of having the money set aside when they get old. It is no different than when any attorney in the United States takes a client's money and puts it into a fund. They cannot use that money for any purpose other than for the client."
Not quite. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. The money that workers pay in taxes now are used for the retirement benefits of their parents' generation, not their own. Their Social Security benefits will be financed by the taxes their children's generation pays.
The real point about the budget and Social Security was never made by either side. It is this: About 20 years into the next century, when the crest of the baby-boom generation is retired and drawing benefits, the Social Security system will be deeply in the red and the Federal budget will have to run large deficits to meet the pension obligations.
The only way to avoid this will be to raise taxes, cut benefits or both. But those are not steps politicians talk about in 1997.
One side talks only about balancing the budget in the abstract, never saying how the goal would be accomplished. The other side stresses protecting Social Security, never addressing how that would be accomplished, either.

HEADLINE: French Luxury Hotel Planned for West Side of Manhattan

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Accor, the giant French hotelier, plans to build a 27-story, 400-room luxury hotel on the rarest of all commodities in Manhattan, a vacant lot, on West 44th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas.
The company closed yesterday on the purchase of the T-shaped lot where it plans to open an $80 million hotel in early 1999, the first new hotel in the midtown business district since 1993, when the Four Seasons opened on East 57th Street. Accor is working with the developer Alan B. Friedberg on the hotel, which will be part of its four-star Sofitel chain. 
 "We've been looking forever," said John Lehodey, president of Sofitel North America. "We already have seven hotels in the United States. We always wanted one in New York, and we finally got the opportunity."
Accor is hardly the only hotelier looking to jump into the market in New York, where hotels are overflowing with tourists and business travelers. The average occupancy rate in 1996 was 81.8 percent, up from a recessionary 67 percent in 1991 and the highest level since the late 1940's, according to John Fox, a hotel consultant at PKF Consulting.
With few new rooms coming on line for at least the next three years, hoteliers expect rates to rise well ahead of inflation. As a result, there was intense interest in the promising lot on West 44th Street, which sits next to the New York Yacht Club (and near the Algonquin and Royalton Hotels) on 44th Street and the Chemists Club on 45th Street.
"We had a lot of interest from domestic buyers, as well as many Asian and Europeans," said Boaz (Buzz) Shattan, senior investment director at the Greenwich Group, which represented the seller, Diamond Kanko. "In the end, six groups bid. I think it's in recognition that 42d Street and Times Square are going through a huge upgrade."
Accor, which owns or operates 2,500 hotels around the world, including the Sofitel, Novotel and Motel 6 chains, paid $11.5 million for the lot and about 55,000 square feet in development rights from an adjacent property. Diamond Kanko, a Japanese company, bought the site in 1986, paying $19.5 million, but was never able to get a project off the ground. Previous owners had not had much luck either, although they did not lose as much money as Kanko.
Marvin S. Winter, a real estate investor, bought the property in the early 1980's and demolished what was then the Seymour Hotel, an 81-year-old, 12-story brick Beaux Arts-style building in the hopes of building an office tower. Nothing came of it, and eventually Diamond Kanko bought the property, with plans to build a hotel. Instead, the lot sat empty for a decade.

HEADLINE: On Your Mark, Get Set . . . Long Gone;
Counting the Blessings of a Mayor Who Makes Blessings Count

SERIES: OPENING STEPS: This is the third in a series of articles examining the early campaign strategies of individual candidates in the New York City mayoral race.

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
As of this week, the re-election team is finally in place; the headquarters is open; even the Web site is almost ready. With 36 weeks left before the voting, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's professional staff of pollsters and marketing experts is finally assembled and ready to go.
Now they simply have to catch up to the Mayor himself, who has been campaigning for months. 
 Were you one of 200,000 small-business owners who received a packet of city tax forms a few weeks ago? Strictly speaking, it wasn't the stuff of campaign literature. But there on page three, mailed at government expense, is a full-page letter from the city's Finance Commissioner, Alfred C. Cerullo 3d, explaining in detail all the various business taxes the Mayor has cut in order to promote economic growth around the city. The letter sounds very much like the speeches the Mayor regularly gives to business groups.
Do you have auto insurance? Perhaps you saw the televised coverage of the "Task Force on Insurance Rates," an informal group of the Mayor's aides and supporters that met last month to help him try to translate the already popular reductions in crime into something equally popular: lower car insurance rates. The task force may not actually reduce premiums, but it certainly makes it appear as if the Mayor's trying.
These are the uses of incumbency, and they will form the core of the Republican Mayor's drive for a second term in the coming months, one that is already far out in front of his Democratic challengers. Though he says he plans to run as if he is 30 points behind, Mr. Giuliani is actually immensely confident, so much so that he will not be relying on the advice of a paid master strategist as he did with David Garth in 1993. He is running his own race this year, and anyone wondering when he will actually begin his formal campaigning can rest assured: he already has.
Consider the deft way in which he turned the Empire State Building shootings into a diatribe against lax national gun laws, a can't-miss proposition in a pro-gun-control city. Or the speeches he regularly gives praising the industriousness of immigrants in a city built by immigration, including the production number last month on Ellis Island. (Hundreds of real-life immigrants were bused and ferried in from city-run senior centers.)
Or even the huge metal placard announcing this week's Grammy Award ceremony that has been hanging on City Hall for weeks: Mr. Giuliani's name is arguably the most prominent element. This and other signposts might as well be pointing the way toward November.
"His day-to-day actions and reactions, his behavior, the signs of leadership he is displaying is the greatest campaign ad in the world," said Adam Goodman, the Republican media consultant the Mayor hired this week to prepare and place his advertising. "What he's doing now is far more important than any 30-second piece of glitz."
But of course, there will be glitzy ads, millions of dollars' worth, on television, radio, billboards and bumpers, hammering on the Mayor's theme of a renewed, robust city.
Mr. Goodman -- known for gorgeous sunlit images of clients like Wisconsin's Governor, Tommy G. Thompson, and Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate majority leader -- is planning to move his operations from Baltimore and Florida to New York. He will be spending a good deal of time at City Hall, filming the Mayor in the very act of renewing the city on state-of-the-art video equipment. With an adman's hyperbole, he said the only hard part would be selecting which aspects of the Mayor's record to highlight.
"It's not often that you're involved in the kind of assignment where the candidate's record is just so unbelievably positive that the spots almost write themselves," he said, already displaying the enthusiasm of a seasoned member of the Mayor's communications staff.
There will also be a furious registration and get-out-the-vote effort (this time directed by the newly named campaign manager, Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter), perhaps the most crucial element of Mr. Giuliani's 53,581-vote margin of victory in 1993. Much of that came from a high turnout on Staten Island because of a secession vote, an issue that won't be on the ballot this time. Still, the Mayor's strategists believe they can keep much of their base and capture the swing votes of non-Orthodox Jews, centrist women and Hispanic voters, while keeping the unions neutral.
But the most important element of Mr. Giuliani's strategy will be the array of resources that any sitting mayor has at hand, and the former prosecutor, now finishing his first term in elective office, has put to rest any questions about whether he would be the least bit awkward or hesitant about using them. Having stressed that he came from the world of law rather than that of politics, Mr. Giuliani ran a narrowly successful, imperfect race in 1993, and in the meantime has become a far more agile political animal.
"He's becoming a politician, and a masterful one, even though it's everything he said he wasn't going to be," said Dennis M. Walcott, president of the New York Urban League. "He's using everything at his disposal to make himself stronger in the eyes of the voters, and particularly capitalizing on the issues that could hurt him in the long run."
None of this means that the Mayor's re-election chances are assured. His often abrasive personality has put off many voters, and there remain hundreds of thousands of Democrats, particularly in non-white areas, who will vote for anyone but him. In a crisis-driven city, any unpredictable event could produce a fumble that his challengers would seize upon, particularly if it produces a notable display of temper.
But unlike any of his opponents, Mr. Giuliani can summon a cluster of television cameras and newspaper notebooks with a snap of his communication director's fingers, and he has proven particularly adept at the art of constant repetition and overstatement to make a series of broad points about the city, softening up voters for the onslaught to come.
Nathan Leventhal, president of Lincoln Center and chairman of the Citizens Union, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, noted that New York City statistically has not been a major national crime center for 20 or 30 years in comparison to other cities, even before the current drop in crime. But it is only under Mr. Giuliani that people have come to believe that, he said. "He's grown considerably as a politician," said Mr. Leventhal. "His state-of-the-city speech was the most impressive political speech I've ever seen."
It was in that rather showy tour-de-force last month that Mr. Giuliani demonstrated precisely what his Democratic challengers are up against. It wasn't just that he had essentially memorized an 83-minute speech, or the ease he delivered it with, wearing a wireless microphone and strolling confidently around the City Council chamber. It was rather in the blunt-force manner in which he used his executive spending power to come up with multimillion-dollar programs in precisely the areas where he was most vulnerable.
A week after he was blamed by his opponents for three years of falling student reading scores, he proposed "Project Read," a $125-million program to improve reading scores. After Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, made an issue out of cuts to arts programs, the Mayor announced in the speech that he was restoring the programs, at a cost of $75 million. And, after years of complaints from black and Hispanic leaders about excessive force by the police, he promised that the department would act in a more respectful and courteous manner.
This modified Rose Garden strategy is the result of advice from his pollsters and advisers, who are aware that his popularity goes down when he is on the attack. For the most part, the Mayor has tried to stay out of the fray, but all too often his combative nature bursts its restraints in a quick flash of gunplay.
Last week, a day after telling an interviewer that "I've never called names," he referred to Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President and a Democratic mayoral candidate, as "pathetic" and "hysterical." He also called Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, a "far left-wing extremist."
The Democrats pretend to be outraged, but are secretly hoping the Mayor spontaneously combusts one day, preferably on live television.
That seems increasingly unlikely. The Mayor is coating himself in a softer imagery these days, reading to second-graders on Wednesday, appearing at Kwanzaa and Ramadan celebrations. It's been weeks since he called anyone a "creep" on his Friday radio show.
Opponents say this is all poll-driven, as are the spending initiatives, poultices for areas where polls say he is weak. He acknowledged earlier this month, in fact, that polls and focus groups showing that many residents hadn't experienced any drop in crime had prompted him to order the police to focus on property crimes as well as violent offenses.
But his pollster, Frank Luntz, a veteran of several Ross Perot and Republican campaigns, insisted that Mr. Giuliani is not basing policy on his polls. "He is one of the least poll-driven candidates I've ever worked for," Mr. Luntz said. "On a number of issues, like immigration and welfare, he was years into the policy before it showed up on the radar screen of our polling."
The challengers vying for position in the September Democratic primary claim not to be worried.
But one Democrat who decided not to run against the Mayor ruefully admired his skills, recalling that Mr. Giuliani's popular campaign to remove the city's sales tax on clothing even resulted in a full-page ad with the Mayor's picture, paid for by Moe Ginsburg, the men's clothing store.
"You've got to laugh at his effectiveness," said Mark Green, the public advocate. "Yes, he's among the people who want to cut the tax, but who else would wind up in a retailer's ad? One presumes Moe's call will be returned by City Hall."

HEADLINE: Pataki Adds $650 Million To Estimate Of Revenues

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 27

 BODY:
In a clear sign that the coming fight over the state budget will probably be more about increasing spending than cutting programs, Gov. George E. Pataki released figures today showing that Wall Street's continuing boom would produce $650 million more in tax revenues in the coming year than he had first projected just a month ago.
The release of the new estimated tax revenues usually begins the negotiations between the Governor and leaders of the Legislature. The Democratic leaders of the Assembly and Republican leaders of the Senate expect to issue their revenue projections on Monday, but their aides hinted today that their estimates of the added revenues would be two to three times the size of Mr. Pataki's. 
 During Mr. Pataki's first two years in office, the disputes centered on how to restore deep cuts that the Governor had proposed in many popular programs. Both times, negotiations dragged out well past the legal deadline of April 1 for enacting a new budget. And last year, the Legislature set a record for the tardiest state budget in the nation's history on July 13, 104 days late.
But many legislators, particularly Republicans, say they believe that the stronger economy with unanticipated revenues will make it easier to reach a timely budget accord.
Democrats, however, warned that they expected both sides to bring many contentious policy issues, like rent regulations, welfare and criminal justice, into the fiscal negotiations. They said that if that happened, even if talks on spending went smoothly, a final budget might not be enacted for many months.
In releasing his new revenue estimates today, Mr. Pataki proposed using $435 million of the additional $650 million to speed up the first phase of a four-year property-tax cut that is at the heart of his $66 billion budget proposal. Mr. Pataki had originally proposed property tax reductions only for the elderly in the coming year. Under his new plan, most property owners would see at least modest tax savings.

HEADLINE: Gifted Programs' Criteria Vary Widely

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
Selection criteria for gifted programs in New York City vary widely from district to district, with schools and districts starting their programs at different ages and using different methods to test children's abilities.
Some districts rely on I.Q. tests or use them as a first threshold. Children who score the highest or above a certain percentile are considered eligible, although some districts, like District 2 in Manhattan, then use interviews or parent evaluations to make their decisions. 
 In some schools, entry to gifted programs is based on a range of measures, sometimes including intelligence tests and sometimes not.
District 8 in the Bronx uses teacher evaluations through the third grade and standardized tests later. Other schools take into account samples of the child's work, the child's vocabulary, interviews, report cards and, for older children, scores on citywide math and reading tests.
Other schools have set up programs to accommodate a wide range of talents, including artistic ability, leadership skills or a knack for telling a story. In District 18 in Brooklyn, for example, four schools in East Flatbush admit children to their gifted programs based on the observation of kindergarten teachers specially trained to identify different kinds of abilities.
In a recent class in Public School 135, one boy had trouble writing a book report but was considered a gifted storyteller. Another's talent was visual thinking and computer skills. And a girl was described as a natural leader who was sensitive to the moods of people around her.
A district's policy seems to have a strong effect on the composition of its programs. Some districts start their programs in kindergarten, which generally limits access in the later grades. This can skew the composition of those who get in, because in kindergarten, the district is more likely to rely on I.Q. tests, since fewer measures of academic achievement are available.
In fact, many districts, like District 25 in Queens, use I.Q. tests only for kindergarten students, and use other measures in later grades.
Some districts have policies that seem to make it harder for poor children to get in. District 2 in Manhattan and District 26 in Queens, for example, require parents to pay for their child's I.Q. test, which can cost as much as $150.
And while the program in District 18 in East Flatbush is made up almost entirely of black children and children of immigrants, another gifted program in the same district, which uses I.Q. or another intelligence test, is disproportionately white: 38 percent in a district where the population is 8 percent white.
Jean Lebec, who teaches the fourth-grade gifted class at P.S. 135, where children are chosen for varied talents, said many of her students would not only miss out on gifted education, but might also be referred to special education because their strengths could not be measured by traditional academic tests.
Given the widespread acknowledgment among educators in recent decades that I.Q. tests and some standardized tests alone do not adequately measure the intelligence of non native speakers of English and of children whose economic and social circumstances limit their verbal or math skills, why do some districts continue to rely on them as a primary screening instrument?
There are many reasons, education experts say.
"It's convenient, it's cheap, it's easy," said Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor at Teacher's College at Columbia University.
Others cite the lack of other academic measures for very young children and say these tests are valid for some students, just not all.
"I think they're very useful," said James Borland, also a Teachers College professor who is studying ways to identify gifted children. "The problem is, it misses some kids."
Still others say that pressure from parents plays a role.
Jacqueline Ancess, a senior research associate at Columbia's National Center for Restructuring Education Schools and Teaching, said that some middle-class parents, whose children tend to do better on the I.Q. tests and other exams, are often protective of existing programs and may pressure their districts to keep the status quo.
But in recent years, even some districts that have continued to rely on I.Q. tests or other traditional measures that tend to favor middle-class children have tried to take steps to make their gifted programs more diverse.
District 15 in Brooklyn, which uses the I.Q. test and another kind of intelligence test, gives priority to minority children who meet the threshold score on those tests.
In District 26 in Queens, the school board voted to defer the gifted program from kindergarten to first grade, hoping that the later start would give more parents time to learn about the program. And the superintendent, Aaron Friedman, said he is looking to use other measures besides the I.Q. test.
At the same time, there are some districts without programs for gifted students. Officials in District 1 in Manhattan object to them on principle, saying they unfairly separate gifted children. District 31 on Staten Island abandoned its gifted program a few years ago because officials said it was too expensive.
Efforts to give more immigrants and members of minority groups better access to gifted programs is something many cities have been tackling in recent years.
Cities like Detroit, Houston and San Francisco have all begun to use multiple screening methods for children applying to gifted programs.
The Los Angeles Unified School District uses many different measures, including a test for creative ability, a leadership test and nonverbal intelligence tests for non-native speakers of English.
"It's really less and less frequent," said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, "that urban school systems use I.Q. tests alone as an entrance requirement."

HEADLINE: Japanese Computer Giant Goes Where the Talent Is

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: PEARL RIVER, N.Y., Feb. 27

 BODY:
One of the assumptions about the telecommunications revolution is that it will make geography irrelevant and thus threaten population centers like the New York region because people can work anywhere and businesses can be anywhere.
But the opposite was announced here today. Officials at Fujitsu Ltd., one of the world's largest telecommunications and computer companies, said they were opening a $122 million research and development center in this Rockland County community because the New York region is home to the specific niche of telecommunications engineering talent needed by the company. 
 "There was a time when talented people were expected to move to the places where the good companies were located," said Ryoichi Sugioka, chairman and chief executive of Fujitsu Network Communications, the subsidiary that will operate here. "But that time is now past. Now the good companies must have a presence in those areas rich with highly qualified engineers and managers."
Company officials, who plan to hire 250 engineers in the next three years, said that the pervasive, generations-long impact of AT&T and its spinoff companies, clients and customers had created a base of skills in a crucial, if narrow, corner of telecommunications: specifically, how to connect networks with consumers. The telecommunications revolution, meanwhile, in raising the market value of those skills, has given engineers greater options and clout.
The result is a collision of old-fashioned supply and demand and cutting-edge technology. Communications engineers can get jobs anywhere and work anywhere they want, and that meant Fujitsu had to take the jobs to them.
"None of them feel very insecure," said Carl DeWilde, a vice president at the Network Communications unit. "Nobody in this field is desperate for jobs."
The arrival of Fujitsu seems likely to accelerate the bidding for that talent. A quarter of the engineers hired here so far were wooed from Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill, N.J. Mr. DeWilde said that the average salary would be $70,000 a year, and more than that for the core group of about 37 engineers already hired, who will have to get the research center up and running in the months to come.
But the new research center -- mostly empty and stark today, and looking rather hospital-like with its angular ceiling tube system to connect fiber optic cable to the work stations -- also illustrates how fractured and specialized fields like telecommunications have become, and how decades of decisions that kept companies like AT&T wedded to the region can suddenly flower unexpectedly.
The Fujitsu network subsidiary has three other research centers around the country, and each is where it is because a kind of talent grew up there around particular companies: Santa Clara, Calif., for network management because of Silicon Valley; Richardson, Tex., for information movement because of the descendants of a company called Collins Radio that went there in the 1950's, and Raleigh, N.C., for network switching because Northern Telecom established a switching center there years ago.
Mr. DeWilde said the Tokyo-based parent company, which has $36 billion a year in sales, has also encountered some sharp regional divisions in the United States that have further pushed the company toward a policy of decentralizing its research and development. Engineers can often be induced to move from one coast to another, he said, and people in the broad middle belt of America will often move within their area, but convincing a Texan, say, to move to New York or vice versa has become increasingly hard.
In New York, there will be no such difficulties. The Pearl River location is near the center of the local map that the company drew up in making its decision. The map identified every company in the region involved with some aspect of telecommunications network access.
That universe extended from central New Jersey, where AT&T and Lucent are the state's largest private employers, through the Hudson River Valley, which has long been I.B.M. country, and eastward into Connecticut, home of the GTE Corporation. Mr. DeWilde said that, unlike with almost any other location considered, hardly any of its new hires -- from whichever corner of region they come -- will have to move.
But if Fujitsu's arrival illuminates the region's strength in this one industry, it also highlights the political divisions. Company officials said that economics and technology demanded that they come to the region, but New York and New Jersey both competed for the company anyway. The winner, New York, will give Fujitsu about $12.2 million, mostly in tax abatements, over the next three years.

Vienna Philharmonic Agrees to Admit Women
The Vienna Philharmonic orchestra, whose members sometimes attribute its superior sound and style to its maleness, has agreed to admit women players. Facing protests during a tour to the United States, orchestra members, gathering on the eve of their departure, agreed to admit Anna Lelkes, a harpist. A1
 
Bombings in Western China
The capital of Xinjiang province in western China was under a security alert after bombs ripped through three public buses, killing 5 people and wounding 60. The attacks were apparently in response to a crackdown ordered by the Communist Party leadership in Beijing to quiet the restive border region, where the Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic minority, chafe under Chinese rule. A8 

Palestinians Hold Conference
Islamic and leftist Palestinian groups opposed to Yasir Arafat's accords with Israel joined in a "national dialogue" conference headed by Mr. Arafat in the West Bank town of Nablus. The meeting's aim was to plan strategies for negotiations with Israelis and to arrive at an agreed document outlining Palestinian positions on a final peace settlement. A3

Little Reaction to Project
Reactions to the Israeli Government's decision to build Har Homa, a housing development for Jews in East Jerusalem, were muted. Mr. Arafat denounced it as a violation of existing agreements, but urged his followers to avoid disturbances on the eve of his visit to Washington next week. For Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, the respite was brief, as renewed charges of influence-peddling in his government circulated. A3
 
Divorce Now Legal in Ireland
Ireland became the last country in the European Union to permit divorce. A law went into effect permitting people in broken marriages to divorce and remarry. Those seeking divorce may find that their cases overwhelm an already backlogged court system. A5
 
Kremlin Drinkers Ousted
After a party in the Kremlin got drunkenly out of hand, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's personal photographer and several senior members of the security service were dismissed. The fact that the revelers were all cronies of Mr. Yeltsin's ousted aide, Aleksandr V. Korzhakov, seemed the more plausible offense. A10
 
Iraq's Medical System Reeling
Iraq's health care system has all but collapsed, the World Health Organization said, leaving an acute shortage of the most basic medicines and supplies. Electricity blackouts have ruined supplies of polio vaccine, which must be refrigerated, and diseases that had been virtually eradicated are reemerging in Iraq, the agency said. U.N. agencies estimate that about 180,000 Iraqi children under 5 suffer from malnutrition. (AP)

Chemical-Warfare Records From Gulf War Disappear
The Pentagon said that all full copies of the chemical-warfare logs maintained by the military during the Persian Gulf War had disappeared, even though copies had been stored after the war in locked safes at two different locations in the United States. Veterans who believe that they might have been made sick by exposure to chemical or biological weapons during the war have been saying that the Pentagon is hiding evidence of the exposure. A1
 
Senator Demands Lake Files
The head of the Senate intelligence committee said that unless he received all F.B.I. files about the Administration's nominee to head the C.I.A., Anthony Lake, no hearings on the nomination would be held. The demand by the committee chairman, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, was backed by the Senate majority leader and a dozen other conservative Republicans. A1
 
In a First, AIDS Deaths Decline
Deaths from AIDS in the United States declined substantially in the first six months of 1996, the first such decrease since the onset of the disease in 1981. The overall decline in deaths was reflected in all areas of the nation but was highest in the West and Northeast. A1
 
Political Documents Seized
Senior law-enforcement officials said F.B.I. agents raided the Washington office of the U.S.-Thai Business Council and took boxes of documents pertaining to the group's political activities. The council was founded with the help of a major Democratic fund-raiser. A27
 
Ex-Private Convicted of Killings
A former Army private was found guilty of murder in the shooting deaths of a black couple in late 1995 in Fayetteville, N.C., near Fort Bragg. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the case, and jurors will hear evidence from them and lawyers for the former private, James N. Burmeister 2d, as they decide whether to recommend life in prison or execution. A14
 
Broadcasters Defend Ratings
The broadcast industry defended the new ratings system for television programs and sought more time to allow it to work as the Senate Commerce Committee held hearings on the issue. Saying that most parents approved of the ratings, industry leaders tried to head off calls for more detailed labeling of violent and sexually explicit programs. A14
 
Split Decisions on Tobacco
The tobacco industry won a victory in Federal District Court in California as a judge dismissed a suit by 12 counties, but it lost another matter in Florida when a state judge allowed antitobacco lawyers to question the heads of tobacco companies in preparation for a class-action suit. In North Carolina, there was no word about a challenge to new Federal rules requiring retailers to ask anyone younger than 27 for a photo identification. A16

Changes Are Sought In Programs for Gifted
Chancellor Rudy Crew is proposing major changes in how New York City's local school districts run programs for gifted children and how they choose students for them. He said many minority and immigrant students were being shut out of the programs. A1
 
Homeless Encampment Razed
The last large encampment of homeless people in Manhattan, in the old Penn Central underground coal bins under West 66th Street near the Hudson River, was razed. There are still clusters of homeless people scattered throughout Manhattan, but city officials and advocates for the homeless agreed that the tight-knit community that lived inside the coal bins was the last large group. B1
 
Curb on Gun Buyers Sought
Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois introduced legislation to prohibit foreign visitors to the United States from buying or carrying firearms. The move comes in response to the shootings at the Empire State Building by a Palestinian who bought a gun in Florida. B5
 
Fatal Crash of Car and Van
A school van carrying six high school students to a yeshiva skidded along a rain-slicked stretch of the Harlem River Drive, jumped a guardrail, then crushed an oncoming car, killing the driver of the van. The passengers of the van, as well as those in the car, were injured. B3
 
Fujitsu Picks Rockland Site
Officials at Fujitsu of Japan, one of the world's largest telecommunications and computer companies, said they were opening a $122 million research and development center in Rockland County because the New York region is home to the type of telecommunications engineering talent needed by the company. B1
 
Workers' Suit Can Proceed
A New Jersey appeals court ruled that former state workers can proceed with a lawsuit contending that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman put two dozen state motor vehicle offices in private hands in 1995 to help Republican supporters, not to save money. The decision could clear the way for election-year court proceedings on charges by the union that represents workers who were displaced. B5

HEADLINE: If Groundhogs Were Boastful: 'I Hate to Say I Told You So'

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Punxsutawney Phil was one laid-back groundhog yesterday.
Wasn't it Phil who told you on Feb. 2 that winter was a dead duck? 
 So yesterday, when the temperature in Central Park hit 72 at 2:42 P.M., setting a record that banished the 68-degree high of 1880, Bill Deeley, Phil's handler, agreed it was a day to give Phil his due.
"We've always said that he was 100 percent correct and knew what was going on," Mr. Deeley said. "Groundhog Day comes and goes, and they sometimes only remember the bad times, not the good predictions. You do good, you should be told about it."
Giving an update on Phil, who is housed in a zoo that is part of the children's library in the municipal building in Punxsutawney, Pa., Mr. Deeley said: "This time of year, he's pretty laid back. He's sleeping and enjoying his time alone."
New York City was not the only place in the metropolitan area where new highs nudged old records into the dustbin of history yesterday.
In Newark, the temperature hit 74, surpassing the record 67 set in 1976. At Kennedy International Airport, where the old record was also 67 in 1976, the temperature reached a high of 71.
At the Garfield Place playground in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, a woman who identified herself only as Lucy sat with her two 4-year-old twins, Alis and Alexando. "I don't come here when its freezing," she said. "We've been out all day since 11 A.M. It's spring in February."
But while people shucked off overcoats, while tulips and daffodils were selling as fast as the produce manager could stick price tags on them at the Edwards supermarket in Pine Hollow, L.I., and while convertible tops were coming down at the high school in Locust Valley, L.I., some weather experts were sounding a note of caution.
Like Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve warning against irrational exuberance in the stock market, meteorologists could be heard reining in intemperate spring fever.
"Winter is not over by a long shot," said Pamela Joyce of the National Weather Service.
And Lee Grenci of the Weather Communications Group of the Department of Meteorology at Pennsylvania State University, said: "Winter is a tough character. There's some pretty good cold air banked up in Canada, and we meteorologists will keep a wary eye to the north."
Still, the short-range outlook was good: mostly sunny today, with highs from 55 to 60 degrees; temperatures of 45 to 50 on Saturday, with a chance of rain; highs in the 60's on Sunday after a chance of early showers, and around 50 on Monday and Tuesday under some clouds, Ms. Joyce said.
The cloud cover contributed significantly to yesterday's highs by holding in the warm air blowing in from the southwest, she said.
Mr. Grenci said, "It's a constant battle between warm and cold air, and the really warm air won today.
"After the winter solstice in the third week in December, the sun has been getting increasingly higher in the sky, and the tropics have been the main beneficiary of that increasing solar radiation. So when Arctic air, which is a heavy hitter in the world of meteorology, takes a hiatus in Canada, that leaves our friend from the tropics to sort of sneak in through the bathroom window."
At West Harbor Beach in Bayville, L.I., Sergio Spano, a 21-year-old student at Long Island University, closed his economics textbook, placed it on a picnic table and sunned himself while nearby his two nephews played barefoot in shallow waves.
"It's a little cold to go swimming, but it's tempting," Mr. Spano said.
"Come on in, Uncle Sergio," said his nephew Frank, 6. "Honest, it's really warm."
Honest, yesterday really was.

Mutual Funds Strong; Stock Prices Tumble
Mutual funds got off to a bigger start this year than ever before, taking in net new cash of $29.4 billion in January. But investors' cautious mood was evident in two ways: a move to relatively conservative stock funds and the market's slide. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.11 points, to 6,925.07, and broader barometers fell more, as technology stocks were swamped in heavy trading in the biggest selloff in seven months. The Nasdaq 100 index lost 32.25 points, or 3.66 percent, to 848.49. It was the index's biggest one-day drop since July 23, when it lost 4.12 percent. Few were able to explain the plunge in technology issues, but some attributed it to questions about 3Com's planned $7.3 billion takeover of U. S. Robotics. [Page D6.]
 
Traders were skeptical about 3Com's planned acquisition, sending both its shares and U. S. Robotics' down. Market Place. [D6.]
 
Milbank, Tweed Accused of Conflict
Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, the New York law firm, has been accused in court motions of conflicts of interest in a Federal bankruptcy filing involving Bucyrus-Erie, a mining company. The firm was said to have represented both Bucyrus and, in separate litigation, the principal for one of the company's main sources of financing. Milbank, Tweed has not yet responded to the motions. [D2.]
 
Surge in Durable Goods Orders
Orders to factories in the United States for big-ticket goods rebounded in January, rising a larger-than-expected 3.6 percent and setting the stage for continued economic growth. The data may increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool the economy. [D2.]
 
Big Bonuses at Morgan Stanley
Three top officers at Morgan Stanley each earned more than $10 million last year, giving a sense of just how much money senior investment bankers made from a prosperous 1996. The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Morgan Stanley, which is merging with Dean Witter, Discover, was the season's first compensation disclosure by a Wall Street firm. [D2.]

Triton Energy Settles U.S. Charges
Triton Energy, an oil and gas development company based in Dallas, agreed to pay $300,000 to settle Federal charges stemming from bribes that a subsidiary paid to Indonesian Government officials in 1989 and 1990. The S.E.C. complaint contended that Triton officials not only made payments that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, but also falsified records to make the bribes appear to be routine business payments. [D2.]
AT&T's Revamping Plan
AT&T announced a series of steps in a revamping aimed at streamlining its sprawling executive ranks. People familiar with the company said that AT&T planned to cut about 200 management jobs. [D4.]
 
Industry Defends TV Ratings
The broadcast industry, seeking to head off calls for more detailed labeling of violent and sexually explicit television programming, defended the current ratings system in testimony before a Senate committee and pleaded for more time to let it work. [A14.]
 
An Heir at American Express
Kenneth I. Chenault (left), one of four vice chairmen at American Express, was appointed the company's president and No. 2 executive. In a letter to employees, Harvey Golub, the company's chairman, said that Mr. Chenault, 45, was now "the primary internal candidate to succeed me when the time comes." But Mr. Golub, who is 57, said that he planned to keep his job until he reached 65. [D2.]

Results for a New Biotechnology
Isis Pharmaceuticals said its treatment for Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel condition, had shown promising results, in the first clinical tests indicating that a biotechnology known as anti-sense may have broad therapeutic effects in humans. [D3.]

HEADLINE: Response To a Furor: Ho-Hums

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: OLYMPIA, Wash., Feb. 27

 BODY:
In the fumoir at the Spar that is, for out-of-towners, a smoky back room in a historic diner dear to politicians and civilians alike in this small state capital -- there seems nary a whiff of outrage these days to mix with the cigar fumes and cigarette haze thickening at happy hour.
"Much ado about nothing!" declared Casey Clegg, a local accountant, about the latest reports of memorandums showing that President Clinton was eager to turn the White House into a bed-and-breakfast for big campaign contributors. 
 Peter Valentine, an unemployed tree-planter who voted Republican in the last Presidential election, was equally unmoved: "We're not talking Tammany Hall," he said. "It's not a question of bagmen. It's a problem of appearances."
Political cynicism tends to run high in towns like this, a state capital where too many people observe how the sausage is made in the Legislature, know the details of how state contractors make sure their bids are accepted and can, if they are masochistic, watch tipsy lawmakers singing karaoke at the Carriage Inn.
The blase reaction here is not an anomaly, however. A national poll taken on Wednesday found that 63 percent of respondents said they believed that President Clinton's behavior was typical of how the White House had been used by both parties, while 22 percent said it was worse. The poll -- of 627 adults and sponsored by CNN, USA Today and Gallup -- also found that 45 percent of respondents did not care about Mr. Clinton's role in the White House sleep-overs, while 27 percent said they were disappointed but not angry, 13 percent said they were disappointed, and 11 percent described themselves as pleased. The margin of sampling error was four percentage points.
But if the reaction in Olympia, too, is mainly a jaded "surprise, surprise," there is an undercurrent of thoughtfulness, a conviction so strong that campaign financing must be reformed that many have already considered how they would do it.
"I think it should be capped, how much you can spend on a race," said Evangeline Sauls, a nonpartisan clerk in the bill office of the Capitol and a 10-year behind-the-scenes observer of Washington state politics. "Think of the amount of money they're wasting! They could take care of all the welfare reform they're talking about with the money they spend on a campaign."
Perhaps lobbyists should not be able to contribute at all, she added, and campaign money should come only from a fund apportioned equally to candidates.
"If they don't start doing that, this will continue forever," she said on a coffee break in the Capitol Grill and Espresso, the Legislature's basement cafeteria. "There has to be reform, but no one is doing anything but talking."
Mr. Valentine, at the Spar, said that given recent court rulings backing a politician's right to raise money and campaign, "the only way we're going to restrict this kind of thing is to have some kind of constitutional amendment." How it could work he did not know, he said, but it seemed clear that the gray area between buying access and buying influence must somehow be defined down to black and white.
Back in the smoking room, a lawyer who declined to give his name -- saying he had too many ties to "the system" here -- had it all worked out: The campaign season, he said, should be cut to two months.
"When you start running three years before the election, of course it's going to cost you money," he said. "There should be a two-month limit and you shouldn't be allowed to start spending the money until the two months start."
Stephen Buckman, 23, a producer for the local version of C-Span, said he did not want to see his tax dollars going to pay for campaigns. But he did like the idea of tough spending caps on contributions and races. Overall, he said, the whole sleep-over affair left him wondering what the fuss was about.
"Of course politics works that way," he said. "It's all backslapping and pressing the flesh and under-the-table deals. That's what it's all about. The Republicans are doing the same thing. They're just being more behind-the-scenes about it."
The disclosures of how the line between Mr. Clinton's Presidential and campaign duties was blurred might have been expected to draw particular attention here because Representative Linda Smith, a Republican who has been one of the most vocal advocates of campaign finance reform.
Here at home, Ms. Smith was the author of a successful 1992 state initiative on fund raising that passed with 72 percent of the vote. It limited contributions from political action committees and banned fund raising by legislators during the session. Ms. Smith, in her second Congressional term, has been working to get something similar passed at the Federal level, particularly focusing on "soft money" given to a party.
Her chances are believed to be better this term than last because of all the publicity surrounding President Clinton's campaigning, but she has said she believes she will succeed only when the voters rise up to express their disdain for the current system at the ballot box.
Disdain there certainly is in Olympia, but it does not seem to be the rising-up kind. In fact, just stepping out of the political habitat of Olympia and into the funkier reaches of the town, which also plays host to a large contingent of students at Evergreen State College and has more than a hint of hippie left in it, showed just how deep indifference to the disclosures of fund-raising irregularities could get.
At the Smithfield Cafe, which specializes in espresso eggs -- eggs scrambled using the steaming wand of the espresso machine -- the owner and chef, Stewart J. Boyle, said he just could not whip up a bit of emotion about the whole issue. He listens to National Public Radio all morning from when he rises at 5:30, he said, but "even if Clinton were renting out rooms at the White House, it just doesn't impress me as something I'd ever care about."
Lori Capra, a contractor stopping in for some carrot juice, offered this assessment: "Compared to the other injustices in politics, it's nothing."

HEADLINE: If Everyone Writes Standards, Who Will Teach?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The argument against national academic standards made by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin (Op-Ed, Feb. 21) is based on the flawed assumption that "education is a local issue." Mr. Thompson holds that local initiatives would reflect community needs, so a community with a strong computer industry, for instance, could tailor its math requirements accordingly. 
 But in the global economy, job markets and industries are not insulated from external factors, and President Clinton's call for national standards reflects this. The well-being of our businesses and workers increasingly depends on the ability of our schools to prepare students to compete in an international context. National standards are an important first step to insure that they do not slip further behind.

Rowland Presses Choice For Electric Customers

 BODY:
Gov. John G. Rowland told a legislative committee yesterday that allowing electric customers to choose utility companies would boost the state's economy by helping make Connecticut's electric rates competitive with other states.
Yet Mr. Rowland stressed that the state must make sure the bill allows both consumers and businesses to benefit from lower costs, while still insuring safe and reliable power. 
 "Without such competition and restructuring, I am afraid that Connecticut businesses will, as time passes, find themselves more and more at a competitive disadvantage," Mr. Rowland said.
Utility companies in Connecticut opposed this bill, saying it introduces competition too quickly and does not allow them to recover certain costs.
