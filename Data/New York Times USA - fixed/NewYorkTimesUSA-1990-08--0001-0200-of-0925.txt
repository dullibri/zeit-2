HEADLINE: F.D.I.C.'S CHAIRMAN EXPECTS 1990 LOSS ON BANK INSURANCE

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
Giving one of his bleakest forecasts to date, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said today that ever-weakening real estate markets and a near-record number of bank failures were likely to produce the third consecutive annual loss for the fund that insures deposits at commercial banks.
The chairman, L. William Seidman, said the Bank Insurance Fund could lose as much as $2 billion this year, leaving it only $11 billion in assets. That would be the lowest level by far in the 57-year history of the fund, which is separate from the fund that insures deposits at savings and loan associations, and it would be half the level of reserves that regulators and banking experts say is prudent.
''The insurance fund is under considerable stress, and it is at the lowest point at any time in modern history,'' Mr. Seidman said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
 
Previous Warnings
Although the F.D.I.C. chairman has been warning for some months that the fund, which insures $2.7 trillion in deposits at commercial banks, is strained, today's remarks were his first that indicate the losses of the previous two years will continue. 
Moreover, they underscore the strains that have gone beyond the savings and loan industry from excessive real estate lending and are now the main preoccupation of the banking industry.
The F.D.I.C.'s Bank Insurance Fund is one of three funds established by the Government to insure deposits up to $100,000 for each account at commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions. Banks and other institutions pay annual premiums for deposit insurance into the funds, which are then used when institutions fail, either to pay off insured depositors or to pay acquirers to cover any losses in taking over the failed institutions.
 
Savings Fund Depleted
The fund that insures the nation's savings and loans is depleted because of the losses in the savings and loan industry. Deposit insurance for failed savings institutions is being covered now by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency created last year to oversee the industry's bailout.
The third fund, covering deposits at credit unions, is generally considered to be healthy.
In the case of the F.D.I.C.'s bank fund, to sustain a $2 billion drain on its reserves this year, which are currently at $13.2 billion, it would have to suffer losses on failed banks of almost $6 billion, since it will receive $3 billion in insurance premiums from banks and $1 billion in interest income on its cash reserves.
So far, 112 banks have failed this year, nearly the pace set in both 1988 and 1989. In each of those years, a total of 200 or more banks collapsed.
Mr. Seidman specifically attributed the drain on the fund to the toll that the fast weakening of commercial real estate markets was having on the banking system. What began as a regional downturn in Northeast real estate prices has now spread to most parts of the country, Mr. Seidman said.
A $2 billion loss would mean that by the end of the year, the fund would have between 50 cents and 60 cents for every $100 of deposits it insures, Mr. Seidman said. That is less than half the $1.25 for each $100 of deposits that regulators and industry experts say is an adequate level of reserves. The assets that support the insured deposits fell from $1.10 for each $100 of deposits in 1987 to 80 cents in 1988 and to 70 cents last year.
 
Worries About Bailout
Mr. Seidman's comments immediately raised concerns among banking committee members over whether a bailout by taxpayers, akin to the savings and loan rescue, would be needed. ''Are the resources of the F.D.I.C. adequate?'' asked Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the banking committee.
Mr. Seidman, who has earned a reputation for plain and credible talk, said he did not see the need at this time for taxpayer funds to buttress the fund. ''At this point, we believe we can handle anything we can see,'' he said.
But people in the banking industry said the remarks by Mr. Seidman today and similar remarks he has made in recent weeks have rankled the Adminstration, which has been assailed repeatedly by Democrats in recent weeks over what they say is its slow handling of the savings and loan bailout.
The White House has also been stung by the scrutiny being given the involvement of President Bush's son Neil in the collapsed Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in Denver. Mr. Seidman has said that the F.D.I.C. would decide within several weeks whether to bring a negligence suit against Mr. Bush and other Silverado directors.
 
Concern on Confidence Loss
Industry experts say the White House and the Treasury Department are concerned that statements about the weakness of the bank fund could cause a loss of confidence in the Government's deposit insurance program and add to their political troubles as elections approach.
Mr. Seidman's comments underscore, however, the seriousness with which the Treasury is looking at revamping deposit insurance, searching for ways to both restrict the financial exposure of the Government and impose discipline from the marketplace on bankers to reduce the risks they take. Last week, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the Administration was leaning toward limiting the insurance to $100,000 for each depositor, from $100,000 for each account, but would not consider cutting the $100,000 level.
For his part, Mr. Seidman seems to be intent on a public relations campaign meant to gradually educate the public about the precariousness of the financial system, without sparking a panic. He said the loss to the fund would not be the result of one large bank failing, but simply the accumulated cost of bank failures caused by the depressed real estate markets.
 
Change From Earlier in Year
His comments today were a change from earlier in the year, when he predicted that the fund, which rose to peak of $18.3 billion in 1987, was likely to break even for 1990, after losing $4.2 billion in 1988, when there were a number of large bank failures in Texas, and $850 million in 1989.
The disclosure and candor by Mr. Seidman is a stark departure from the approach by regulators several years ago. At that point, regulators were concerned that such public discourse would quickly erode depositor confidence in the banking system, sparking runs. So far, Mr. Seidman has proved that belief wrong.
Some experts said one reason for the continued public confidence is that Congress, in the savings and loan bailout, unequivocally demonstrated that the Government's full borrowing powers still stood behind deposit insurance.
''I think we are living in a different world than the world in which bank regulators were very circumspect about the health of the deposit insurance funds,'' said Stephen Verdier, a lobbyist for the Independent Bankers Association. ''Politicians and the people they represent are demanding to know what the exact status of the funds is. And I think that while before there was some residual uncertainty about whether the Government would step in, there is no doubt now. Deposit insurance is as good as the Treasury. I expect absolutely no panic.''

HEADLINE: REBELS IN TRINIDAD SET PREMIER FREE; 40 ARE STILL HELD

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad, July 31

 BODY:
Gunmen from a militant Muslim group released the wounded Prime Minister of this Caribbean island nation today, but they continue to hold other members of the Government who were taken hostage four days ago.
The release of the 63-year-old Prime Minister, Arthur N. R. Robinson, who was sent to a hospital, is the first break in a standoff between the insurgents and the Trinidad Army, which is surrounding the rebel gunmen.
Though some hopes for a peaceful end to the crisis were raised by word that the Prime Minister was free, there is a sense among many here that military action is still under consideration.
 
Caribbean Force Stands By
''This crisis is far from over,'' Anthony Smart, Trinidad's Attorney General, said tonight. ''We are praying for the safety'' of the remaining 40 hostages, he added, including 11 Cabinet officers who are being held in the Parliament building and the offices of the state television. 
Eight other hostages have been freed by the Muslims since Friday.
Diplomats here, including the American Ambassador, Charles A. Gargano, said 200 troops from Jamaica, Barbados and elsewhere in the Caribbean were assembled on Barbados for possible duty in Trinidad, although the Government insists that it has the situation in hand. [Page A6.] Bullet Wound in Leg At the same time, Ambassador Gargano denied that any American troops or hostage specialists had been flown to Trinidad despite rumors that hundreds of marines had been seen in this seaside capital and that American warships had moved off the coast.
Tonight, Mr. Smart refused to say whether Mr. Robinson had acceded to rebel demands that he resign as a condition of his release, adding that the leader had been hospitalized and was in no state to resume his role as head of government, let alone assist in negotiations to free the remaining hostages.
Mr. Smart said Prime Minister Robinson suffered a superficial bullet wound in the leg, which was treated by a fellow hostage, Health Minister Emmanuel Hosein, who is a physician. Mr. Robinson was also said to be suffering from fatigue and glaucoma.
Although Mr. Smart said that the Government was ''continuing its efforts to secure the release of all those still held hostage,'' he indicated that the situation remained explosive. He brushed aside questions about reports that an agreement had been reached and then somehow scuttled on Monday night. ''These discussions are at a very delicate stage and we want lives to be saved,'' he said.
Late today, 15 hostages remained at gunpoint in the Parliament building, 7 of them members of Trinidad's 19-member Cabinet, while 25 other captives, mostly employees of the state television, were being held in the television offices, across town.
 
Wave of Looting
Although water and electricity were being maintained, troops surrounding the buildings have refused to allow food, and the rebel leader complained today that the Government had cut telephone links to his followers in the Parliament house, complicating negotiations.
The hostage siege, which began with a series of armed attacks on the capital early Friday evening, touched off a wave of looting that left Port of Spain's commercial center and much of the surrounding suburbs in smoldering ruins, raising fears that shortages of food, medicine and fuel could set off further unrest in a matter of days. To compound matters, workers due to receive their monthly paychecks were not paid today because of the disruptions.
Late Monday night, while he was a prisoner of the rebels, Mr. Robinson told a reporter for the Caribbean News Agency by telephone that he had agreed to step down as part of an overall agreement that included amnesty for the members of the militant sect holding the hostages, the creation of an interim government and new elections in three months. But his statement was disavowed by a group of politicians who were not seized in the takeover.
 
Rebel Leader Interviewed
This morning, the leader of the rebels, who calls himself Imam Yasin Abu Bakr, asserted in a telephone interview that the Prime Minister's agreement to quit had been undermined by members of a faction within the ruling coalition who were seeking to gain political advantage. Mr. Abu Bakr accused the faction of sabotaging a settlement despite efforts by an Anglican churchman to make a deal with the rebels.
''If God wills - and God don't will wrong - then they'll move in and kill everybody, because then they'll have an excuse,'' said Mr. Abu Bakr, a former Trinidad policeman whose name was Lennox Phillip before his conversion to Islam.
There were also reports that the 5,000-member police force, which may have lost 37 men when its headquarters were attacked by Muslims from the Abu Bakr group on Friday night, was outraged that the Government might agree to an amnesty for the rebel group, known as Jamaat al-Muslimeen, or Society of Muslims.
Since their conversion to Islam, experts say, the group's leaders have remained distant from the mainstream Muslims of Trinidad. Those Muslims are primarily ethnic East Indians, descendants of indentured laborers brought from what are now India and Pakistan to work in the sugar cane fields in the 19th century.
The Government has given no estimate of overall casualty figures, although journalists here have put the the number dead as high as 60, including policemen and soldiers, and more than 300 wounded. Most of the civilians are thought to have been shot by security forces for looting or for violating curfew since Friday night. A 22-hour curfew is in effect around the hostage sites, while all people elsewhere in the country must remain indoors except between noon and 6 P.M.
Maj. Dave Williams, a spokesman for the 1,500-member armed forces, said the Muslims, whose number has been put as about 50 gunmen in each building, seemed to ''operate like a trained military force'' in tactics and in their use of automatic weapons and small arms. He would not comment on reports that the rebels have mortars and rocket-propelled grenades.
Whatever the case, there seems to be wide agreement among Trinidadians that the episode is a calamity for this petroleum-producing country, which has been reeling from a series of economic setbacks that began five years ago with the collapse of oil prices.
At Independence Square, a 10-block shopping center in the heart of Port of Spain, virtually every business, from supermarkets and electronics stores to dress shops and hardware outlets, had been looted and in some cases burned.
On the East-West Corridor, the main highway between the capital and the northeast coast, shopping centers and huge warehouses once brimming with everything from frozen meat to automobile tires had been devastated. Trinidadians said many looted goods were available at bargain prices in the streets over the weekend.
''I have enough to feed my family for now, but I'm afraid what will happen later,'' said Evonne Thornhill, a 54-year-old worker in a paper-bag factory.

HEADLINE: Reorganizing the Yankees;
Other Owners Either Silent Or Still Quietly Surprised

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
A day after George Steinbrenner was stripped of control of the Yankees, his fellow owners generally maintained their sedate postures.
Some, like Bill Giles, the owner and president of the Philadelphia Phillies, expressed surprise at the severity of the sanction imposed by Commissioner Fay Vincent, but did not question it. Others, like Larry Lucchino, the president of the Baltimore Orioles, issued brief noncommittal statements looking to the future. 
Most were simply noncommittal, either withholding or reserving comment or not returning phone calls seeking their opinions.
 
No Comment From Mets
Nelson Doubleday, the chairman of the Mets, was traveling yesterday, and Fred Wilpon, the club's president, was occupied in meetings. Neither returned messages left with their offices.
Few executives were as loquacious as Giles. ''It is very unfortunate when any owner is penalized by the commissioner of baseball,'' Giles said. ''I was surprised by the severity of Commissioner Vincent's decision, but I had no knowledge of the case other than what I learned through the news media.''
Lucchino was even less outspoken, declining to elaborate on a two-sentence statement issued by his office.
''Baseball has a proven process for the resolution of these matters.'' it began. ''That process has now been completed, and it's time to turn our attention back to the game on the field,'' it ended.
Jerry Reinsdorf, chairman of the Chicago White Sox, took a similar tack. ''I am pleased the matter has finally been resolved,'' he said.
In Milwaukee, Bud Selig, the president of the Brewers, said he would have no comment until he had read the commissioner's report, and in Los Angeles, Gene Autry, the owner of the California Angels, said he would have no comment at all.
One baseball man who was a bit more forthcoming was Dallas Green, a former Yankee manager. ''I was surprised by the severity of the penalty. But Fay apparently knows a little bit more about it than we do,'' Green said. ''It's tough to hit a guy when he is down, but George has always been his own worst enemy.''
Green expressed reservations about Steinbrenner's plans to turn operation of the team over to his son Hank. ''I don't think he's the kind of person they need,'' Green said. ''The Yankees desperately need a baseball person, a strong baseball person.'' Someone, perhaps, like Green? ''I'm unemployed,'' he said, ''but I'm not available for that. There's still too much Steinbrenner influence in that situation. You'll find somebody to take that job, but you won't find a Dave Winfield or a Dallas Green or a Yogi Berra.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Helps Underwrite Guatemala Terror

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I want to commend your articles (most recently, July 5) about the increasing violence in Guatemala. Your contribution is vital because so few Americans know that Guatemala has one of the most repressive regimes in Central America.
I learned about this country during a Witness for Peace trip this year. We spent five days meeting with religious leaders, educators, peasants, women's groups and the military. We learned rapidly how dangerous the situation is for dissenters. Students, union leaders, health agents and church workers are targets because they threaten the Government with ideas of social, political and economic reform. Few who know the situation deny that the so-called democratic Government is a facade for the military, who retain control by intimidation and murder. Amnesty International has reported that human rights crimes in Guatemala account for nearly half of all human rights violations in Central America. 
In Guatemala City, we interviewed a member of an organization started by mothers of the ''disappeared,'' that is, people kidnapped by the police or military and never heard from again. If they are discovered, it is as corpses with evidence of torture.
The woman said they had always been a close-knit family. Then one of her daughters disappeared as she walked home from the university. Her other daughter fled in fear to Canada, broke down in her isolation and is now in a mental hospital. Her remaining children, two sons, have been threatened. One has sought asylum in California; the other has quit the university out of fear and is torn about leaving his mother alone or escaping to another country.
These mothers and members of their families risk their lives by organizing demonstrations, carrying pictures of their loved ones, searching prisons and appealing to the world for help. The woman we interviewed spoke to us hoping we would go back to the United States and let others know what is happening.
Her case is but one example of the injustices Guatemalans suffer from a regime supported with our tax dollars. Most sources agree that in the last 20 years more than 100,000 people have been murdered by the military; 40,000 have disappeared, and 100,000 have been forced into exile.
We must let our representatives know that we oppose the use of our tax dollars where people are not free to dissent and where opposition to the Government is suppressed by murder, by torture and by ''disappearances.''

Enemies List Getting Shorter: Some Hate It

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure; Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure. - Lord Byron
$/
One New Yorker said yesterday that he felt as good as he had on the day Richard M. Nixon resigned. Yet not having George Steinbrenner to kick around anymore poses a risk: whom do we have to hate?
Within less than a year, several of New York's most ubiquitous targets of antipathy fell from grace and were transformed, against their will, naturally, into almost pitiable figures: Edward I. Koch lost the mayoralty; Leona Helmsley was sentenced to prison, and Donald J. Trump was placed on a monthly allowance. This week, the source of public enmity No. 1, Mr. Steinbrenner, was ordered by the commissioner of baseball, Fay Vincent, to yield control of the Yankees. 
His perceived villainy could never be considered in the same league as Walter O'Malley's. But during most of Mr. Steinbrenner's 17 seasons of discontent as principal owner of the Yankees, a team some New Yorkers loved to hate anyway, he has consistently been the best target in town.
If this were merely a local phenomenon, even in a city with as many would-be opinion makers as New York, it would be serious enough. But attrition has shrunk the nation's enemies list, too. The form of Communism that Americans comfortably feared is collapsing and the number of reviled dictators has shriveled to just a few. If people are known by their enemies, our definition is unraveling.
Fear plus hate equal power, Eugene Burdick once wrote. Today, power has become so diffuse that billions of dollars can be diverted in a savings-and-loan scandal without anyone being singled out for blame. Television - by contributing to the crowd-pleasing blanding of America and by stifling conversation - has sapped our national venom. Potential targets are faceless behind a corporate veil.
Many government figures no longer loom large enough to hate. Can anyone really get into a lather over the villainy of Stanley Simon, the former Borough President of the Bronx.
Roy Cohn died. Rupert Murdoch sold The New York Post. Jimmy Breslin stopped writing his annual list of people he isn't talking to. And Richard Nixon keeps edging closer to rehabilitation, although that prospect alone gives some people still another reason to hate him.
For some haters in this city, the best hope might be the Rev. Al Sharpton. If he is sidelined with a sore throat, New Yorkers would be left empty-handed.
Might not the absence of hate be a positive development, ushering in an era of good will? It might, except that what has dissipated is not hate, but handy targets. All the talk or a mellower America and all the blue unity ribbons notwithstanding, some deep thinkers consider hatred to be a healthy emotion, properly directed.
''We have to have certain targets,'' Dr. Vamik Volkan, a psychiatrist at the University of Virginia, said yesterday, elaborating on the thesis of his book, ''The Need to Have Enemies and Allies,'' published by Jason Aronson.
''We also need to feel secure and cohesive in our identities as a group,'' Dr. Volkan said. ''There's something about yourself that you do not like, so you say it doesn't belong to me, it belongs to someone else.''
''The whole idea,'' he said, ''is to keep your self-esteem. I call it in-projection-projection-relatedness.''
Mr. Steinbrenner, Dr. Volkan said, represents ''a transference figure - one of those people, like Presidents and sports figures, who absorb many of our wishes as well as our defenses against what we're not.''
Will an absence of transference figures manifest itself in an era of good feeling, a frantic search for new targets or a period of self-hate? ''All of the above,'' Dr. Volkan replied. He suggested that the absence of popular villains - and, with the possible exception of such distant figures as Nelson Mandela, of heroes, too - is only transitory because people in stressful cities, with so many different ethnic and economic groups, also abhor a vacuum.
His optimism was echoed by another interpreter of popular culture, Jerry Della Femina, the advertising executive.
''We need people to hate because it brings New York together,'' Mr. Della Femina said. ''I see a big Dinkins hate coming.'' Mr. Della Femina recalled that even Mr. Steinbrenner was once, many seasons ago, a hero to some people. ''Let's not lose hope,'' he said. ''There are people we still admire who we could learn to hate.''

HEADLINE: Minority Role in Broadcasting Yields Far Bigger Effect on Radio Than TV

BYLINE: By JEREMY GERARD

 BODY:
After Federal and local law-enforcement officials arrested Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. of Washington on drug charges in January, Cathy Hughes devoted a week of her morning radio talk show on WOL-AM to issues raised by the arrest.
Hers was not the only call-in radio show in the capital to explore Mr. Barry's troubles. Indeed, the Mayor made himself prominently available to WOL and other stations that specifically serve minority audiences. But many listeners said WOL's programs addressed issues in the case, including the role of race, that were of particular concern to the station's largely black audience. 
Executives and experts in broadcasting say this kind of programming, directed at audiences not regularly addressed by mainstream radio and television, is precisely what the Federal Communications Commission was seeking in 1978, when it instituted policies that give preference to minority applicants for broadcast licenses.
But they also say such programming is usually found only on AM radio stations like WOL, and is still greatly underrepresented on television despite a modest increase in the ownership of television stations by minority members.
 
'Stayed With the Same Style'
''I would say there has been no change at all in our programming,'' said Sean Bradley, the station manager at KTBY-TV in Anchorage, a Fox affiliate that changed to minority ownership in 1985 with help from the F.C.C. ''We've stayed with the same style,'' Mr. Bradley said. The commission's policies, which were upheld by the Supreme Court in June, give preference to qualified minority applicants for broadcast licenses and allow a station owner in danger of losing a license for financial or other reasons to sell it to a qualified minority applicant. Both policies give tax advantages to owners and minority buyers.
The commission says the policies have increased the minority ownership of radio and television stations from about 1 percent in 1978 to about 3.5 percent today. Among the nation's 12,000 radio licenses and 1,200 television licenses, 182 radio stations and 17 television stations are licensed to 110 companies owned by blacks, according to the National Association of Black-Owned Broadcasters, a Washington trade group. Other minorities are considerably less represented among owners, the F.C.C. says.
''I'm not sure there is any special responsibility to do increased minority programming,'' said James S. Winston, executive director and general counsel to the black broadcasters' group. ''However, the vast majority of owners do that. The greatest change by far is in radio, which goes to a smaller and more targeted audience than television.''
WTNH-TV in New Haven is the rare example of a television station whose programming has been affected by its transfer to minority ownership.
 
Community Affairs Programming
''We've changed a certain focus in community affairs programming,'' said Lew Freifeld, vice president and general manager of the station. WTNH, an ABC affiliate, was sold in 1985 by Capital Cities Inc. to the Cook Inlet Communications Corporation, an Aleut and Eskimo company whose headquarters are in Anchorage.
''We took a story line or an issue -last year we did 'For a Drug-Free Generation' - and allocated all of our resources toward that,'' Mr. Freifeld said. ''We pre-empted prime time. In the past that wasn't true.''
He attributed the changes to WTNH's new owner. Under the F.C.C. policies, Cook Inlet, owned by 6,500 Aleut and Eskimo shareholders, has purchased 11 radio stations and WSMV-TV in Nashville, in addition to WTNH. Both television stations have won awards for public service programs, said George V. Kriste, a Cook Inlet executive.
Minority owners, like their white colleagues, face the task of making their stations successful businesses. Increasing the number of voices, they said, is a goal that can be met only with more minority owners in the broadcasting marketplace.
 
No Plans to 'Narrowcast'
Two years ago W. Don Cornwell, who is black, left Wall Street to form the Granite Broadcasting Corporation, which now owns two ABC and two NBC affiliates and plans to buy more. Mr. Cornwell said he did not buy those stations to serve a small audience. ''You don't buy it to narrow-cast,'' he said. ''Unlike a radio station, there's a broader perspective.''
At the affiliates, the executives said, the commission's policies have had less effect on programming. Managers at affiliate stations said that while they adhered to the network schedule, minority ownership had increased their sensitivity to concerns of minorities in local news and public affairs.
Minority owners, as well as civic leaders, also scrutinize the stations' hiring practices, they added.
''You do have a high interest in happenings in the minority community,'' said Stephen H. Kimatian, president and general manager of WKBW-TV in Buffalo. WKBW, an ABC affiliate, became the nation's largest black-owned television station in 1986 when it was bought from Capital Cities by Queen City Broadcasting Inc. The chairman and majority stockholder of Queen City is J. Bruce Llewellyn, a soft-drink executive from Philadelphia who is black.
 
'Accent and Emphasize'
While WKBW fills prime time and much of the daytime schedule with ABC programs, the station, like other affiliates, draws from syndicated shows for some hours of the day, including those immediately before and after the evening news.
''You select programs with a value to minorities; you do accent and emphasize,'' Mr. Kimatian said. He added that under the new owner, ''Buffalo Beat,'' a locally produced community affairs program, had increased reporting on subjects like unemployment, racism and drug abuse, which are of great concern in Buffalo, whose population is 28 percent minority.
The minority ownership policies enabled Ms. Hughes to buy WOL in 1980, when she changed the Washington station's format from music to a combination of talk and music. She later moved the station from Georgetown to a ground-floor studio in downtown Washington, where passers-by can watch the announcers. WOL is much like the community bulletin board station in Spike Lee's film ''Do the Right Thing.''
In New York, WLIB-AM, another black-owned radio station that was bought with help from the F.C.C. policies, also features talk shows that address current issues from a distinctly black perspective, and there are others in major cities around the country.
But most executives said greater diversity in programming, especially on television, would not come until there were more minority owners.
''As so often is the case with minorities,'' said Gerald D. Smith, an executive at WOL, ''until you get in the front door you can't move around the house.''

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
A Plan Aimed at Improving Schools

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

DATELINE: MOBILE, Ala., July 31

 BODY:
The nation's governors today approved plans intended to give backbone to their national education policies, but the package was greeted with skepticism by some education groups.
The proposals, which could run into trouble with voters because of the costs, was the clearest indication yet of who will assume the lead in establishing, financing and accepting responsibility for programs to meet the six ambitious goals set forth earlier this year by President Bush and the governors as a way to overhaul American schools by the year 2000.
''The time for excuses is running out if we're going to remain a first-world country,'' Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington said in an interview at the summer meeting of the National Governors' Association, which elected him its next chairman. ''We have to do with the resources we have. In my state I'm ultimately accountable.'' 
The issues of accountability and financing had been unclear since the first announcement of the goals. But today the governors approved the creation of a 14-member committee that will include six governors, equally divided between the political parties, and four Administration appointees. That will put the bulk of responsibility in the hands of the Governors.
Two senators and two representatives, also from from both parties, will also join the panel, but only as advisers.
 
Strategies for Meeting Goals
In addition to establishing the committee, the governors approved a long list of strategies to provide guidance on meeting the six general goals. Strategies at the state level include things like reducing red tape in local school systems and holding students more accountable for their performance. Strategies at the national level include easing restrictions on how some Federal money is spent.
The committee will issue an annual report evaluating each state's progress on the strategies and the six larger goals.
Although both the Administration and Congressional leaders have roles in putting the goals in place, some governors said it made sense for the states to take the lead, because the proposals were largely a result of their work. In addition, they said states on average pay for about 50 percent of education expenses, as against the Federal Government's 8 percent.
Governors face significant hurdles in trying to meet the goals. Many state budgets have been hobbled by soft economies that leave little room for more education money. Proposals for more taxes to pay for school improvements are likely to run into hostile voters, many of whom are increasingly weary of paying for inadequate schools.
 
Governor Pays With His Job
Moreover, even changes aimed at improvement can carry risks. In 1986, for example, Gov. Mark White of Texas was defeated after he proposed teacher competency testing and a requirement that students have passing grades before they could participate in extracurricular activities. In what could be their sternest test, governors may face resistance from some educators who already feel beleaguered and blamed for the faults of American schools.
Although some governors, like Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, complained about inadequate Federal financing and argued that some savings from military budget cuts should go to education, many more of the state chiefs here said the largest share of financing was the responsibility of states.
''The reality is there is finite money,'' said Governor Gardner of Washington, a Democrat.
In many states, educational revisions are already under way or soon will be, and the increases in spending came at the expense of other state programs. Since their efforts are in line with the national goals, officials in those states have urged the others to go along with assuming most of the responsibility at the state level.
''Everybody has enough money to pay for education if that's their priority,'' said Gov. Ray Mabus of Mississippi. Mississippi, for instance, in 1988 raised teachers' annual average pay to $24,500, moving the state to 42d from last in teacher salaries.
 
Questions on Accountability
Officials of education groups said they had hoped for more clarity on the issues of accountability and finances. The said they were afraid that the absence of a definitive statement on those issues would leave their members open to further blame for the decline of education and render the goals unworkable.
''They set up a system for everyone to be held accountable, but the committee isn't responsible to anyone,'' said Samuel B. Husk, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, an association of 45 urban districts with 5 million students representing about 10 percent of the national school enrollment. ''They completely ignored funding,'' he added.
Martha C. Fricke, president of the National School Boards Association, said she was afraid that without more definitive language over responsibility and finances, local boards would become scapegoats. ''We've been burned before,'' she said.
Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, a Denver organization that helps states coordinate education policy, said schools would be held more accountable under the governors' plan.
But Mr. Newman, who served on an advisory committee that assisted in formulating the goals, disputed assertions by some members of education groups that the burden of accountability would unfairly fall on them instead of the politicans.
''This is not public posturing'' by the governors, he said. ''They've stuck with the idea and have said that they're going to be accountable.''

 BODY:
In a contest between child care in France and the United States, American children are the losers.
''Why don't you change it? It is incredible for a large rich country to accept the terrible infant-mortality rate. It's crazy.''
That was how a woman who helps oversee child-care and preschool education in France reacted to the way America treats its infants and children. The official, Solange Passaris, special counselor on early childhood and motherhood to the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, said in an interview that because Europe was no longer in economic crisis it could now deal with children's welfare as part of a country's economic well-being. 
She said she did not understand how the United States could accept ranking 19th in the world in the prevention of infant deaths while France ranked fourth.
National commitment may be at the heart of the matter. Even discounting the French passion for dramatic style, there is a political message in President Francois Mitterrand's statement that ''France will blossom in its children.'' Or, as the president of the French-American Foundation, Edward H. Tuck, said more prosaically in a recent report by the foundation, ''A Welcome for Every Child,'' France's success is attributable to ''national policies focused on children, highly trained staffs, clearly defined responsibilities among agencies and a committed leadership at all levels of government.''
Child care in France enjoys strong support from business and industry. ''We try to create a partnership between business, the unions and government,'' Mrs. Passaris said.
Maternal leaves with pay begin six weeks before birth and continue for 10 weeks after delivery. Corporate leaders do not appear to be concerned over any possible negative effect on productivity and profits.
By contrast, American business interests lobbied so successfully against legislation that would have provided 10 weeks of unpaid maternity leaves that President Bush vetoed it.
To strengthen the family, French parents may take off two years without pay after a child's birth, knowing that their jobs remain protected.
On major issues, this is truly a tale of two countries.
Pre- and postnatal health care, lacking for so many poor women and their babies in the United States, is firmly anchored in French national policy. So is immunization, which in the United States has become increasingly erratic, leading to the revival of children's diseases that had been considered virtually extinct.
French eductors, health experts and politicians appreciate the close link between preventive health care and children's future success in school and life.
In the United States, millions of children are exposed to unlicensed day care. In high-quality centers, the cost is high. That creates great disparities in the lives of rich and poor children.
In France, the cost of care for children up to the age of 3 ranges from $195 a year for the poorest families to a maximum of $4,700 for the wealthiest.
Preschool for 3-to-5-year-olds is free, and 98 percent of the children attend it, more than three times the American percentage. Safe and nurturing places for young children of working parents are available from early morning to late afternoon.
In the United States, low pay and low status severely hamper the staffing of child-care centers. According to a recent report by the General Accounting Office, 40 percent of the workers in child-care centers in the United States leave each year.
French preschool teachers hold the equivalent of a master's degree in early childhood and elementary education. The directors of child-care centers are pediatric nurses, with additional training in public health and child development. Staff members have the equivalent of two years of college plus a two-year course in child development and early childhood education.
As an incentive, France offers students of preschool education free college tuition plus a stipend in return for a pledge to work in the field for at least five years after graduation.
Home care, which allows families to take in three children in addition to their own, is also licensed. In addition to daily compensation, family day-care providers are covered by Social Security, disability and unemployment insurance.
The home-care system is augmented with small-group centers to allow the children to mingle with others once a week.
A look at child care in industrial societies suggests that under regulated capitalism, as in France, or in social democracies, as in Scandinavia, children's welfare is protected because it is viewed as crucial to the children's and the nations' futures.
By contrast, leaving child care exposed to the uncertainties of a largely unregulated free market, as in the United States and Britain, has created conditions that Mrs. Passaris calls crazy. The practice leaves many children with inadequate care and permanently damaged, a costly liability to society.

HEADLINE: A Girl Trout Needs a Boy Trout The Way a Fish Needs a Bicycle

BYLINE: By DENA KLEIMAN

DATELINE: UHL, Idaho

 BODY:
THEY call this stark, spectacular crevice of Idaho the Magic Valley after a trick of nature that sends more than a million gallons of water a minute down its vast canyon walls.
But that is not the only trick of nature going on here at the Clear Springs Trout Company, 120 miles south of Boise. There is another, human trick that now makes it possible for a business executive to orchestrate the production of a fish egg, fertilize it, dictate its sex, hatch it and manipulate its growth rate to produce the ''fresh'' rainbow trout that most people find on their dinner plates - and in far less time than nature intended.
Clear Springs, amid the lava rock along the Snake River here, is one of the largest and most advanced trout farms in the world. And the work it has done here - domesticating wild animals and turning them into the underwater equivalent of the modern farm-raised chicken - reflects a transformation of the entire seafood industry, as aquaculture spreads and techniques improve. 
Fish farming has soared in the United States in recent years as pollution, over-fishing and other environmental problems have depleted supplies of fish in the wild. In 1980, farms provided only about 1 percent of all the fish consumed; today they provide more than 10 percent, according to the Commerce Department, which predicted that the figure would rise to 20 percent by the turn of the century.
Species being farmed today include striped bass, shrimp, tilapia, salmon, sturgeon, redfish, oysters, clams, crayfish and catfish. But none have been farmed as long as trout, nor with such technical sophistication.
The trout was once exclusively wild, and it still evokes images of clear rushing mountain streams and fishermen in rubber boots. But today almost none of the trout eaten by Americans come from the wild. The Agriculture Department said more than 99 percent of the 57 million pounds of trout now consumed each year in this country are farmed. Nearly 60 percent of the trout farmed in the United States are raised in Idaho (the other states include North Carolina and California), and more than half of the Idaho fish come from Clear Springs.
Less than 15 years ago, it took 18 months to grow an edible trout on a farm. (In the wild, it can take up to three years.) Today it takes less than 12 months, and scientists at Clear Springs hope, over the next 15 years, to cut that time in half.
''What we're seeking is a more efficient animal,'' said Larry Cope, the president of Clear Springs. He pointed out that it takes only six weeks to grow a chicken. The secret: female trout. Officials of the company said they hoped to eliminate all males from their stock and breed a super race of trout - all female - because females are better than males in appearance, texture, growth rate and taste. The problem with male trout is that they become unattractive and their texture gets ''mushy'' as they age. They also become combative and waste energy chasing each other.
''They develop a skinny appearance and dark, unattractive skin,'' said Dave Erickson, the director of technical services for Clear Springs.
''They become mushy and the yield goes down,'' said Jim Parsons, a research scientist at the company.
As of mid-July, 62.5 percent of the 22 million trout at Clear Springs were female. The goal over the next three years is to raise that to 100 percent, using genetic tricks and male hormones.
Other companies are also using genetic engineering to make fish farming more efficient. Dr. James P. McVey, an associate program director at the National Sea Grant College Program, which finances aquaculture research for the Commerce Department, said that some 40 percent of all the oysters now being consumed in the United States are sterile oysters that have been altered to channel all their energy into growth rather than reproduction. Other changes are also becoming increasingly widespread, prompting some critics to condemn such genetic manipulation.
''It is a violation of a species' integrity,'' said Jeremy Rifkin, the president of the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington and an outspoken critic of genetic engineering.
And as more and more species are being bred on farms, some wildlife organizations are voicing concern that domesticated and genetically engineered animals could weaken species that are surviving in the wild.
''I've been afraid of this happening,'' said Bill Bakke, the executive director of Oregon Trout, a conservation organization in Portland, when told of Clear Springs's decision to grow nothing but female fish. Mr. Bakke said he feared that genetically altered fish could end up intermingling with wild fish, which must survive under totally different conditions.
In response, Clear Springs said that there was only a remote chance that one of its trout would escape, and that even if one did escape it was unlikely to cause significant damage.
The company's attempts to grow the most trout in the shortest time with the least food in the smallest amount of water are considered the standard for the industry by the National Fisheries Institute, a trade organization for processors. Other companies frequently send observers to Clear Springs for a glimpse, perhaps, of the future.
The company has four farms, which get most of their fertilized eggs from a spawning station 200 miles away in Soda Springs, Idaho. That is where the genetic destiny of male trout is rerouted, and this is how it works:
Mature eggs are removed by hand from specially selected females that have been bred for speed of growth as well as texture, flavor and resistance to disease. Other, similarly selected, females are fed testosterone, a male hormone that causes them to grow male sex organs and enables them to produce sperm.
But while male sperm typically contains an X chromosome and a Y chromosome, these fish remain genetically female, and their sperm contains only X chromosomes. When this sperm is used to fertilize the eggs, which also contain only X chromosomes, the offspring are all female. (The company decided to use this procedure rather than to feed female hormones to male fish because, a Clear Springs spokesman said, it did not want to feed hormones directly to fish that people would eat.) The fertilized eggs are then shipped from Soda Springs to Buhl, where they go to the four farms. Separate farms are maintained to guard against catastrophe; in 1974 the company was almost wiped out when it lost 840,000 pounds of fish in a single night when a wall collapsed and drained an entire farm of water.
Each farm is on about eight acres of land. Each has a ''hatch house,'' a vast greenhouse-like structure that houses the fertilized eggs and youngest fish. At the Box Canyon farm, 20 three-foot high cylinders of circulating water are lined up along one wall in the hatch house. Each holds about 150,000 eggs for 12 days, until they hatch.
Then the eggs are siphoned into 60-foot-long concrete ''ponds'' where they remain for 35 to 40 days, growing to a length of several inches. In the ponds, they are fed a high-calorie mixture of anchovies, herring, wheat germ, molasses and fish oil, mashed to the consistency of moist flour.
There was a time when trout spawned only in the spring. But now through selective breeding and tricks of lighting developed at the company, they can be made to spawn for 10 months of the year. The fish are held in tanks where artifical lighting simulates daylight and the lengthening of the days, tricking them into thinking it is time to spawn.
At the age of about 3 months, the trout are transferred outdoors at each farm to a complex of 180 outdoor raceways, each 18 feet wide and 150 feet long and filled with swiftly moving water that simulates a natural stream. Their growth is monitored by computer and controlled by the amount of feed, which is also developed and manufactured at Clear Springs.
Only a few years ago, trout required three pounds of food to gain one pound in weight, but now they need only about 1.3 pounds of food to gain a pound, in part because of selective breeding and in part because of better understanding of trout digestion.
''Trout are carnivores,'' said Mr. Erickson, the director of technical services. To keep smaller trout from being eaten by bigger trout, a series of gates separate the larger fish from the small. Even though several hundred thousand fish swim around at close quarters, there is no odor at the farm. The only sound is that of rushing water.
Indeed it is the steady supply of water that lures fish farmers to Magic Valley. Not only is the water fresh, clean and constant, its temperature is exactly 58 degrees year round. That means it is always spring - spawning time - for the trout. The water source is a 100-mile-long aquifer that is fed from melting mountain snows to the north.
Six strains of fish that have been bred for rapid growth, superiority of taste and resistance to disease produce the millions of fish at Clear Springs.
These trout remain in their outdoor raceways for 8 to 10 months. Their runways are periodically cleaned of waste, which is donated to local farmers for fertilizer.
As the company receives orders, the fish are taken by truck to a processing plant, where they are cleaned and prepared for sale in a variety of forms: dressed, filleted, frozen and stuffed (the recipe for the stuffing is the company's own). On average, 75,000 pounds of trout are processed each day and are sent in the company's trucks to chains like Shop Rite, Grand Union, Ponderosa and Red Lobster.
''We're not different from other animal industries,'' said Mr. Cope, the Clear Springs president. ''Our animal just lives in the water.''

HEADLINE: Currency Markets;
Tumbling U.S. Dollar Could Hit New Lows

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Weakened by a sluggish economy and the expectation of lower interest rates, the American dollar is tumbling, and many economists expect it to reach or come close to all-time lows against several leading currencies.
The dollar has fallen 3.2 percent against the West German mark over the last three weeks, declining yesterday to 1.5888 against the West German mark, just above its post-World War II low of 1.57. It continued to slide against the Swiss franc, the British pound and many other currencies.
The Japanese yen is the only exception to the trend. While the dollar fell yesterday against the yen, it is still stronger than it was at the beginning of the year, partly because of political problems in Japan and continued uncertainity about economic policy there. 
American corporations with operations in Europe are already benefiting from the fall because their earnings from abroad, when they are translated back into dollars, are worth more. But the declining dollar shrinks the spending power of American tourists abroad.
If the dollar stays at these low levels for several months, American exporters will benefit because the lower dollar makes their products more competitive abroad. It would also make imports more expensive and less attractive to American consumers.
 
Importers Feel the Pinch
Some importers are already feeling the pinch. ''I'm beginning to see substantial increases in the prices of champagne and cognac,'' said Michael Kapon, president of Acker, Merrill and Condit, a liquor store in Manhattan.
Rising import prices here could increase inflation but some economists feel that with a slowing economy and declining demand the impact will be much less than might be expected.
Many analysts have been predicting for much of the year that the dollar would move lower because of rising interest rates abroad and declining rates in the United States. This makes investment in dollar-denominated securities less attractive.
But it took several events in the last three weeks to solidify the bias toward a lower dollar. The Federal Reserve eased credit slightly in mid-July and Alan Greenspan, its chairman, expressed concern about the weakening economy.
Friday's report on the gross national product, which showed that the economy grew more slowly in the second quarter than had been expected and that it is not far from a recession, added further downward pressure on the dollar.
''I don't care what the level of the dollar is, whether it's at its all time low or not,'' said Liliana Nealon, vice president for foreign exchange sales at Union Bank of Switzerland. ''The way to be is short on the dollar.''
This is the first time since 1985 that the dollar has moved significantly without the direct encouragement or obvious objections of the Group of Seven, which includes the United States and its chief economic allies: Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
From 1985 to 1987, the Group of Seven worked with interest rate moves and aggressive market intervention to push the dollar from record highs as a way to reduce the United States trade deficit, which was then at record highs. Since last fall, the Group of Seven has worked to keep the dollar from rebounding again.
The Group of Seven has not raised any objections to the dollar's levels, an indication, analysts said, of its general approval and that member nations are concentrating on domestic economic politics.
Both the Germans and the Japanese want their currencies to be stronger to help fight inflation at home. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is more worried about a recession than the inflationary impact of a lower dollar. And a lower dollar could also help further reduce the American trade deficit by making American exports more competitive and imports more expensive.
So many traders and analysts do not think the Group of Seven will object to the new lows, although they intervened in the market at the beginning of 1987 to keep the dollar from falling below its all-time low of 1.57 marks.
''I don't think that in the given circumstances the U.S. Treasury will fight this,'' said David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services.
In trading yesterday, the dollar closed at 1.5888 marks, which is just above the second-lowest level of 1.5880 reached on Jan. 4, 1988. The dollar hit its record low against the mark, which was created in 1948, on Dec. 31, 1987. Including yesterday's spurt, the German mark has risen 3.3 percent in the last two weeks, while the yen has picked up only 1 percent. It closed at 145.84 to the dollar in late New York trading, up in value from 147.83 late Monday.
The dollar also moved closer to a record low against the Swiss franc, closing at 1.3455 yesterday, the lowest since Jan 20, 1988. Its slide against the British pound to $1.8639 pushed it near a 20-month low, but still far above its all time low, while the drop against the French franc to 5.3255 reached a two and a half year low.
Analysts expect the dollar to fall even further because interest rates are rising abroad. But they generally agree that the dollar will continue to be much stronger against the yen than against European currencies.
Both short and long-term interest rates in Japan have been rising since the end of June and many analysts now expect the Bank of Japan soon to raise its official discount rate, which is now 5.25 percent. In West Germany, rates should remain high and some economists expect the Bundesbank to push interest rates higher to help curb inflation as the two Germanys merge.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve surprised the market with its easing of interest rates on July 13. More easing is expected, but the timing is uncertain.

HEADLINE: Prices Paid to Farmers Unchanged in July

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
The prices farmers get for raw products were unchanged from June to July, but the overall commodity price index was still 2.7 percent above a year before, the Agriculture Department said today.
Prices were higher in the month for lettuce, apples and milk, but declines were reported for cattle, wheat and eggs, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report.
Most prices are mid-July averages that will be revised next month. For example, the latest report showed June prices dropped 2 percent instead of the 1.3 percent decline indicated a month ago. 
The report also showed prices farmers pay to meet expenses were up five-tenths of a percent from April, when the previous estimate was made, and 3.4 percent above July, 1989. The prices paid index is computed quarterly.
Department economists say consumer food prices are going up much faster this year than the earlier prediction of 3 to 5 percent.
Ralph L. Parlett Jr. of the department's Economic Research Service said in a telephone interview that a 1990 forecast due in August will ''put us right back to the early 1980's'' when retail food prices were climbing steeply. Annual food price increases were 8.6 percent in 1980 and 7.9 percent in 1981 before slowing in the next few years.
Mr. Parlett did not disclose the new forecast but indicated the 1990 increase would probably exceed 6 percent. Food prices rose 5.8 percent in 1989, the most since 1981.
''It's obvious that 3 to 5 percent forecast is out in left field,'' he said. ''Beef and pork, that's what's doing it - pork, particularly.''
Recent forecasts show the net cash income of farmers in the range of $55 billion to $59 billion, compared with about $54 billion in 1989. The record was $57.2 billion in 1988.
Based on the preliminary figures, the July price index for livestock and poultry dropped 1.2 percent from June but still averaged 8.9 percent more than a year earlier. Meat animals were down 1.5 percent from June but averaged 11 percent more than a year before.
Milk prices rose 30 cents in July to an average of $14.10 for l00 pounds. That was up $1.50 from July 1989. The farm price of milk rose to a record $16 a hundredweight in December before easing down.
Crop prices, over all, rose 1.6 percent from June but averaged 4.4 percent below the year-earlier level.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Houses Up 3>8%; Some Predict a Turnaround

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
Sales of new homes surged 8 percent in June, the sharpest increase since November, the Government said today.
Many analysts saw the rise as an indication that the sluggish housing industry had bottomed out. ''We believe that the second quarter was the low point,'' said David Seiders, the chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. 
He and other analysts said they expected continued but subdued growth in both new and existing single-family home sales for the rest of the year.
 
May Data Revised
The Commerce Department said new home sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 581,000 units after posting a revised 2.3 percent gain in May. May sales were reported last month to have risen just four-tenths of a percent, the first advance in five months.
The June increase was the sharpest since an 8 percent gain in November. Analysts attributed the increase to lower mortgage rates, which they said should renew interest in home sales.
''We expect mortgage rates to trend downward in the weeks ahead, which should boost sales of new homes as well as existing homes,'' said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.
The group reported last week that sales of existing homes rose 1.2 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.34 million units. It was the first increase since a 3.2 percent gain in November.
The average rate for 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages ranged from 10.10 percent to 10.29 percent in June, according to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. The rate had dropped to 9.98 percent by Friday.
Mark Obrinksy, an economist with Freddie Mac, and other analysts said they did not expect rates to fall much more. They predicted only a gradual increase in future sales.
 
Favorable Weather
Richard Peach, the deputy chief economist with the Mortgage Bankers of America, said favorable weather had attracted buyers in June.
''We had a very soggy April and May, particularly in the eastern part of the country,'' Mr. Peach said. ''When it's cold and damp, people don't like to go out and shop around for new houses.''
Sales in the Northeast, which had been sluggish for more than a year, jumped 36 percent, to an annual rate of 102,000 units. Sales also rose in the South, up 13.6 percent, to an annual rate of 243,000 units.
But they dropped elsewhere. In the West, sales were down 5.8 percent, to an annual rate of 146,000 units; in the Midwest, they were off 4.3 percent, to an annual rate of 90,000 units.
The Commerce Department said the median price of a new home rose 1.6 percent, to $129,900. The median price means half of the homes cost more and half less. The average price advanced 2.1 percent, to $152,900.

HEADLINE: Company News;
New California Park Is Proposed by Disney

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEV, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 31

 BODY:
Intent on creating a second significant attraction in Southern California, home of Disneyland, the Walt Disney Company disclosed plans today for a big park and resort with an ocean theme in Long Beach, Calif., about 20 miles west of Disneyland.
The $2 billion waterfront project, to be called Port Disney, would include five hotels, shopping areas, restaurants and a cruise-ship terminal. The accompanying theme park, tentatively called DisneySea, would feature rides, shows, an aquarium and marine research operations.
Disney has been considering building a new attraction here for several years. At one point, the company considered developing a Hollywood-theme entertainment complex in Burbank, where the company is based, but it abandoned that plan.
Now, Disney says it wants to proceed either at Long Beach or in Anaheim, on land next to Disneyland. The company is pitting Anaheim and Long Beach against each other to see which city will offer the best inducements.
Disney, which has set no completion date for its proposed project, said it would decide on its plans next year.
''A final decision will be based on a number of factors including community support, government approvals, public sector participation and theme park and resort economics,'' said Alan Epstein, vice president of the Disney Development Company.
Industry analysts said it was important to Disney, which has reported record sales and earnings for 22 straight quarters, to continue developing projects to assure strong growth.
The Port Disney proposal encompasses 350 acres, including 250 underwater acres that would be filled. Disneyland is about 180 acres. Two other Disney-owned attractions already on the Long Beach site, the Queen Mary and the Spruce Goose airplane, may be repositioned or moved.
Disney's stock slipped 25 cents today, to $117.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 2, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Company News page in Business Day yesterday about the Walt Disney Company's plans for a theme park in Long Beach, Calif., misstated the company's business relationship with two attractions on the site in some copies. Disney leases and operates the Queen Mary ocean liner and the Spruce Goose airplane; it does not own them.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices on Treasury Bonds Ease

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds eased yesterday in lackluster trading, causing rates to edge up. Dealers described the market's mood as indecisive. Some dealers said a pause was normal after two sessions of sharp advances, but others described the market as confused and contended that the recent price gains had left the market vulnerable to any determined selling.
Few professional traders and speculators, who provide much of the bond market's liquidity, have sold Treasury securities short, and that makes the market vulnerable by reducing a potential reservoir of buying power - those who sell securities short eventually have to buy out of their positions. 
The Treasury's bellwether long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in 2020, were offered late in the day at 103 22/32, off 2/32. This caused the long bond's yield to inch up a basis point, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 8.41 percent.
''It is surprising that the long end of the Treasury bond market held up as well as it did today, given the day's burden of negative news,'' said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. ''The shorter Treasury maturities, which are more influenced by the overnight interbank lending rate as well as Federal Reserve operations, showed the best gains.''
 
Chicago Purchasing Managers
Mr. Kellner noted that about the only positive news for the bond market, which generally reacts positively to bearish economic news, was a report by the Chicago purchasing managers indicating that business was terrible in July. The influential report by the National Association of Purchasing Managers is due out today and is expected to mirror the Chicago data.
The reason negative economic news is positive for investors in fixed-income securities is that it is perceived to lessen inflationary pressures and keep interest rates on competitive investment instruments from rising.
An important element of the day's economic news - a further drop in the dollar's value against key foreign currencies - was decidedly bearish for the fixed-income market because it made dollar-denominated investments less attractive to foreigners.
 
Single-Family Home Sales Up
Also negative was the Government's report of an unexpectedly strong rise of 8 percent in June sales of single-family homes. Moreover, May sales were revised upward to 2.3 percent from a previously reported increase of four-tenths of 1 percent.
The other news from Washington was equally bleak for bondholders. The Congressional Budget Office increased its estimate for the Federal deficit in the current fiscal year to $195 billion, or $60 billion more than its previous estimate six months ago. Mr. Kellner noted that the latest deficit figure was equivalent to 3.6 percent of the Gross National Product, compared with 2.9 percent six months ago.
''While the vote by the House to raise the national debt ceiling by $322 billion, to $3.4 trillion, was expected,'' he said, the market does not know how all these deficit numbers will affect next week's record Treasury refunding auctions. But we do know it will add to the supply of Treasury paper.''
Today, the Treasury will announce the terms of its auctions of three and 10-year notes as well as 30-year bonds that will be sold next Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. After the terms are announced late today, the three issues will then be traded on a when-issued basis and provide some estimate of investor interest in the auctions.
The long notes, the 8 7/8's of the year 2000, were unchanged in price and yield at 103 17/32 and 8.34 pecent, respectively.
Among some representative shorter Treasury maturities, the 8.5 percent notes of 1997 rose 3/32, to 101 8/32, for a yield of 8.26 perent; the 8's of 1992 gained 4/32, at 100 8/32, to yield 7.86 percent.
Demand for Treasury bills caused discount rates to decline. While the 90-day rate dipped a basis point, to 7.49 percent, the six-month bills fell 5 basis points, to 7.32 percent, and the one-year bills also lost 5 basis points, at 7.19 percent.
The Treasury announced that it would auction $4 billion of 44-day cash management bills tomorrow. As usual the bills are denominated in units of $1 million.
The Federal Reserve intervened in the credit markets, adding $2 billion to banking reserves through customer repurchase agreements. Federal funds, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, were at 8 percent at the time and continued to trade at that level for the rest of the session.

Editor Leaving Philadelphia Inquirer

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The executive editor and president of The Philadelphia Inquirer, Eugene L. Roberts Jr., announced unexpectedly yesterday that he would retire on Sept. 1.
Mr. Roberts, 58 years old, is one of the nation's most respected newspapermen. In his 18 years as the top editor of The Inquirer, the paper won 17 Pulitzer Prizes and became a prestigious daily.
His successor is Maxwell E. P. King, currently a senior vice president of The Inquirer. 
 
To Travel and Teach
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Roberts said he had decided to retire to travel and teach, and to clear the way for younger editors at the paper.
But Mr. Roberts has made no secret of his unhappiness with what he regards as the increasingly bureaucratic and profit-oriented management of Knight-Ridder Inc., the Miami-based newspaper chain that owns The Inquirer.
At many newspapers, editors are feeling heavy pressure to trim expenses and increase circulation, as declining advertising sales have cut heavily into profits.
The Inquirer has been highly profitable, but it too is suffering from a weak advertising market in the Northeast. In addition, circulation has been relatively flat for several years, with The Inquirer selling about 500,000 copies daily and about one million on Sundays.
 
Struggle Over Budget
A year ago, Mr. Roberts described the struggle to reach an agreement with Knight-Ridder on a five-year budget plan as a ''brass-knuckle, white-knuckle debate,'' and he has been critical of the emphasis on quarterly earnings among publicly owned newspaper companies.
Yesterday, Mr. Roberts said budget differences were not a factor in his decision to retire. He added that Knight-Ridder, which has a reputation for operating well-regarded newspapers like The Inquirer and The Miami Herald, had been more restrained in its profit expectations than most newspaper groups.
''There haven't been any arteries hit,'' said Mr. Roberts, who will remain with Knight-Ridder as a consultant.
Mr. Roberts also said that his decision was not related to the appointment in March of a publisher at The Inquirer with overall responsibility for both news and business operations. Mr. Roberts had long resisted such a management structure, preferring to report directly to a Knight-Ridder executive in charge of news operations at all of the papers.
 
Tribute From Chairman
James K. Batten, Knight-Ridder's chairman and chief executive, praised Mr. Roberts as ''an inspiration'' to other editors and said his budget disagreements with Knight-Ridder had always been resolved amicably.
Mr. Roberts's successor, Mr. King, is a former editor at The Inquirer who switched to the business side of the paper in 1988. He will have the title of editor of The Inquirer and will become executive vice president of Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., which also publishes The Philadelphia Daily News.
Mr. King, who is 46 and the grandson of Maxwell Perkins, a renowned book editor, currently oversees circulation. Gene Foreman, the managing editor, will become executive editor, reporting to Mr. King.
 
Prickly Independence
Mr. Roberts had a reputation for stubborn, prickly independence that belied his shy manner and eccentricities, like lapsing into prolonged silences in mid-conversation.
Mr. Roberts came to The Inquirer in 1972 from The New York Times, where he had been national editor.
Reporters at The Inquirer said yesterday that much of the paper's news staff regarded Mr. Roberts with awe because of his aggressive news coverage and willingness to underwrite expensive projects.
For instance, Mr. Roberts approved a painstaking 15-month inquiry into who benefited from special provisions of the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The series resulted in a seven-part series that won a Pulitzer Prize.
Donald L. Barlett, a reporter on the tax inquiry, said that the staff feared that without Mr. Roberts, such projects would be considered too expensive.
Mr. King said that he was committed to the values Mr. Roberts had instilled at the paper and felt strongly that Knight-Ridder was similarly committed, but that he was concerned that underlying newspaper economics threatened high-quality journalism at all newspapers.
''I'm no Gene Roberts and I don't think of myself as replacing Gene Roberts,'' Mr. King said. ''But I do think of myself as leading a group of journalists who are dedicated to carrying on his work.''

HEADLINE: Pentagon Drafts Strategy for Post-Cold War World

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The Pentagon has drafted a blueprint for United States military strategy in the 1990's with the assumption that once Soviet forces withdraw from Eastern Europe it would take Moscow up to two years to mobilize for a major invasion.
The plan marks a striking change from the assumption underlying American military strategy during the cold war, that Washington might have as little as two weeks to reinforce NATO forces if Moscow appeared to be marshaling troops and weapons for an attack on Western Europe.
The confidential plan, the details of which unfolded in interviews with several senior Pentagon officials, was presented to President Bush in late June by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It envisions, by about the mid-1990's, cutting the armed forces by 500,000 troops from the current level of 2.1 million, reducing overseas deployments and establishing a new organizational framework for the military.
The plan would also take advantage of the longer warning time of a possible Soviet attack on Europe by creating new Army reserve divisions that could be brought up to full strength only if needed for a prolonged crisis. These ''reconstitutable'' units would be partly manned and their equipment would be held in storage. 
Some senior military officers have criticized the plan, arguing that the cuts go too far. But while it is still being refined by the Pentagon, Bush Administration officials say the main thrust of the blueprint has been favorably received by the President, who is expected to draw on some of the Pentagon's latest planning in a speech on military policy in Aspen, Colo., on Thursday.
The new blueprint represents the first comprehensive effort by senior Pentagon officials, under heavy pressure from Congress to reduce spending, to adapt American strategy and forces to the political and military sea change that has taken place in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
 
Nuclear Forces Will Continue
The changes in the Defense Department's thinking deals more with conventional than with nuclear weapons. Pentagon officials believe the Soviet Union will continue to have a formidable force of long-range nuclear weapons so it can maintain its status as a superpower. Thus, the United States will have to keep a large strategic nuclear force as well.
Until now, the Pentagon has presented only fragmentary suggestions of how it would adjust to receding Soviet tensions, mostly dwelling on budget cutting. This has drawn sharp criticism from members of Congress, who have assailed the Defense Department for failing to articulate a broader vision.
The Pentagon told Congress in June, for example, that it was considering a 25 percent cut in forces over five years and offered a breakdown to illustrate how such a reduction might be accomplished. But that report made no mention of strategy, did not explain the projected cuts in detail and was cast primarily as an exercise to explain the fiscal consequences of force reductions.
 
In Line With Budget Plans
Pentagon officials said the new strategic plan reflected an acceptance that the military budget is in decline. It is generally consistent with current Administration plans to cut military spending, after taking account of inflation, by 10 percent over five years. Somewhat greater savings could be achieved if the pace of the reductions in forces were accelerated.
But at the same time, the plan is intended to help the Pentagon hold the line against more severe budget cuts, by arguing that there is a ''base force'' that the nation cannot go below.
The blueprint is the result of more than five months of planning and meetings, encouraged by Mr. Cheney, and is based on the work of General Powell and Paul Wolfowitz, the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, who oversaw separate efforts to update military planning. General Powell and Mr. Wolfowitz reached similar conclusions about the size of forces needed.
 
Four Basic Components
The new plan, in keeping with the thinking of General Powell, organizes the military into four basic components. It would establish an Atlantic Force that would include armored units and sizable Army and Air Force reserves to guard against a renewed Soviet threat, and to meet threats in the Persian Gulf. There would also be a Pacific Force that would emphasize naval and tactical air units to defend South Korea and other American allies in Asia.
Additionally, the military would have a Contingency Force for rapid response to smaller conflicts in the Third World and to be the leading edge if a major military action became necessary. There would also be the Strategic Force of long-range nuclear weapons.
Based on the revised forecast of the Soviet military threat, the blueprint calls for cutting Army and Air Force units oriented toward the defense of Western Europe.
The United States has already proposed shrinking its force of 305,000 Army and Air Force troops in Europe to 225,000. Pentagon officials say the new plan does not explicitly say what further cuts might be possible there if Moscow completely withdrew its forces from Eastern Europe, as projected by the Defense Department.
But these officials add that the plan implies there would be such further reductions. In fact, senior Pentagon officials are now weighing plans to cut to the level of 100,000 to 125,000 or so if Moscow should withdraw from Eastern Europe.
 
'Reconstitutable' Divisions
The new ''reconstitutable'' Army reserve divisions suggested in the plan are sometimes known as ''cadre'' divisions. The idea is part of a larger proposal advanced by Mr. Wolfowitz for building up forces in a crisis. The broader plan calls for storing equipment from dismantled units, but retaining officers who could provide training and leadership if reconstituting became necessary.
Some elements of the new blueprint have drawn sharp criticism from the services. Pentagon officials said final decisions will not be reached by Mr. Cheney until the commanders in the field and the Joint Chiefs of Staff meet later this month and further studies are completed.
One point of contention revolves around the possibility, raised in deliberations on the plan, that the United States would modify its longstanding policy of keeping some aircraft carriers constantly stationed near areas of potential conflict.
Mr. Wolfowitz and General Powell have reportedly raised the question of reducing the Navy to 11 deployable aircraft carriers as part of a minimal Navy force.
The Navy, which now has 14 deployable carriers, has complained that such a force is not sufficient to keep carriers in the Mediterranean Sea and the Western Pacific constantly, while also maintaining a presence in the Indian Ocean six months of the year. The service says 12 are needed.
An aide to Mr. Cheney said that the Secretary currently favors retaining a force of 12 carriers but that the matter is under review.
 
Marine Corps Objections
The Marine Corps objects to the blueprint's proposal to reduce the service to about 150,000 men, a 25 percent cut. Gen. Alfred M. Gray, the Marine commander, has argued that the 196,000-member corps should not be reduced below 180,000. The Marines argue that the corps is needed more than ever to deal with conflicts in the third world.
Top Army officials appear reconciled to the proposal to cut the service to 12 active divisions from 18. But Army officials are cautious about the idea of creating two ''reconstitutable'' reserve divisions, expressing concern that it could lead to even sharper cuts. In addition to the two ''reconstitutable'' units, the blueprint would keep six other reserve divisions.
Senior Air Force officials have said the service needs more than the roughly 25 active and reserve tactical air wings suggested by the new blueprint. The Air Force currently has about 36 air wings and has proposed shrinking that to 28.
Pentagon officials say the new plan assumes that Soviet forces will be withdrawn from Europe by the mid-1990's, that a new East-West conventional arms agreement will be reached and that the Western alliance will be intact.
Following such developments, Moscow would still able to launch limited attacks on the northern and southern flanks of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or even in central Europe. But the Soviet Union would need a year or two of preparation to fight a conventional war involving a multifront attack on Western Europe.
The study also assumes that third world powers like Iraq, which is already regarded as a formidable opponent, will become more powerful. The growth of regional powers in the Middle East is leading to some important modifications in military planning.
Because a nation like Iraq could attack on short notice, the warning is likely to be less than it would be for a Soviet invasion, Pentagon planners say. To cope with such regional threats, planners are emphasizing tactical air forces, instead of ground troops, and might draw on forces from the Pacific as well as from the Atlantic.

HEADLINE: Afghan on a Sudden Trip to Moscow

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Aug. 1

 BODY:
As Afghan rebel leaders and Pakistani officials await the results of talks on Afghanistan between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, attention here and in Kabul is riveted on the sudden and mysterious trip to Moscow by the Afghan leader, Najibullah.
An embassy in Kabul, reached by radiophone today, reported that President Najibullah had taken several high-ranking military officers and the Soviet Ambassador to Afghanistan with him to the Soviet Union on the eve of the Baker-Shevardnadze meeting in Irkutsk in Siberia, which began today. The Afghan leader was also accompanied on the trip by his immediate family, it was reported here.
President Najibullah has been giving mixed signals over the last few weeks about his willingness to cooperate in a Soviet-American plan, still under discussion, that would end outside arms supplies to the warring Afghan factions and set up an impartial electoral process. Mr. Najibullah is sustained by at least 20 Soviet flights a day, costing Moscow billions of dollars a year. 
In recent days, the Afghan leader appeared to be reneging on promises to give up much of his power to speed the transition to a new political order. This concession would be crucial to American acceptance of his continued presence in an interim government.
 
An Unannounced Trip
After President Najibullah left on an unannounced trip to Moscow on Saturday, the official Kabul radio said he was going for a ''medical checkup.'' Soviet officials called it a vacation. Kabul radio has not commented since.
It is considered significant that an Acting President was named in Mr. Najibullah's absence. He is Abdul Rahim Hatif, who formerly served the exiled King, Zahir Shah. Mr. Hatif, who is considered a moderate in Afghan terms, is not a Communist. The former King recently met Peter Tomsen, the United States envoy to the Afghan insurgents.
While Western diplomats and Pakistani officials say that no major breakthroughs are expected in the Siberian talks, they acknowledge that the Afghan issue has become the almost total preserve of Washington and Moscow and that even information is scarce here. The increasing cooperation between Soviet and American officials has made a palpable difference in the Pakistani capital, which feels for the first time in years like a diplomatic and strategic backwater.
 
U.S.-Soviet Meeting
IRKUTSK, U.S.S.R., Thursday, Aug. 2 (Special to The New York Times) -Foreign Minister Shevardnadze said at a joint news conference today that the Soviet Union had agreed to suspend production of the SS-24 rail mobile system. But American officials said they were not certain how significant the Soviet concession is, because it is unclear how many more of these intercontinental missiles the Soviets had intended to produce.
Secretary of State Baker and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze went fishing in Siberia on Wednesday as they discussed Afghanistan, arms control and a possible summit meeting before the end of the year.
Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze spent the day on Lake Baikal, first on a hydroplane and then on a fishing boat. Neither had much success as anglers, with the Soviet Foreign Minister managing to catch the only fish of the day -an omul, a type of trout.
As the two were about to leave from the dock on the Angara River, Mr. Shevardnadze said it was a coincidence that the two would discuss Afghanistan today and Thursday as President Najibullah is visiting the Soviet Union.
Soviet journalists covering the Baker-Shevardnadze meeting said they understood that President Najibullah would meet with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss his possible removal from office in preparation for elections - an approach endorsed by the Bush Administration.
Neither Mr. Baker nor Mr. Shevardnadze would discuss details of their Afghanistan discussions. ''We have things to discuss about Afghanistan,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said. ''I'll not call those new ideas, but we'll see.''
Mr. Baker said, ''We are moving closer together on Afghanistan,'' but he cautioned that it did not mean that ''the people that we've been aligned with have come any closer to a settlement.''
Without going into details, the two Foreign Ministers said they were discussing scheduling for a future meeting between President Bush and President Gorbachev, arms control in Europe and future American technical aid to help the Soviets develop a market economy.

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis today signed the $13.4 billion budget the Legislature sent to him on Saturday, ending seven months of bitter negotiations.
Mr. Dukakis also signed a separate measure, a $1.4 billion financing bill, that will allow the state to issue bonds to pay bills that current tax revenues are insufficient to cover. The Governor said the budget and the borrowing authorization ''will finally restore our fiscal stability and set the stage for economic recovery.''
State leaders have been struggling with budget deficits since 1988, when the economy began to slow down after years of steady growth.
Legislators had been unable to agree on a balanced budget for the current fiscal year, which began July 1, until last Saturday, when they approved 4 percent across-the-board cuts in several categories of spending. Human services, higher education and aid to municipalities were the hardest hit.
The new budget relies on revenue from a $1.8 billion tax increase that became law on July 18. The increase comes from higher levies on income and gasoline and an expansion of the sales tax to nearly 600 services not previously covered, including, for example, legal and accounting services,

HEADLINE: America's Neck and a New Noose

 BODY:
Even before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, America's energy situation was looking increasingly ominous. Fact one: Imports accounted for a record 50 percent of the oil consumed by the U.S. during the first half of 1990. Fact two: The oil cartel, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, this week raised its target price for oil by 17 percent.
This combination of increasing dependence and price was cause for concern by itself. Now add the possibility of military upheaval, and there are all the ingredients of a new energy noose, like the one that caused Americans to choke in the 1970's. 
The U.S. can't do much about its declining oil production or OPEC's prices. But it can curb its voracious appetite for oil by imposing higher energy taxes. And, by enlarging the Strategic Reserve, it can protect itself against the temporary supply crises that might follow from Iraq's action.
The 1980's were kind to oil importers. Mexico, the North Sea and other non-OPEC sources blossomed. OPEC's ability to enforce high prices waned, even among its members.
That's not surprising; cartels are inherently unstable. At first, OPEC members embraced strict production quotas in order to create artificial scarcity. That jacked up prices tenfold. But the exorbitant prices created an irresistible desire by some members to sell more than their assigned quotas. In time, they cheated - and prices plummeted.
Oil-importing countries helped their own cause by cutting back demand. The U.S. now uses a third less oil, compared with the size of the economy, than in 1973. That's progress.
The 90's look less kind to importing countries. Britain's North Sea oil and America's production from the North Slope are petering out. And now Iraq's aggression against Kuwait adds more uncertainty. By threatening Kuwait last week, Iraq delivered a stern warning to all OPEC members to stop cheating. Judging from the quick bargain struck at this week's OPEC meeting, the warning was heeded. But now the possibility looms of a disruption in oil shipments from the Middle East.
Before Iraq's move these developments were troubling but not alarming. Non-OPEC oil exporters are numerous. Supplies of natural gas outside the Middle East are large. And the U.S. has effective ways to counter the OPEC oil cartel:
Store more oil for an emergency. America created its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975 after the 1973 oil crisis. But the reserve holds only slightly more than half the original target of a billion barrels. Morris Adelman, an energy economist at M.I.T., urges an increase to at least 750 million barrels - enough to offset a 10 percent loss of imports for two years.
Such a loss would be far worse than the crises of 1973 and 1979, when imports fell less than 5 percent. Yet these disruptions became catastrophes because panicky consumers and suppliers hoarded every barrel in sight. By guaranteeing ready access to oil, an ample Strategic Reserve would calm nerves and ward off panic. Mr. Adelman warns, however, that administrative procedures must be changed so that the oil would be immediately available.
Enhance conservation with energy taxes. Another ingredient of a sound energy policy is lower demand. A sizable energy tax, phased in over time and with offsets for the poor, would lower demand for oil imports and reduce the Federal deficit and clean up the environment.
OPEC is unlikely ever again to voluntarily sock oil-importing countries with precipitous price hikes. That would drive customers into the welcoming arms of non-OPEC oil exporters, hasten conversion to natural gas and other fuels, and promote conservation. But even if the noose is not pulled to the point of strangulation, it can hurt. The U.S. needs to cut itself a bit more slack.

HEADLINE: Don't Let Congress Hobble the Cable Industry;
Fiber Optic Highway

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 22 editorial ''Furious About Cable'' makes a point, but misses the target.
Yes, viewers are angry, and the Cable Act of 1984 is not working. But the goal should not be a country of happy cable watchers, tranquilized by movies at home. The goal should be the development of diverse technologies that will serve the broader public interests of home education, health care delivery, telecommuting and international competitiveness.
That goal requires a broad-band fiber optic network - an information highway, really - to every home, school and business in America. Spurring that network will take more than ''light-touch reregulation.''
Night's courage may be day's timidity. Your ''no rush'' policy is too cautious. Rand studies notwithstanding, the United States needs to create opportunity, not just satisfy demand. There is enough daylight now for us to move as a country toward telecommunications excellence.
The people may be ''furious about cable,'' but they are curious about much more. The Information Age is already here. Let's not lose the opportunity to build, for all of us, a truly global economy.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Has Earned No Environmental Role

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Whether the motives that Robert Bazell attributes to Senator Sam Nunn for proposing a strategic environmental research program are true or not (''Rapid Employment Force,'' Op-Ed, July 12), the Senator is correct in his assessment that the military, which now absorbs nearly 70 percent of all Federal research and development funds, will not continue to require all these resources in the future.
Senator Nunn's suggestion that some of these research resources be redeployed to deal with the country's urgent environmental, energy and competitiveness problems is a wise one; but his plan for doing so is seriously flawed for a number of reasons. Among others:
* Government departments with internally competing interests and tasks are doomed to immobilizing inefficiency and hopeless tangling in Congressional committees. Environmental research that competes for funds and attention with military projects within the Department of Defense and Department of Energy is destined for wasteful atrophy. 
* Pentagon-led research and development has been marked by chronic cost overruns and often produces costly, complicated, unreliable or unworkable systems. There is no reason to believe that the Pentagon can develop cost-effective civilian products that would succeed in the competitive international marketplace as the Senator hopes.
* The Federal Government must maintain an ''even field'' and not favor weapons research facilities over private industry that not only pays taxes and has to survive in a competitive environment, but also knows best how to operate in it. To provide environmental research and development funds to military research and developing installations preferentially would be choosing winners and losers, at best a dubious proposition in a market economy such as ours.
* Exclusively military research and development facilities were established and maintained to provide the necessary secrecy that must surround weapons development. Secrecy is not needed for environmental research, and therefore such facilities and their research can be safely removed from military controls.
There is no nationally rational reason for the military to become involved in research and development that addresses the problems of the society's metabolism - that is, the process of energy extraction, use and waste disposal that sustains the myriad activities of society. The United States needs a broad, well-coordinated national environmental-energy-competitiveness technical policy that cannot be implemented into the needed civilian technology base as a sideshow of the country's military oligarchy.

HEADLINE: To Expand Javits Center, Reopen the Coliseum

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The proposal that New York City's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center be enlarged (news article, July 18) at the same time recognizes a need and neglects simpler and less expensive means of solving the problem and doing so immediately.
For the four years since the opening of the Javits Center, the New York Coliseum in Columbus Circle has remained dark. While by no means a perfect exposition facility, it served its purpose well, and could do so again. From being a burden to the city it could become highly profitable, producing revenue, directly and indirectly, for the city's economy.
The Coliseum could house expositions that can find no home in New York because of the Javits's crowded schedule. Although some of the shows implicitly indicated as shunning New York because of the Javits's inadequate space would not come here because of high costs and more sinister causes, other large shows could, by using both the Javits and the Coliseum. While division of a large exposition is not ideal, it has precedents in other cities. The separation between the two is only a mile and a half, an easy link by bus.
Reopening the Coliseum, perhaps under Javits administration, could achieve the proposed expansion painlessly at great savings and restore a litigation-plagued building to its role as an asset.

HEADLINE: Who Robbed the S.&L.'s? Congress.

BYLINE: By Jim Leach; Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, is a member of the House Banking Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The most captivating news story in my home state last year concerned an attempted robbery of tragicomic proportions.
At the end of the basketball season, a star forward on the Iowa State University team walked into the campus Burger King, without a mask, carrying a rifle. He asked the high school sophomore at the counter to hand over the money in the cash register. The team's picture featuring this strapping athlete was on the wall. The teen-ager recognized him with a ''Hi, Sam.'' He looked up and responded, ''It's not me!'' 
The savings and loan scandal is another kind of robbery, the biggest bank heist in history - one that goes beyond the bank vaults to pick the pocket of every American. And the picture of another pin-striped team is on the wall: It is the biannual official photograph of Congress.
The savings and loan debacle symbolizes the breakdown in discipline in legislative bodies, especially at the committee level, where interest groups target their attention and dollars. Committees are designed to be delegated centers of legislative expertise. Too often they have become advocacy rather than oversight oriented, failing to provide stop signals for the inevitable train wrecks.
In modern politics, legislative reputations are generally made by extremists, those who push the biggest programs or tax cuts, or who advocate the greatest new powers for Government or the private sector.
With savings and loans, the committees of jurisdiction in Congress failed to rein in the powers that regulators had allowed the thrifts - to over-leverage capital, buy junk bonds and make speculative investments. They chose instead to encourage the continuation of patently imprudent practices.
During the 1980's, the two costliest code words in the legislative lexicon became ''direct investments.'' Thrifts were released from their social contract to make home loans -the historical quid pro quo for receipt of Federal deposit insurance - and given license to speculate in commercial real estate and leveraged buyouts. Instead of following the Wall Street precept that ''first loss is best loss,'' gullible legislators bought the claim of Charles Keating and other industry insiders that inflation-ravaged thrifts could beat insolvency by gambling with other people's money.
From a Sun Belt perspective the gamble worked: The wealth of the Midwest and Northeast was transferred on a one-shot basis to the Southwest and West. While graft was rampant, not all of the deposits were frittered away. A localized infrastructure of homes and modern offices was built that will stand for a generation as a government-induced incentive for migration to those states with the most lax regulation.
This criminal transfer of wealth from one region to another, from middle-class taxpayers to lubricious high rollers, occurred because legislative bodies abandoned the national interest and represented regional and industry concerns. Once an innumerate Congress ceased to require prudent capital ratios and sanctioned phony accounting and capricious powers, the Government's gold could be stolen without breaking into Fort Knox.
Ironically, it was the alleged defenders of the little guy in American politics who led the charge to transform an industry created under Franklin Roosevelt to serve small savers and average homeowners into a privileged preserve for the moneyed elite.
The only honor that can be salvaged from this fiscal Vietnam - the chance to hold the ''ins'' accountable for privatizing profit and socializing loss - must be a demand for campaign reform, for fair rules, for competitive opportunity in American political as well as economic life. The $20 a month that the average American family must pay Uncle Sam for the next 30 years amounts to a Congressional Watergate, depriving Congress, particularly its majority party, of the moral authority to defend the political status quo.
In Chinese history there is a theory of revolution based upon a ''mandate of heaven.'' A government may be overthrown when a catastrophe - a drought, flood or earthquake - signals the necessity. The question of the 1990's is whether the American people are concluding that the conflicts of interests that cost real people real money are of such earthquake proportions that the mandate of governance ought to be removed from the Democratic political establishment, which has controlled Congress and the majority of state legislatures during the past half-century.
The challenge to Republicans is to stake out the position as the party of reform. The future belongs to the political party that puts the S.& L. crooks in jail and removes America's legislative bodies from the control of moneyed influence peddlers.

HEADLINE: Former Associate Sues Rinfret Over Business

 BODY:
A former business associate of Pierre A. Rinfret, the Republican candidate for governor, has filed a lawsuit charging that Mr. Rinfret went back on a promise to give him a share in his investment businesses.
In the suit, Arthur E. Greco also contends that Mr. Rinfret lost a substantial amount of his clients' money in the October 1987 stock market plunge. In an interview, Mr. Greco's lawyer, Donald Chase, asserted that some clients of the investment company, Rinfret Inc., lost 80 percent of their money in the stock collapse.
The suit also accuses Mr. Rinfret, an economic consultant, of making personal investments that ran counter to those he made for his clients.
Mr. Rinfret's son and business partner, Peter Alan Rinfret, said they would not comment on the suit.
The lawsuit said the Rinfrets persuaded Mr. Greco in February 1987 to leave his job at J. P. Morgan Securities by promising a $75,000 annual salary and 16 percent of their investment business. The suit seeks money equal to this share and punitive damages.

HEADLINE: Phil D. Fine, Lawyer, Dies at 64; Key Force in Boston Development

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Phil David Fine, a lawyer who played an important role in several major development projects in Massachusetts, died Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 64 years old and lived in Boston.
His family said the cause of death was heart failure. 
In the early 1970's, Mr. Fine assembled the investment group that built Schaefer Stadium, now Foxboro Stadium, outside Boston for the New England Patriots football team. The stadium was the first since the 1920's to be built solely with private financing.
 
Revival of Languishing Plan
He was also instrumental in the redevelopment of Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston, the first of several projects in historic areas of Eastern cities undertaken by the Rouse Company of Maryland. The proposal had been languishing for a decade when he won approval in 1973 for Rouse to restore Faneuil Hall, then a decaying property in the heart of Boston that dated to Revolutionary times. The exteriors of the market buildings were preserved, and shops, restaurants and other services were housed inside.
To clear the way for the construction of Exchange Place, a 40-story skyscraper using the facade of the old Boston Stock Exchange, Mr. Fine worked out design compromises with city officials and preservation interests permitting his client, Olympia & York of Toronto, to start the project.
In recent years he was a consultant to the Government of Israel and the City of Jerusalem on construction of the Mamilla project, the largest urban development effort in that country.
Mr. Fine, who was born in Brookline, Mass., was a graduate of Northeastern University and the Boston University School of Law. He was a founding partner of the law firm of Fine & Ambrogne in Boston and later of White, Fine & Verville in Washington.
In 1961 and 1962, he was Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration in the Kennedy Administration. He was a founder of the Commonwealth Bank of Boston in 1964.
Mr. Fine was an overseer and trustee of Northeastern University. He was president of the American Jewish Historical Society for two years before becoming its chairman last May.
He is survived by his wife, the former Norma Loew; three daughters, Susan and Debra, both of Manhattan, and Lauri Friedman of Haifa, Israel; two sisters, Tina Mintz of Norwood, Mass., and Leona Vetstein of Newton, Mass.; a brother, Ralph, of Boston, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Legal Leg for Designers

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
AFTER years of legal wrangling, the design field in New York state has taken a step toward professional legitimacy with the signing by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of a bill that provides for state certification of interior designers.
The bill, the LaValle-Koppell bill, resulted from an agreement between the architectural profession and interior designers on the scope of designers' work. Architects initially opposed the bill, which establishes for the first time legal definition of interior design in the state that is widely considered the nation's design capital. The Governor's office announced yesterday that the bill was signed Monday.
The law is intended to set a higher standard for the profession and to give designers higher status by establishing a category of certified interior designers. Those who wish to be certified must have a minimum of seven years of education and professional training, and must pass two examinations. The law goes into effect next June 1. 
Theoretically the law will help clarify who's who in a field where people arbitrarily call themselves interior decorators and interior designers, a distinction that has been virtually meaningless until now. In New York State, people will still be able to practice as interior decorators, space planners, home fashion consultants and even as the so-called housewife decorators as long as they do not use the title certified interior designer.
In a move led by architects - and one that may cause widespread chagrin - the bill contains no grandfather clause exempting established designers from its provisions. To call themselves certified, even seasoned professionals with academic training will be required within two years to take two comprehensive examinations, one a design qualifying exam and the other on city and state fire, safety and building codes.
This has already created some angst as famous designers contemplate being trapped in a room with pencil and paper. ''I'll probably fail,'' said Mario Buatta, the maestro of chintz.
New York is the eighth state, plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, to recognize interior designers legally. Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Virginia, New Mexico and California have passed laws with varying degrees of strictness; in Illinois a bill is pending.
For the designers, who have lobbied vigorously for five years in Albany in a protracted territorial feud with architects, the bill's passage may go a long way toward improving a longstanding image problem. It will legally distinguish the work of interior designers, who may become involved in reorganizing space by moving certain nonstructural partitions, from the work of architects, who are legally authorized to make decisions about the physical structure and systems in a building.
''There's been a lack of credibility,'' said Noel Jeffrey, an interior designer in Manhattan who has supported the bill. ''A segment of the population still thinks of us as glorified shoppers.''
Until the act, an amendment to the education law governing the use of the title certified interior designer, there was no official body to monitor professional qualifications among interior designers. Membership in organizations like the American Society of Interior Designers, which has 32,000 members nationwide representing but a small percentage of the estimated 200,000 interior designers in the country, is strictly voluntary; the society has no means to regulate competence.
Nor was there any consumer protection. The new law is meant to protect consumers by creating a state board for interior design to monitor certification and professional conduct. Its members will be appointed by the Board of Regents.
''Up until now anyone could go hang a shingle and call themselves an interior designer, whether they were the owner of a paint store or a graduate of F.I.T.,'' said Susan Forbes, a partner in Forbes-Ergas Design Associates in Manhattan and a board member of Interior Designers for Legislation, a coalition of six organizations that has been lobbying for a certification law since 1984.
''We feel very good about the strength of the bill,'' said Ruth Lynford, a partner in Lynford Mayo Associates Inc. and president of the designers' lobbying coalition. ''No other state has passed a law with two exams, including one on codes. We feel the bill shows seriousness of purpose and a willingness to take on responsibility and accountability.''
The law does not go so far as to prohibit anyone else from operating in the domain of interior design. (State law does restrict the practice of architecture to registered architects.) The laws on interior design in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are ''practice acts,'' meaning that ''unless you have the qualifications, you cannot call yourself an interior designer nor can you practice interior design,'' said Jean Richmond, director of government and public affairs for the American Society of Interior Designers.
The New York law is expected to create a demand for certified designers. ''I think it's a very good thing,'' said Georgina Fairholme, a Manhattan designer. ''This will divide the real workers from the 'social' workers.''
Interior decorators and designers and architects have long been involved in a tug of war over turf. In New York, where the New York State Association of Architects lobbied against state certification for designers until an agreement was reached at the 11th hour, the architects' most strenuous disagreements were over which aspects of interior construction constituted the architect's domain and which the interior designer's.
The architects argued that construction of even non-load-bearing interior walls, for example, significantly affects a building and is therefore the architect's responsibility. They also objected to an earlier version of the bill, which had a provision enabling designers to stamp drawings that would be accepted by municipal building departments without full review by an architect or engineer.
''You would have had interior designers involved in issues of public health, safety and construction technology, for which they do not have educational and training experience,'' said Randolph R. Croxton, a New York architect who is a director of the architects' association.
Lee Bearsch, a Binghamton, N.Y., architect who is president of the state association, said, ''We were concerned that certification would confuse the public into thinking a person who'd picked out curtains and colors could do the equivalent of architecture.''
The new law defines the type of interior construction designers can perform as ''not materially related to or materially affecting the building systems''; according to several designers, details are open to interpretation. Passage of the bill demonstrates official recognition that what designers do goes beyond comfort and esthetics to affect the public health, safety and welfare.
The bill, named for its legislative sponsors, State Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, Republican of Suffolk County, and Assemblyman G. Oliver Koppell, Democrat of the Bronx, is also an acknowledgment of the growth of the profession. From its origins early in the century, when self-taught decorators like Elsie de Wolfe - a woman with good taste and a business card - pioneered the field, Interior Design magazine estimates that interior design in the United States has grown into a $31 billion industry, $7 billion of that in New York State.
Most designers were called decorators until the 1950's. But in the last two decades, there has been a demand for services that go beyond decorating and furniture arrangement to involve knowledge of space planning, flammability and toxicity of materials, and building codes.
Robert Gutman, a professor of architecture at Princeton University who has written extensively on the architectural profession, said that among architects, interior design ''tends to be regarded as a less important subject,'' even though some of the world's greatest interior spaces have been designed by architects. In architecture, traditionally a male-dominated profession, interior design ''has also suffered from the fact it has historically been associated with female roles,'' he said.
In recent years competition and a growing demand for interior design services resulted in many large architectural firms forming interior design departments.
''What's generally creating the current brouhaha is the market growth in interior work environments,'' Professor Gutman said. ''The issue is, whose turf is it? Especially in times of economic anxiety, the architectural profession is anxious to maintain its hold on the market.''
Mr. Croxton, for one, thinks the lines between the two professions are blurring. ''The notion of architecture as a box and someone coming along to decorate it later is outdated,'' he said. ''Some of the best work today is being done in a collaborative environment in which the two disciplines are being merged.''
Professor Gutman said: ''The bill gives interior designers a greater degree of legitimacy than they have had historically, and establishes a legal umbrella through which disputes can be resolved. But whether or not it will result in a better built environment is hard to say.''
Many decorators and designers welcomed the certification as a necessary fact of modern life. ''Although we are all reluctant for government intervention, the nature of the work has become much more taxing and demanding than it used to be,'' the designer Mark Hampton said.
''Sixty-four years ago, when I started, there wasn't even such a thing as a decorating school,'' said Sister Parish, a grand dame of decorating. She heartily approves of the bill. But, citing her age - 80 - she said she would not be taking the exams.

HEADLINE: From Honda, an Exotic Challenge

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., July 31

 BODY:
The Acura NSX sports car that will be roaring down American roads later in August has swooping lines, a heart-stopping 168-mile-an-hour top speed and a long list of other characteristics that the Honda Motor Company says a competitive ''super car'' should have.
Still, at $60,000 for two seats, the car will appeal to only a few thousand buyers. But beyond the exotic looks and near race-car performance, the NSX represents a clear technical leap forward that could mean stronger sales for all Honda luxury cars.
''The true significance of this car is the way it enhances Acura's high-performance image,'' said Christopher Cedergren of J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive-marketing consulting firm in Westlake Village, Calif. ''With the NSX, you can have a sexy, exotic performance car with the maintenance cost of a Honda Accord.'' 
The NSX, shown to reporters at a race track here this week, also symbolizes the Japanese auto industry's determination to place challengers into every marketing niche of the industry, no matter how small.
In building the NSX, Honda extensively redesigned outside body parts and inside components to reduce size and weight. It also refined the engine technology to coax enormous power from six cylinders.
The resulting car, due in American showrooms in two weeks, makes Honda the first Japanese auto maker to offer a vehicle that matches the lightning-fast performance characteristics of the super cars from Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche that cost $100,000 and more.
Honda engineers say innovations introduced in the NSX will appear in other new models destined for the American market, starting with two new Acura sports luxury models that are to be introduced within nine months.
To show off the NSX's handling and performance characteristics, Honda executives have been inviting automotive journalists and reviewers to race tracks around the country, including the Portland International Raceway, for test drives. Porsche and Ferrari models were provided for comparison.
 
Extremely Glowing Reviews
Suprisingly, the NSX's gears and clutch feel the same as those in regular Hondas. But the power and sound of the engine seem awesome to one accustomed to conventional cars. Just a few seconds after pressing the accelerator, the driver can see the speedometer closing on 110 miles an hour. Despite the high speed, there is little sense of danger or urgency, even in fairly sharp curves.
NSX stands for ''new sports car experimental,'' as it was called internally while it was under development. The car has already been trumpeted on the covers of most car magazines and has received extremely glowing reviews, even by the standards of the sometimes boosterish automotive press.
One important development in the car was the use of aluminum for NSX's body, rather than steel or plastic. Aluminum is 40 percent lighter than steel but also five or six times more expensive and very difficult to bend and weld because it tears easily. Honda engineers said that what they learned about special welding equipment, dies and aluminum alloys could result in more aluminum parts on future cars, especially if energy prices increase and fuel efficiency standards get stricter, requiring lighter-weight vehicles.
 
Multivalve Technology
The NSX's engine is placed in the middle of the car behind the two-seat passenger compartment, which is unusual but not new. The engine derives much of its uncanny power from the four valves on each of the six cylinders, rather than the more common two. The additional valves allow more air in and out of the combustion chambers where the fuel ignites, resulting in more power.
This multivalve technology, found on most Japanese-made cars, normally requires a small sacrifice in power when the engine is operating at low speeds or starting to move from a standing stop.
To overcome that effect, Honda developed special electromechanical valve controls that enable the NSX to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles an hour in less than six seconds, a rare feat. The Nissan Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan is the only other car available in the United States to offer similar technology.
Relentless efforts to cut the size of components to make them fit in the compact NSX left a comparatively large amount of elbow and leg room for driver and passenger and good visibility in all directions - features not found in similar cars.
 
Honda's Sales Goal
If the three new Acura models are as successful as the current two, they will probably vault Honda well past the Chrysler Corporation as the nation's third-best selling car company, after the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company.
''If this puts us ahead of Chrysler, then it does,'' said Thomas Elliott, executive vice president of Honda's American sales organization. ''Frankly, our goal is to sell a million cars a year'' within the next five years.
Currently, Honda and Acura sell about 840,000 cars a year; the auto maker was selling 552,000 cars in 1985, before the Acura was introduced. Meanwhile, Chrysler, which once sold about a million cars a year, has seen its sales slide to a level just slightly higher than Honda's.
By itself, the NSX will have only a marginal effect on the American car market. Honda hopes to sell 3,000, just a drop in the sea of 14 million to 15 million vehicles of all kinds sold annually.
So far this year, Japanese car brands have captured a 28.4 percent share of the American market, up from 24.3 percent a year earlier.
 
Psychological Effect
But the greatest effect of Honda's new sports car could be psychological. Honda is hoping that attention to the NSX will spill over Acura's entirely redesigned Legend sedan, scheduled to make its debut this fall, as well as a second new Acura sedan, equipped with a five-cylinder engine, that will be smaller than the Legend but larger than the sporty Integra compact.
The expanded array of Acura vehicles is primarily aimed at customers of sporty European luxury cars like some Mercedes-Benz and BMW models, at current Honda owners and at owners of Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti brands.
Honda, whose racing engines have dominated the Formula One car racing circuit for several years, began developing the Acura NSX five years ago. The concept meshed with the auto maker's overall American marketing strategy, which was to create a separate line of sports luxury vehicles in 1986. In its first year, Acura sold 52,869 cars; last year that number had grown to 142,061, surpassing BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Japan Agree On Telecommunications

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Japan agreed today to open up its telecommunications market further to foreign companies, meeting an Aug. 1 deadline for possible American retaliation, United States officials said.
The tentative agreement, expected to be signed in Tokyo Thursday, should pave the way for American companies to win hundreds of millions of dollars of sales in Japan, they said.
''This agreement represents an important step toward giving U.S. firms in Japan access comparable to the access Japanese firms enjoy in the United States,'' the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said. 
 
What the Agreement Covers
The agreement, reached in Tokyo after 13 days of talks, covers both telecommunications equipment and services.
Mrs. Hills said Japan agreed to liberalize its large and fast-growing market for such advanced telecommunications services as voice mail and electronic banking.
The Japanese market in such services is estimated at about $700 million per year now and American officials estimate that it could grow to close to $2.5 billion by 1994.
Tokyo pledged to simplify regulations so that it would be easier for foreign companies to enter the market, United States officials said.
American companies will be able to communicate electronically - internally, among affiliates and with regular customers and suppliers - essentially free of regulation.
''As a result, U.S. manufacturing, financial and other firms that do business with Japan should be able to run those operations more easily and economically,'' Mrs. Hills said.
Also under the agreement, American companies will be able to sell network channel terminating equipment directly in Japan, rather than having to go through Japanese companies like the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation.
Network channel terminating equipment acts like a modem to connect computers to digital telephone networks. $150 Million Market ''Industry sources estimate that the U.S. share of Japan's market could be at least $150 million annually,'' Mrs. Hills said.
She said Japan also promised to enact safeguards against anticompetitive conduct in the telecommunications services sector.
''These agreements will play a growing role in maintaining the competitiveness of American firms in providing benefits for consumers worldwide,'' Mrs. Hills said.

HEADLINE: Kodak Profits Rise Sharply

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, N.Y., Aug. 1

 BODY:
The Eastman Kodak Company said today that its earnings had risen nearly fivefold in the second quarter from results that were depressed by a large restructuring charge a year ago.
The photographic giant earned $384 million, or $1.19 a share, for the second quarter, compared with $77 million, or 24 cents a share, in the 1989 period, when results were reduced by $227 million because of restructuring costs. The company said that excluding that charge, its profit was up 26 percent, from $304 million, or 94 cents a share, in 1989.
It was the first quarterly earnings increase for the company since 1988.
Sales for the quarter rose 2 percent, to $4.87 billion, from a restated $4.77 billion in 1989.
Kodak, the most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange, rose $4.25, to $42.375.
''Barring unexpected developments in the general economy or dramatic changes in currency valuations, we look forward to continued recovery in Kodak earnings and to a strong second-half performance,'' said Kay R. Whitmore, Kodak's chairman and chief executive.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Remain Level

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The Government's main gauge for forecasting the direction of the economy did not budge in June, the Commerce Department said today in a report that analysts said was a sign of a listless economy in the months ahead.
The index of leading indicators, designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months in advance, was unchanged from the month before for the second time this year. It had risen in March and May and fallen in February and April. 
Many economists had expected a small increase in June. If the index were to fall for three straight months, it could signal a forthcoming recession.
 
A Consistent Pattern
''This meandering is consistent with what is happening in the economy,'' said Darryl Delano, an economist with Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass. ''It all nets out to basically nothing.''
But other analysts, including David Jones, an economist with the New York securities dealer Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, expressed deeper concern.
''What we have got is an economy that is slowly sinking into possibly a mild recession by either late this year or early next,'' Mr. Jones said.
The Bush Administration has predicted that the economy would grow by 2 percent this year.
But the growth rate as measured by the gross national product was just 1.7 percent in the first quarter and 1.2 percent in the second, meaning the economy would have to expand at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the second half to meet the Administration's prediction.
 
Slump in Manufacturing
Few economists expect that amount of growth. Indeed, the National Association of Purchasing Management released its latest survey today showing that the manufacturing economy slumped in July for the first time in three months.
And the Commerce Department, in another report today, said construction spending in June was flat after falling in the previous two months.
Both the building and manufacturing sectors have borne the brunt of high interest rates under the Federal Reserve Board's policy of stemming inflation by slowing the economy.
''The June leading indicators report dashes almost all hope that the economy will pick up steam later this year,'' said Richard W. Rahn, chief economist with the United States Chamber of Commerce.
''The weak industrial sector will get even weaker by year's end as manufacturers' new orders fall and growth in unfilled orders wanes,'' Mr. Rahn added. ''It would take only a mild amount of order cancellations to stop growth in industrial production and turn a weak economy into recession.''
 
Many Negative Statistics
Both manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and unfilled orders were among the negative statistics in the June indicators report. Others were a decline in the money supply, a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence, a decrease in orders for new plants and equipment and an increase in weekly unemployment claims.
The consumer confidence index also was negative in May, leading some analysts to fear that consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, were retrenching.
But a Commerce Department report issued Monday eased these fears when it showed that personal consumption jumped 1 percent in June, suggesting consumers would keep the weak economy alive.
Nevertheless, only four of June's leading indicators were positive: an increase in the price of raw materials, higher stock prices, an increase in building permits and slower business delivery times. The length of the average workweek was unchanged.
The various changes left the index at 146 percent of its 1982 base of 100 and up 1.4 percent from its level a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Was Unchanged in June

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Construction spending, which fell for two straight months, was flat in June, the Government reported today.
The Commerce Department said that spending on residential, nonresidential and Government projects totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $447.5 billion, after dropping 1.9 percent in April and three-tenths of 1 percent in May.
The April and May declines were not as severe as first reported. The April figure was revised from 2.2 percent while the May number improved from four-tenths of 1 percent. 
Residential spending was down 2.2 percent in June for the second consecutive month, to an annual rate of $196.1 billion.
 
Single-Family Building Is Off
Single-family building was off 3.5 percent, after a 4 percent drop in May. Apartment spending was unchanged, after rising 1.5 percent in May.
Some analysts said they expect a slight pickup in residential building but suggested other areas of the construction industry would remain sluggish.
David Berson, chief economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association, said residential activity was still feeling the effects of higher mortgage rates earlier this year.
The rates, he said, caused sales to drop and builders to put off projects.
The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which had been in the double digits for most of the year, dropped to the 9.98 percent level by last Friday.
Nonresidential spending surged 3.9 percent, to $107.1 billion at an annual rate, paced by a huge 10.2 percent gain in construction of office buildings. The nonresidential segment had fallen nine-tenths of 1 percent in May.
 
Widespread Vacancies
Both Mr. Berson and Darryl Delano, an economist with Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass., expressed surprise at the spending on office buildings and suggested the pace could not be sustained because of widespread vacancies throughout much of the nation.
The often-volatile Government sector was off one-tenth of 1 percent to $108.4 billion, after a 3.8 percent advance in May.
In another report on construction spending this week, F. W. Dodge, a financial information division of McGraw-Hill Inc., said its index of new construction contracts fell in June, to 153, from 156 in May. The report said spending for new construction totaled $240.7 billion in June, compared with $245.7 billion in May.
Dodge said contracts for new nonresidential construction increased 5 percent, while residential construction spending fell 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Index Is Steady On Confidence

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Confidence in the nation's economy among consumers was about the same in July as in June, according to a monthly study.
Consumers were slightly more positive about current conditions than in June but a little less positive about their expectations for the months ahead, the Conference Board reported this week. 
The conclusions were based on a monthly survey of 5,000 households nationwide conducted by the Board of Family Opinion Inc. in Toledo, Ohio.
Confidence was sharply lower in New England in the second quarter of 1990 compared with the corresponding period a year earlier. Expectations in the Middle Atlantic and Pacific states were also lower, while consumer confidence was up in the West Central and mountain regions.
Of those surveyed, 23.2 percent said business conditions were good in July, up from 22.6 percent the previous month.
But more respondents - 11.7 percent in July, compared with 10.4 percent in June - said they expected business conditions to worsen.

Fund Yields Are Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of tax-exempt and taxable money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down for the week ended yesterday.
The decline is expected to continue as further signs of a weakening economy emerge and the Federal Reserve Board comes under increasing pressure to push down rates, analysts at Donoghue's said.
''So far, short-term rates are down sharper than long-term rates, which have resisted the pressures to some extent because of the upcoming quarterly refunding by the U.S. Government and a weak dollar overseas,'' said Walter S. Frank, Donohgue's chief economist. 
The average number of days that securities are held by tax-exempt money funds remained unchanged this week at 51.
 
Tax-Exempt Assets Drop
Assets of tax-exempt funds declined by $67 million, to total $78.7 billion. The average seven-day tax-exempt compounded yield was unchanged at 5.21 percent, while the 30-day average yield was down by 5 basis points, to 5.26 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The equivalent taxable seven-day compounded yield would be 7.23 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket and 7.76 percent for investors in the 33 percent bracket.
Among tax-exempt funds with assets exceeding $100 million surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's, the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund again showed the best return, with a yield of 6.13 percent. The fund is distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc. of Milwaukee.
Assets of taxable money funds increased by $600 million, to total $385.4 billion, a new high. About $300 million of the gain was in Treasury-only funds as investors uneasy with deposit insurance at banks sought refuge in those funds, analysts said. #44 Days to Maturity Institutional assets fell by $90 million, to $82.5 billion, while consumer assets rose $700 million, to total $302.9 billion.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios remained at 44. The level is considered high, Donoghue's said.
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for taxable money market funds fell by 4 basis points, to 7.84 percent, while the 30-day average yield fell 3 basis points, to 7.91 percent.
Of the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million, the Alger Money Market Portfolio, distributed by Fred Alger & Company, Jersey City, showed the best return for the fifth consecutive week, with a yield of 8.78 percent.

Chargeurs Buys Pathe

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 1

 BODY:
A French industrial group, Chargeurs S.A., today bought Pathe-Cinema S.A., the film company that the Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti tried to buy earlier this year.
The acquisition, costing an estimated one billion francs, or $180 million, was announced in two stages. 
First, French stock exchange officials said Chargeurs had bought 52.3 percent of Pathe-Cinema for 517 million francs, or $93 million, from four companies within the Rivaud investment group.
Later, Mr. Parretti's Pathe France Holding, which owned 46.5 percent of Pathe-Cinema, said it was also selling its shares to Chargeurs. The sale price was not disclosed.
It could not be immediately determined whether the sale of Pathe-Cinema would affect Mr. Parretti's efforts to buy the MGM-UA Communications Corporation in the United States.
The Chargeurs deal follows a decision in June by the Economics Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, to block Mr. Parretti's acquisition of Pathe. Mr. Beregovoy questioned the source of Mr. Parretti's financing, which was linked to a Swiss company, Sasea Holding. If this were the case, he contended, Mr. Parretti's group should have sought prior approval from the Government because Switzerland is not in the European Community.

TV Ratings Spying Case

 BODY:
A former employee of the Arbitron Company attempted to give confidential information about the company's television ratings to its principal rival, the A. C. Nielsen Company, the Department of Justice charged yesterday. 
In a one-count criminal indictment filed by the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, the Arbitron employee, Barry D. Glick, was accused of interstate transportation of stolen property.
Mr. Glick, a 45-year-old former Washington policeman, is charged with mailing to Nielsen internal Arbitron memoranda, a company manual and a ''remote-control device and related technology'' having a value of more than $200,000.
The criminal count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

Chiat/Day Lays Off 30 In New York

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
CHIAT/DAY/MOJO, the Venice, Calif., agency that seemed to have the golden touch in the last decade, announced yesterday that it had laid off 30 employees in its 150-person New York office, which has lost three major accounts this year.
Chiat/Day employees, aware of the financial pressures on the agency, which built its reputation on its Nike and Apple Computer ads, said that the number of layoffs could go as high as 50 this month.
Jane Newman, the president of the New York office, said the layoffs were necessary because one of the office's biggest clients, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, had decided to put its $35 million account into review. ''We aren't sure that we are going to re-pitch the account,'' she said. ''This is the prudent thing to do.'' 
If, as expected, the agency loses the Royal Caribbean account, it will be the fourth big loss this year for the New York office. It lost the $7 million Sara Lee bakery account; the $5 million to $10 million Bissel account and the $30 million Reebok account. American Express and the New York Life Insurance Company have also cut back substantially on their advertising spending with the Chiat/Day New York office, which currently has billings of about $130 million.
The loss of the Royal Caribbean account would mean billings at the New York office would fall below the critical $100 million mark. It is generally believed in the industry that agencies with billings of less than $100 million would not be considered by national clients for their large accounts.
The recent problems at the New York office have sparked rumors that there will be a management shake-up there, with several of the office's top executives leaving, including at least one senior creative executive.
''We are very concerned about what is happening in New York, and we plan to fix it,'' said Bob Wolf, the chairman and chief executive of Chiat/Day's North American operations. But he would not comment on what, if any, changes would be made in light of the loss of accounts.
Mr. Wolf said that the agency had no plans to cut back further in the New York office or to close it. ''We are still very committed to it,'' he said. ''New York is an important part of our future.''
Some advertising executives said a primary reason for the problems at the New York office was the frequent absences of Jay Chiat, the agency's founder, who moved his office to Manhattan when the New York branch was opened in 1981. He recently has been spending increasing amounts of time at the agency's other offices in the United States and abroad.
Recently, Chiat/Day/Mojo, which has total billings of about $1 billion, has sold several of its smaller businesses. Last week, the agency announced it had reached an agreement to sell its public relations subsidiary, Jessica Dee Communications, for an undisclosed amount to the firm's management. In June, Chiat/Day sold most of its San Francisco operation to that agency's management.
The agency's plans to establish itself as a big international advertising power seem to have stalled. Last year, Chiat/Day acquired Mojo MDA, an Australian agency, for about $68 million. The acquisition gave Chiat/ Day a valuable foothold in the Pacific Rim and also an office in London, which it could use as a jumping-off point to begin an assault on Europe.
But its Australian operations have faltered lately. The agency is suffering primarily because of Australia's depressed economy. One of the agency's primary clients is the Australian tourism account, which has cut spending drastically. In addition, one of the agency's biggest clients, the Bond Corporation Holdings' brewing interests in Australia, filed for bankruptcy protection.
The one bright spot, Mr. Wolf said, is the agency's flagship office in California. In the last 12 months, he said, that office has won about $30 million in new accounts.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Bond Investors Gain Overseas

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to global bond investing, sometimes all that matters is getting the currency right. In July, the principal determinant of profit was investing in bonds denominated in almost any currency other than the dollar.
The fall of the dollar, which is near its lowest level ever against the German mark, was the principal reason that European bond markets, measured in dollars, produced monthly returns of at least 6 percent.
But the dollar was not the only factor. Interest rates have turned lower in most major countries, with the dramatic exception of Japan. That downturn, coming after a rapid increase in rates early in the year, may help to stimulate economies around the world, thus reducing the chances of a recession in this country. 
For American money managers, the recent returns have been extraordinary, but some doubt whether that can continue. They worry that foreign interest rates could turn higher, particularly in Europe, as the cost of German reunification is felt.
According to the J. P. Morgan government bond index, 10 of the 11 bond markets it follows produced a positive return for local investors in July. The exception was in Japan, where bond investors lost 1.06 percent. But after factoring in the dollar's slide against every currency, the United States bond market, with a return of 1.29 percent, was the poorest performer. Japan showed a gain of 3.18 percent in dollars.
The star bond market for the month, and for the previous three months, was the one in Britain. In dollars, a portfolio of British government bonds, known as gilts, produced a stunning return of 6.86 percent in July, raising the three-month return to 24.81 percent, according to Morgan's figures.
Yields on British gilts now average about 11.6 percent a year, high by international standards but down significantly from earlier this year, as a slowing economy has led to recession talk. The rise of the pound has been related in part to speculation about Britain's joining the European Monetary System of fixed exchange rates.
Early this year, as interest rates were soaring in many markets, stock markets also suffered. But the general downturn in interest rates has provided some support for stock markets around the world, which, with the notable exception of Japan, generally rose last month. The United States market had a small decline, as the Standard & Poor's 500 average dipped 52-hundredths of 1 percent.
The recent rally in bonds has more than wiped out the losses early in the year, and holders of government bonds are showing a profit in local currencies for 1990 in 9 of the 11 countries, the exceptions being Germany, which is down 39-hundredths of 1 percent, and Japan, off 4.2 percent. For the year, the dollar is down against every currency except the yen, so in dollars there are profits for bondholders in every currency.
The J. P. Morgan figures for various bond markets are not strictly comparable, because they are based on the overall return of all outstanding government bonds. Countries that have more long bonds outstanding, like Britain and the United States, generally have more volatile returns. But the figures broadly reflect the profits, and losses, of investors in each market.
In the United Sates, the year began with a general - and incorrect - consensus that rates were headed lower, and that bond prices would rally. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, at 7.97 percent as the year began, rose to above 9 percent by the end of April. It has since fallen to 8.34 percent, which means bonds sell for less than they did at the beginning of the year. But coupon payments in the interim have more than made up the difference.
Now, while many expect the Federal Reserve to push short-term interest rates lower to combat a weak economy, the slide of the dollar makes that forecast less certain for longer bonds. Some analysts think those rates will have to rise to draw in foreign cash worried about possible further declines in the dollar.
In Japan, the general consensus is that rates will remain under upward pressure, ''simply due to over-full employment and pressures from higher energy prices,'' as Kenneth Oberman, a money manager with Oppenheimer Capital Management, put it yesterday.
In Germany, where rates are close to as high as they have ever been, and are close to United States levels, foreign money has poured into the markets in recent months. That has helped to push bond prices up a bit, and to strengthen the mark. But some American money managers are growing more cautious. ''We are starting to see the costs of the German reunification coming through, and they are higher than people expected,'' said John Hickling, the manager of Fidelity Investment's International Growth and Income Fund. He said he had been reducing the fund's holding of German bonds.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 5.94; Bank Stocks Off Sharply

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks fell slightly yesterday, with bank shares giving ground amid fears that the industry could be facing difficult times.
The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 5.94 points, to 2,899.26, despite heavy program buying.
Volume rose to 176.8 million shares, from 173.8 million the day before. Declines totaling 777 outnumbered 733 advances, with 84 stocks setting new lows. 
Particularly disturbing, analysts said, were remarks on national television Tuesday evening by a Stanford University economist, R. Dan Brumbaugh Jr., who said he believed that several big banks were ''close to true insolvency.''
Speaking with Ted Koppel on the ABC News program ''Nightline,'' Mr. Brumbaugh said the banks included Chase, Chemical, Manufacturers Hanover, Bankers Trust ''and even Citibank and Bank of America.''
 
Reaction of Seidman
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who also took part in the program, called the remark ''irresponsible.'' The economist ''has been saying things like this for the last three or four years,'' Mr. Seidman said. He argued that investors ''say the banks aren't broke, or they wouldn't be buying and selling their stocks.''
A spokesman for one of the six banks, commenting on the condition that he would not be identified, said: ''All the banks he mentioned are turning in profits; they're all paying dividends and in most cases their capital requirements are higher than Federal guidelines. So he's flat wrong.''
Chase, the Big Board's second-most-active stock yesterday, fell 1/4, to 18 7/8, with nearly three million shares changing hands. Citicorp, the third-most-active, slumped 3/4, to 19 3/8, on 2.5 million shares, after hitting a new low of 19. BankAmerica, the fourth-most-active, slid 3/4, to 24, on 2.4 million shares, and also dipped to a new low, 23 5/8.
Chemical fell 1, to 22, hitting a new low of 21 3/8; Manufacturers Hanover fell 1, to 29 1/2, and Bankers Trust dropped 1, to 37. Wells Fargo, which was not mentioned by Mr. Brumbaugh, fell 2 5/8, to 65 7/8, after tumbling 3 3/8 on Tuesday in the wake of growing wariness over real estate loans in California. It also hit a new low yesterday, 63.
 
Weak Economic Reports
Three economic reports released yesterday gave further signs that the economy continues to weaken. The purchasing managers index, indicating conditions in the manufacturing sector, fell to 47.4 percent in July, its lowest level since January and its sharpest decline since 1984. And the Government's index of leading indicators, designed to predict the course of the economy, and its report on the level of construction spending were both unchanged in June. The news helped bond prices advance, but stocks did not follow.
David B. Bostian, chief economist for Jesup, Josepthal & Company, said the news meant ''recession is coming'' but that stocks did not rise in expectation of lower interest rates because of the ''negative impact of recession'' on corporate profits.
''There's still hope,'' he said, ''that the Fed will ease further but I don't think the Fed's easing will be rapid enough to help corporate profits -and that's what the market pays attention to.''
 
Kodak Is Most Active
Kodak, which reported an exceptionally sharp rise in second-quarter profits, jumped 4 1/4, to 42 3/8, leading the Big Board's active list on 3.85 million shares.
The Dow transportation index, which fell 31.57 points on Tuesday, fell an additional 2.55, to 1,090.88. UAL, which touched off Tuesday's decline with a 16 7/8 drop, lost 4 1/8 more, to 135 7/8, on doubts over the financing for a buyout of the airline by its union.
Oil stocks gained, responding to rising crude prices and new Middle East tensions. Arco was up 1 1/8, to 130 1/2; Texaco up 3/4, to 64, and Exxon rose 1/4, to 52 1/8, with two million shares traded.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 0.63, to 355.52. The Nasdaq composite, where technology stocks weakened, fell 2.33, to 435.91, and the Amex market value index fell 0.30, to 353.30.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bonds Post More Gains

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Interest rates resumed their decline yesterday as prices of Treasury securities rallied on new evidence of a weakening economy.
Dealers said the latest spate of buying was touched off by an unexpectedly sharp drop in the closely watched economic index compiled by the National Association of Purchasing Management. The Government, meanwhile, reported no change in its June index of leading economic indicators.
Dealers said the purchasing managers' July index stunned the market because it plunged to 47.4 percent from 51.1 percent in June. Many economists had expected a neutral reading of 50 percent - much as they had expected the Government's index of leading indicators to show little change. 
 
Report 'Somewhat Shocking'
''Although the Chicago purchasers' report on Tuesday more or less told the market what the national data would show, the index was still somewhat shocking,'' said Peter D. Mayers, Treasury securities trader at the New York office of Bank Julius Baer of Zurich. ''And once again investors rushed to lock in declining yields, which led many of them to the longer Treasury maturities.''
Late in the session and after some profit taking, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in 2020, were offered at 104 13/32, up 22/32 on the day, as the yield dropped to a six-week low of 8.34 percent from 8.41 percent the day before and 8.47 percent on Friday.
Those investors fearing to venture that far out were aggressively buying the long notes, the 8 7/8's of 2000, which caused the price to climb 14/32, to 103 31/32, and the yield to fall to 8.27 percent from 8.34 percent the day before and 8.41 percent on Friday.
Demand was also strong for the 8.5's of 1997, which climbed 13/32, to 101 20/32, as the yield fell to 8.19 percent from 8.26 percent the day before and 8.35 percent at the end of last week.
But Mr. Mayers noted that while the shortest notes, the 8's of 1992, rose only 2/32, to 100 10/32, to yield 7.83 percent, this issue has become pivotal to the interest-rate structure.
 
What Short Notes Tell
The reason, he explained, is that either the short notes have been overbought and their price is due for a correction, or more likely, their price is telling the market that the Federal Reserve will have to lower interest rates.
Except for Treasury bills, the two-year notes are the most sensitive of the Treasury coupon issues to the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for temporary loans. And the funds rate is the most easily controlled by the Fed. Despite a further infusion of $2.5 billion of reserves by the Fed, the funds rate moved up to 8 1/16 percent from 8 percent, which is well above the yield on the short notes.
''We can't see the yield on the short notes remaining much longer at so low a discount to what investment professionals can get on similar or shorter maturities such as commercial paper,'' Mr. Mayers said. ''We think it won't be long before the Fed eases.''
The discount rate of Treasury bills continued to decline. The 90-day rate fell 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.43 percent; six-month bills lost 6 basis points, at 7.26 percent, and one-year bills fell 7 basis points, to 7.12 percent.
Late in the day, the Treasury announced its terms for the midquarter refunding auctions, which it said were tentatively scheduled for next week because Congress has yet to complete legislation raising the debt ceiling. If the debt ceiling is not raised by Monday, the sales set for the following three days will have to be rescheduled.
 
Auction Dates Set
The Treasury tentatively plans to auction $11.5 billion of three-year notes on Tuesday; $10.5 billion of 10-year notes the next day, and $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds next Thursday.
Today, the Treasury plans to auction $4 billion of 44-day cash management bills in the usual denomination of $1 million each. Next Thursday, the Treasury said it planned to auction $10 billion of 36-day cash management bills. The proceeds of cash management bills are often used by the Treasury to redeem maturing debt normally covered by the refundings.
Dealers said that because of the uncertainty over what would be a record $32.25 billion refunding auction, there would be no when-issued trading on the 3- and 10-year notes as well as the 30-year bonds originally scheduled for sale next week. Trading in such issues on a when-issued basis enables bidders and investors to measure market sentiment as well as hedge potential purchases against adverse price moves after the sales.

HEADLINE: Currency Markets;
Dollar Makes Some Gains, But Traders Remain Wary

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar regained some ground in foreign exchange trading yesterday, but traders warned that the United States currency remained weak.
Analysts said the dollar's advance appeared to be a technical correction as traders took profits on foreign currencies that have surged against the dollar in the past week. 
The dollar has fallen sharply amid increasing signs that the United States economy is weakening and amid speculation that the Federal Reserve Board will be forced to lower interest rates to stimulate business activity.
The dollar is supported by higher rates, so a move by the Fed to push rates down would also bring the currency lower.
Further evidence of an economic slowdown came today from the monthly index issued by the National Association of Purchasing Management, which fell to 47.4 in July from 51.1 in June. The decline indicated a slowing in the manufacturing sector.
Analysts said currencies of countries with higher interest rates -especially those in Europe - remain strong against the dollar, and they are not expected to decline in the near future.
The dollar recovered some ground against the British pound today. Sterling fell to $1.8552 in New York, from $1.8635 late Tuesday.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose in New York trading to 1.58885 marks, from 1.58555 Tuesday.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar rose in New York by nearly a yen and a half, to 147.30, from 145.84 Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.3540 Swiss francs, up from 1.34475; 5.3240 French francs, up from 5.3195; 1,162.75 Italian lire, up from 1,162.00, and 1.15275 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15165.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks and Yen Fall After Iraqi Invasion

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Japanese stock prices fell sharply in afternoon trading today and the yen fluctuated wildly against the dollar after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
Spot crude oil prices, meanwhile, rose sharply in Far East trading. The price of the widely traded Middle Eastern Dubai crude jumped at least 30 cents a barrel after the invasion was reported. Price levels were not clear as buyers and sellers backed off from the market, oil traders said. 
Japan is hugely dependent on Persian Gulf oil supplies.
''The conflict, if further aggravated and prolonged, would have significant impact on Japan in various forms, especially in terms of oil supplies,'' an official of the Foreign Ministry said.
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei stock index - which had fallen 255 points in the morning session - plunged almost another 400 points in the first 25 minutes of afternoon trading.
Shortly before the close, the Nikkei was down 673.22 points, or 2.18 percent, to 30,164.77. At one point, it was down more than 900 points.
News of the fighting pushed the dollar up by nearly a yen.
The dollar fluctuated violently between its morning low of 146.50 yen and high of 148.15, reached after frenzied buying after a Japanese translation of the news appeared.
''It was incredible,'' said Yuko Fukakusa, assistant manager at Tokai Bank. ''The market was thin, but it just went wild.''
The dollar was at 147.70 yen at midday.
Japan, the world's second largest oil importer, depends on Middle Eastern crude oil to meet about 70 percent of its needs.
Kuwait supplied 5.9 percent of Japanese crude imports of about three million barrels a day in June, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry reported. Iraq exported some 100,000 barrels a day, or 7.7 percent of Japan's needs.
 
Oil Rises in New York
By The Associated Press - Petroleum and gold prices rose yesterday in New York as the growing tensions between Iraq and Kuwait sent fears of a crude-oil supply disruption through the trading pits.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 32 cents to 85 cents higher, with the contract for September delivery up 85 cents, to $21.54 a barrel. Wholesale heating oil was 1.85 cents to 2.84 cents higher, with September at 61.19 cents a gallon, and wholesale unleaded gasoline was 1.81 cents to 2 cents higher, with September at 64.27 cents a gallon.
Gold and silver futures also rose on the Iraq-Kuwait news, partly to hedge against the inflationary effects of higher oil prices and partly because of the tendency among investors to seek the safety of precious metals during times of international conflict.
Gold futures settled $3.30 to $3.40 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, with August at $373.30 an ounce. Silver was 3.2 cents to 3.5 cents higher, with August at $4.822 an ounce.

HEADLINE: The Iraqi Invasion: Global Reverberations

 BODY:

OIL PRICES Spot market prices surged, with the American benchmark crude rising to $23.11 a barrel, up $1.57. The invasion stirred fears of slower economic growth, higher inflation and OPEC domination of the world oil market. But price increases should be limited by a near-record stockpile worldwide. Page A9.
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS The dollar rose, gold prices jumped and most stock markets fell. Japan, dependent on imported oil, was hard hit. As of today's close in Tokyo, its stock market had fallen 4.3 percent since the invasion took place. Page D1.
 
THE SOVIET UNION Moscow announced a suspension in the delivery of arms and military hardware to Iraq. The move interrupted Moscow's longtime role as Baghdad's chief arms supplier. Page A10.
 
UNITED NATIONS With Moscow and Washington in agreement, the Security Council voted 14 to 0 to condemn the invasion and demand an Iraqi withdrawal. Page A10.
 
DIPLOMACY Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d cut short a visit to Mongolia and plans to issue a joint statement about the crisis in Moscow today with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Syria condemned the invasion and called for an emergency Arab summit conference.
 
ISRAEL Israeli leaders condemned the invasion, but they also appeared relieved by the move. For months, President Saddam Hussein has been sharply threatening Israel. Officials in Jerusalem were openly frustrated that the rest of the world did not seem adequately concerned. Page A10.
 
THE EUROPEAN ALLIES Western European countries unanimously condemned the invasion, with Britain and France joining the United States in freezing billions of dollars worth of Kuwaiti assets. Page A10.

HEADLINE: The Iraqi Invasion: A New Gulf Alignment;
Iraqis, Bargaining on Anti-U.S. Sentiment, May Profit by Intimidating the Monarchies

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait ushers in a new alignment in which Iraqis, Iranians and Palestinian hard-liners appear to share an interest in subduing the oil-rich monarchies of the region and challenging United States influence in the Arab world.
In ordering his forces to attack Kuwait, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq calculated that the odds were largely in his favor.
Arab diplomats and military experts said the only serious risk for Iraq was swift retaliation from the United States military forces. But that is a move that Washington may not be ready to take, given that the Iraqi armed forces are widely considered the most tested and best equipped in the Gulf region.
The Iraqis have much to gain from their invasion of Kuwait. A successful offensive could establish Baghdad as the dominant power in the Middle East, giving it a much greater say in decisions on oil production and prices. 
Beyond that, the attack could become a rallying point for those in the Arab world who resent United States influence in world affairs and who feel that some Middle Eastern nations like Egypt have gone too far in accommodating Washington. Lastly, it could finally settle Iraq's longstanding border disputes with Kuwait.
The prospects for an effective counter to the attack appear slimmer in view of evidence that the Iraqis coordinated their move with Iran, which helped exert diplomatic pressure on Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to raise prices last month at a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Iran officially condemned the Iraqi move late today, but the suspicion remained that it had at the very least not discouraged Baghdad's action.
 
Sense of Powerlessness
In the wake of the invasion, the Arab world is discovering how powerless it is in countering an Iraqi attempt to assert its dominance.
Saudi Arabia is Kuwait's closest ally in the region and the founder of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the alliance to which both Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates belong. But it has hardly lifted a finger to halt the Iraqi invasion, giving the impression that it is powerless and ever more dependent on American assistance. Although the Saudis have spent billions of dollars on weapons and equipment in the past decade, they have contented themselves so far with giving refuge to the Kuwaiti Emir and his crown prince.
Saudi Arabia, which signed a nonaggression pact with Iraq last year, has within its territory a major pipeline that carries 1.5 million barrels a day of Iraqi crude to the Red Sea port of Yanbu. The Saudis could shut this outlet down, but such a step could give President Saddam Hussein of Iraq grounds to attack Saudi Arabia as well. Sacrificing Kuwait? ''I am afraid that we may have to sacrifice Kuwait as we knew it, to get out of this one,'' said a senior Arab Cabinet minister from a country friendly to Kuwait, who asked not to be further identified.
Saudi Arabia's main hope now appears to be action by the United States. The Saudis are reported to be discussing the possibility of organizing some kind of diplomatic and economic sanctions, like a boycott of Iraqi exports. Such action would require a guarantee of military protection from the United States.
Bolstering Iraq's resources is the price of oil, which has already soared to a two-year high along with the country's revenue. An oil embargo by the West and Japan against Iraqi or Kuwaiti crude would only push prices higher, hitting Western consumers hardest.
The Iraqi move has already buttressed Baghdad's quest for leadership in the Arab world, diluting the influence of American allies like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan as their strenuous diplomatic efforts to avert the attack over the last few days failed miserably in the face of Iraqi determination.
 
Iraq and Iran Met Secretly
Iraqi and Iranian officials confirmed in interviews at the OPEC meeting last month in Geneva that their officials had met secretly as recently as late July, days before the OPEC session opened. In a half-day meeting, the officials said, Iran and Iraq crafted their common strategy of squeezing Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to stop violating their quota ceilings on oil production.
When President Hussein and his top ministers singled out Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates as the main culprits in the weakening of oil prices, he had the open support of Teheran. Iraq and Iran then maneuvered to nudge the rest of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Saudi Arabia, to raise the minimum price of oil by $3 a barrel, a policy which had been steadfastly opposed by Kuwait.
Arab officials from Persian Gulf countries said they believed that some Palestinians from among the 400,000 Palestinians who live in Kuwait had lent active support to Iraq, gathering information and giving other assistance to Iraqi troops.
The Iraqi attack comes at a time when Palestine Liberation Organization militants active in the Israeli-occupied territories have been sharply criticizing Egypt, Iraq's main rival for Arab leadership, accusing President Hosni Mubarak of being ''an American puppet.''
 
Atmosphere of Hostility
The Iraqi invasion also comes amid a growing hostility in the Arab world to American policies. Many Arabs were disappointed over the failure of the American dialogue with the P.L.O. to produce tangible progress toward satisfying Palestinian aspirations. They also resent the United States for supporting Israel throughout the two-and-a-half year Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
Several Arab officials expressed ambivalence about Kuwait. On the one hand, there is a widespread admiration for its generous help to many an Arab country, including Iraq, which received close to $10 billion in interest-free loans from Kuwait during its eight-year-long war with Iran.
But Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are also seen as privileged countries that have accumulated wealth far beyond that of other Arab nations and that have done little to help resolve the Palestinian issue.
This view was evident by the late afternoon, when only a handful of Arab nations had spoken out unequivocally in favor of Kuwait. Among them was Syria, Iraq's longtime enemy, which called today for an emergency summit conference of the heads of state of 21 Arab nations to discuss what its official radio station called the ''blatant invasion of sisterly Kuwait by Saddam Hussein's forces.''
Syria was also reported by Arab diplomats to have reinforced its military units on its border with Iraq.
 
Hints of Appeasement
Perhaps in recognition of this sentiment, senior Kuwaiti officials hinted today at an appeasement of the Iraqis, even while calling for help against the invasion. Abdel Rahman al-Awadi, a Kuwaiti minister of state, emerged from a meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo to appeal for a ''brotherly solution'' to the conflict.
Libya warned against any foreign intervention in the conflict, saying it would be considered an aggressive act, according to the official Libyan press agency JANA. Libya also reiterated its thinly disguised criticism of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates for their policy on oil prices.
Iraqi officials appeared confident of the cards they were holding, reacting firmly to any notion of withdrawing troops until they installed a regime favorable to Baghdad.
''The ruling family system in Kuwait is over for good. The Americans know that,'' said a senior Iraqi official who asked not to be identified.

HEADLINE: The Iraqi Invasion;
IRAQ'S ADVANTAGE LIMITS U.S. OPTIONS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The Bush Administration faced the sobering reality today that despite a longstanding commitment to defend America's vital interests in the Persian Gulf, there was no easy military means to compel Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait.
 
With the forces of pro-
Western Arab powers like Saudi Arabia no match militarily for Iraq's powerful army, and with only a token American military presence in the area, the Administration's immediate responses included condemning the invasion, freezing Iraqi assets in the United States and calling for international sanctions.
Pentagon officials said that the United States had undertaken some military preparations as a result of the Iraqi attack. One aircraft carrier, the Independence, was under way at high speed from the Indian Ocean toward the Arabian Sea, adjacent to the Persian Gulf. It is expected to reach the area in several days. 
 
A 2d Carrier Is Shifted
Another aircraft carrier, the Eisenhower, was being shifted to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea to put its attack planes within range of Iraq. The modest fleet of American ships in the Persian Gulf was expanded from six to eight. And some Air Force aerial refueling tankers were said to have been dispatched to the Indian Ocean region.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney canceled plans to go with President Bush to Aspen, Colo., for Mr. Bush's speech on military issues and instead monitored the Gulf crisis from the Pentagon. But there was no effort to dispatch Army forces or move Marine Corps supplies based on ships toward the Persian Gulf for a possible ground campaign.
In a morning news conference, Mr. Bush suggested that a military response to Iraq was not imminent, but he did not formally exclude it. Asked if the United States would intervene militarily in response to urgent Kuwaiti calls for assistance, he said, ''I'm not contemplating such action, and I, again, would not discuss it if I were.''
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, expressed the prevailing view on Capitol Hill when he said that the proper response should be economic and political pressure and not military action.
 
'Intensive Diplomatic Activity'
''I don't think we have a military option at the moment, nor do we have a treaty obligation,'' Mr. Nunn said. ''I believe that our primary recourse should be to very intensive diplomatic activity.'' His comments were made on the NBC News program, ''Today.''
Pentagon officials said that the Administration was actively considering a number of military responses but stressed that the first course of action would be to apply political and economic pressure.
The impediments to military action are the simple facts of geography and the phenomenal growth of Iraq's military power.
Pentagon officials said, for example, that it would take close to a month to deploy an Army corps of two ''heavy'' - armored or mechanized - divisions to the gulf, assuming that Saudi Arabia was prepared to receive it.
Smaller forces, like a Marine Expeditionary Brigade, numbering about 16,000 troops, could be dispatched more quickly. It would take about a week to move such a unit and its equipment to the gulf, a Pentagon official said. But such a unit would be no match for Iraq's large, battle tested Army.
 
Concerns About Americans
Further, as Thomas L. McNaugher, a military specialist at the Brookings Institution noted, Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, is holding as virtual hostages the Kuwaiti population and the several thousand Americans living in Kuwait. The Iraqi radio, in an official statement today, warned against intervention, saying ''our armed forces'' would make Iraq and Kuwait ''a graveyard'' if such action were attempted.
For some military officials, a punitive air strike against Iraq did not appear to be an attractive option, though others said it was under consideration. Such an attack could be carried out by Air Force or Navy planes, or by Navy ships in the gulf firing conventionally armed cruise missiles.
But having endured an eight-year war with Iran, Iraq's leadership might calculate that its population would not be shaken by such a blow, some Pentagon officials say. Iraq also has surface-to-air missiles to defend its installations; this raises the prospect that American planes could be shot down and their crews killed or captured.
Beyond that, there is the possibility that Iraq could respond to an American air raid by sending its force beyond Kuwait and into Saudi Arabia. Unless the United States was ready to defend Saudi Arabia, an air raid could be risky, a military official cautioned.
 
Differences in Interpretation
''With warning time, we could move into Saudi Arabia and develop a defensive position. All of this is predicated on warning. We have lost that. What warning we had was ambiguous,'' a military official said, noting that many in the Administration were inclined to interpret Iraqi military moves as merely intimidation.
But one senior Administration official took exception to this analysis, saying that the United States could adequately defend Saudi Arabia.
The obstacles to an immediate American military response, as well as the failure by the Bush Administration to anticipate the Iraqi attack, have raised questions about the Administration's strategy toward Iraq.
When Iraq began making public threats toward Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates and moving forces toward the Kuwaiti border last month, the United States response was to hold a joint air and sea exercise with the United Arab Emirates.
 
Signal to Iraq
The exercise, while very modest in military terms, was intended as a signal to Iraq to abandon any aggressive designs on the gulf states. But when Iraq, in effect, called the Administration's bluff with its lightning attack on Kuwait, many Administration officials were surprised.
Bush Administration officials had been well aware before the attack of the threatening deployment of large numbers of Iraqi troops on the border with Kuwait, and the Central Intelligence Agency had reportedly flagged the possibility of an attack. The force eventually reached 120,000. But many officials fundamentally misjudged the Iraqi leaders' intentions. The prevailing view in the Administration, the military official said, had been that Iraq intended to use its forces to intimidate Kuwait, or perhaps snatch a small piece of territory.
The United States is not devoid of military options, and they remain under consideration.
Mr. Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, after meeting in Colorado, called for economic sanctions against Baghdad under the United Nations Charter, which provides for collective military action to enforce such measures. That raised the possibility that American naval vessels could be deployed to mount a blockade of Iraq, an option under discussion.
The United States could also buttress the defense of Saudi Arabia by moving military supplies and forces toward the gulf country. One option being discussed is to dispatch American tactical aircraft to Saudi Arabia. But the Saudis have not officially requested any military assistance.
The Iraqi attack might influence the debate here about the proper level of military spending and how the Pentagon should reshape its forces. Faced with a declining budget, the Navy no longer keeps an aircraft carrier continuously on station in the Indian Ocean, and no carrier was deployed there when Iraq moved troops last month toward the border with Kuwait.

INVADING IRAQIS SEIZE KUWAIT AND ITS OIL; U.S. CONDEMNS ATTACK, URGES UNITED ACTION

BYLINE: By APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Iraqi troops stormed into the desert sheikdom of Kuwait today, seizing control of its capital city and its rich oilfields, driving its ruler into exile, plunging the strategic Persian Gulf region into crisis and sending tremors of anxiety around the world.
President Bush condemned the invasion as ''naked aggression'' and sought to enlist world leaders in collective action against Iraq.
Faced with a dire threat from the truculent Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, to a region containing much of the world's oil reserves and with world financial markets in turmoil, Mr. Bush banned nearly all imports from Iraq and froze the nation's assets in the United States. At a news conference in Woody Creek, Colo., the President and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain raised the possibility of economic or even military action by the United Nations.
 
Iraq Suspends Payments
In response, Iraq, which had been accusing Kuwait for weeks of stealing its oil and violating production limits set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, suspended debt payments to the United States. Western experts asserted that Iraq had been motivated by a financial squeeze that only more oil dollars could ease and by ambitions for regional dominance. 
Although oil prices rose sharply today, analysts noted that world inventories are unusually high, and they saw no immediate threat to supplies.
Witnesses in Kuwait said that hundreds of people were killed or wounded today as Iraqi ground forces, led by columns of tanks, surged into the desert emirate at the head of the gulf. Other troops came by air.
For Mr. Bush, the invasion posed manifold problems: the difficulty of direct military action despite the huge commitment of money and resources to the gulf in recent years; fear of another surge in oil prices, which could hurt economic growth and rekindle inflation; the potential disruption of the fragile budget negotiations between the White House and the Congress, in which a gasoline tax has been considered, and possible damage to the Republican Party in elections this fall.
Reuters reported that the Kuwaiti forces continued to resist tonight in at least one area of the capital, at the main military barracks. Earlier reports spoke of explosions and gunfire echoing around the steel-and-glass skyscrapers of the city center in fierce fighting at dawn. But the Iraqi Army, the most powerful in the Arab world, vastly outnumbered the Kuwaiti forces, and 12 hours after the invasion began the Iraqis were reported in control of the airport, central bank and all key government buildings.
The State Department reported that Iraqi troops had taken six American oilfield workers into custody near the Kuwait-Iraq border. Officials said their whereabouts were unknown.
The President said he could not confirm that Americans had been seized, but that if it were true, ''it would affect me in a very dramatic way because I view as a fundamental responsibility of my Presidency protecting American citizens.''
Mr. Bush said this morning that American military intervention was not under active consideration, but Lieut. Gen. Howard Graves of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, traveling in Mongolia with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, said the United States was considering ''political, military or economic moves'' against Iraq. And after flying west to meet Mrs. Thatcher and deliver a speech at the Aspen Institute, the President said, ''We're not ruling any options in but we're not ruling any options out.''
 
Warships Head Toward Gulf
An American naval task force, headed by the carrier Independence with 60 fighters and bombers, sailed from the Indian Ocean toward the mouth of the Persian Gulf in a show of strength. The Kuwaiti Ambassador in Washington, a close relative of the Emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who is now in Saudi Arabia, pleaded for immediate American military intervention.
At the United Nations, the Security Council issued a unanimous call for an Iraqi withdrawal despite Iraqi assertions, brushed aside by virtually all nations, that Baghdad had been asked to send troops into Kuwait by rebel elements there and that Iraqi forces would be withdrawn from Kuwait within a few weeks.
Mrs. Thatcher called Mr. Hussein's behavior ''intolerable'' and said that ''a collective and effective will of the nations belonging to the U.N.'' was needed.
United States and British officials referred to Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, which permits the Security Council to use economic sanctions or military action against any nation that threatens the peace.
Such action was always difficult to take during the cold war because it was very rare to find all five permanent members of the Security Council in agreement on any major dispute.
 
Soviet Shipments Suspended
But the Soviet Union, a principal arms supplier to Iraq, immediately suspended its military shipments to that country, and the United States and the Soviet Union planned a joint statement on Friday after Mr. Baker arrives in Moscow. He hurriedly changed his travel plans after receiving news of the invasion.
Still there seemed to be little practical action that anyone could take in the days immediately ahead to reverse the Iraqi conquest. If Baghdad absorbs Kuwait or sets up a compliant government there, the oil reserves under Iraqi control will be doubled to about 195 billion barrels, making it second only to Saudi Arabia, which has 255 billion barrels.
The invasion appeared to have the potential to shift not only the economic but also the military and political balance in the region.
Moving swiftly today to endorse the President's actions against Iraq, the House voted 416 to 0 to impose trade sanctions and to cut off Export-Import Bank credits.
The Senate unanimously approved a resolution calling for multilateral actions ''involving air, sea and land forces'' under the United Nations charter to restore international peace and security to the region.
Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Mr. Hussein ''the Hitler of the Middle East'' and criticized Mr. Bush for not having moved earlier to forestall an invasion. Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, an influential member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, complained that there had been ''a kind of inertia'' to American policy toward Iraq in recent weeks.
 
Fears Over Saudi Arabia
Several lawmakers suggested that Mr. Hussein might now be emboldened to move into neighboring Saudi Arabia. Senator David Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, who was briefed by the Central Intelligence Agency this morning, noted that the primary Saudi oilfields are only 250 miles from Kuwait, with no terrain ''that would impede a rapid movement of forces'' by Iraq.
''We have to understand that our national interests are very much at stake,'' Mr. Boren said. ''I think it would be wrong to underestimate the ultimate aims of Saddam Hussein. He really hopes in the long run to put Iraq on a par with the kind of power he sees the Western powers as having.''
Judith Kipper, a Middle East specialist at the Brookings Institution, described the conflict in Kuwait as ''a war of resources.''
''This is the first post-cold-war crisis in the economically dependent world,'' she said. ''With the end of the East-West game, small countries can act with impunity to rearrange the neighborhood. Iraq is a superpower in its own area, but they need cash to service their debt and rebuild their oil industry. He gets cash from oil; oil prices are going up. Plus, they have historic claims to Kuwait, which Saddam Hussein has chosen to act upon.''
Gary Sick, a Middle East expert in the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations who now teaches at Columbia University, said that condemnations by nations around the world would have ''no effect at all.''
''Saddam Hussein obviously expected that when he did it,'' Mr. Sick said. ''He can't be surprised by the reaction, and he obviously discounted that in advance. Some tangible steps will have to be taken if in fact Saddam Hussein is to be persuaded that this didn't work out to his benefit.''
 
Washington Is Galvanized
The news of the invasion galvanized Washington on Wednesday night and this morning.
Mr. Bush was told of the invasion at 9 P.M. on Wednesday in the residential quarters of the White House, officials said, and was awakened from time to time during the night for briefings by his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. He signed his orders on Iraqi assets and trade at 5 A.M., they said.
At 8 this morning, the President met at length with his senior advisers, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Colin L. Powell.
Michael J. Boskin, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, said that if oil prices rose 25 percent, and he seemed to consider this plausible, it would have ''some deleterious effect on our economy.''
Such a rise in prices would slow growth slightly, he said, but not enough to produce a recession. Growth, though meager, is still running at slightly more than 1 percent.
Later the Department of Energy said the turmoil in the Middle East posed ''no immediate threat'' to American supplies of petroleum products. It estimated that in January to May of this year, Iraq supplied 8 percent of United States oil imports, about 3.6 percent of total United States demand. For Kuwait, the department said, the comparable figures were much smaller -just over 1 percent and less than one-half of 1 percent.
The Energy Secretary, James D. Watkins, said that crude oil stocks in the United States stood at near-record levels and that world inventories were also unusually high at the moment. This country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a statement by the department said, could offset the amount of oil the United States has been importing from both Iraq and Kuwait - about 730,000 barrels a day - for more than 800 days.
 
Crude Oil Prices Rise
Still, crude oil prices shot up to more than $23 a barrel, and some economists said that gasoline prices would rise by at least a nickel a gallon within a week.
Recalling the Arab oil embargo of the 1970's that forced millions of Americans to wait in long lines, analysts noted that the United States is more dependent on Middle East oil now than it was then. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents United States oil companies, spoke recently of a ''potentially ominous'' trend that has brought oil imports to nearly half of total American consumption.
 
Mediation Efforts Collapse
Arab mediation efforts to head off the crisis broke down Wednesday with the collapse of talks between Iran and Kuwait in the Saudi Arabian port of Jidda on the Red Sea. Mr. Bush said tonight, after talking by phone with a number of Arab leaders, that he was hopeful of a new regional initiative, but there were no reports of concrete plans to bring the two sides together.
Only a few hours after the collapse of the talks, Iraqi armor, led by more than 350 main battle tanks, began racing across the 80-odd miles of desert that separate Kuwait City, a modern enclave on the gulf, from the frontier. It took the Iraqi forces, using weapons supplied largely by the Soviet Union, France and China, little time to overwhelm the Kuwaiti defenders.

HEADLINE: To Americans Abroad, Paris Isn't All Feast

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Chauffeur-driven cars, drinks by the swimming pool, year-round tans and bottomless expense accounts may not be the happy fate of most American expatriates. But to a good many people back home at least, those are just some of the privileges they think are enjoyed by their fellow Americans abroad.
Not so, many overseas Americans say. Thrown into an environment where language, food and customs are strange, cut off from family and lifelong friends, they say they get little thanks for carrying the country's assorted diplomatic, business and cultural flags around the world. 
Still worse, when it comes to questions of citizenship, taxation, education and social security, many assert that they are victims of discrimination and even human rights violations. ''We are the forgotten Americans,'' said a Chicago-born lawyer now living in Paris.
Yet as different organizations representing Americans overseas begin organizing a lobby to carry their message to Washington, their leaders are fully aware that their golden image is the main obstacle to winning the sympathy of their fellow citizens.
 
Seeking to Persuade Congress
''We Americans have a sort of auto-xenophobia: we don't like ourselves when we move abroad,'' said Andrew P. Sundberg, a consultant who founded the Geneva-based American Citizens Abroad. ''This is due 95 percent to ignorance and 5 percent to envy.''
At what was proclaimed to be the First World Conference of United States Citizens Abroad, held at the American Hospital in Paris in June, expatriate spokesmen from Europe and the Middle East began mobilizing arguments aimed at persuading both Congress and American public opinion that theirs is not such a happy lot.
In speech after speech, it was said that the United States did less for its overseas citizens than any other industrialized power, that it is the only Western nation that taxes its citizens abroad and that it effectively discourages talented business people from taking foreign assignments.
One speaker said that while three million Americans live abroad, as a proportion of their countries' populations, far more Britons, French and Dutch live overseas. And if the United States is to face the challenge of the global economy, he went on, Washington must make it easier to do so.
 
Number of Suggestions
The expatriates suggested these ways to change the situation:
* Legislation should be amended so that American citizenship is given to children born to or adopted by an overseas American married to a foreign national, thus eliminating ''human rights violations'' where these children may be considered stateless.
* Americans working abroad should not be required to pay American taxes on foreign earned income - at present they have a $70,000 annual tax exemption - because they are often subject to double taxation, in their country of residence and in the United States.
* Americans living abroad should be allowed to choose between paying social security in the United States or overseas rather than twice, as frequently the case today.
* The United States should follow the lead of France and other Western countries in supporting American schools abroad since many American business people refuse foreign postings for fear of hurting their children's education.
* Modeled after the special delegates who represent Puerto Rico, Guam and other American territories on Capitol Hill, overseas Americans should be allowed to choose between voting in state elections or electing their own representative to Congress.
 
'A Global Town Meeting'
Democrats and Republicans Abroad, two of the six organizations that co-sponsored what became known as ''a global town meeting,'' did not endorse the idea of a nonvoting special delegate for expatriates on the ground that it would disfranchise overseas Americans from voting in their own states.
But the expatriates are not without friends on Capitol Hill. Mervyn M. Dymally, Democrat of California, who is chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called hearings in Washington last October on the plight of Americans abroad and it was at his suggestion that the conference was organized here in June.
He invited nine Congressmen to join him at the Paris meeting and promised hearings in Washington this fall. ''The perception in the United States is that Americans abroad have the good life,'' he said. ''But I have the utmost admiration for our overseas Americans.''
They were warned, though, that they must take their battle to Washington. ''There's not a single person in Washington asking what's happening to you,'' Ben Blaz, the special Congressional delegate from Guam, said. ''The burden on you is to lobby, to keep us posted, to make people realize you're not mercenaries of America but missionaires of our country.''
 
'Important National Asset'
Cheered by a letter from President Bush, who described Americans abroad as ''very important national asset,'' the conference organizers are thinking of creating a permanent Congress of Americans Abroad that could send lobbyists to Washington without waiting for Congress to act on a special delegate. But one Congressman reminded them that victory was not nigh.
''You are taxed because you are citizens of a government that has to be maintained, and you have as great an obligation here as I do in Detroit,'' George W. Crockett, Democrat of Michigan, said. ''You asked me to tell you the reading of the average Congressman? You got it.''

HEADLINE: The Iraqi Invasion;
70's-Style Price Shock Not Likely in This Oil War

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A new round of economic warfare seemed to be under way yesterday, as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait resurrected both higher oil prices and fears of OPEC domination of the world oil market. But many ground rules have changed, both for nations that export oil and for those that import it.
The price surges on the spot oil market yesterday recalled the shocks of the 70's and stirred concerns about slower growth and more inflation worldwide. But unless pure fear inflates demand unnecessarily, the world is probably not headed for price run-ups on the scale of the 1979 oil shock, when prices tripled within months.
For now, the world is sitting on a near-record stockpile of crude, and at least some surplus capacity exists inside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
But in the years since the oil shocks of 1974 and 1979, OPEC members, including Kuwait and Iraq, have taken far different approaches to economic development, introducing strains into the organization.
 
Uncertainty at the Pump
The effect at the gasoline pump is uncertain. Crude oil prices fell sharply in the early part of this year but gasoline prices were stable. In the longer term, an increase of $7 a barrel in crude, which is what the markets have seen in recent weeks, would come to 17 cents a gallon at the pump.
In contrast to 1974 and 1979, experts point out, it is not clear that Iraq intends any interruption in output.
''Loadings were stopped; that's all we know,'' said Wolfgang G. Luding, head of the oil industry division of the International Energy Agency in Paris. ''They may resume tomorrow.'' Even if they do not, though, and Kuwait does not load a single tanker this month, world inventory on Sept. 1 would be about the same as it was last Sept. 1, according to Joseph Stanislaw, of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
Confirming the surplus, the Exxon Corporation estimated yesterday that the world inventory is 150 million to 200 million barrels ''in excess of normal commercial needs,'' about 100 to 133 days worth of Kuwaiti production of 1.5 million barrels daily.
 
Other Sources of Oil
Even if Kuwait's production were lost for a longer period, there are other sources. Outside the Persian Gulf, Venezuela has about one million barrels a day of spare capacity, experts say, and other countries could produce an additional one million barrels a day.
On the Gulf, Saudi Arabia alone has two million barrels a day or more of idle capacity, and the United Arab Emirates has about 800,000, Mr. Stanislaw said. But having seen Kuwait invaded by a neighbor bent on enforcing quotas, they may be reluctant to produce much more.
''They've now got a lot of Iraqi tanks a lot closer than they were yesterday,'' said Michael C. Lynch, a political scientist and energy analyst with the Washington International Energy Group, a consulting firm.
Still, Mr. Stanislaw said, there is no immediate reason to believe that Iraq would hobble Kuwaiti production. If Saddam Hussein now effectively owns Kuwait or exacts a tribute from it, he may prefer even higher production.
 
Impulse of the Marketplace
But this logic may never prevail in the marketplace, say some analysts, who point out that the impulse in time of shortage is to buy more, even if huge stocks are on hand. And the price of oil depends on the price of the last barrel purchased. At the Institute for International Economics, Philip K. Verleger, a visiting fellow, estimated that a 10 percent shortfall in world supply would raise prices to about $45 a barrel.
A price that high, however, would bring new supplies to market. In contrast, in 1979, when the fall of the Shah of Iran removed that country's six million barrels a day from world markets, capacity elsewhere was thin. The same was true at the time of the Arab oil embargo of 1974. And after both interruptions, demand from nervous consumers swelled far above normal.
In trading yesterday of contracts for September delivery, West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, closed at $23.11, up $1.57. It closed last week at $20.04.
The Energy Department said late yesterday that for the first five months of this year, the United States imported 610,000 barrels a day from Iraq, less than 8 percent of total imports, and 120,000 barrels from Kuwait, which is less than one-half of 1 percent. Domestic crude oil stocks are 1.1 billion barrels, the highest level in eight years, the department said, and if imports are interrupted, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve of stored oil can be emptied at 3.5 million barrels a day for 170 days.
 
Faster Reaction
There are other differences from the shocks of the 70's. One is that markets are faster now and unregulated. The shouts of a horde of speculators are quantified and transmitted worldwide by computer, and customers will feel them quickly.
Another change is that OPEC has been fundamentally split between countries like Kuwait, which diversified in the oil business so they could profit in a low-price environment, and countries that remained pure producers, like Iraq. If oil prices decline, so does Iraq's income.
The Saudis would also like to keep prices down so that the oil in the ground worldwide - about a quarter of which they own - will be the primary fuel of the next century.
One factor that has not changed is a frustrated desire to retaliate. Most of the responses, including the embargo of Iraq ordered by the White House, constitute the West's biting the hand that oils it.
 
Effects of an Embargo
At best, a Western embargo of oil from Iraq and its new acquisition would leave the world bidding up the price on the remaining OPEC output, say experts, hitting consuming nations with an increase at least as big as the one Iraq is seeking to impose.
As Western governments cast about for levers of economic influence they can exercise over Iraq, experts say there are few.
Some countries could exert immediate influence on Iraq; about a third of the country's exports go through Saudi Arabia, in a pipeline built during the Iran-Iraq war to avoid the Strait of Hormuz. But thus far, they have not chosen to turn the tap.
The United States Navy could also respond. If bombers retaliated against Iraq by attacking its oil export facilities, ''it would add another $5 a barrel in a matter of seconds,'' predicted Marion B. Stewart, an energy expert at National Economic Research Associates, a private consulting group in White Plains, N.Y.
 
Japan and Germany
Presumably, the impact would be bad in Japan, Germany and other trading partners whose dependence on imports exceeds the 50 percent in this country.
''The countries that get hurt the most are the oil-importing countries in the third world, like Morocco, Jordan, countries in Africa and India,'' said Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington.
For industrial countries, the impact of an increase is likely to be smaller now, because their economies were fundamentally altered by the earlier oil shocks, and now use less energy for each unit of economic output. Of the energy they do use, a smaller fraction is oil. In the United States in 1973, oil's share of all energy sources was 46.9 percent; last year it was 42.1 percent. The decline in other countries has been steeper.

HEADLINE: The Iraqi Invasion;
U.N. Condemns the Invasion With Threat to Punish Iraq

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council voted overwhelmingly early this morning to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, demanding the immediate, unconditional withdrawal of all of Baghdad's forces from the tiny Persian Gulf nation, and threatening to invoke mandatory sanctions if it does not promptly comply.
The Council called on Iraq and Kuwait to begin ''immediate intensive negotiations'' to resolve their differences and gave its backing to Arab League efforts to mediate in the crisis.
Citing Articles 39 and 40 of the United Nations Charter, which gives the Council the authority to impose such sanctions on aggressor nations and to intervene against them with military force, the Council resolved to meet again ''as necessary to consider further steps to insure compliance with this resolution.'' 
 
A Seldom-Issued Threat
This is the language the Security Council traditionally uses when it threatens Charter violators with punitive action. Today's move is believed to be only the fifth time in the organization's 45-year history that the Security Council has issued such a threat.
The four previous occasions were the imposition of arms embargos against South Africa and Rhodesia, the threat of sanctions to obtain a cease fire ending the first Israeli-Arab war in 1948, and and the council's action ordering a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war in 1987.
The 1948 and 1987 actions preceded cease-fires, and the Rhodesian arms embargo lapsed after that country became Zimbabwe under majority rule in 1980. The South African embargo remains in effect.
Several Council members emphasized that they are deadly serious about the sanctions threat, arguing that at a moment when a more peaceful and cooperative world order is evolving, the United Nations must show itself ready to compel compliance with the principles of its Charter.
 
'The World Is Watching'
''It is a time for peace and diplomacy, not for war and aggression,'' the United States chief delegate, Thomas R. Pickering, told the Council. ''The world is watching what we do and will not be satisfied with vacillation and procrastination.''
Kuwait's United Nations representative, Mohammed A. Abulhassan, called the resolution ''a test of the Council and its ability to preserve the peace and security of all small nations.'' After the vote, the delegate of one third world nation said, ''We have threatened sanctions and we mean it. Our credibility is at stake.''
The 15-member Security Council consists of five permanent members -Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the United States - and 10 rotating seats, currently held by Canada, Finland, Colombia, Ethiopia, Malaysia, Ivory Coast, Zaire, Romania, Cuba and Yemen.
Western members of the Council said they will probably delay the next meeting until Monday to give Iraq time to comply and allow the Arab League to pursue its mediation efforts. But if, as they anticipate, Iraqi forces are still occupying Kuwait, they expect to reconvene and start planning a worldwide program of mandatory economic sanctions against Baghdad.
 
Early-Morning Vote
After a night of frenzied negotiations, the Security Council voted just before 6:00 this morning to condemn Iraq's invasion. Fourteen of the Council's 15 members voted in favor of the resolution and none against. Yemen, the only Arab country on the Council, did not participate in the vote because its delegate said he had no instructions from his government.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
The Target of Choice For the G.O.P.: Mitchell

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Move over, Mario Cuomo. George Mitchell, the mild-mannered, sober-minded and rarely quotable Senate majority leader, is emerging as the Democrat the Republicans love to hate.
When House Republicans adopted a resolution two weeks ago declaring their opposition to a budget plan that includes any kind of tax increases, the Democrat they scorned for having ''championed tax increases at every turn'' was Senator Mitchell. True, the Senator's name was inserted at the suggestion of an Administration eager to divert attention from President Bush's position on taxes, but Congressional Republicans liked the idea. 
''House Republicans are mad as hell at Senate Democrats, and at George Mitchell in particular,'' said Representative Vin Weber, a Minnesota Republican. ''He's been in the forefront of getting President Bush to break his pledge on taxes.''
When Senate Republicans found themselves outmaneuvered on the procedures for debating and amending the civil rights bill, the man they accused of playing fast and loose with the rules was Senator Mitchell.
''It has been happening on other bills, and we don't think this is a fair way to run the Senate,'' said Senator John C. Danforth, a Republican from Missouri, who insisted there was no personal animosity toward Mr. Mitchell.
Another Republican, Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, said: ''Republicans feel they are being deprived of their right to offer amendments on important legislation. It's been building for several months, and on our side it's developed into a real resentment.''
This was evident when Republican strategists looked for a way to explain high interest rates and a sluggish economy. The cause they cited first was the fact that the capital gains tax rate was not cut last year. And the man they blamed for blocking the cut was Senator Mitchell.
''The Mitchell Recession is more than an article of faith for Republicans: it has entered into our mythology,'' said John Buckley, a former spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee. ''George Mitchell's single-handed blocking of the capital gains tax cut in 1989 is the greatest blow this economy has received in the last two years.''
Mr. Mitchell's transformation by Republicans from ''just plain George'' to arch-Democratic villain is all the more striking because only six months ago political strategists in his own party were lamenting the Maine Senator's lack of a partisan edge. But to a large extent, Mr. Mitchell, a former Federal judge, has become a Republican target by default.
The Democrat who used to serve Republicans as a partisan punching bag was Jim Wright, then the House Speaker. But the pugnacious Texan was toppled from his post and forced to resign in an ethics scandal last year. His successor, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, is, as Mr. Weber put it, ''just too nice a guy'' to cast in the role of a political heavy.
Congressional Democrats say Senator Mitchell's emergence as a Republican straw man is a sign of desperation.
''One by one, their issues are leaving them,'' said a senior House Democrat. ''They can't talk about Communism, or the flag, or the balanced budget, or abortion, or taxes, so George Mitchell pops up on the screen. It's like a target-of-the-month club.''
Mr. Mitchell won't go that far, insisting that the machinations by House Republicans on taxes have nothing to do with Republican complaints about legislative procedure in the Senate. Hoping to diffuse any lingering ill will over the civil rights bill, he sought no restrictions on amendments or time limits for the debate this week on campaign financing.
''This is a total that's larger than the sum of the parts,'' the Senator said. ''I don't see any significance or lasting impact.''
But Mr. Weber said Republicans had other ideas. ''Some people have reputations as partisan slashers, and others as nonpartisan above-the-fray politicians,'' he said. ''Our view is that Mitchell is the former, that he has to finally shed his judge's robes.''
Mr. Weber conceded that Senator Mitchell was not yet the partisan lightning rod that Mr. Wright had been, but he said Republicans were working on it.
''I think he can be made to play that part,'' the Congressman said. ''He could grow into the role.''

HEADLINE: Hussein Must Be Stopped . . .

BYLINE: By Gary Sick; Gary Sick was a National Security Council staff member in the Ford, Carter and Reagan Administrations.

 BODY:
The seizure of Kuwait sends a further signal that President Saddam Hussein, the megalomaniacal leader of Iraq, must be stopped. If he is not, the consequences will be perilous for the Middle East and for the world.
Since Iraq's invasion of Iran a decade ago, President Hussein has made his ambitions starkly clear. He wishes to become the dominant power in Arab politics and the dominant voice on Arab oil. 
If his power grab succeeds, he will become the ultimate arbiter of OPEC policy, able almost singlehandedly to determine supply and price levels. Today, by virtue of Iraq's conquest of Kuwait, it has perhaps become the No. 1 oil superpower.
If Mr. Hussein alone can wield the so-called oil weapon, he will be in a position to influence international politics profoundly. That is an outcome devoutly to be resisted.
The least the West can expect from swollen Iraqi power is that the Arabs' relations with Israel would become more dangerous than they have been in the recent past. Mr. Hussein, after all, has shown a willingness to threaten and to act aggressively, without worrying unduly about risks to himself, his nation and its neighbors.
After his invasions of two neighbors, Iran and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia has reason to worry. So do others, including President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, a major rival of Saddam Hussein, with whom he has already come to blows; Turkey, with which Iraq has had an ongoing dispute over water, and even Jordan, which like Kuwait has attempted to ally itself with Iraq.
The U.S., its European allies and Japan, as well as the Soviet Union, can ill afford the long-term threat to regional and international stability that Iraq's latest foray poses.
The U.N. Security Council has condemned the invasion, demanded an unconditional pullout and called for immediate negotiations between Kuwait and Baghdad. Beyond this, the international community must take quick, forceful economic and military steps to defuse the crisis and to frustrate Mr. Hussein's appetite.
President Bush has taken a sensible first step by freezing Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets in the U.S. Now, acting through the Security Council, world leaders should impose economic sanctions on Iraq. This entails an agreement that no government will purchase any Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil until Iraqi forces have fully and unconditionally quit Kuwait.
Since Iraq's dominant source of hard currency is oil exports and the country has no other significant source of income, a boycott would make its economic position very tenuous very fast.
President Hussein's invasion of Kuwait was partly prompted by Iraq's indebtness. The war with Iran strained Iraq's economy to the limit and put a great burden on its financial reserves. One of his immediate goals is to drive up oil prices so that Iraq can increase its revenues.
Historically, the effectiveness of economic sanctions has been diluted by the unwillingness of many countries to honor them, notably during the Carter Administration's hostage crisis in Iran.
If a boycott against Iraq is to succeed, both Saudi Arabia and Turkey should be persuaded to shut off oil pipelines. The Saudis, acting, say, in response to a request by the international community, could shut off the Iraqi pipeline across their territory to the Red Sea. Similarly, the Turks could close Iraq's pipeline across their country to the Mediterranean. But to stiffen wills in Riyadh and Ankara, there would have to be a U.S. military presence in the area.
Thus, the U.S. must immediately begin re-establishing a credible military profile in the Persian Gulf. A convincing deterrent to further Iraqi military action would require at least bolstering the Saudis' air defenses as well as increasing the U.S. naval presence and deploying a Marine amphibious unit.
Such a buildup would help deter a possible attack against Saudi Arabia and serve as a precautionary defense of the oilfields in eastern Saudi Arabia. It would also signal Mr. Hussein that the U.S. and the West will not tolerate further Iraqi invasions.
A buildup should not be difficult. The Pentagon's contingency plans over the past decade have been developed around the mission of defending the oilfields as a last ditch effort to preserve access to the region's oil.
The puny military forces of the Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia's, are no match for Iraq's well-trained, battle-seasoned divisions, which may be tempted to roll down the Gulf coast. The immediate deployment of a squadron of U.S. aircraft to Saudi Arabia might help discourage such designs.
A U.S. air interdiction capability would make it extremely difficult for the Iraqis to seize and hold Saudi oilfields. Iraq's supply line would be long and open to air assault. In the end, President Hussein would risk military defeat.
This is not just America's crisis. In considering military options, we should seek the close cooperation of our friends. Moreover, the crisis hasoffered a fascinating opportunity to see the new spirit of U.S.-Soviet cooperation put into practice. Moscow voted with Washington in yesterday's Security Council meeting. And subsequently the Soviets issued a condemnation of the Iraqi attack in language almost identical to that used by the U.S. Significantly, Moscow indicated that it would not sustain its deliveries of military equipment to Iraq so long as the present situation persisted.
The weak international response to Mr. Hussein's muscle-flexing in the Gulf in recent years surely nourished his belief that he had little to fear from the world community and that he could get away with murder again. This time, he has to be made to see that he has overreached.

HEADLINE: Iraq's Naked Aggression

 BODY:
Without warrant or warning, Iraq has struck brutally at tiny Kuwait, a brazen challenge to world law. Iraq stands condemned by a unanimous U.N. Security Council and major Western oil purchasers. President Bush's taste for bluntness stands him in good stead: ''Naked aggression'' is the correct term for President Saddam Hussein's grab at a vulnerable, oil-rich neighbor. 
Fortunately, despite its million-man army, Iraq is also vulnerable. It depends on Soviet and European arms, on Western banks and markets and on the agreement of its oil-producing partners to keep supplies down and prices up. If ever there was a case for collective sanctions, Mr. Hussein's latest transgression has made it. And he can no longer play the U.S. against the Soviet Union, as Moscow made plain yesterday by suspending weapons shipments to Iraq.
Mr. Bush has taken the right first step in barring trade with Iraq and freezing Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets now controlled by Iraq. Congress is already weighing further sanctions against Iraq; the invasion clinches the case. But these measures can be effective only if reinforced by the countries most directly threatened.
The integrity of every Arab state is at risk if Iraq fails to heed the U.N. demand for immediate withdrawal. The specious pretext for Iraq's invasion was a purported plea for aid from ''revolutionary youth in Kuwait.'' The same formula could as well be invoked against other Persian Gulf states, notably Saudi Arabia. Having sought to appease Iraq, Arab neighbors now face a bully whose appetite they have helped whet.
Oil and power are the stuff of this aggression. Iraq contends Kuwait has forced down oil prices by overproducing and by ''stealing'' petroleum. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt strove vainly to settle this dispute by direct negotiation. He has been repaid with the invasion. This leaves oil producers with a bitter choice - yield to Iraq and its radical allies, rewarding aggression, or risk reprisal by cutting Iraq's pipelines or increasing output.
Arab unity, and courage, may depend on the determination of outside powers. Iraq's long war with Iran has left Baghdad more than $50 billion in debt. Iraq desperately seeks foreign trade and investment. Sanctions conditioned on a pullout from Kuwait make moral and diplomatic sense. Having experienced the results of piecemeal appeasement in decades past, Europeans should understand the need to stand together against aggression.
The U.S. has no treaty obligation to come to Kuwait's aid. But the gulf states and most nations still look to Washington for leadership and help in organizing action. President Bush has responded with the right lead - a strong national stand and a strong push for collective diplomacy.
In attacking an Arab state, Mr. Hussein has assuredly banked on the acquiescence of his neighbors and the covetous passivity of his trading partners. He needs to be proved resoundingly wrong.

HEADLINE: Film Fallout: Bright Lights, Cranky City

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
Six times in the last month, the eastbound lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge were closed for a full night, stranding thousands of unwitting commuters in snarled, honking processions along other escape routes from lower Manhattan.
The closing had nothing to do with the ubiquitous resurfacing, rebuilding and other highway construction projects that at least promise smoother travel in years ahead.
In fact, there wasn't a repair crew in sight. Instead, a movie-production company had commandeered the city's most famous bridge to film an ambulance chase and other stunt-driving scenes for ''Hudson Hawk,'' a new mayhem-studded thriller about a paroled criminal starring Bruce Willis, Danny Aiello and James Coburn. 
 
Not Camera Shy, Just Annoyed
The agreement the film company, Tri-Star Pictures, reached with the city allowed it to close all three eastbound lanes of the bridge from 10 P.M. to 5 A.M., and that is what happened Wednesday night and yesterday morning, as well as on the nights of July 16 through 19 and July 21.
And while the city contends that resulting inconvenience was relatively minor - and more than justified by the Tri-Star and other film companies bring to the local economy - there is at least an undercurrent of discontent about the growing number of film crews tying up streets, blocking sidewalks and inadvertently shining high-intensity lights in apartment windows around the city.
''This place is crawling with film companies,'' said Olga Bloom, the director of Bargemusic, a floating concert hall beneath the Brooklyn Bridge. ''It's not a deliberate rudeness. They have a job to do, and they just blindly pursue it. You don't mind accommodating a few times, but after a while, you feel abused. Why don't they invest in building studios in New York?''
Jaynne Keyes, the director of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, which issues permits for filming in the city, said that film and television production companies generate about $3 billion in spending in New York each year. ''Hudson Hawk'' alone pumped about $500,000 a day into the city's economy during the month of filming here that ended yesterday, Ms. Keyes said.
Last year, 8,000 city permits were issued for filming movies, television shows, commercials, music videos and other productions, including 110 for feature films, she said. This year, 90 permits for feature films have already been issued.
 
'A Few Complaints'
Few of the permits involve productions as elaborate as ''Hudson Hawk,'' or dislocations as jarring as the closing of the Brooklyn Bridge, she said. ''There's always some inconvenience, and we do get a few complaints, but most New Yorkers understand that it brings money into the city as well as the excitement and enthusiasm that's part of what New York's all about.''
Ms. Keyes said traffic advisories are issued by the city's Department of Transportation when streets are to be closed for filming and production companies are asked to notify adjacent neighborhoods by distributing leaflets.
Inevitably, city officials said, some drivers do not hear the advisories and get stuck. But the city goes to great lengths to accommodate film companies because of stiff competition from other cities, Ms. Keyes said. Production companies do not pay the city for the right to use local streets or bridges other than for the overtime costs of paying police officers and traffic agents.
Although no more blockbuster closings are planned this summer, a crew filming ''The Hard Way'' with Michael J. Fox is in Times Square this week. ''Prince of Tides,'' with Nick Nolte and Barbra Streisand, and ''One Good Cop,'' with Michael Keaton, will be shooting later this month, and ''Billy Bathgate,'' with Dustin Hoffman, will be in town in September.
And for frustrated drivers who want to see what the Brooklyn Bridge looked like on recent nights, ''Hudson Hawk'' is due in movie theaters next summer.

RICHARD REDUX
Richard III, Shakespeare's passionate villain, is back in New York, courtesy of the New York Shakespeare Festival. ''The Tragedy of King Richard III'' opened last night at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, becoming the 15th in the producer Joseph Papp's six-year, 36-play Shakespeare marathon. Directed by Robin Phillips in his Shakespeare Festival directorial debut, this production features Denzel Washington (the star of Spike Lee's newest film, ''Mo' Better Blues'') in the title role and Mary Alice (who won a Tony Award in August Wilson's ''Fences'') as Queen Margaret. Others in the cast include Daniel Davis as Buckingham, Jeffrey Nordling as Hastings, Joseph Ziegler as Clarence, Nancy Palk as Queen Elizabeth, and Sharon Washington as Lady Anne. The play will be presented Tuesdays through Sundays at 8 P.M. through Sept. 2. Tickets, which are free, are distributed one per person at 6:15 P.M. at the theater, where lines usually form a few hours earlier. The Delacorte is adjacent to the Great Lawn in Central Park, near the West 81st Street entrance. Information: 861-7277. 
 
'WORKING': THE MUSICAL
In his acclaimed book ''Working,'' Studs Terkel captured the thoughts and feelings of America's working men and women. The waitresses, firefighters, teachers and others featured in those pages came to life onstage in 1978, when Stephen Schwartz turned the book into a musical. This weekend, the show will be revived by the British-American Youth Festival Theater at the Gershwin Theater of the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts. Directed by Robert Shampain, it features 30 performers, ages 11 to 17, from the Brooklyn College Preparatory Center for the Performing Arts and the Tyne Youth Theater in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England. ''Working'' may be seen tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 and Sunday at 2:30 P.M. Tickets are $5 and will be available at the door one hour before curtain. The Gershwin Theater is near the intersection of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. Information: (718) 856-0936.
 
BAROQUE AT BARD
Three of this country's respected early-music specialists are Daniel Stepner, a Baroque violinist; Laura Jeppesen, a gambist, and John Gibbons, a harpsichordist and fortepianist. Together they form the Boston Museum Trio, which since its inception in 1973 has been one of the champions of the period-instrument movement. Tonight at 8, the ensemble opens its second annual summer concert series at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. Joining them tonight is the mezzo-soprano Judith Malafronte, singing works by Strozzi, Calestani and Allesandro Scarlatti. Also on the program are works by Monteverdi, Frescobaldi and Domenico Scarlatti. Tickets are $10; a subscription for the three-concert series, which continues on Aug. 10 and Aug. 17, is $24. Information and directions: (914) 758-6822.
 
A MUSEUM SETUP
For those who have wondered how the lifelike exhibitions at the American Museum of Natural History are created, a show opening there today will help unravel the mystery. ''Behind the Scenes'' will give museum patrons a chance to watch specialists and volunteers demonstrate the techniques used to create replicas of fossils, rocks, foliage and other components of the museum's dioramas. Visitors will learn about the film and video technology often used in shows, and they will also have a glimpse of two exhibitions now under construction, the Hall of Human Biology and Evolution, scheduled to open in the fall of 1992, and the proposed renovation of the fourth-floor hall of dinosaurs. The show is scheduled to run through April 7. The museum is at Central Park West and 79th Street; admission is $4 for adults and $2 for children. Hours are daily from 10 A.M. to 5:45 P.M., until 9 P.M. on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Information: 769-5100.
 
Saturday
 
WATERLOO MUSIC
Just about an hour from Manhattan's masses of concrete and steel lies an oasis of grass and trees amid a Colonial and 19th-century restoration called Waterloo Village. For 15 years, the village has presented one of the area's most popular music festivals. On Saturday night at 8:30, the Waterloo Festival Orchestra, under the direction of the young Chilean conductor Maximiano Valdes, will play Vaughan Williams's Overture to ''The Wasps'' and Dvorak's Symphony in D minor. Also on the program will be Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto in D, with the Soviet emigre Mark Peskanov as the soloist. Waterloo Village is on Waterloo Road in Stanhope, N.J. Tickets are $20 for reserved seating under the tent, or $15 for lawn seating, and may be purchased at the Waterloo box office or from Ticketmaster at 307-7171. Information and directions: (201) 347-4700.
 
JAZZ PICNIC
In the opposite direction, another grassy musical mecca is the Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay, L.I. On Saturday night at 8, the Friends of the Arts' Summer Festival will present the Preservation Hall Jazz Band from New Orleans, whose members include sexa-, septua- and octogenarians. The band will be led by two brothers, Willie and Percy Humphrey, on clarinet and trumpet, with Narvin Henry Kimbal on banjo, Frank Parker on drums, Frank Demond on trombone, and James C. Prevost on bass. At 7 P.M. there will be a picnicking contest, with prizes to be awarded for the most elegant, most delectable and most creative spreads. Registration is at 6:30 P.M. Admission to the concert is $15 to $25 for reserved seats, or $12.50 for the lawn. (You may bring your own chair.) Tickets are available from Ticketmaster at 307-7171. Information: (516) 922-0061.
 
HITS OF THE 50'S
In 1958, Vito Picone and the Elegants recorded ''Little Star,'' the hit song that sold 2.5 million copies and brought the group fame. Since then, the band has toured the United States, Mexico and Canada, and its songs have been included on the soundtracks for ''Joey,'' ''American Hot Wax'' and other films. The group returns home to Staten Island on Saturday night for ''Doo-Wop Hop,'' a concert of songs from the 50's. There will be two shows, at 7 and 9:30, at Veterans Memorial Hall at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace in Livingston. Tickets are $10 and $12 and are available from Harborcharge at (718) 448-2500, or from Ticketmaster at 307-7171. Information: (718) 448-2500.
 
Sunday
 
THE SCENE, CIRCA 1929
Elmer Rice's play ''Street Scene'' won the 1929 Pulitzer Prize for drama; in 1947, Kurt Weill turned it into a musical that Brooks Atkinson, reviewing it for The New York Times, called ''a play of magnificence and glory.'' On Sunday at 3 P.M., the Playhouse of American Classics will present a chamber theater production of this exploration of life in New York City's tenements. Directed by its artistic director, Terence McDonald, this performance opens the Playhouse's 1990-91 season, which will focus on New York life in the 1920's, 40's and 60's. Other plays will include ''My Sister Eileen'' and ''Two for the Seesaw.'' ''Street Scene'' will be presented at the Mazur Theater in the Murphy Center at the Asphalt Green Community Center, 555 East 90th Street. Admission is free, but a $5 donation will be requested at the door. Information: 662-8178.
 
WATER ROUTE TO HISTORY
Once the lifeline of New York's economy, the shipping lanes of lower Manhattan remain a vital link to the city's maritime heritage. On Sunday at the Alice Austen House and Park on Staten Island, a celebration of this heritage will take place when the fifth Nautical Festival opens at 1 P.M. Included in the afternoon's activities will be a masthead knot-tying demonstration at 1:30 and 3 P.M., a demonstration of a Coast Guard air-to-sea search and rescue at 2, and, at 2:30 P.M., a lecture on the history of New York Harbor by Peter Stanford, the president of the National Maritime Historical Society. There will be live music by the sea-chantey singers Stout and by the New York Brass Entourage. At 3 P.M., there will be a tour of the historic Austen house and gardens and its current photography exhibition on turn-of-the-century shipping in the Narrows. The Austen House is at 2 Hylan Boulevard in Rosebank. Admission is free. Information: (718) 816-4506.

HEADLINE: Savings Cure May Kill the Patient

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
When President Bush gathered with Congressional leaders in the Rose Garden last Aug. 9 for the signing of the savings and loan bailout bill, he triumphantly declared, ''This legislation will safeguard and stabilize America's financial system and put in place permanent reforms so these problems will never happen again.''
But as the anniversary of the Financial Institutions Rescue, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 approaches, the law looks like a blunt instrument indeed. Many economists and industry experts, and some regulators, say it not only failed to rescue the savings system but also inadvertently put commercial banks in some danger by creating a difficult operating climate - without addressing the crucial issue of deposit insurance.
On Tuesday, L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, gave one of his gloomiest forecasts to date. Because of a deepening downturn in commercial real estate markets that is spreading to almost every region of the country, he said, the assets of the Government's deposit insurance fund for banks could lose as much as $2 billion this year. That would make 1990 the third year in a row that the fund has posted an operating loss. 
In the last year, Federal regulators, highly sensitive to charges that they were too easy on shaky savings and loans, have started to question the quality of real estate loans on the books of commercial banks. That initiative has forced many banks to take big losses on their loan portfolios and others to close.
Adopting a defensive, almost fortress mentality, many banks have established tighter lending policies, restricting the money available to businesses and threatening to slow the economy.
Some analysts now say that even a mild recession could generate so many failures that the Government's fund that insures bank deposits might need a bailout, too.
The savings bailout bill left the crucial issue of deposit insurance unresolved. The legislation required only that the Treasury Department study the issue and report to Congress by early next year.
Yet it was the existence of deposit insurance, as much as any other single factor, that induced the savings crisis and could cause problems for the banks as well.
The system, set up in the early 1930's after many people lost the money they had in banks that failed during the Depression, placed the Government's safety net behind deposits. Thus, it gave bankers few incentives to avoid high-risk lending.
 
Radical Proposals
Radical proposals, from phasing out Federal insurance in favor of private insurance to slashing the current level of $100,000 an account, have been circulating on Capitol Hill. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told Congress last week that the Treasury was not likely to support a reduction in the $100,000 level but could limit insurance to $100,000 a person, no matter how many accounts. The level was last raised in 1980, from $40,000.
Deposit-insurance reform is a thorny issue. Some experts warn that any substantive change in the system - like reducing the amount insured to $25,000, as some members of Congress have proposed - could prompt runs at banks. Others, with a free-market bent, contend that the Government should greatly reduce its role in deposit insurance and require the industry to insure itself.
While there is no consensus on the cure, many analysts agree that as long as there is no change the entire financial system is vulnerable to another big shock and the American taxpayer will again be called to bail out the system.
''We have a situation in which an even larger debacle can be caused in the banking industry if we don't revamp deposit insurance,'' said Peter J. Wallison, a partner at the Washington law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, who was general counsel to the Treasury from 1981 to 1985.
 
Idea for Private Insurance
Mr. Wallison has proposed a system in which large banks and savings and loan associations would have to form insurance associations on their own and offer deposit insurance to other large institutions. Any losses would have to be absorbed collectively by the banks in those associations, much as the members of the Lloyd's of London insurance market jointly share their losses.
Mr. Wallison noted that the nation's largest banks have $165 billion in capital to cushion against losses, far more than the $13.2 billion of reserves at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's bank insurance fund.
But Congress is expected to resist the idea.
''There is a question of whether the Congress is up to taking that kind of step,'' said Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''It generally likes to be able to blame deregulation and the regulators for all the problems.''
 
The $100,000-a-Person Plan
Still, some changes are expected next year. Many experts are saying the concept that seems to have attracted the most attention now in Congress is the one that Secretary Brady said last week that the Administration could support.
It would limit deposit insurance to $100,000 a person. Now depositors are insured for $100,000 in deposits in each institution where they have accounts, as well as for money in joint accounts up to $100,000, creating almost unlimited coverage.
They also predict that Congress could permit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to adjust its premiums on deposit insurance depending on the risk of a bank's assets, and force depositors of the largest banks to take an automatic loss - of about 10 to 15 percent - on their uninsured deposits in the event of failure.
 
Fear of Strains on Banks
The issue of limits on deposit insurance and the condition of the commercial banks are closely tied. For increasingly, financial experts are asking whether the nation's commercial banking system is going to encounter such strains that the Government will be called upon to lend assistance.
Few predict that, even under the worst conditions, commercial banks would have problems of the dimension of the savings industry's crisis. The bank regulatory structure has been much stronger; banks have held a much more diversified array of assets, and their managements, in general, have been more professional.
But the banking sector is almost three times the size of the savings industry. Even a modest shock could be very costly to taxpayers.
 
An Industry May Disappear
While the fate of the banking industry is uncertain, the future of the savings industry seems clear. By the end of the decade, experts say, it will be extinct, in large part because of the bailout legislation.
On the rationale that the industry must pay up first, before the American taxpayer is made to pay, the legislation required the healthy institutions that remained to take a sizable amount out of their profits each year and put it toward the cleanup -even as their costs of doing business were raised. Under the legislation, capital requirements were increased to levels roughly on a par with commercial banks; the amount of money an institution could lend to a single borrower was limited, and a new rule said that at least 70 percent of an institution's assets, up from 60 percent, had to be invested in mortgage-related assets.
While few dispute the prudence of these changes, the speed at which they were imposed on the industry seems draconian, even to the industry's toughest critics.
 
'Vindictiveness in the Legislation'
''There was a kind of vindictiveness in the legislation that I don't think anyone really expected,'' said Bert Ely, a financial consultant based in Alexandria, Va. ''It made thrifts into second-class citizens.''
At the same time, regulators, with a host of new powers and a new-found zeal, moved to shut almost any institution that did not meet the higher capital standards. While much of this action is aimed at preventing an accumulation of losses at institutions that are likely to fail, it also has a strong political component.
Regulators do not want to be hauled before Congress and grilled on why they did not act quickly enough to close an ailing institution. One result is that the Government, casting about for buyers for hundreds of seized institutions, has found relatively few eager investors.
 
S.& L. Charters Lose Value
''All this means that the charter value of a thrift is now much less than before,'' said James R. Barth, Lowder Eminent Scholar in Finance at Auburn University in Alabama. ''And it is going to get harder to get people to come in investing in this industry, and you have driven up the cost of the bailout.''
Still, there is a large school of thought that says such pain is unavoidable and that even more pain should be imposed. In this view, revamping the deposit insurance system is not the surest way to prevent a repeat of the savings and loan debacle. Instead, these people say, both banks and savings institutions should be required to hold capital cushions, which include cash reserves and investments by shareholders, well in excess of 10 percent of their assets, up from current levels of 6 percent.
''Look at the early part of this century,'' said George S. Kaufman, John F. Smith Jr. Professor of Economics and Finance at Loyola University of Chicago. ''The capital levels were 20 percent. It doesn't take much of an economic shock to wipe out 6 percent capital.''

HEADLINE: Company's Rise is Built on Credit

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: REDWOOD CITY, Calif.

 BODY:
Credit cards are now being tried in fast-food outlets, grocery stores, movie theaters and other places that have historically not accepted them. And that is music to Hatim A. Tyabji's ears.
Mr. Tyabji's company, Verifone Inc., is by far the leading supplier of those ubiquitous little boxes that retailers use to check on the credit cards of customers. It garnered 65 percent of North American sales of such point-of-sale terminals in 1989, according to an industry newsletter, POS News in Chicago. And its revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of 70 percent for five years.
Now, Verifone, which went public earlier this year, stands poised to benefit from the rapidly spreading use of magnetic cards, not only at new types of retailers but beyond retail purchases. 
 
A Card Instead of Stamps
Some states and counties are beginning to issue magnetic cards to recipients of food stamps, welfare payments, unemployment insurance and other government benefits.
Verifone terminals, for instance, are being used in a New York State pilot project in which food-stamp recipients are given a magnetic card instead of stamps. When they buy food, the store runs the card through a terminal, which dials a computer to find how much money is in the customer's account. If the purchase is approved, the amount of the purchase is automatically deducted from the customer's account.
Health insurance is also starting to be handled that way. In one system already used in 50,000 drugstores, pharmacists can run a magnetic card through a terminal to find how much of a purchase is covered by insurance. The customer then pays only the amount not covered and the insurance company is informed without the pharmacist and customer having to fill out forms.
Indeed, transaction processing, or ''transaction automation'' as Verifone calls it, is one of the fastest-growing parts of the computer business. ''We have found a veritable gold mine,'' said Mr. Tyabji, the company's president and chief executive.
 
Small Computers
Verifone's terminals are actually small computers with built-in software and a built-in modem for communicating with other computers over the phone lines. Instead of a keyboard, they have alpha-numeric keypads like those on telephones, and instead of a full screen, they have small displays that can show a line or two of data. The machine reads the information off the magnetic card as it is run through a slot and then dials a phone number and connects with other computers to verify the credit of a customer. It then displays a message that the purchase should be accepted or rejected.
Because its machines are computers, Verifone has been able to program in other functions besides credit card authorization. The same box can be used by a retail shop to keep track of the hours worked by its employees, transmitting the information electronically to a company that produces payroll checks. Gasoline stations use Verifone boxes to keep track of inventory and reorder electronically when supplies are low.
Mr. Tyabji contends that computers are thus sneaking into retail establishments that otherwise would not purchase a personal computer. ''These are computers for people who don't know they're using computers,'' he said.
 
Some Clouds
But that is also Verifone's biggest risk. As more establishments get full personal computers, Verifone's boxes might not be needed. In the pharmacy system, only 12,000 of the roughly 50,000 pharmacies use Verifone terminals, with the rest punching in the account numbers of customers on personal computers, according to an official of PCS Inc., which runs the service.
Similarly, the huge makers of electronic cash registers, including the NCR Corporation and I.B.M., are working on building credit card reading and verification into their machines, similarly doing away with the need for a special terminal. Verifone officials hope that at least some of these companies will license its technology rather than develop their own.
Verifone was founded in Hawaii in 1981 by William N. Melton, who had founded another company that ran a data bank to help retailers verify checks. Verifone charged into the market for credit card verification terminals by cutting manufacturing costs to the bone, underselling its competitors by several hundred dollars.
But the company's first products did not work as they were supposed to. The company was poorly managed, perennially short of capital and lived from crisis to crisis. It was ''management by reactive panic mode,'' said Frank J. Caufield, a partner in the venture capital firm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, which invested in Verifone in 1985.
 
New Management
In 1986 the venture capitalists recruited Mr. Tyabji, a high-ranking executive of the Sperry Corporation who had decided to leave when the company was bought by Burroughs to form Unisys.
A native of India who came to the United States to attend graduate school in electrical engineering at the State University of New York at Buffalo, Mr. Tyabji provided the professional management the company needed.
Mr. Tyabji is almost universally described as extremely intense and hard-working, even to the point of working without a secretary and answering his own phones. Burton J. McMurtry, a Verifone director and partner in Technology Venture Investors, an early investor in the company, said he and other directors have been urging Mr. Tyabji to slow down a little, to prevent health problems or burnout.
 
A Global Operation
Verifone, which moved here from Hawaii in 1985 to be closer to its customers, venture capitalists and engineering talent, is a widely dispersed company that went public in March at $16 a share. [It closed yesterday at $20.25, down 37 1/2 cents, in trading over the counter.] With only 900 employees, the company has development offices in Hawaii, India, Taiwan, Silicon Valley and near Sacramento, with manufacturing in Taiwan and a distribution center in Southern California.
Verifone has continued to gain market share in recent years, in part through the 1989 purchase of the point-of-sale terminal business of its closest competitor, the Icot Corporation of San Jose, Calif. Its competitors include National Business Systems of Canada; Omron, a Japanese company, and Hypercom, an Australian concern.
The company recorded net income of $10.1 million, or 50 cents a share, in 1989, up 57 percent from the previous year, as revenues jumped 68 percent, to $123.5 million. Analysts expect profits of 80 cents a share this year with sales growing to $170 million.
But Verifone is now facing saturation in its primary market, because most small retail shops that accept credit cards already have a terminal.
 
Looking Abroad
To grow, Verifone is looking at new areas. One is to expand international sales, which account for less than 10 percent of the company's revenues.
Another potentially huge opportunity comes from the acceptance of credit cards at places that never took them before, ranging from supermarkets to taxis. Such places generally have shunned the cards because the procedure takes too long or the purchase is not large enough to merit the processing expense.
Now Verifone, as well as competitors and credit card companies, are experimenting with systems that send information about invalid cards by radio waves to the terminal in the store, which holds the information. That allows a terminal to verify a card without having to connect to a central computer, cutting the time for authorization from about 20 seconds to a couple of seconds.
 
Transferring Money
Verifone has also been trying to make its terminals more versatile. In addition to authorizing use of credit cards, many of the company's terminals now automatically arrange the transfer of money from the bank that issued the credit card to the retailer's bank. The merchant thus avoids paper work and can get paid for a credit card purchase in a day instead of the 7 to 10 days it once took.
Other new uses, which also include time and attendance reporting, inventory control and electronic mail, increase the price Verifone can charge for its terminals, which now range from $100 to $1,700.
Verifone officials, and many in the electronic funds-transfer business, also envision far greater use of cards for government benefits, frequent-shopper programs, health insurance and other uses.
''This is far more than just credit cards,'' Mr. Tyabji said. ''We are changing the way people live and I would submit to you that we haven't even started.''

HEADLINE: Invasion Shakes Up Markets

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar rose, gold prices jumped and most of the world's stock markets fell as the news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait spread around the world yesterday.
From Tokyo to New York, investors fled to the safe havens of the dollar and gold because of the world tension, and they dumped stocks because of fears of higher oil prices, rising inflation and slower economic growth.
In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average slumped 34.66 points, to 2,864.60. [Page D6.] And bond prices dropped sharply and interest rates rose. [Page D14.] Dollar's Rise and Fall These were typical market responses to a crisis situation. But more surprisingly, the dollar, which had risen 2.1 percent against the German mark in an early reaction to the invasion, had fallen back by the end of currency trading in New York to just above where it started the day. 
The dollar also advanced and then retreated against all other leading currencies.
And gold, which rose about $12 on news of the invasion, drifted back down and was only $3.50 higher for the day, at $376.80 an ounce in New York.
Traders and analysts said that by the end of the trading day the military situation appeared to be less serious than thought earlier, partly because of the response from the United States and its allies and the cooperation from the Soviet Union, which cut off its arms shipments to Iraq.
 
Moderation of Concern
This meant that the longer-term view on the dollar - that it will decline because interest rates here will fall while they remain stable or rise abroad - took hold again. On Tuesday, traders holding this view had sent the dollar down to near its all-time low against the German mark.
''You bought the dollar on the invasion,'' said Richard E. Witten, vice president of foreign exchange at Goldman Sachs & Company. ''But when it appeared that what was going to happen next was not electric, you sold the dollar.''
By the end of the day in New York, he added, ''there was a moderation of concern.'' He warned, however, that Iraq could send the dollar up again with another surprise move.
But fears of higher inflation remain. Higher inflation is the first effect of higher oil prices. The expectation of this inflation, in turn, would force market interest rates higher as investors demand higher returns to compensate for the rising prices. And central banks, in an effort to curb price rises by slowing economic growth, could also push interest rates up.
But the jump in oil prices itself would also slow economic growth by reducing spending power. That is most worrisome in the United States and Britain, whose economies are growing very slowing and could be tipped into recessions.
This threat of both higher inflation and slower growth also makes choosing a level of interest rates that allows growth but fights inflation more difficult for central banks, like the Federal Reserve.
 
'A Negative for the Stock Markets'
The Iraqi invasion caused stock markets in London, Frankfurt, Paris, and Tokyo to fall sharply, and the United States bond and stock markets failed to recover much of the ground lost in the morning. And it is likely that expectations of higher inflation will remain for some time, weakening both bond and stock markets around the world.
''At the moment, this is clearly a negative for the stock markets,'' said Martin Paling, international investment strategist for James Capel & Company in London. ''We could be back to square one in a day or so, but it adds to our caution anyway.''
Madhav Dhar, a global strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, in New York, said the rise in oil prices worsened the already generally pessimistic outlook for world stock markets.
Many of the world markets are already sluggish or, like the American market, declining from all-time highs, partly because of disappointing corporate earnings.
 
Problems for Tokyo
Analysts expect the worst market impact to be felt in Japan, which imports all of its oil. Even before the Iraqi invasion, oil prices worldwide had begun to rise because of the recent agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce production.
The OPEC members had raised their target price by $3, to $21 a barrel for a mix of OPEC crude oils. Now analysts say a $25-a-barrel price is possible if Iraq decides to curtail production further on its own.
However large the increase, it will be magnified by the fact that the Japanese yen is so weak against the dollar, the currency in which oil is priced. Compared with an average price of $18 for Brent crude oil in 1989, for example, a $25 price for the Japanese, after accounting for a weak yen, is about a 50 percent increase.
The impact of higher oil prices on Japan contributed to the fall of the Tokyo stock market yesterday. The Nikkei 225-stock index lost 592.81 points, or 1.92 percent, to 30.245.18.
 
Worries in Europe
In West Germany and Britain, the impact of the higher oil prices will not be as severe because their currencies have strengthened significantly recently against the dollar. But concerns about the need for higher interest rates to fight inflation will not help the stock and bond markets.
The London stock market's main indicator, the Financial Times-100, fell 34.5 points yesterday, or 1.48 percent, to 2,304.5, while the DAX index in Frankfurt dropped 23.51 points, or 1.24 percent, to 1,869.38.
But the invasion has helped markets in countries that produce significant amounts of oil, gas and gold. The stock market in Norway, whose economy heavily relies on the revenue it receives from its North Sea oil production, hit a record high yesterday. And in Australia, the All Ordinaries Index shot up 30 points, or 1.89 percent, to 1,616.8, helped in part by a surge in gold and oil stocks.
 
Gains for the Dollar
In the currency markets, the dollar ended trading in New York at 1.5917 marks yesterday, just above its 1.5883 close on Wednesday. When trading opened in New York, however, after the invasion news swept the markets in Asia and Europe, the dollar rose to 1.6215.
Against the yen, the dollar closed at 149.25 in New York, up from 147.30 Wednesday but down from its intraday high yesterday of 151.50. In Toyko this afternoon, the dollar was trading as high as 150.20 yen, up from yesterday,s close of 148.90 yen.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Fell 1.5% in June

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Orders to factories for manufactured goods declined 1.5 percent in June, the Commerce Department said today. It was the third time this year that the monthly total of orders declined from the month before.
The report added to analysts' fears of a possible recession, which were intensified by rising oil prices caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
''We're in a precarious position, on the edge of a recession,'' said Thomas Runiewicz, an economist with the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. ''With the problems in the Middle East and the threat of higher oil prices, that may be just enough to push us over.''
 
Soaring Oil Prices
After the Iraqi army pushed into neighboring Kuwait this morning, oil prices soared amid fears the invasion would reduce the world's oil supply.
But Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, contended that even a 25 percent rise in oil prices could be absorbed by the economy without halting its growth.
''Even if the higher price is enforced, our economy today is much better able to absorb modest price increases,'' Mr. Boskin said today in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
In its report on factory orders, the Commerce Department said the decline was concentrated in durable goods, which are higher priced items expected to last more than three years, like major appliances and automobiles. Orders for these goods fell 2.8 percent from May, to $125.1 billion, after a 2.2 percent advance a month earlier.
 
Plunge in Military Goods
More than half of the decline in orders for durables was in military goods, which dropped by 20.3 percent, to $8 billion. Excluding the military sector, orders would have dropped only seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Orders for nondurable goods were flat, at $112.3 billion.
Robert G. Dederick, chief economist with the Northern Trust Company of Chicago, noted that factory orders had bounced up and down throughout the first half of the year and, as a result, the manufacturing sector ''is really just spinning its wheels.''
Orders had plummeted 5.5 percent in January - the sharpest drop since a 7 percent decrease in December 1974. They then rose 1.8 percent in February and 4 percent in March before dropping 2.1 percent in April. Orders were up 2.2 percent in May.
 
A Loss of Jobs
As orders decline, industry tends to cut production and jobs. In fact, the Labor Department had reported earlier the loss of 31,000 factory jobs in June.
Because many factory-made items, particularly durable goods, are purchased with loans, the manufacturing sector has been adversely affected by the high interest rates maintained by the Federal Reserve in its effort to slow the economy to curb inflation.
But even if the higher oil prices do not jolt the economy into recession, they tend to drive up overall living costs and hamper the central bank's anti-inflation efforts.
The factory orders report did contain one hopeful sign, a gain of six-tenths of 1 percent, to $36.1 billion, in the important category of nonmilitary capital goods. This barometer of business investment plans had fallen 1.8 percent in May.

HEADLINE: Dow Slumps 34.66 Points, But Oils Soar

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Inflation fears touched off by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait pushed most stock prices lower yesterday, including airlines and other users of petroleum products, but sent oil and oil-service stocks sharply higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which had sunk as much as 52 points around 11:30, closed at 2,864.60, down 34.66, or 1.2 percent. Trading activity soared to the highest level in nine months.
Eight of the 10 most active issues on the New York Stock Exchange included some of the world's biggest oil companies. Leading the list, Chevron rose 1 5/8, to 80 3/8, with nearly 12 million shares changing hands, and reached a new high of 81 1/4 during trading. Texaco, No. 2, surged 2 5/8, to 66 5/8, on 6.2 million shares and also reached a new high, of 68 1/2, before falling back. 
 
Volume Up Sharply
Volume jumped to 253.1 million shares from a strong 176.8 million the day before, but 1,211 stocks fell, 144 hit new lows and only 464 advanced. Activity was the heaviest since Oct. 16, when volume soared to 416.3 million after the previous session's slide.
Although crude oil prices have been climbing, analysts maintained that the situation in the Middle East was so fluid that the direction of prices was uncertain and would continue that way for some time. Hugh Johnson, head strategist for the Albany Corporation, a brokerage firm, said, ''If oil prices stay high, it could endanger the economic recovery, which is closing in on its eighth anniversary.''
The oil price rise also ''darkens the outlook for the economies of West Germany and Japan,'' he said, noting that they rely more heavily than the United States on Middle Eastern oil.
 
Saudi Reaction Awaited
''The key economic question,'' said Peter J. Canelo, investment strategist for the Wall Street firm of Bear, Stearns & Company, ''is where does the price of oil go?'' The big consideration, he added, ''may prove to be what the Saudis do.''
He argued that it was in the interest of Saudi Arabia and most members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain moderate prices. After consultation with Stephen A. Smith, the Bear, Stearns oil analyst, he described his idea of moderate as around $18 a barrel for Saudi crude and the ''low 20's'' for West Texas intermediate.
''If Iraq really wants the price to stay high and cuts Kuwait's production, will the Saudis make up that shortfall?'' he asked. ''We believe the Saudis will increase production to achieve stability.''
Program trading - particularly program selling - helped push the market down sharply. Birinyi Associates, which tracks such activity, said the net effect of the buying and selling was to lop slightly more than 19 points off the Dow.
 
Other Oil Stocks Up
Among other oil stocks on the Big Board active list, Exxon rose 1 1/8, to 53 1/4, also reaching a new high of 55. Mobil rose 1 7/8, to 67 1/4, a new high. USX, which owns oil interests, rose 1/2, to 34 5/8. Phillips Petroleum rose 7/8, to 29 5/8, after a new high of 30 1/2. Unocal, the 10th-most-active stock, rose 2 1/8, to 33 1/4, with 3.2 million shares changing hands.
Arco gained 5, to 135 1/2; British Petroleum 4, to 79 3/4; Oryx Energy, 3 3/8, to 52 1/4; Amoco 2 7/8, to 58 1/4; Amerada Hess 2 7/8, to 52; Union Pacific, which has oil and gas interests, 2 3/8, to 77 7/8 and Pennzoil 2 1/4, to 84 3/8.
Companies that serve the oil producers also gained. Schlumberger rose 2 1/4, to 68 3/4, hitting a new high of 69. Dresser rose 2 1/8, to 55 1/2, with a new high of 55 3/4. McDermott International rose 2, to 34 1/2, yet another high.
Mr. Canelo of Bear, Stearns argued that ''if the energy sector benefits from higher oil prices, other sectors will be forced to pay the cost.'' He mentioned consumer durables and particularly cars, airlines, some utilities using oil and energy-intensive industries, like steel and aluminum.
 
Utilities Hold Up
Ford fell 1 1/4, to 39 7/8; G.M. 1 1/2, to 43 7/8, and Chrysler 5/8, to 14 3/8. Except for UAL, which fell 5 7/8, to 130 on financing woes, airline stocks fell slightly. Utility stocks held up well. Reynolds Metals lost 1 1/4, to 65, and Alcoa 1, to 67 1/4.
In response to a gold price rise, gold stocks advanced, with Newmont Mining, rising 1 3/4, to 51 5/8.
Fund American, which is selling Fireman's Fund to Allianz A.G., rose 11 5/8, to 49 3/4. But with a drop in bond prices depressing insurance investments, insurance stocks fell. A.I.G., a market favorite, fell 3, to 71.
Drug stocks fell in the wake of strong increases already made this year. Bristol Myers fell 2 3/4, to 62 1/4. Lilly 2, to 82 5/8, Merck 2 5/8, to 87 1/4 and Syntex 2 3/8, to 59 1/8.

HEADLINE: More Companies Choosing to Self-Insure Benefits

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
More than 50 percent of the nation's employees with health insurance provided by their employer now work for companies that design and insure their own health benefits, a sharp increase over the past 15 years, an insurance industry group reports.
Many smaller companies, including a majority of companies with 500 to 1,000 employees, are following the lead of Fortune 500 corporations that have long been self-insured.
Unlike traditional health insurance, in which a company pays premiums to an insurance carrier that bears the risks and pays the claims, a self-insured company assumes the risk itself and creates a fund with which to pay health claims. Money in the fund is usually invested until it is needed to pay the claims. 
 
Incentives for Self-Insurance
The major incentives for self-insurance include exemption from potentially costly benefits that are mandated by the states, exemption from state taxes on insurance premiums, and the ability of the self-insurers to design their own plans and invest the money previously paid as premiums until it is needed to pay health expenses.
The major drawback of self-insurance is the exposure to financial risk.
''The largest insurer in America is not Blue Cross/Blue Shield, but the nation's employers,'' said Jon R. Gabel, associate director of research and statistics at the Health Insurance Association of America, which provided the estimate on self-insured companies. Mr. Gabel called the growth of self-insurance ''a quiet revolution in health care.''
Only 5 percent of employees were in self-insured plans in 1974, Mr. Gabel said. That was the year of enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA, which exempted self-insured plans from both mandated benefits and state insurance premium taxes.
Jim Kinder, executive vice president of the Self-Insurance Institute of America, which designs such programs, said the major advantage of self-insurance was: ''You're buying the level of services you need, not a product offered by an insurance company. It's the difference between buying a fully-loaded automobile, and buying an automobile with just the equipment that you want on it.'' 1989 Study A study last year found that 51 percent of the firms that converted to self-insurance from 1981 to 1984 would not have done so if there were no state-mandated benefits. The study was co-authored by Mr. Gabel and Prof. Gail A. Jensen, a health economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Exemption from state-mandated benefits is one reason that Subaru of America, with 1,150 employees and headquarters at Cherry Hill, N.J., began self-insuring on July 1. ''We'll have greater flexibility in designing our health-care program,'' said Monica Haley, manager of executive compensation and benefits.
One advantage, she said, was that Subaru did not have to comply with state laws that require ''coordination of benefits'' or full co-insurance for employees whose spouses are covered by other policies. Under self-insurance, Subaru will co-insure only the difference between what the spouse's company pays and what it allows on a claim. The ensuing savings will enable the company to offer expanded benefits in other areas, she said.
Subaru will also be able to earn interest on the money that it would otherwise spend on premiums. The company will pay an insurance company to administer the plan.
 
'Stop-Loss' Insurance
Like other self-insurers, Subaru will now assume the financial risks previously borne by its insurance carrier. But to protect itself against unexpectedly large claims, it will buy catastrophic ''stop-loss'' insurance from a carrier, a common practice among self-insurers.
Large companies are better able to bear those risks. A study of 1,943 companies last year by A. Foster Higgins & Company, an employee benefits consulting firm, found that only 30 percent of companies with fewer than 500 employees were self-insured, while the percentage rose steadily for larger companies: to 52 percent for those with 500 to 999 employees; 58 percent for those with 1,000 to 4,999, and up to 82 percent for companies with more than 40,000 employees. Over all, 52 percent of the companies surveyed were self-insured.
Dewey Dresser, a benefits specialist at Dewey Ballantine Bushby Palmer & Wodd, a New York law firm, said the growth of the 1,100-employee law firm had put self-insurance on the horizon. ''We're approaching the level where we might consider it, but we're not there yet,'' Mr. Dresser said.
 
State Risk Pools
The trend toward self-insurance will have a minimal effect on state risk pools for uninsurable individuals, according to Carl Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association. He noted that 24 states now have such pools, but with a total enrollment of only 53,712 of the two million Americans considered uninsurable. Although the pools are financed by insurance companies, based on a percentage of premiums, some states are now considering legislation that would require self-insurers to contribute as well, Mr. Schramm said.
The biggest disadvantage of self-insurance, experts agree, is the risk that the companies assume. ''A few unanticipated catastrophic cases like AIDS or cancer can threaten the solvency of a fund,'' Mr. Gabel noted.
Such possible catastrophes were the reason that Hill & Knowlton, a New York public relations company with 1,100 employees, decided against self-insurance. ''It crosses our mind every now and then,'' said Sharon Shea, director of employee benefits. ''But we're not a large company. If we should have a bad year, we'd be in trouble. With AIDS or cancer, you get one case and you're looking at $100,000 for one employee.''
Because processing claims can be complex and time consuming, more than 75 percent of self-insured companies turn to another company to administer the health plan.

Long-Term U.S. Bonds Tumble

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds tumbled yesterday, sending interest rates up, after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The invasion raised the specter of a resurgence of oil-fueled inflation, which would undermine the values of bonds and other fixed-income securities.
The Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in 2020, were offered late in the day at 103 5/32, down 1 9/32, as the yield climbed to 8.45 percent from 8.34 percent on Wednesday.
A point in bond prices is equivalent to $10 on each $1,000 of face value. Thus, the long bond lost almost $12.50 on each $1,000 of face value, which is considered substantial. 
But prices of most corporate bonds, which usually take their cue from similar Treasury maturities, registered relatively small losses. The largest declines were in the junk bond sector, where they ranged between a half-point to a full point on RJR Nabisco issues.
Also unnerving to many bond investors was the relative stability of short-term Treasury note prices. That stability was interpreted as precluding any change in Federal Reserve policy because the short-term notes would be among the issues most immediately influenced by any change in Fed policy.
''The big questions in the bond market when we went home Wednesday were how much higher prices would go, and whether the delay over the Federal budget was preventing the Fed from slashing interest rates,'' said Jonathan B. Greenspan, chief trader at the Aegis Capital Management Corporation. ''We woke up to a cold inflation shower, with Treasury bond prices already crumbling overseas on news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Gold was up $12 in London, where oil prices were also going through the roof.''
 
Oil and Gold Prices
Although gold and oil prices, viewed by many as barometers of future inflation, gave up much of their early gains, the bond market did not recover from its losses. About the only positive factor in the bond market was the dollar's early strength, which did not fade until the close of the New York foreign exchange market.
Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International, said that in light of the Fed's preoccupation with inflation, ''it is unlikely that the Fed is about to lower interest rates, even if the current economic situation increases the chances for a recession.''
''This is what bothered many bond investors today,'' he said.
But Mr. Brusca pointed out that ''the oil situation today is in no way similar to the 1973 embargo by the Arab members of OPEC.''
''Nor will the Fed print more money to pay for higher oil prices, as it did with disastrous results for inflation after the 1973 embargo,'' he added.
 
Banking System Reserves
What the Federal Reserve system did yesterday was pump a large amount of reserves into the banking system through four-day repurchase agreements. Whether the move was a technical adjustment or not, it kept the bedrock cost of credit - Federal funds - from rising. The funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, closed at 8 percent, after trading at 8 1/16 percent for much of the day.
As a result, discount rates on Treasury bills were relatively firm. The rate on 90-day bills was unchanged at 7.43 percent; six-month bills rose 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.31 percent, and the one-year bills gained 7 basis points, at 7.19 percent.
Meanwhile, the closely watched 8 percent notes of 1992, the shortest Treasury coupon issue, fell only 3/32, to 100 7/32, for a yield of 7.88 percent. By comparison, the 8.5's of 1994 fell 8/ 32, to 101 13/32, for a yield of 8.07; the 8.5's of 1997 dropped 19/32, to 100 3/32, and a yield of 8.29 percent, and the Treasury's long notes, the 8 7/8's of the year 2000, lost 21/32, at 103 8/32, as the yield climbed to 8.38 percent from 8.27 percent the day before.
The Treasury auctioned $4 billion of 44-day cash management bills at an average discount yield of 7.60 percent. If Congress raises the Federal debt ceiling from the current level of $3.1 trillion, the Treasury might have to postpone its record $32.25 billion refunding and other auctions scheduled next week.
In the corporate bond market, the prices of the two widely traded high-yield RJR Nabisco Inc., bonds each lost a point in light trading. The 2007 issue closed at 91.75 and the 2009 bonds at 113 5/8.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
The Hunt For Clients Intensifies

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
AS the competition for new accounts becomes fierce, a growing number of agencies are being forced to learn how to hustle.
In better times, many agencies simply relied on their reputations to attract new business or counted on the old-boy network to push business their way. But industry analysts said these systems are no longer effective because the slowdown in the economy has led many advertisers to cut their media budgets and avoid changing their accounts too often because every switch is costly.
''With so many small and mid-size agencies doing outstanding work, the agencies that will have the best chance of winning new business are the ones that go out and aggressively pull clients their way,'' said Lee Anne Morgan, a principal at Morgan Anderson & Company, a consulting firm that helps clients find agencies. 
Professionals specializing in finding new business for advertising agencies are in such demand that many top people in the field command salaries of $300,000 to $400,000 a year. A top new-business executive will make about 20 cold calls a day and will keep in touch with more than a thousand potential clients.
Large agencies like Young & Rubicam and Lintas USA have well-established departments for seeking out new business. But most small and medium-size agencies never bothered hiring such specialists.
Not any more. Take the case of Cadwell Davis Partners. Executives at the New York agency, which has billings of about $100 million, recently decided that the only way to guarantee healthy growth was to hire a new-business specialist.
''We would just sit back and wait for one of our clients to recommend us to someone new,'' said Franchellie Cadwell, the agency's president. ''It isn't a system that works well now.''
Specialists in locating new business have also become more important because clients are becoming more reluctant to change agencies, even if they are not entirely satisfied with the work they are getting. ''The cost of switching has become prohibitive,'' Ms. Morgan said. The hunt for a new agency takes a minimum of three months of full-time searching by a firm's top executives, time that many companies cannot afford in today's tough business climate, the analysts said. And, once a new agency is found, it can take more than a year to get it up to speed on the account, they said.
Insuring a constant influx of new clients was so important to the Saatchi & Saatchi Company that it dispatched a specialist in new business from its London office to teach its account acquisition system to executives at its American divisions, Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising and Backer Spielvogel Bates, neither of which have been on a big winning streak this year.
''The agencies were counting too much on the old system of expecting current clients to substantially increase their budgets every year,'' said David Miln, the director of new-business development at Saatchi & Saatchi in London. ''We needed to be more aggressive. We have to teach everyone how to be the right kind of hunters.''
Some agencies are establishing departments that focus on generating new business because top executives have realized that they do not have the time to chase after new clients. ''I tried to do it myself, but it has become clear that I should have hired a new-business specialist from day one,'' said Cliff Freeman, who started Cliff Freeman & Partners in 1987. ''All my time was taken up doing work for the clients I already had.''
In addition, Mr. Freeman said, he was not any good at the job. So two months ago, he hired a specialist. His agency is already talking seriously with several prospective clients, he said.
Many agencies do not know how to put together a new-business department, and some are turning to consultants to do the job for them.
''Many agencies go about it all wrong,'' said Kathy McCabe, a partner at Creamer Towbridge & Case, a new-business consulting company. ''They pursue a prospective client like it was some prey that had to be chased down.'' Ms. McCabe said one of the most important things her firm teaches agencies is that it takes three to five years of conversations to build a relationship with a prospect that will pay off.
Still, not all agency executives think a new-business department is a necessity. Foote Cone & Belding Communications, for example, is one of the few large agencies that has no such department and last year received $250 million in new business.
''We don't go out and beat the bushes,'' said Norman Brown, the agency's chairman and chief executive. ''We still believe that if we do good work for our clients, the word will get out.''

HEADLINE: Boskin's View on Recession

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Amid a continuing barrage of weak reports on the economy, Michael J. Boskin, the Presidential adviser, said today that the chance of a recession during the next 12 months, while ''low,'' is ''certainly not zero.''
In an appearance before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Mr. Boskin also appeared to retreat from earlier admonitions by the Bush Administration that the Federal Reserve needed to further relax its monetary policy to keep the economy moving forward. He said that while it took time for changes in policy to take effect, the Fed did not necessarily have to cut interest rates in anticipation of a deficit-reduction deal between the White House and Congress but might wait until a deal had been struck.
In discussing the prospect of recession, Mr. Boskin said he disregarded this week's poor reports on the Government's predictive index and on construction spending. He said he would only be concerned about the decline in manufacturing activity, as reflected in the report on the nation's purchasing managers, if this persisted in coming months.
At another point, Mr. Boskin said that while the business cycle had not been eliminated as a fact of economic life, recessions would probably be less frequent in coming decades, partly because of better techniques of managing inventories.

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
IRAQIS MASS ON SAUDI FRONTIER; ARABS AGREE TO MEET ON CRISIS; BUSH IS READY TO HELP IF ASKED

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Powerful Iraqi forces wheeled into position for a possible attack on Saudi Arabia today, while the United States and its allies continued to search, without discernible success, for a way to force Iraq to pull back from its rapid conquest of Kuwait on Thursday.
In Baghdad tonight, a spokesman for the ruling Revolutionary Command Council said Iraq would begin withdrawing its troops from Kuwait on Sunday ''unless something appears which could threaten the security of Kuwait and Iraq.'' But Baghdad radio specified that its ''provisional government,'' denounced as a puppet regime by the United States and most of the world, would remain in control in Kuwait. The White House discounted the Iraqi announcement.
 
Meeting in Saudi Arabia
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq agreed to meet on Sunday in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, with other Arab leaders, Saudi officials announced. The United States and the Soviet Union issued an extraordinary joint statement condemning the invasion, and the Arab League denounced Baghdad, but the outlook for diplomatic efforts was guarded. [Pages 5 and 6.] 
President Bush stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia and said, ''If they ask for specific help - it depends obviously what it is - I would be inclined to help in any way we possibly can.'' He stopped well short of vowing to defend the wealthy and strategically vital oil-producing kingdom with American arms, but conceded that economic sanctions often do not work.
Saudi Arabia, with the world's largest oil reserves, provides 15 percent of United States oil imports. It has been the linchpin of American foreign policy in the region for decades.
 
Military Option Said to Gain
Top American officials indicated that military intervention of some kind was rising rapidly to the top of their list of options. The United States told allies at NATO headquarters in Brussels that it had contingency plans for a military response if Iraq pushed on.
The State Department said 14 American oilfield workers were missing in Kuwait and were presumably in the hands of the Iraqis. But Iraq's Ambassador in Washington, Mohammed al-Mashat, denied in an interview that an attack on Saudi Arabia was imminent and insisted that Iraq held no Americans.
As financial markets on four continents swayed from the force of the turbulence in the Middle East, the Iraqi Army faced pockets of resistance in Kuwait from determined defenders. Reports from Kuwait before all telephone lines were cut spoke of explosions and gunfire shaking the country's main military barracks, and of firefights elsewhere.
Ports, airfields and the three land crossings into Kuwait were closed, said a British diplomat quoted by the Press Association in London. Most telephone lines to the little desert nation at the head of the Persian Gulf were severed, and a loyalist radio station was knocked off the air.
Its last, despairing message was an appeal to other Arabs, ''Rush, rush to our help.''
Pentagon officials said that more than 60,000 Iraqi troops were massing in the southern part of Kuwait, not far from a major oilfield in Saudi Arabia.
A State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said Iraqi troops were within 5 to 10 miles of the frontier. The British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said the Iraqis were massing on the border.
The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said, ''They are close enough to the Saudi border to indicate cause for concern, but we don't know what their intentions or motives are.''
Squabbling broke out in the Bush Administration over who bore the responsibility for the United States being caught flat-footed by the Iraqi offensive. White House officials blamed the Central Intelligence Agency for providing faulty intelligence, and the C.I.A. blamed policy-makers for failing to heed ample warnings.
 
Parallel Drawn to 1930's
Increasingly, military analysts, scholars and politicians compared the situation in the Middle East with that in Central Europe in the 1930's - with a dictatorial aggressor, determined to gobble up neighboring countries, moving boldly while the rest of the world wondered what to do about it.
Saudi Arabia seemed to be in the pivotal position. Any regional American defense effort would require Saudi agreement to provide the United States with bases on a level never before contemplated.
Any effort to drive oil prices down, thus denying President Hussein one of the fruits of capturing Kuwait, increased oil revenues, would require increased Saudi crude-oil production.
The Arab League decided after two days of debate in Cairo to denounce Baghdad's conduct, but 7 of the 21 members abstained - Iraq, Jordan, Mauritania, Yemen, Sudan, Djibouti and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Although the Arab representatives had said they were holding back in the hope of fostering peace talks, their comments suggested that they feared Iraq's wrath if they spoke out.
In Jordan, a country that acts as an American ally on many issues, state-controlled newspapers backed Iraq and said the United States should not intervene in what they called ''our Arab region.''
 
A Call for Sanctions
Other major nations, including some that depend on Iraqi oil, joined the United States in condemning the invasion, and at the United Nations the United States pressed for broad mandatory sanctions. Mr. Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, said his country was willing to take part in a total trade embargo against Iraq, but he added, ''It only works if everybody does it.''
The United States-Soviet statement of condemnation, a highly unusual development, was issued after Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d paid a quick visit to Moscow to meet with his Soviet counterpart, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. The Soviet Union, Iraq's main military supplier along with China and France, cut off arms shipments on Thursday.
But the superpowers appeared to have less leverage than they once did in the Middle East.
''Ironically, the end of the cold war means there is less chance for the two powers to discipline smaller countries because there isn't the risk of a nuclear confrontation,'' said Robert Hunter, a former White House official who is now a senior fellow in Middle East Studies at Georgetown University.
 
'Draw the Line in the Sand'
It remained unclear whether the United States planned to move boldly to counter the Iraqi takeover in Kuwait, or tacitly acquiesce in it while throwing down the gauntlet on Saudi Arabia, or do neither.
Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, called on President Bush to ''draw a line in the sand'' in front of Iraqi forces.
''We need to tell Saddam Hussein that an invasion of Saudi Arabia means war,'' he said. ''That message needs to be delivered this week while it might influence his decision.''
Representative William S. Broomfield of Michigan, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, used even blunter language. He said: ''Saddam stuck his finger in our eye. I say, let's break his arm.''
Another Democrat, Representative Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee dealing with the Middle East, argued that Mr. Bush and others were underestimating President Hussein and his determination to dominate.
''This mistake will be compounded if George Bush doesn't understand he's not dealing with some errant European leader,'' Mr. Torricelli said. ''Congress and the President's pronouncements will have no impact on Saddam's policy. Nothing but the deployment of force and clear willingness to use it will do.''
 
Bush's Guarded Tone
Clearly conscious of the difficulties that American intervention would bring, Mr. Bush spoke in much more guarded terms at a brief news conference on the White House lawn late this afternoon before leaving for Camp David.
With Kuwait under occupation, the President said, ''the status quo is unacceptable, and further expansion'' by the Iraqi forces ''would be even more unacceptable.'' Mr. Bush declined to confirm reports that he had asked Turkey and Saudi Arabia, in telephone conversations with their leaders, to cut the two pipelines that carry Iraqi oil across their territories to the sea.
Any American military operation would have to be a major one, experts said, because of Iraq's military strength. The United States Army, with 700,000 troops, is not as big as the Iraqi Army, with a million, and there would also be problems with landing large numbers of troops, with bases and with resupply.
''We can dominate the Gulf from a naval standpoint,'' said Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ''We can keep the Iraqis off the water, we can dominate them in the air. But the question of ground troops in that vast desert, that's another matter altogether.''
Nonetheless, a ranking White House official said, a move by Iraqi forces into Saudi Arabia or to harm Americans in Kuwait would all but inevitably trigger a military response.
 
Dispatch of Ships
The aircraft carrier Independence, carrying its normal contingent of jet fighters, attack planes and bombers, is steaming from its post in the Indian Ocean to a position at the mouth of the gulf, along with six escort ships. It is a trip of several thousand miles. The Navy already has eight ships in the gulf, but none carries planes that pose any serious threat to Iraq.
In addition, the carrier Saratoga, which is based in Florida, and the amphibious assault ship Inchon, now at Norfolk, Va., and their escort ships are to leave for the Mediterranean next week.
The ships, plus the carrier Eisenhower, which may well stay on station instead of returning home after the Saratoga arrives, would give the United States considerably more punch. Baghdad and Kuwait are within range of planes operating from the Mediterranean, although some of the aircraft would require in-flight refueling.
Mr. Bush met at length at the White House with his advisers today, and he is to meet them again on Saturday at his Catoctin Mountain retreat, Camp David. He also spoke with a number of world leaders about strategies. The networks struggled to cover the invasion from their home bases, using stock newsreel clips and experts. Critic's Notebook, page 46.

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE CLIMBS THE MOST IN NEARLY 4 YEARS

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
In a mostly grim report that took many analysts by surprise, the Labor Department said today that the nation's unemployment rate climbed three-tenths of a point in July, to 5.5 percent, in the biggest increase since early 1986.
The number of Americans who are working also decreased sustantially. The report intensified worries among private analysts that the economy was tipping into recession or might have already done so.
At the same time, the Labor Department's report, generally considered the best single indicator of economic performance and the first comprehensive one published each month, also pointed to heightened inflation. Average hourly earnings jumped six-tenths of 1 percent last month, and the department increased its initial estimate of how much hourly earnings rose in June. 
 
Some Analysts Very Worried
''I can't imagine a release that could have read much worse,'' commented Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, noting that it came amid the acute uncertainty caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Higher oil prices are considered certain to further slow an already limping economy and likely to aggravate inflationary pressures.
Nonetheless, there were signs that however close the economy has come to ending its long expansion, it is not tumbling into an abyss. There was no increase, for example, in the number of workers who lost jobs last month and the ranks of factory production workers actually increased slightly.
Still, the overall profile of the economy was grim. One of the most discouraging elements in the jobs report, analysts said, was that the longstanding decline of jobs in goods-producing industries was no longer offset by strength in services.
''The services industry has been the major engine of job growth during the current economic expansion'' dating from late 1982, Dr. Janet L. Norwood, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. ''But that engine seems to have sputtered in July.''
The Bush Administration, however, expressed no alarm. ''We believe the economy continues to grow, albeit slowly,'' said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. ''We don't see a recession.''
But Mr. Fitzwater added that sluggish growth ''does reinforce our concern'' for reaching an agreement to reduce the Government's budget deficit.
 
Federal Reserve Faces Problem
The Labor Department's report also led private economists to worry about the problem now facing the Federal Reserve. Confronted with such persuasive evidence of dwindling economic activity, the Federal Reserve would normally be expected to ease its policy in the hope that lower interest rates would provide fresh impetus.
But this time sudden price increases for oil and fresh wage pressures could prevent the Federal Reserve from easing interest rates. This raised the prospect of a business downturn that it could not head off and at least a mild case of the 1970's disease known as stagflation - a weak economy accompanied by high inflation.
The stock market declined today by 54.95 points as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average, to close at 2809.65 after being down more than 120 points. Bond prices continued to tumble, causing the interest rate on the 30-year Treasury bond to rise to 8.55 percent from 8.45 percent on Thursday. Market analysts said events in the Middle East were a major factor in the market's movement, but the unemployment report also weighed in it.
The Labor Department report showed ''extreme weakness'' in the economy, said Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. The department's survey of businesses, to which economists pay close attention, put nonfarm payroll jobs at 110,706,000, or 219,000 below the June level. Although 162,000 of this reflected the laying off of temporary workers hired to conduct the census, analysts had been expecting a modest advance after adjusting for census workers - not a decline.
 
Construction Is Weak
Construction was particularly weak, losing 50,000 jobs, while the previously vigorous growth of jobs in health care slowed to 25,000 after gaining 40,000 in June and 45,000 in May.
Some analysts, including Norman Robertson of the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, found a measure of consolation in the fact that manufacturing lost just 7,000 jobs and that production workers, who account for the largest component in the manufacturing category, actually posted a gain of that amount.
But Mr. Straszheim said he was disappointed that factory jobs continued to decline, since manufactured exports had been counted on heavily to keep the expansion going.
The department's other main survey, of households rather than company payrolls, showed an even bigger overall job loss, of 436,000. Combined with a decline of 69,000 people in the labor force, this caused the number of jobless to rise by 367,000, to 6,814,000, and raised the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent, the highest level since August 1988.
While analysts said the figures were generally discouraging, they pointed to elements showing the economy was not falling into an abyss. The bulk of the rise in unemployment, for example, occurred among teen-agers and others seeking their first jobs or among those re-entering the labor force after an absence.
 
Teen-Agers Hit Hard
Dr. Norwood told the committee that while a smaller proportion of teen-agers looked for work this summer, more of those who did so failed to find jobs and the unemployment rate for teen-agers climbed to 16.3 percent, about a percentage point higher than in 1988 and 1989.
She added that while it was not entirely clear why teen-agers had more trouble finding jobs this year, job growth in retail trade and other service businesses that hire many young people has slowed considerably.
All population groups had higher unemployment rates last month than in June but apart from teen-agers, the only groups for which the rate rose more than the over all jobless rate were black and Hispanic workers. The rate for blacks rose nine-tenths of a point to 11.3 percent, while rate for Hispanic workers rose eight-tenths of a point to 7.9 percent.
The unemployment rate for adult men, at 4.9 percent, now stands a half point higher than a year ago while the rate for women, at 4.7 percent, is in line with the rates prevailing since late 1988, the Labor Department noted.
Among the largest states, the rate for North Carolina jumped nine-tenths of a point to 4.6 percent, while Florida's jobless rate fell eight-tenths of a point, to 5.7 percent. New York's rate rose a statistically insignificant two-tenths of a point, to 5.3 percent, while New Jersey's stood at 4.8 percent for the third straight month.
Among regions, unemployment rates continued to converge with the Northeast and Midwest both at 5.3 percent, the South at 5.5 and the West at 5.6, according to figures that unlike the others are not adjusted for seasonal variation.
The payroll survey also showed that the index of aggregate weekly hours edged up to 130.8 and that the percentage of nonfarm industries adding workers climbed to 51.9 percent.
The six-tenths of 1 percent rise in average hourly pay, to $10.09, compared with a five-tenths of 1 percent increase in June that was revised up from an initial estimate of three-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
PRICE OF OIL RISES; STOCKS IN RETREAT

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Oil prices rose again yesterday and the stock market fell sharply in unusually volatile trading as investors feared that higher energy prices brought on by the turmoil in the Middle East could push an already weak American economy into recession.
After plunging more than 120 points in the biggest selloff since last October's ominous drop, the Dow Jones industrial average recovered rapidly and ended the day down 54.95 points, at 2,809.65.
In the oil markets, West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, closed on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $24.49 a barrel, up $1.38 from the day before and $8.55 since mid-June.
 
Bond Prices Fall
In the credit markets, the price of the Treasury's 30-year bonds fell and interest rates rose on expectation of renewed inflation, while the dollar and gold rose slightly. 
Energy prices have already begun rising for consumers. Around the country, some service stations anticipated higher gasoline prices by raising the pump price; the Michigan chapter of the American Automobile Association, for example, surveyed 100 stations in the Detroit area and found that 30 had raised the price by at least a nickel after closing on Thursday. Northwest Airlines said it would begin charging an $8 fuel surcharge on all domestic tickets as of Aug. 9.
Though the outlook for oil prices and inflation is as uncertain as the developing events in the Middle East, some analysts said the current fears of an inflationary impact seemed exaggerated.
 
View Called Incorrect
Speaking of the Dow's dance, Charles T. Maxwell, the vice chairman of C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell and an energy analyst, said, ''A climactic series of events has convinced people, I think quite incorrectly, of a devastating effect of inflation'' brought on by higher oil prices.
Mr. Maxwell said the market would not support higher oil prices for long, even if Iraq seeks them, unless other factors, like natural disaster, or blockade and embargo, intervene.
Daniel Yergin, of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, predicted that when the dust settled, the Iraqis would want to sell oil. ''These are one-crop economies,'' he said of the Persian Gulf nations.
Other energy experts and economists, taking a longer view, said yesterday that even if President Saddam Hussein of Iraq achieved his goal of raising the price of OPEC oil to $25 a barrel, an increase of about 50 percent from the levels that prevailed before the Kuwait crisis, the effect on this country's pattern of energy use would be modest.
Still, the effects would ripple through the economy.
 
Effect on Prices
''This is probably going to push up the Consumer Price Index by a percent or more,'' said George F. Friesen, an energy expert at Deutsche Bank Group. Higher energy prices mean more reluctance in Washington to raise energy taxes, and therefore a harder job in balancing the budget, he said. ''Increasing the Federal excise tax on gasoline is probably a nonstarter for this year,'' he said.
All the talk of price increases is coming long before a shortage could develop; the Persian Gulf is about six weeks from North America by tanker. In addition, it is not clear if the Iraqi invasion will result in a substantial supply interruption, or a price increase will be any higher than the $21 a barrel that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced it would seek last month.
An increase to $25, which would imply a price of $27 for West Texas Intermediate, which sells for more because it need not be transported so far, would stimulate domestic drilling and probably slow the decline in American oil production, but not stop it, experts said. Production is declining 4 to 5 percent a year.
The higher price would induce oil companies to spend more on exploration and production, but mostly abroad, industry experts said. In this country, companies would quickly turn to more costly ''tertiary recovery'' methods to squeeze more oil out of old fields that cannot be effectively operated at low prices. And the increase would rekindle a stalled trend toward greater energy efficiency and probably encourage energy research, experts say.
 
Research May Be Resumed
''In the last 10 years, the main activity of people working in alternative energy in laboratories has been sending out their resumes,'' said Mr. Yergin, of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. OPEC oil at $25 a barrel would ''get them back to their research,'' he said.
The total change in the energy bill from $25-a-barrel OPEC oil is difficult to figure, because higher prices would induce some conservation and would also lead to lower economic growth, which would also cut consumption. An oil price increase would also pull up the price of natural gas, experts say.
But an increase of about $10 a barrel would come to about $60 billion a year; the nation's energy bill last year for all sources was about $450 billion. The gross national product, or value of all goods and services, was about $5 trillion.
 
Higher Gasoline Prices
The biggest impact of higher oil prices would be higher gasoline prices, since about two-thirds of oil is used in transportation. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in Oak Ridge, Tenn., David L. Greene, a transportation researcher, said, however, that an increase to $25 would not have a large effect on motorists.
''Real fuel prices are as low now as ever,'' he said, pointing out that when inflation is taken into account, gasoline at $1.15 is cheaper than it was before the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74. And the per-mile cost of driving a car has never been lower, he said, because new cars go twice as far on a gallon as cars of the 1960's and early 1970's did. On average, the fleet is 50 percent more efficient.
Before the invasion, West Texas Intermediate was trading from $16 to $21, Dr. Greene pointed out, and an increase to $27 from the top of that range would add only 15 or 20 cents a gallon to gasoline. That is a consumer expenditure of $15 billion to $20 billion a year, which would have a significant effect on the general economy, but would probably make only a modest difference in the market for cars.

HEADLINE: Fight Is Intensified on Fake Documents for Aliens

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Armando Huerta arrived here two months ago from Mexico and, like many of the illegal aliens who continue to come to Southern California, went almost immediately to a seedy part of Alvarado Street near downtown Los Angeles.
There, Mr. Huerta said, he quickly found a man who offered to sell him fake identity papers. Mr. Huerta told the man he could afford to pay $19 - he had $20 but he needed to save $1 for the bus - and the deal was quickly struck. In a few minutes the 23-year-old Mr. Huerta had a counterfeit ''green card'' and Social Security card, allowing him to get temporary jobs in restaurants and construction.
Now Mr. Huerta is looking for a permanent job in a factory, and is settling in as a member of the region's huge illegal work force. 
 
The Most Pressing Problem
The ease with which Mr. Huerta and other newly arrived illegal immigrants can buy fraudulent documents and use them to find jobs has become one of the most pressing problems Government officials face as they try to enforce the nation's 1986 immigration law.
As long as illegal immigrants believe they can find jobs and relative prosperity in the United States, experts say, the Immigration and Naturalization Service will continue to have difficulty stemming the flow of illegal aliens from Mexico and other economically distressed nations to the south.
''This is the premier fraud problem facing the immigration service,'' said Lynn Nelson-Paretta, the service's senior special agent for investigations in Washington.
The 1986 law, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, gave many illegal aliens already in the United States a chance to become legal residents. But it was also meant to choke off further illegal immigration by making it more difficult for illegal aliens to find jobs.
 
Proof From Job Applicants
The law requires employers to demand proof from job applicants of their right to work in the United States, through documents like passports, driver's licenses, Social Security cards and immigration papers. Employers found not to have required such proof face fines or prison sentences.
Immigration officials say a vast majority of employers are meeting the law's requirements by demanding documentation from prospective employees. In fact, some employers are so fearful of the law's penalties, or so biased, that they refuse to hire any aliens.
A study made public earlier this year by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, found a ''widespread pattern of discrimination'' against people with a ''foreign appearance or accent.''
But other employers who are willing to check into an applicant's documentation have no legal incentive for doing so. The law does not require employers to verify the authenticity of documents, nor does it provide an easy way for them to do so.
 
It's 'a Mushrooming Industry'
With fraudulent documents so readily available, officials say, employers in regions and industries that have long relied on a low-wage illegal work force are still hiring large numbers of illegal aliens, sometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly.
''This loophole in the law has created a mushrooming industry of falsified documents,'' said Jorge Bustamante, president of the College of the Northern Border, in Tijuana, who has done extensive research on illegal immigration.
Counterfeiting is a problem in every city that attracts large numbers of illegal aliens, officials said, but such activity is very brisk in Los Angeles.
 
A Survey of Illegal Aliens
To gauge how widespread is the use of fraudulent documents, the immigration service surveyed 900 aliens who were arrested at work places last year. Of those 900, 233 admitted having counterfeit Social Security cards and 142 admitted having a fake ''green card,'' the common name for a permanent residency document. Officials said the survey probably understated the number of aliens with fake documents.
Prices for such documents vary widely. Most new arrivals can buy a green card and a Social Security card for $20 or more in central Los Angeles, with prices generally higher in other regions, investigators said.
More elaborate documents, like the card used to identify an alien as someone who has completed the first step in the process of becoming a citizen under the 1986 law, can cost at least $500. Fraudulent birth certificates and driver's licenses are also widely available on the street.
''Some employers even refer the undocumented immigrants to where they can get falsfied documents,'' Mr. Bustamante said. ''They are interested in reducing the cost of labor, and they can comply with the law by just seeing a document, any document.''
 
A Glance From the Bosses
After arriving here a year ago from Mexico, Guillermo Jacobo Abunader looked for day work with gardeners, construction companies and other employers who hire men from street corners without asking for documentation. But that type of work, which pays less than a steady job, is not always available. So Mr. Abunader bought a fake Social Security card and green card.
''It's much easier to find work with papers,'' he said. ''The bosses just want you to show them something. They just glance at them and are satisfied.''
The immigration service is developing a pilot program to allow employers to phone in and verify the documents being provided by job applicants. The agency is also considering recalling all old versions of the green card, including the mid-1970's version that counterfeiters have found particularly easy to copy.
For now, immigration officials say they are aggressively pursuing cases involving fraudulent documents. William M. Griffen, the supervisory special agent in charge of the immigration service's anti-fraud efforts in Los Angeles, said the office had obtained 129 felony convictions on document-fraud charges in the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30.
The pace of convictions this year is running slightly ahead of last year's, Mr. Griffen said, with 101 cases successfully prosecuted throught the first nine months of the fiscal year.
 
Search for the Counterfeiter
The agency's ultimate goal is to arrest the counterfeiters who are producing the false documents. But in most cases investigators must work their way back up a chain from the document sellers on the street through a variety of distributors before they can identify the counterfeiter.
In a recent case, immigration investigators bought counterfeit documents from a husband and wife team selling documents from a street corner in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. Investigators followed the husband to the apartment of another couple in south-central Los Angeles, where the falsified documents were prepared by placing the buyer's name and picture on the counterfeit documents.
Investigators raided the apartment and found 4,000 blank counterfeit documents, $12,000 in cash and a stolen gun, said John Torres, a special agent for the immigration service in Los Angeles. From there investigators were able to trace the suppliers of one particular counterfeit identity card and arrest them as well.
Although the case resulted in three guilty pleas and one conviction on felony charges involving the possession of selling of falsified documents, investigators have not yet been able to find their ultimate target, the counterfeiter who made most of the documents being sold by those who were arrested.

HEADLINE: Subic Bay Journal;
Where American Might Is a Bit High and Mighty

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SUBIC BAY NAVAL STATION, the Philippines

 BODY:
Contemplating the grand sweep of Subic Bay, recognized for hundreds of years as one of the best-protected natural harbors in Southeast Asia, it is easy to see why the United States Navy wants to keep its access to the huge naval base here.
Despite recent strains in American-Philippine relations, Filipinos and American officials agree that the two nations are likely to reach a new bases agreement to replace the one that expires in September 1991.
But officials warn that Filipino sensitivity over sovereignty and the perceived weakness of President Corazon C. Aquino could combine with American arrogance and self-righteousness to make a new agreement impossible.
The negotiations themselves, after angry exploratory talks in May, are scheduled to resume in late August. The timing alone worries the American side, since funds for a new agreement should be factored into the fiscal year 1992 budget, which is put together by October 1990. 
 
What's at Stake
At stake is the future of two major bases and four minor installations that are the foundation of the United States' military presence in the region. Subic Bay Naval Station and nearby Clark Air Base are among the largest United States military bases overseas. With superb storage and ship-repair capabilities, an experienced Filipino work force and a large naval air station across the bay at Cubi Point, Subic Naval Station can support combat operations of several carrier battle groups and provide logistics for operations in the Western Pacific and in the Indian Ocean.
Subic also has an 833-foot drydock that can handle all United States Navy ships except battleships, and the only complete repair and reconditioning plant for military jet engines in this part of the world.
United States Navy officers talk about how they could live without this base, but they would prefer to keep it. The cost of replicating the installations elsewhere in the region is estimated from $3 billion to $8 billion.
To American servicemen, talking over cheeseburgers and club sandwiches, military and personal relations have already changed. Because of threats to Americans, airmen do not wear uniforms to and from Clark. Nor do Americans wear uniforms in Manila or traveling there.
''I heard five years ago you could wear your uniform in the streets of Manila and people would pat you on the back and buy you a beer,'' a naval officer said. ''Well, it's not true anymore.''
For Filipinos who want the bases and Americans out, the coup attempt last December, thwarted largely as a result of United States intervention, and the considerable aid the American military gave recent earthquake victims have been reminders of the dangers of precipitate American withdrawal. The bases employ nearly 80,000 Filipinos, provide $1 billion a year to the economy and represent nearly 5 percent of the gross national product.
While Filipinos who oppose the bases were grateful for the rapid, efficient American response to the earthquake, it also reminded them of their own dependency, which is not merely economic.
 
The Transition Period
''Nearly everyone agrees now there should be another bases agreement, and that it's better to get American help in making the bases economically viable once the Americans are gone,'' a Filipino official said. The Americans have said they want a transition of at least 10 years, he said, while many Filipinos have said a 5-year transition is plenty.
The Americans are likely to agree to grant use of all installations to the Philippine military; to ''privatize'' or ''commercialize'' some facilities, like ship repair, for which annual, contractual fees can be paid; to accelerate the handover of surplus weapons and equipment to a needy Philippine military from a shrinking American one; to provide expanded access to United States markets, and to offer more relief on Manila's foreign debt obligations of some $28 billion.
Manila is the second-largest recipient of American sugar quotas, officials point out, and a textile treaty, worth more than $1 billion in sales to the United States, expires at the end of 1991.
''We need an agreement for pragmatic nationalists that is responsive to Filipino sovereignty and that's also a good deal they shouldn't pass up,'' an official said. ''Because emotionally, they don't want to sign one.''
''I think it's doable,'' he said. ''But a lot could still go wrong.'' #3 Americans Slain The May discussions were a good example of the difficulties, all displayed in the glare of a Filipino press that often suspects that the bases issue is the motivation behind every American act. On the eve of the talks, three United States servicemen were killed, one at Subic and two at Clark. The Communist group called the New People's Army took responsibility for the killings at Clark, and Government officials said robbery was the motive in the slaying at Subic.
Once the talks began, Foreign Minister Raul S. Manglapus, who has said Filipinos must ''slay the American father image'' to become a sovereign nation, rebuked Washington for falling $96 million short on aid pledges tied to the bases.
The Americans said Washington's contributions were not a contract or rent for the bases, but a matter of the President's ''best efforts'' to provide aid. Anyway, they said, the pledge was a two-year one, so no shortfall could yet be claimed.
 
'Cash-Register Diplomacy'
The chief United States negotiator, Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense for international security affairs, then said America valued its alliance with Manila, the bases provided mutual benefits and he did not want to engage in ''cash-register diplomacy.''
He has not been forgiven since for that comment, which was considered a grave insult, and two Filipino senators opposed to the bases have suggested banning him from the country. The suggestion is a reminder that under the Philippine Constitution, a new deal on the bases must be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate, where many of the 23 senators oppose it.
Filipino officials say they think another base agreement is possible in the ''context of a new relationship.'' In essence, one said, ''we want America to treat us like equals and eat some humble pie.''

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
Washington Calls on U.N. To Impose Boycott on Iraq

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 3

 BODY:
The United States asked other members of the Security Council today to endorse its proposal for a worldwide economic boycott of Iraq and occupied Kuwait until Baghdad agrees to withdraw its military forces from Kuwait.
The Americans presented a draft Security Council resolution calling on the United Nations to ban all imports from Iraq and Kuwait, and all exports to the countries, except for medicine and supplies of a humanitarian nature.
The American plan, diplomats say, would urge countries not to trade with Iraq and Kuwait, a provision that implies that Turkey should cut the pipeline across its territory through which Iraq exports much of its oil.
The resolution would also ban financial dealings with Iraq or Kuwait but does not specifically tell governments to freeze the countries' overseas assets, although the United States and some other nations have done so. 
Under the United Nations Charter, any such sanctions package approved by the Security Council would be legally binding on all member nations.
 
'Strong Interest'
Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, the United States representative at the United Nations, said today that he had begun consultations on the draft plan with other Security Council members and other countries. ''There is strong interest within the Council for moving toward sanctions if Iraq fails to withdraw,'' he said.
Meanwhile, the White House expressed skepticism today about a report on Baghdad radio saying that Iraq would begin to withdraw its forces on Sunday provided that its security is not threatened and that the Emir of Kuwait not try to return to his throne.
American officials said it was unclear how long the withdrawal would take and described the attempt to ban the Emir's return as unacceptable because the Security Council had said Iraq must unconditionally pull out.
The American move comes after the Security Council voted 14 to 0 on Thursday to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, also on Thursday, demanding the immediate withdrawal of its forces and threatening to impose economic sanctions if Baghdad did not comply. The fifteenth Council member, Yemen, the only Arab member, did not participate.
The representatives of Britain, France and the Soviet Union, three of the five permanent Security Council members with veto power over its decisions, gave cautious support to the American proposals.
 
MORE EUROPEANS ACT
PARIS, Aug. 3 (Special to the New York Times) West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Canada moved today to protect Kuwaiti assets from seizure by Iraq.
In ordering an effective freeze of Kuwaiti holdings, the six European Governments and the Canadians followed the example of the United States, Britain and France, which took similar measures on Thursday.
So far, only the United States and France have frozen Iraqi assets. In contrast, the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and the Kuwait Investment Office are believed to have more than $100 billion invested in Europe, the United States and Japan.
 
Dutch Suspend Credits
The Dutch Government said it had suspended export credits to Iraq and Kuwait. Newspaper editorials criticized Western European Governments for not acting to forestall the invasion.
The Guardian in Britain said the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, was not a man to be swayed by soft words. The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in West Germany said it was easy to proclaim that Mr. Hussein should be taught a lesson. ''But how?'' it asked. ''The industrialized nations need Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil and will buy it at any price.''
In announcing Ottawa's action, the External Affairs Minister, Joe Clark, said Canada would back any program of sanctions proposed by the United Nations Security Council.
Iraq and Kuwait jointly supply 1.4 million of the European Community's 9.1 million barrels per day of oil imports, and 600,000 of the United States's 7.2 million barrels a day of oil imports.
 
TOKYO, Aug. 3 (Special to the New York Times) The Japanese Government said tonight that it was freezing $20 billion to $30 billion in Kuwaiti assets. Iraq provides Japan with 5.6 percent of its imported crude, with Kuwait providing 4.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Deeper Economic Uncertainties Confront U.S. Policy Makers

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
For the economic policy makers in the Bush Administration, Congress and the Federal Reserve, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait creates a new storm in an already unsettled atmosphere.
The economic uncertainty was reflected in the financial markets today. The Dow Jones industrial average closed almost 55 points lower, after having plunged by more than 120 points earlier in the day, and trading in the currency markets was volatile.
The budget negotiators from the White House and Capitol Hill can no longer be confident that the economy can withstand a $50 billion reduction in the Federal deficit, and they may question the wisdom of deep cuts in the military budget and increases in energy taxes. 
 
New Threat of Inflation
The Federal Reserve must now be concerned about a new threat of inflation, although unexpectedly unfavorable domestic economic reports might have led it toward lowering interest rates.
The Government reported last week that the economy for the last year has been running much closer to a recession than most economists had thought, and today it reported the steepest monthly rise in unemployment in more than four years.
Paradoxically, the Government's bailout of the savings and loan industry may become somewhat less costly if higher oil prices push up the value of Texas real estate. But the economic disparities between regions of the country, already a matter of political tension, could be worsened.
''The timing is particularly inopportune,'' said Robert D. Hormats, a former top economist at the State Department and the National Security Council, who is now vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International in New York.
 
'A New Uncertainty'
The situation in the Persian Gulf, he continued, ''has created a new uncertainty in an already uncertain environment, and we just don't know how to weigh all the implications,'' he continued, adding ''Until we know, it's hard to make intelligent policy decisions.''
Economists agree that if the invasion leads to a sustained increase in oil prices, the result would be higher inflation and less growth in the American economy. How much higher the inflation and how much lower the growth rate would depend on the size of the price increase, and that may not be known for weeks.
As a rule of thumb, an increase of $5 to $6 a barrel in the price of crude oil, not an unreasonable estimate, would result in a rise in the price of a gallon of gasoline of 12 to 15 cents at the pump. #1/ Translates Into $1 Billion Each 1-cent increase for gasoline means that consumers will spend about $1 billion less on other goods and services.
About half of that money would be recycled into the American economy in terms of higher profits for the domestic petroleum industry, but the rest would be lost abroad.
Among the results, most economists agree, would be an increase of at least 1 percent in the Consumer Price Index, the most common measure of inflation, and a slowing of the growth rate by half a percentage point or more.
Those shifts would create special problems for the budget negotiators, who are deadlocked after nearly three months of talks. So far, they have agreed only that the Federal deficit should be cut in the next fiscal year by $50 billion to $60 billion.
 
Concerns About Recession
Now, some of the negotiators and their economic advisers are concerned that such a cut might lead the already weak economy into recession, particularly if the Federal Reserve could not ease monetary policy to offset the tighter fiscal policy.
Representative Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, the top Republican on the Budget Committee, said today that many people felt this was ''not a very good time for Congress to be taking bold steps on either taxes or spending.''
The invasion also ''might make members of Congress think twice about how far and how fast the defense budget should be cut,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief staff adviser on economic policy.
 
Gasoline Tax Effort May End
Finally, the likelihood of higher oil prices may have ended whatever chance there was for raising taxes on gasoline, imported oil or energy consumption.
In the main, economists agree with Mr. Hormats that the situation is ''serious but not catastrophic.''
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview that the American economy was much more able today than it was in the 1970's and 1980's to absorb a rise in energy prices.
Charles L. Schultze, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, agreed with that analysis. ''If I lost a night's sleep over the first oil shock,'' he said, ''I'd lose a couple of hours over this one.''

HEADLINE: Lawmaker Says His Racial Insult of Health Secretary Was Mistake

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
The chairman of a health subcommittee told the House today that he should not have called the Secretary of Health and Human Services ''a disgrace to his race'' when he criticized the Secretary's positions on Thursday.
''To the Secretary, I have to say I blew it,'' said the lawmaker, Pete Stark, the California Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.
But Mr. Stark, who is white, repeated his criticism of the Secretary, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, who is black, for supporting Bush Administration policies that Mr. Stark called bankrupt and damaging to minority members. The lawmaker said his reference to race had obscured his central complaint about Dr. Sullivan's positions on abortion, health care and civil rights. 
Republican lawmakers strongly criticized Mr. Stark for his remark, and the White House castigated him for what it called his ''bigoted assault.'' Dr. Sullivan himself demanded an apology, responding to the remark by saying, ''I don't live on Pete Stark's plantation.''
Bob Schmermund, a spokesman for Dr. Sullivan said later today that Mr. Stark's latest comments were not the apology Dr. Sullivan wanted.
''He was right about one thing: he blew it, '' Mr. Schmermund said. ''Other than that, we certainly don't view what he said on the House floor as anything close to an apology.''
Questioned this morning at his daily news conference, the leader of the House Democrats, Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington, disagreed with Mr. Stark's attack, saying, ''I have a high respect for Dr. Sullivan.''
Later, just before Mr. Stark spoke, the House Republican leader, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, led a series of Republican critics who demanded an apology, charging that Mr. Stark had brought ''discredit on this institution.''He called Mr. Stark's attack ''as bizarre as it is deplorable.''
''No matter how heated our debate may be,'' Mr. Michel said on the House floor, ''no one has a right to bring into question a man's race or religion or national origin.''
Mr. Stark stood moments later and said Mr. Michel was ''absolutely right.''
 
Criticism Is Repeated
''To bring race or religion into a policy debate is wrong,'' he said.
But he then repeated his complaint that Dr. Sullivan was going along with Administration policies that Mr. Stark said hurt the poor and minority members. He said the policies were denying them good medical care, job training and extended unemployment benefits, as well as denying poor women abortions.
One black lawmaker, Representative Craig Washington, Democrat of Texas, rose in Mr. Stark's defense. He said he hoped Republicans criticizing Mr. Stark would vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1990, which was passed later in the day.
Mr. Stark first made his remarks in response to questions at a news conference he had called to discuss his sponsorship of an anti-smoking bill. He was unapologetic as he repeated them later at a second news conference, held after Dr. Sullivan demanded an apology.
Mr. Stark's attack apparently stemmed from a speech Dr. Sullivan delivered last month opposing proposals for federally sponsored national health insurance. Mr. Stark is sponsoring a proposal that would levy an added income tax to pay for such coverage.
Mr. Stark said that at the urging of Administration officials before taking his Cabinet position Dr. Sullivan had reversed his position on abortion, now opposing it, and that he had similarly been persuaded to oppose Federal health coverage for the uninsured. The lawmaker named the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, as those influencing Dr. Sullivan.
''He's a disgrace to his race, because he really does not have the courage to turn his back on Sununu'' and the Administration, Mr. Stark said.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday that Mr. Stark's ''bigoted assault on the integrity and ability of Secretary Sullivan is an affront to the Congress and the Democratic Party.''

HEADLINE: CLOSE G.O.P. RACE FOR TENNESSEANS

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Of more than 100,000 votes cast on Thursday, only 158 separated the top two candidates today in a Republican primary race for the right to challenge Senator Al Gore in November's general election.
With 96 percent of Tennessee's 2,415 precincts counted, William Hawkins led Ralph Brown. Mr. Hawkins, an economist, had 50,979 votes; Mr. Brown, a businessman, had 50,821 votes. It will be Monday at the earliest before Tennesseans learn who won the Republican contest. 
Mr. Gore ran unopposed in the Democratic primary and is expected to handle easily whichever Republican he faces in the fall.
Mr. Brown, who was forced to declare bankruptcy a year ago, did not wait up for the results of his campaign, on which he spent less than $100. He turned in about midnight, said his wife of 50 years, Marie.
''He was very excited,'' she told a late-night caller. ''But it got late. You don't know who won, do you?''
 
David vs. Goliath
In the Democratic primary for the governorship, Ned McWherter, the incumbent, received 376,123 votes and will face Dwight Henry, a Republican state lawmaker who suspended his campaign in June and resumed it ls s hahaa a ekekefefe e e e ececonont t e e rueue o oleleslslivivcocoeaeaeses r.r.enen s sd,d,'I'I don't think there's any question about who the David is in David vs. Goliath.''
In another race, the state's only black Congressman crushed two challengers in the second re-election campaign he has conducted under the cloud of a Federal bank-fraud indictment. #78 Percent of the Vote The Congressman, Harold E. Ford, defeated State Representative Pam Gaia and Mark Flanagan, a businessman from Memphis, for the Democratic House nomination. With 116 of 187 precincts counted, Mr. Ford had 78 percent, to 19 percent for Ms. Gaia. Mr. Flanagan had 3 percent.
Mr. Ford's Republican opponent in November will be Aaron C. Davis, a political newcomer.
Mr. Ford was indicted by a Federal grand jury in 1987 on bank and mail fraud charges. Jurors deadlocked in April after an 11-week trial. Prosecutors say a second trial will be held, but no date has been scheduled. Mr. Ford contends that the Justice Department has made a special target of him because he is a prominent black leader.
All nine members of Congress from Tennessee are running for re-election, but only Mr. Ford and Representative Marilyn Lloyd faced primary opponents. Ms. Lloyd defeated David Ray Stacy, a pipe fitter.

HEADLINE: America's English Disease

 BODY:
America has just passed a milestone. Unfortunately it's on the way downhill. Last year, for the first time, the United States invested less in plant and equipment than Japan did, even though Japan's economy is half the size. The disparity suggests how grossly America is neglecting its future. 
Japan spent $549 billion on capital investment, compared with $513 billion by the U.S, according to the Council on Competitiveness in Washington. Though a single year's figures may be of limited significance, they are part of a long-term pattern. Since 1972 Japan has spent an average of 17 percent of its gross domestic product on capital investment, America only 12 percent.
Capital investment is probably the most important factor in determining a nation's future productivity and standard of living. American manufacturing productivity is greater than that of other major industrial countries. But this lead is bound to be lost if others continue to invest more.
A one percentage point lag in productivity per year for one century ''was sufficient to transform the United Kingdom from the world's undisputed industrial leader into the third-rate economy that it is today,'' William Baumol notes in a recent study of productivity. A long period of sustained underinvestment means lower standards of living at home and diminished power to exert influence abroad.
If Japan so chooses, its enormous surpluses could be invested to serve diplomatic as well as economic goals. America has the same option. But to aid the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe on the scale, say, of the Marshall Plan, the U.S. would have to generate sufficient savings, which it seems unwilling to do even though the economy is far larger than it was after World War II.
Americans, like their Government, prefer consumption to saving. Japanese may enjoy consumption just as much, but they get less say in the matter. Tokyo's civil servants maintain a powerful set of incentives to save, from high housing prices to a lack of consumer credit. Tapping this bountiful pool of savings, Japanese companies enjoy a lower cost of capital than their Western competitors. An economy run primarily for the benefit of producers has brought substantial consumer gains, too.
Washington lacks Tokyo's powers to decide what's good for people. But that's no excuse for its long neglect of low saving and investment rates. In Tokyo's diagnosis, America is suffering from a bad case of ''eikoku byo'' - English disease. The current budget negotiations may be the place to try to shift the American economy toward healthier and less profligate habits.

HEADLINE: Workers' Compensation: More to Do

 BODY:
Before 1914, workers in New York State who were disabled on the job faced a stark choice: Sue or starve. Then the Legislature devised a no-fault insurance plan that covered medical costs and two-thirds of lost pay. Albany closed its 1990 session by voting a deserved increase in worker benefits. It now needs to restore the compensation system to financial soundness. 
Under the 1914 law, workers gave up their right to sue employers. In return, workers were assured prompt payment of statutory benefits. Owners, for their part, paid the cost of premiums and lost the right to blame accidents on worker negligence. The state set up its own insurance fund in case private insurers refused to cooperate.
The plan promised fair benefits at minimal cost. Competition among the state insurance fund and private carriers kept premiums low. Accumulated reserves and surpluses earned interest that helped insurers offset increased claims.
In recent years, however, the system eroded. With medical costs rising, ''partial'' disability became a common practice, reducing employee benefits by half, to $150 weekly - often no better than welfare. Then, in the Dole v. Dow case in 1972, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that while employers could not be sued directly by their employees, they could be forced to pay damages in suits against third parties, like manufacturers of machinery involved in an accident. That forces insurers to set aside a large and growing part of their premium income to pay judgments to a small number of claimants, who would collect in any case from the third parties they sue.
Furthermore, urged on by Gov. Mario Cuomo, the Legislature has allowed the state to divert $1 billion in cash from the state insurance fund. The state pays no interest on the ''borrowing,'' forcing employers to pay approximately $90 million more in premiums annually to compensate for the lost interest and dividends. Should the state fund run short of cash to cover claims, it will be required to pay them from tax revenues.
The Legislature deserves praise for reviving the concept of total compensation and for raising benefits to $400 a week. But it has shamefully neglected to stop the drain on insurance resources caused by the Dole-Dow opinion and the state's interest-free borrowing. The Insurance Department has already authorized an increase of 29.4 percent in employer premiums, which now exceed $3 billion annually. Further increases will surely follow, discouraging expansion of employment.
To repair some of the damage - and allay fear that claims will have to be paid from tax receipts -the Legislature would be wise to repeal the Dole v. Dow decision and start paying interest on the money it took from the state fund.

HEADLINE: Farm Policy's Problem Is Subsidies for Few

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Get Fat Farmers Off Welfare'' (editorial, June 19), you characterize the inequity and inefficiency of farm subsidies. ''A Summit Challenge: Farm Subsidies'' (editorial, July 10) puts the issue in its proper trade context, emphasizing the intransigence of the European Community in the Uruguay Round and the need for comparable policy reforms in the United States.
Randolph Nodland of the National Family Farm Coalition writes (letter, July 10) that higher, not lower price supports, plus supply control, would solve our agricultural problems. A. L. McLeod's letter (same date) admonishes the United States for pursuing a Gorbachev-style policy of ''controlled markets'' in agriculture and advocates free markets for American farmers similar to those we are advocating in Eastern Europe. These letters, representing two poles of the debate over agricultural policy, provide much food for thought. 
As self-described liberals, we do not swallow arguments ''whole-hog from the libertarian Cato Institute's materials,'' as Mr. Nodland accuses you of doing. One of us, Willard Cochrane, while serving as economic adviser to Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman in the Kennedy Administration, designed and tried to carry out a supply control policy such as the National Family Farm Coalition advocates. In the end, farmers voted down the supply control approach in a 1963 referendum.
We now believe that high price supports and supply control are an untenable policy for United States agriculture, because of the global trading environment on which American farmers increasingly depend. To jack up domestic prices by artificially shorting the market, the United States would need to impose border controls to prevent cheap grain imports and would forsake its major market position as a net exporter. This would fly in the face of our obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to open world markets.
Mr. Nodland also contends that United States agricultural benefits flow primarily to the small- to-medium-size ''family farmer,'' and that their regressivity is ''the product of statistical manipulation.'' In a recent study, J. D. Shaffer of Michigan State University and G. W. Whittaker of the Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture found that in 1987, 60,000 farmers, representing only the top 3.6 percent of all American producers, received 42 percent of total direct payments, averaging $75,500. The average net worth of these farms was $745,000. The top 18 percent received 90 percent of direct payments. And this represents only direct payments. The study concluded that ''the direct payments significantly underestimate the total income transfers from the Treasury and consumers to farm operators and those who own farm land.'' We also reject the claim that these subsidies do not help cover costs of production for most farmers. The real problem is that the subsidies raise the costs of production because they are capitalized into land values, restricting entry into farming by younger operators. If costs of production are not covered by current prices, plus Government subsidies, it would be impossible, as Mr. Nodland states, for farmers to respond to low prices by expanding output without going out of business.
However, we also view calls for ''free market agriculture'' as naive. Government will continue to intervene in agriculture. The question is, What kind of intervention do we need? Not supply control and higher price and income supports, or free market agriculture.
The task of political leaders, both farm and nonfarm, in the 1990's must be to fashion a policy compromise in which commercial farmers are protected against sharp and unpredictable income declines, consumers are guaranteed a safe and bountiful supply of food, poverty in rural America is dealt with effectively and the environment is protected. And these objectives must be achieved without imposing trade-distorting measures at our borders. This cannot be accomplished by continuing farm policies in which the largest share of farm income subsidies goes to a relative few big successful farmers. This policy can only lead to still fewer, bigger and richer farmers, and rising land values.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Fruit of Appeasement

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein of Iraq has answered with a roar the long, dithering argument over whether it was wiser to indulge him or try to isolate and block him. That is why his blitzkrieg invasion of Kuwait, proving his insatiable ambition, has led so many European commentators to remember Hitler. The same kind of argument went on through the 1930's, until it was too late.
It is frustrating that there seems to be no quick military response available to stop him in his tracks and expel him from Kuwait. But that is the case. The geography is too difficult and he is too well armed. 
And it is disheartening that this first crisis of the new Soviet-American search for cooperation shows the superpowers can't contain their sorcerer's apprentices. They can make peace between themselves, but not around the world. A Soviet commentator now says, ''We created this monster with our arms supplies.''
Indeed, Iraq's army not only dwarfs all the other forces in the region, it is bigger than those of Britain and France combined. It has, thanks mostly to eager Western suppliers, the Arab world's one credible modern weapons industry.
The 53-year-old dictator has been called paranoid, a mad bull who shouldn't be provoked. The State Department believed in soothing. But he is coldly calculating and prepares his moves with care. He gave plenty of warning, with his repeated bellicose, self-righteous tirades and troop movements observed by satellite -and, no doubt, Saudi Awacs reconnaissance planes. No one responded.
Everyone was taken by surprise at the massive, irresistible takeover of Kuwait. That was because of the self-induced conviction that he was bluffing, that he only sought to extract limited, if still unreasonable, demands by intimidating fellow Arabs.
Intimidate he did, clearly demonstrated by the reticence of most Arab regimes to join the world chorus of outrage. Even now, some of them talk of negotiating with concessions. So far, at least, Saudi Arabia shows no sign of daring to cut the pipeline across its territory that carries much of Iraq's oil exports to the Red Sea.
There was collusion with Iran, Iraq's former enemy, before the latest meeting of OPEC to force the Kuwaitis to stop overproduction, which was depressing oil prices. And Iran has shown no interest in worrying Iraq by moving troops to the border since the invasion. Private reports from Teheran say, in fact, that people were dancing in the streets there because oil prices are rising and Kuwait, which gave generous help to Iraq in the war, has been humiliated by its former ally. Despite all the talk about Persian Gulf solidarity and Arab loyalty, relations in the area are always undermined by jealousies and shifting maneuvers. Mr. Hussein understands this well. He plays the game, but trusts only force and fear of his ruthlessness.
So he tested the waters, and had reason to think he had a good bet on getting away with what has aptly been called the greatest bank heist in history - Kuwait's hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign assets and its 200 years of oil reserves.
There should be no misunderstanding of his aim. He has explained it. He desperately needs money to pay his huge debts, to acquire more arms and reconstruct his country. But beyond that he is determined to become the great leader of the Arab nation, and not just another nation but a world power based on guns and oil. His relentless drive for a nuclear weapon is not only to threaten his neighbors and Israel; it is to change the whole balance of power.
The challenge can be ignored at direct peril. It must be acknowledged and faced. The first step is to deprive Mr. Hussein of the fruits of aggression. That means a great coalition of nations, perhaps possible given their first reactions, to cut off all further arms supplies and boycott all Iraqi exports.
The result will be an even sharper rise in oil prices and consequent economic disruption, but it will be cheaper than letting him succeed. It will take time to have effect, and the West must show its commitment by renewing strong oil conservation measures, which it should never have allowed to lapse for many reasons, including the environment.
This is also a way to show other producers the risks of another huge oil crisis and induce them to compensate for Iraqi oil so as to moderate the boycott's effects. Other Arab leaders scarcely have to be told that they are next on Iraq's list, but they have to be convinced that complacency is more dangerous than opposition.
Beyond that, arms control has to get serious. Not only East and West but much of the world militarized to absurd heights during the cold war. The arms race must be stopped in the third world too. The lesson Mr. Hussein has given is global.

HEADLINE: Audubon Site Is Dropped For Building

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Using her powers under an obscure state law, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan yesterday placed such tight restrictions on money to be used to build a biomedical laboratory on the site of the old Audubon Ballroom that New York City officials said the project was effectively doomed.
In bitter negotiations over a project to be built jointly by Columbia University and the city and state, Ms. Messinger insisted on preserving more of the old building, in which Malcolm X was assassinated, than the sponsors wished, and on placing the new structure in a spot that city officials contend would require starting the approval process over.
 
Visceral Issue
Ms. Messinger sought to challenge the plan using a little-known veto power over $8.1 million in funds of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that had been earmarked for the $34 million project on Broadway at West 165th Street. In doing so, she dealt a major political blow to her longtime ally, Mayor David N. Dinkins, who had backed the idea despite strong criticism from many blacks and who often mentioned it as an example of a way to attract new businesses to the city. 
''It's about as close to dead as can be,'' said Mr. Dinkins's Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero. ''I guess maybe there's a faint heartbeat somewhere, but I'm not hearing it very well.''
Ms. Messinger said the project was too speculative and would commit too much public money to generate what the city said would be 300 full-time jobs initially. But the visceral issue in the debate over the project was preserving the ballroom, and her decision capped a twisting tale that began eight years ago when Columbia proposed to develop the site.
As it moved toward a final vote at the Board of Estimate later this month, the plan had recently come to divide the city from preservation groups and civil rights advocates, who wanted to save the distinctive terra cotta facade and the room where the black Muslim leader was shot in 1965.
As a compromise, the Dinkins administration agreed to preserve about 40 percent of the ballroom, and to build the lab around it. But Ms. Messinger and preservationists favored a plan by the Municipal Art Society to keep the whole ballroom and build the new building on a different corner of the block.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero and other officials said yesterday that the change would require resubmitting the project to the city's land-use approval process, which Columbia said it was unwilling to do. Hanging over the debate was the Board of Estimate's impending demise under the new city charter and Columbia's desire to gain approval before the system changes.
 
No Sign of Relenting
While the project technically remains on the Board of Estimate agenda, city officials said they saw no hope that Ms. Messinger's conditions could be met if she stuck by them. Ms. Messinger, smarting from some recent jockeying with the Dinkins administration for respect and influence over planning issues, gave no sign that she would relent.
Columbia issued a statement last night, saying it was ''disappointed that the questions and concerns raised in the public discussion of this significant project could not be resolved to permit the Borough President to approve the project at this time.''
Ms. Messinger's action came under a law that enables borough presidents to reject projects to be included in Port Authority master plans.
Under the city's latest plan, its Public Development Corporation was to contribute $10 million, the Port Authority $8.1 million through the State Urban Development Corporation and Columbia about $4.7 million through a combination of direct spending and borrowing. The parties were arguing over how to pay to preserve 40 percent of the ballroom, at a cost that the city initially estimated at $3 million to $5 million, but finally at almost $9 million.
Preservationists contended that the entire ballroom could have been preserved for about $4 million extra, while city officials argued it could cost more than three times that amount, with neither side agreeing on exactly what would need to be done.
Richard D. Emery, a lawyer for the Sugar Hill Historial Society, which wanted to preserve the whole room, called Ms. Messinger's decision ''a courageous and wise act.''

HEADLINE: Hotel Is Macklowe's Bid for a Shinier Image

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Harry Macklowe has quietly opened his elegant hotel, which towers 38 stories over Times Square. He hopes his stature will soar with it.
In an industry that many New Yorkers love to hate, no major developer's reputation has needed more rehabilitation - a ''gut rehab,'' in real-estate lingo - in recent years than Mr. Macklowe's. And the need goes beyond ego. A tarnished name can have economic consequences when a developer needs government approval for other projects, as Mr. Macklowe has in New York and California, and when he woos prestigious guests as a hotelier.
His hotel and high-technology conference center - a lucrative niche, he hopes, in a potentially glutted market - opened without fanfare in mid-June between a shuttered Blimpie's restaurant and a landmarked theater he owns on West 44th Street in Manhattan. 
Five years before, several buildings on the site were partially bulldozed without proper safety precautions one night to beat a proposed New York City moratorium on the demolition of single-room-occupancy hotels. The moratorium was to take effect the following night.
That Mr. Macklowe has named the new hotel for himself, a name that he says stands for ''a commitment to a very high level of efficiency and service,'' suggests that he feels his reputation has finally been redeemed.
To his critics, though, the name still means something else, which the stylized HM logo atop the Hotel Macklowe affirms.
Since 1985, Mr. Macklowe has lowered his profile somewhat and has invested further in good works (he had been regarded as an art patron before).
If his rehabilitation has not been complete, he has, at least, regained the full $2.7 million, plus $500,000 interest, that he paid the city as a buyout for a single-room-occupancy hotels that had been destroyed at the West 44th Street site. He received the refund earlier this year after the buyout law was undeclared unconstitutional.
''It's very unfortunate that we had a poor public image,'' the 52-year-old builder said, speaking in the past tense, over breakfast the other day at the Hotel Macklowe. He was displeased by still more questions about his past, which he either sought to deflect or answered warily, and preferred instead to discuss the hotel's future and how it might reflect upon his own. ''There's no question his reputation is being enhanced,'' said his lawyer, James Gill.
In May, Mr. Macklowe was honored, along with Mayor David N. Dinkins, by We Can, a deposit container collection center that caters to homeless people, many of them former residents of single-room-occupancy hotels. He helped renovate We Can's building on West 52d Street at a savings to the nonprofit organization of about $150,000.
''Redemption is for everyone,'' said Guy Polhemus, the organization's executive director.
Another new friend is former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who not only pilloried Mr. Macklowe after the demolition but returned his $10,000 campaign contribution and sued him. Mr. Koch has become more sympathetic since he joined Mr. Gill's law firm and has got to know Mr. Macklowe better.
''So why is he a monster?,'' Mr. Koch said. ''Did he illegally demolish those buildings? A grand jury found that he did not. He thinks of himself as a good guy.''
 
Continues to Haunt Him
The Macklowe firm and one of its vice presidents were indicted, but Mr. Macklowe himself was never charged in the illegal demolition - he testified without immunity from prosecution before a Manhattan grand jury.
But the incident was magnified by its location, just off Times Square, by the potential dangers that the demolition posed to neighbors and to passers-by, and by the timing - at night, just before the moratorium deadline, and as the city government, reversing policies that had contributed to homelessness, was seeking to preserve the remaining hotels whose residents, many of them poor, occupy single rooms.
The controversy helped galvanize anti-development forces and has haunted Mr. Macklowe, who was already an anathema in some quarters, in every venture since. He complains that it has made him an easy target for politicians in a city where tenants heavily outnumber developers and has subjected his subsequent projects -the latest, a proposed office tower on West 34th Street that would replace another single-room-occupancy hotel -to a higher standard of scrutiny and even to retribution.
Yet Mr. Macklowe has consistently provided his critics with ample ammunition of varying calibers, ranging from the West 44th Street controversy down to the marketing of his 65-story Metropolitan Tower on West 57th Street as a 78-story residence (the base of office floors with higher ceilings largely accounted for the difference, one of his lawyers said).
 
'Cynical' and 'Effective'
''My Catholic upbringing would say anybody is worthy of redemption,'' said Robert F. Wagner Jr., who was chairman of the City Planning Commission under Mr. Koch, ''but among developers he has displayed a pattern of extraordinarily cynical and ultimately very effective tactics.''
The green-glass Hotel Macklowe, between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, rises from a limestone and marble facade punctuated by an Art Deco New York panorama etched in glass over the front door. It contains 100,000 square feet of meeting rooms on the lower eight floors and hotel rooms above. Mr. Macklowe is renovating the adjoining Hudson Theater - briefly referred to as the Macklowe Theater until the controversy over the demolition - which will be rented to corporate conferees and for other events. The world chess championship is scheduled there in October.
Hotel-industry analysts say it is too soon to tell whether, by catering to corporate conferences, Mr. Macklowe has carved out a profitable niche in an otherwise depressed market. (Executives of Aramis International, Citibank and Tiffany's were among those meeting there last week.) Two other hotels have recently opened in the Times Square area - the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza with 770 rooms and the Rihga Royal with 500 suites. An Embassy Suites hotel, with 461 suites, is to open next month, and the Ramada Renaissance, with 310 rooms, in 1991. #52 Percent Occupancy The Crowne Plaza is said to have reported an 82 percent occupancy rate in June. On an industrywide basis, the average break-even point is usually in the 70's. Mr. Macklowe said his hotel, where the summer room rate is $175 for a single and $195 for a double, hit 52 percent occupancy one night last month, which he called ''encouraging.''
His several hundred hotel employees are not unionized and Mr. Macklowe apparently likes it that way. His son-in-law, Kent Swig, and other executives of the Macklowe Organization are said to be negotiating a so-called neutrality agreement with the hotel and restaurant employees union under which management is not supposed to impede organizing efforts if the workers decide they want union representation.
Mr. Macklowe proudly shows off the hotel with child-like enthusiasm and an art enthusiast's attention to detail. Dominating the lobby are two specially commissioned oil paintings, ''Day'' and ''Night,'' titles that Mr. Macklowe's critics, and even some of his colleagues, say also seem to be a reflection of a loner who wants to be liked. He says there is no new Harry Macklowe - just a man whose accomplishments are beginning to be appreciated.
''I'm not talking about a fan club,'' he said, ''but the more people see our work and get to meet me, they are pleased with what they see.''
 
'The Process One Goes Through'
Among recent visitors to the hotel was Herbert Sturz, another former City Planning Commission chairman. After he pronounced it ''tasteful and elegant,'' he was asked whether the hotel is better than what was there before.
''I don't think that's the relevant question,'' Mr. Sturz said. ''Rather, it's the process one goes through. It's means and ends. And sometimes means become ends in themselves.''
Developers are routinely accused of cutting corners; Mr. Macklowe has often seemed to do so more clumsily.
In 1985, some of his colleagues were so concerned about how the West 44th Street demolition reflected on their industry that they convened a special panel of the Real Estate Board of New York and invited Mr. Macklowe to explain himself. The results were inconclusive. But a short time later, as evidence that the board members' concern had been well founded, preservationists mounted a vigil at a Fifth Avenue site in fear that its owner, too, would raze the buildings there under cover of darkness. #72d Street Project Later in 1985, the city threatened to withhold a temporary certificate of occupancy from his River Terrace apartment building at 515 East 72d Street because details had been modified without City Planning Commission approval, in violation of a special permit. To satisfy the commission, Mr. Macklowe agreed to renovate the esplanade along the East River from 103d to 125th Streets at a cost of $5 million.
''I wasn't able to do that because of what he had done on 44th Street,'' said Mr. Sturz, who was the planning commision chairman then, ''but because of what he had done on 72d Street.''
In 1986, the city sued Mr. Macklowe, maintaining that his River Tower apartment building at 420 East 54th Street failed to provide inviting public plazas in exchange for permission to build an extra 74,000 square feet. His representatives argued that the plans had been approved by the Buildings Department. The city countered that Mr. Macklowe's architect was responsible for certifying that the plans complied with zoning provisions.
If his reputation had preceded him in some circles, the 44th Street demolition all but made Harry Macklowe a household name.
 
Fine and Buyout
Mr. Macklowe testified that he had ordered the buildings demolished knowing that no permit had been granted but confident that safety precautions had been taken.
The city subsequently pressed the State Legislature, unsuccessfully, for tougher penalties against illegal demolition.
Mr. Macklowe paid a $2.2 million fine to settle the city's civil suit. He also paid the city $2.7 million as a buyout for the 59 rooms of the Lenox Hotel, one of the demolished buildings. Most of the fine went for construction of an 80-apartment residence, run by Franciscan priests, for the former homeless.
Mr. Gill, the lawyer, said Mr. Macklowe had also contributed several thousand dollars a month, voluntarily, for diapers and baby formula for homeless infants. Meanwhile, he challenged the constitutionality of the buyout law.
''Harry felt that landlords, even in the City of New York, have some rights,'' Mr. Gill said.
Under the city's moratorium on demolishing single-room-occupancy hotels, Mr. Macklowe was barred from building his new hotel on the site for four years. But he was able to begin two years early because the City Council eliminated the ban when the moratorium was renewed.
Mr. Macklowe is negotiating for Board of Estimate approval later this month of a proposed office building on 34th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. He has agreed to replace the 37 single-room units in a hotel that now occupies the site, but he is being pressed, by Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, among others, to provide as many as 170 that had been there before.

Oil prices rose again and stocks fell sharply in volatile trading as investors feared that higher energy prices brought on by the turmoil in the Middle East could push an already weak American economy into recession. West Texas Intermediate closed at $24.49 a barrel, up $1.38, after reaching a high of $26.25.

HEADLINE: 10-Day Car Sales Up 8.4%, Paced by Big Jump at G.M.

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Cars of domestically produced cars rose 8.4 percent in late July, helped by sharply higher sales for the General Motors Corporation, the industry leader.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate for the industry in the 10-day period ended July 31 was 7.5 million units, although the rate for all of July was 7.1 million, compared with a 6.9 million rate through the first six months of the year.
Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company, was reluctant to attach much significance to the surge. ''I don't like to put too much weight on any 10-day period,'' he said. ''I'm not sure it means anything.'' Vehicle demand in the United States has been depressed for about a year. 
Mr. Heinbach, noting the increase in energy prices because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, said car sales may be depressed immediately as customers wait to see what happens to gasoline prices. He also predicted that shoppers may begin choosing smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, which would tend to hurt the Big Three.
''Up to now, car buyers' first preference has been comfort and performance,'' he said. ''Now they may begin thinking more about fuel efficiency.''
Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said he doubted that the late-July surge would last. ''G.M.'s sales increase is against a very weak year-ago period,'' he said. ''Sales at Ford and Chrysler are more indicative of the market's direction.''
General Motors said auto sales in the late-July period jumped 14.8 percent, to 112,817 units. Ford Motor reported a 14.4 percent drop in car sales, to 60,515. And the Chrysler Corporation posted an 11.5 percent decline, to 24,288.
Among the Japanese-owned manufacturers, the Honda Motor Company reported that sales of its cars made in this country rose 65 percent, to 23,020. The Toyota Motor Corporation said sales of its American-built cars were up eightfold, to 13,372, compared with the period a year ago. And the Nissan Motor Corporation's domestic car sales were up 7.9 percent, to 4,829.
Sales of domestic light trucks rose 11 percent in late July, to 149,210 units, from 134,444 a year ago. General Motors posted a 17.7 percent gain, to 63,018, Ford reported an 11.7 percent rise, to 51,755, and Nissan, a gain of 21 percent, to 5,600. Chrysler reported a 3.7 percent decline in light truck sales, to 28,837. Ford said sales of its Explorer four-door compact utility vehicle helped it increase its share of the light-truck market.
Karen Longridge, a spokeswoman at General Motors, said the company attributed the sharp increase late in the month to ''customer acceptance of our new products, the Chevrolet Caprice, Buick Park Avenue and Buick Regal sedan.''
 
Sales Down for Month
For the month, combined sales of domestically produced cars and trucks were down seven-tenths of 1 percent, while sales of imported cars and trucks dropped 8.9 percent. On a combined basis, car and truck sales fell 2.6 percent, to 1,224,132, in July, from 1,257,049 last year.
General Motors, which continues to gain market share, posted an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in domestic car sales for the month, to 279,055 units, compared with the period a year ago; Ford, which has been losing market share, lost 14.7 percent in domestic sales, to 159,184, and Chrysler, also losing market share, declined 15.7 percent, to 60,948. A Ford spokesman said the company expected to regain car-market share for the rest of the year because of the increasing availability of its new line of Ford Escort/Mercury Tracer subcompacts.
As a group, the Big Three domestic manufacturers captured 69.9 percent of all light vehicle sales in July, compared with 70.9 percent a year ago.

HEADLINE: A Long, Hot Summer in the Skies

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
It's summertime and the airlines are sweating. The normally prosperous travel season is proving a disappointment for the industry, and as a result the airlines are offering discount fares, although with many restrictions, that are unusual at this time of year.
Industry analysts attribute the summer slump to the fact that the airlines' fleets, bolstered by hundreds of new planes ordered years ago, are expanding faster than the number of passengers, which has been held down by the softening economy.
Available seats increased 6 percent in the first half of the year from the year-earlier period, while the number of miles flown by paying passengers increased only 4 percent. Not surprisingly, the industry's load factor - the average percentage of seats filled -dropped 1.6 percentage points on domestic flights during the first six months, to 60 percent from 61.6 percent. 
It does not help that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait is raising oil prices -a jump that means higher jet-fuel costs.
While no analysts are predicting an industry free fall - and in fact the sluggish domestic market has been partly offset by strong international traffic - many said the industry's expansion plans might have been too ambitious.
''The airlines are supposed to make up for the January doldrums during the summer, and it's not happening,'' said Paul Turk, an analyst for Avmark, a consulting firm based in Arlington, Va.
''We're seeing discounting this summer the likes of which we've never seen before,'' said Kevin Murphy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. ''I see a consumer that is reluctant to spend and an industry that is forced to give fare promotions.''
For instance, Continental Airlines is trying to fill some of its seats with the airborne equivalent of a one-day sale. Those making last-minute plans who are willing to travel on a weekend before Aug. 13 can fly on Continental from New York to Bermuda for $99 each way and from Houston to Acapulco for $69 each way.
 
Many Restrictions, Few Seats
Most airlines are offering one-way fares from New York to Los Angeles for $138. But the restrictions are many and the seats are sometimes few. ''They're in the newspapers, but they may not be in the computers,'' one corporate travel manager said of the lowest fares. Analysts said that only if the slump continues into the fall will airlines offer more widespread discounts, possibly slashing business fares as well.
The summer's discount tickets are not refundable and must be purchased when reservations are made. And the industry's discount fares have been aimed at the leisure traveler; the business traveler is probably paying as much as ever. ''There have been some very deep discounts in the past few weeks, but they are sporadic and only in certain markets,'' said Gail Ruderman, president of Ruderman Travel, a chain of travel agencies based in Trenton.
The slump in air traffic shows up in lower second-quarter earnings reported in the last two weeks, which reflect the beginning of the summer travel season. Analysts also attributed the poor showing to higher maintenance costs, mainly attributable to the need to make hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of modifications to aging fleets. Fuel costs, which account for about 15 percent of an airline's expenses, rose sharply last winter and are expected to rise further since the invasion of Kuwait on Thursday. Indeed, Northwest announced yesterday that it would add an $8 surcharge on all domestic flights because of higher fuel costs.
American Airlines' profits dropped 27 percent, to $129 million. Two of the hardest-hit carriers were Delta Air Lines, whose profits dropped 61 percent, to $74 million, and USAir Group, which reported a loss of $75 million.
Delta's poor earnings are partly a result of competition from Eastern Airlines, which has been promoting what one analyst called desperation fares in an attempt to win back travelers lost in the 17 months since a strike led the airline to file for bankruptcy court protection. For instance, Eastern is offering one-way fares from New York to 30 destinations, including Florida, for as low as $69. So far, other carriers have been slow to match these fares.
In fact, only Northwest, United and America West Airlines have avoided the hard times that come when capacity outpaces demand. These airlines are benefiting from their Pacific routes, where traffic is surging. And Northwest and United have fewer costly new airplanes entering service.
The second-quarter net income of UAL Inc., the parent of United, rose 5.1 percent, to $148.2 million. America West's income more than doubled, to $6.14 million.
A major reason for the poor second-quarter earnings, analysts said, is the softening economy. The industry is one of the most vulnerable in an economic downturn. ''One of the first things people do is cut back on vacations,'' said Thomas Longman, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company.
Yet airline executives ordered hundreds of planes years ago based on optimistic economic forecasts. These extra planes are just now entering service. The airlines will take delivery of about 260 planes this year, 25 percent more than last year. 2 New Planes Each Month American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, is adding nearly two new planes to its fleet each month; the total number of planes it has on order or option is larger than its current fleet. And American, like most of the carriers, has no plans to retire any of its older planes soon.
The one bright spot for the industry is international flights, which have partly offset the sluggish domestic market. In the first six months of this year, international traffic grew 17 percent from the year-earlier period, and the percentage of seats filled grew 3.5 percent. Most of the large United States airlines are trying to expand their international route systems. American, for instance, recently purchased Eastern's South American routes.

HEADLINE: Price Plunge Continues For Long-Term Bonds

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds continued to crumble and interest rates continued to rise yesterday, as more investors feared that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait would fuel a resurgence of inflation that would undermine the value of fixed-income debt issues.
A report from Moscow early in the afternoon, indicating that Iraq would withdraw its forces from Kuwait over the weekend, tended to arrest the decline. But the report - later confirmed by Iraq but discounted by the White House because it was conditional - did not cause bond prices to rebound nearly as much as stock prices did.
The only prices of Treasury securities that rose were those of bills and the two- and three-year notes. The demand for the short-term debt issues was attributed to the parking of funds by investors who had fled the battered stock market this week. 
''Much of the selling that greeted the opening of the New York bond market consisted of sell orders from Japan and Europe,'' said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. ''The foreign sellers were reacting more to the July job data that the Government reported before the markets opened than the Mideast situation.''
Outwardly, the employment data was positive for the bond market, which thrives on any negative economic news. But the Government report of a drop of 219,000 nonfarm jobs last month was accompanied by data showing that hourly wages climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in July after a five-tenths rise in June.
''This raised the prospect that the recession many in the Street believe is coming later this year will be accompanied by a higher rate of inflation,'' Mr. Ricchiuto said. ''This was a double dose of bad news for the bond market, which dreads both the specters of inflation and the higher interest rates it breeds.''
Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation, the domestic arm of the giant Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo, said that ''had it not been for the Iraqi-Kuwait affair, many of us expected that the July employment numbers would prompt the Federal Reserve to start lowering interest rates today. The Mideast situation only delayed the move.'' ''Almost everyone in the Street expected the job data to remove any lingering doubts about the impending recession,'' he added. ''Besides, if the Fed had acted today, it could have helped stimulate interest in the record Treasury refunding auctions scheduled for next week.'' Senate Action Expected With the House approving a short-term rise in the debt ceiling and the Senate expected to follow suit over the weekend, the Treasury is expected to auction $11.5 billion of three-year notes on Tuesday, $10.5 billion of seven-year notes the next day and wrap up the midquarter refunding with a sale of $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday. Japanese insurance companies and other institutional investors have been taking up about a third of the Treasury debt offered in these refundings.
Late in the session, the Treasury's bellwether long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in 2020, were being offered at 102 4/32, down 1 2/32 on the day. A point is equivalent to $10 for each $1,000 of face value. The fall sent the long bond's yield climbing to 8.55 percent, from 8.45 percent the day before and 8.47 percent a week ago.
The Treasury's long notes are also closely watched because they are compared with Japanese and West German Government issues that serve as their long bonds. The Treasury's long notes, the 8 7/8's of the year 2000, fell 13/32, to 102 27/32, as the yield rose to 8.44 percent, from 8.38 percent the day before and 8.41 perent a week ago.
By comparison, the yield on the 10-year Japanese long bonds rose to 7.70 percent from 7.56 percent a week ago, while the similar West German maturity soared to 8.78 percent from 8.13 percent during the week.
The Treasury maturities involved in the refunding also drew interest. The outstanding seven-year notes lost 6/32, at 100 30/32, for a yield of 8.32 percent. But the current 8 5/8 percent three-year notes rose 3/32, to 101 19/ 32, for a yield of 7.96 percent, and the 8 percent notes of 1992 gained 5/32, at 100 12/32, for a yield of 7.79 percent.
 
Bill Rates Drop
Continued strong demand for Treasury bills caused their discount rates to drop. The rate on the 90-day bills fell 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.33 percent; the six-month bills lost 9 basis points, to 7.22 percent, and the one-year bills plunged 12 basis points, to 7.07 percent.
The only action by the Fed was to add a further $2 billion of reserves to the banking system through customer repurchase agreements. The move was considered technical and not aimed at influencing the key Federal funds rate that banks charge one another for brief loans. The funds rate closed at 7 7/8 percent after trading most of the day at 8 1/16 percent.

HEADLINE: Mideast Anxiety Jolts the Markets

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks took one of their biggest tumbles of the year yesterday amid widespread anxiety and uncertainty about the Middle East, but the close showed a solid recovery from the far lower levels earlier in the day.
After plunging more than 120 points in the biggest selloff since an ominous 190-point drop last October, the bellwether Dow Jones industrial average rapidly recouped half that loss. It closed at 2,809.65, down 54.95 for the day and 88.86 for the week.
On the currency markets, the dollar climbed further in volatile trading, to 149.93 yen, up from 149.25. And gold prices, after rising $3.50 an ounce on Thursday, posted a slight gain, adding 60 cents, to $377.40. [Page 39.] On the New York Stock Exchange, volume soared to 292.4 million shares from an extremely heavy 253.1 million the day before. And with many workers away on vacation, most brokerage firms worked with short staffs. Calls Went Unanswered Traders readily acknowledged that telephones occasionally went unanswered. The National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the over-the-counter market, officially denied that its dealers were not answering phones. 
Statistics on the day's movements, normally available within a short time after the market's close, were still incomplete hours later. Traders said prices became so cheap in the middle of the day that investors rushed back to pick up bargains. I.B.M., for example, had sunk to 103 3/4 before ending the day at 108 1/8, down 1 5/8. More than 3.5 million shares changed hands.
General Electric dropped to 66 3/4 before bouncing back to 69 3/4, down 7/8, on volume of 3.4 million shares.
Many investors took comfort from a prediction late in the day by Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet Foreign Minister, that Iraq would soon withdraw from Kuwait. Iraq later confirmed that it intended to withdraw, but the White House discounted the announcement.
 
Grim Unemployment News
Beyond the fluid situation in the Middle East, new Government data yesterday showed that the unemployment rate had jumped to 5.5 percent last month. It was the highest level in two years and provided new evidence to investors that the economy is steadily weakening.
''We had a double whammy - two negatives in the market at the same time,'' said Kenneth P. Ducey, senior vice president of S. G. Warburg & Company. ''There was a lot of fear and a lot of panic.''
Watching the market from the Midwest, Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist of the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, remarked, ''Portfolio managers are scared of the stock market right now.'' He said they were ''reshuffling their assets,'' converting money into Government securities and cash.
 
'On the Verge' of Recession
He said the new unemployment figures, plus the rise in oil prices, ''reinforced the belief in the financial markets that we're on the verge of a recession.''
Taking no chances in the mounting uncertainty, investors pulled money out of normally recession-proof drug stocks and out of some of the best-known growth stocks, including McDonalds, American Express and Wal-Mart Stores.
McDonalds fell to a new low of 29 1/2, but recovered to 30 1/4, down 1/2. American Express fell as low as 26 1/2, but ended at 27 3/4, down only 1/4. Wal-Mart slid to 28 1/2, but came back to 30 3/8, up 1/2.
''Prices got pretty low,'' Mr. Ducey said, ''and stocks started to look attractive.''
 
Oil Stocks Come Down
Although oil prices seemed to be rising slightly, Wall Street sentiment that the increases should be moderate helped to lower oil stocks from their highs of the day before.
After soaring to a new high of 140 3/8, ARCO sank as low as 132 3/8 before ending the day at 133 5/8, down 1 7/8. Exxon, which traded as high as 55, dropped by the close to 53 1/8, off 1/8, with 3.26 million shares changing hands. Mobil jumped to a new high of 69, but fell back to 66 7/8, down 3/8, by the end of the day, also on volume of 3.26 million shares.
With airlines and other big energy users affected the most, the Dow Jones transportation average slumped 39.23. UAL accounted for most of the drop, falling 7 1/2, to 122 1/2, after hitting a new low of 114. Norfolk Southern slid 2 3/8, to 40; Union Pacific fell 2 5/8, to 75 1/4; Southwest Airlines dipped 1 3/4, to 25 3/4 and Delta Air Lines dropped 1 1/8, to 62 1/2.
Among the health-care stocks, Bristol-Myers Squibb traded between a low of 58 1/4 and a high of 61 3/8 before closing at 60 1/2, down 1 3/4, in heavy trading. Upjohn moved between a low of 37 5/8 and a high of 41 1/2, ending at 40 3/8, down 1 5/8. Becton, Dickinson ranged between 67 and 70 1/2 and closed at 68 5/8, down 68 5/8. Bausch & Lomb sank 5, to 62 3/4; it had traded as high as 67 1/2.
 
New Rule Takes Effect
The Dow fell sharply from the opening bell at 9:30. By 10, the blue-chip barometer had slipped 60 points. By 2 o'clock it had slumped 120 points, or 4.3 percent. Then, within 20 minutes, it had recovered almost 40 points and by well before 3 it had climbed 30 more.
Program traders operated in force much of the day, said Birinyi Associates, which tracks such market activity. By the end of the day, after five selling programs and two buying programs, program trading had clipped 37.99 points from the Dow. Birinyi said that in one 20-minute selling program starting just before 1 P.M., the Dow slid 23 points.
With investors far more nervous than ever, the market indicator might have dropped far more but for a new stock exchange rule that was used yesterday for the first time. It provides that when the Dow falls more than 50 points, program traders are not permitted to sell stock on a downtick - when the last sale is lower than the one before. The rule had previously been voluntary.
And on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a plunge in stock-index futures prices touched off a two-minute trading halt that is one of the ''circuit breakers'' intended to prevent a runaway market collapse.
Technology stocks, which have been losing favor, continued to fall. On the American Stock Exchange, where stocks fell sharply on what was the heaviest trading day of the year, Amdahl, the computer company, fell 1 7/8, to 12 3/8. On the Nasdaq, Apple Computer ranged between 39 3/4 and 43 3/4 before closing at 41 1/4, down 2 1/4. Microsoft, the software producer, traded between 60 3/8 and 65 3/4, ending at 63 1/4, down 2 3/4.

Reports on Iraq and Jobless Lift Dollar in Volatile Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar climbed slightly today against most major currencies in trading that was volatile as dealers divided their attention between the Persian Gulf crisis and evidence that the United States economy might be on the verge of a recession.
Gold prices, meanwhile, after rising $3.50 an ounce in New York on Thursday after news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, posted a minor gain on the Commodity Exchange today. Gold for current delivery settled at $377.40 an ounce, up 60 cents. 
Investors unloaded dollars early in the United States trading day, reacting to the latest economic statistics from Washington. The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate shot up to 5.5 percent in July, from 5.2 percent in June.
Analysts said the report, which furnished one of the first insights into the economy's performance last month, flashed a recession warning. The July jobless rate was the highest since a 5.6 percent reading in August 1988.
 
Oil Jump a Factor
But the turmoil in the Middle East after Iraq's move kept dealers on guard against selling dollars aggressively. The jump in oil prices since the invasion Thursday has been a principal reason for the dollar's advance, which began Thursday against most major currencies. Oil transactions are conducted in dollars.
''There still was a great deal of buying interest,'' said Kevin Lawrie, treasury manager at the Bank of Boston's office in New York. ''No one's comfortable going home short of dollars over the weekend when anything can happen out there.''
Rumors that Iraqi troops had begun an assault on Saudi Arabia gave investors an extra incentive to buy dollars as a safe haven. But when word came later that Iraq planned to withdraw its troops from Kuwait this weekend, assuming the area was not threatened, the dollar buying subsided somewhat.
In New York, the dollar rose to 149.93 Japanese yen, up from 149.25 Thursday. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 149.35 yen, from 148.90 at Thursday's close. And in London, it rose to 149.85 yen. Against the German currency, the dollar rose to 1.5935 marks, up from 1.5910.
The dollar also rose in value against sterling in the United States. One British pound brought $1.85375 late in New York, compared to $1.8545 late Thursday. In London, the pound rose to $1.8570 from $1.8495.
Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's late quotes, included: 1.3505 Swiss francs, down from 1.3530; 5.3415 French francs, up from 5.3320; 1,166.00 Italian lire, up from 1,164.50; and 1.15125 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
Bullion dealers overseas said the markets were hectic with gold seesawing in a broad range. In London, gold rose to a late bid of $379.25, from $378.75 late Thursday. But in Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $378, from $379 Thursday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $375.75, down from $379.39 Thursday. Silver changed little.

Fears on Economy and Oil Churn Commodity Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Recession fears, inflation worries and conflicting reports from the Persian Gulf ricocheted through the commodity markets yesterday, resulting in price moves with little relation to supply and demand factors.
''It seemed like a lot of attention was focused on what the latest rumors were,'' said Tim Evans, a copper trader with Deak International Inc., a New York-based dealer of metals and currencies.
Copper futures fell, and grains, soybeans and livestock were mixed. 
To further complicate markets already roiled by the Iraqi invasion, the Labor Department reported yesterday that nonfarm payroll employment fell by 219,000 in July and unemployment jumped three-tenths of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent. The figures reinforced concern that economic activity was weakening.
The recession fears weighed heavily on the copper market, which is especially sensitive to signs of economic weakness. Copper futures settled 2.4 cents to 3.4 cents lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in August at $1.261 a pound.
Surging prices in oil futures - with the September contract of West Texas Intermediate crude oil settling $1.38 higher, at $24.49 a barrel - contributed to inflation fears, which prompted buying in other markets, including soybeans. On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans were 1 cent lower to 6 1/4 cents higher, with August at $5.86 1/2 a bushel.
But other grains were lower. Wheat futures settled 2 cents to 4 1/2 cents lower, with September at $2.80 1/2 a bushel, and corn was 1 1/4 cents to 3 1/4 cents lower, with September at $2.49 1/2 a bushel.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle were 0.03 cent to 0.53 cent lower, with August at 77.17 cents a pound.and live hogs were 0.65 cent lower to 0.35 cent higher, with August at 57.90 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
The Networks Cover Invasion From Afar

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
How can a television news operation cover a war that is over before it begins and to which cameras are not invited? Well, it rolls out stock newsreel clips, hauls in correspondents and lays on experts. Such were the weapons available to the evening news programs as they addressed the swift Iraqi conquest of Kuwait.
All three major networks devoted their Thursday evening news programs almost entirely to the invasion. By the time they came on, however, some 20 hours after the earliest dispatches, CNN cable had, as so often, pretty well covered the territory. 
First on the job for the networks, on Wednesday, was ABC's ''Nightline,'' which managed within an hour of learning of the attack to switch from its scheduled program on the problems of lesbian motherhood to the problems of Arab brotherhood and to accumulate the appropriate experts. One imagines that specialists like Gary Sick, a former National Security Council staff member, and Judith Kipper of the Brookings Institution began applying makeup as soon as news of the invasion came over the wire and kept it on in prospect of continuing demand.
ABC also made the most effective showing on Thursday evening. The package of reports presented by Peter Jennings on ''World News Tonight'' seemed fuller, better organized, more energetically delivered than those of its rivals. Viewers of ''The CBS Evening News'' may have been a little perplexed at seeing Dan Rather doing his stand-up in London. Had he got on the wrong plane? No, he had been vacationing in France. By last night he was in the Persian Gulf. A few seconds into ''NBC Nightly News,'' Tom Brokaw's telephone line to a reporter in a hotel room in Kuwait was cut off, which made for a somewhat shaky start and called attention to the visual medium's reliance that night on unseen reporters who in fact could not see very much.
The differences among the programs, however, were slight compared with their essential similarities. As far as substance went, they could not have been more alike if they had been controlled from a single newsroom. Whatever channel the viewer chose, he was told of the ambition of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to dominate the Middle East and of his warlike inclinations. Old pictures from the files attested to his army's slaughter of the Kurdish civilians in his own country and his attack on Iran. But the stills of the Kuwaiti invasion showed no fighting, just soldiers; they might have been troops anywhere.
Reports from Washington conveyed words of indignation from members of Congress along with the consensus from the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon that America's ''options,'' the favored word throughout the evening, were few and probably did not include military action - although that was left somewhat fuzzy as the President's statements became less definite. The best the programs could offer as visual accompaniment here were familiar pictures of United States naval vessels steaming along peaceably in the Persian Gulf.
All the networks presented the bad news that oil prices in the West would rise, and possibly shove the United States into a recession. Charts and graphs were called into service. All also addressed Israel's position, which seemed to have been improved by the invasion, at least in the public opinion market. The fight among the Arab nations, it was agreed, would distract attention from the Palestinian troubles and remind Americans that Israel had been trying for weeks to alert Washington to Iraqi intentions and had moved to forestall a perceived danger in 1981 when it bombed what it said was an Iraqi plant capable of producing nuclear weapons.
All these elements deserved notice, but lacking the immediacy and punch of pictures of the action, they could be treated more informatively on Thursday evening's straightforward talking-head programs, ''The MacNeil Lehrer Newshour'' and ''Nightline.'' The network news departments deployed their resources professionally, but found themselves in somewhat the same position as the United States in the face of a conquest accomplished in uncongenial territory: their most powerful weapons could not be brought into play.

Protecting Yourself From Losing a Home

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
In the Northeast, economic problems have led to a rash of residenatial mortgage foreclosures by commercial banks and other lenders. But conditions in New York and Boston are not typical of what is happening in some other parts of the nation, even though real-estate markets in most places continue to weaken and bank failures are at a near record.
When real-estate markets are sluggish, banks are under greater pressure to end mortgage delinquencies. Nevertheless, foreclosure is a drastic step that most lenders are reluctant to take. They see it as an expensive way to obtain only a partial repayment of a home loan. 
Here is a look at how consumers can prevent foreclosure.
 
Number of Foreclosures
 At the end of last year, there were 300,000 residential loans in foreclosure nationwide and 1.7 million delinquent loans. Thomas M. Holloway, a senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, estimated that the number of foreclosures and delinquencies today is not significantly different.
''There has been a big change in the Northeast, which was going like gangbusters in the mid-80's,'' he said, referring to booming home sales.
In Connecticut, filings for bank foreclosures almost tripled over the last two years, while in New Jersey, filings rose almost 50 percent in the first six months of this year.
Nationwide in the first three months of 1990, the percentage of mortgage loans on one- to four-unit residential properties in foreclosure was about three-quarters of 1 percent, according to the association. This figure is down sharply from the high of more than 1 percent in the second quarter of 1987, but still almost three times the level recorded in the third quarter of 1979.
 
Preventing Trouble
Homeowners are forced into foreclosure for a number of reasons, including losing a job, becoming seriously ill or being too much in debt. Most foreclosures follow the breakup of a marriage, said George Sternlieb, professor emeritus of urban and regional planning at Rutgers University.
But missing one or more mortgage payments does not mean foreclosure is inevitable. The key in preventing foreclosure is to contact the lender as soon as difficulties arise. Try to work out an arrangement to postpone or reduce the monthly obligation for a while.
''Banks in most cases will want to work with delinquent borrowers,'' said William Nicholson, the chairman of the American Bankers Association's housing and real-estate finance committee. ''But you have to have the desire and intent to make up the amount due.''
Among the ways to get out of a mortgage repayment morass are to defer or waive late charges, pay the interest only, establish a new amortization schedule calling for lower monthly payments, apply principal prepayments to the current debt and suspend or reduce payments.
Foreclosure is the legal step under which the title to a home is lost by an owner who has not made timely payments of principal and interest on a mortgage. It involves court procedures that can take up to 18 months.
Mortgage payments are usually due on the first of the month, and a homeowner is delinquent if the money is not received by the lender on that day.
But loan agreements usually have a 15-day grace period before a late charge, as much as 4 percent of the payment, is imposed.
Even before the 15th day, the lender may send a letter to the homeowner as a reminder that the payment is late. If the money is not paid immediately, additional letters are written and telephone calls are made, demanding payment.
After the 60th day, a notice is sent stating that a foreclosure action will begin unless payment is received. Once the homeowner is three months delinquent, the process begins.
 
Public Sale Is Scheduled
A lawyer for the bank does a title search and applies for a court order allowing a public sale of the property to be scheduled. At the sale the lender will bid up to the amount of the mortgage and thus end up with either the home or the amount that is owed.
''Up until the time of the sale, the borrower has an opportunity to reinstate the loan,'' said Pazel G. Jackson Jr., a senior vice president of Chemical Bank. ''He can pay back the interest and arrears and keep possession.''
Even when a homeowner cannot make mortgage payments and cannot sell the house for the mortgage amount or more, there are more palatable ways to get out of the loan than defaulting. Some government and nonprofit agencies have programs to inform the public about these alternatives.
 
Helping Yourself
They include allowing a new purchaser to assume the borrower's mortgage, granting a lower interest rate on the loan, holding a pre-foreclosure sale and voluntarily deeding the home back to the lender.
''Lenders will not help borrowers who are not interested in helping themselves,'' said Robert J. Engelstad, a senior vice president of the Federal National Mortgage Association, a private corporation that invests in home mortgages. ''These things can only be done when it makes economic sense for both the lender and the borrower.''

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
Trade Sanctions Against Baghdad Imposed by European Community

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The 12 nations of the European Community imposed an immediate embargo today on oil imports from Iraq and Kuwait and said they would stop selling arms and other military equipment to Baghdad as punishment for having invaded Kuwait.
Acting with unusual swiftness and force, the Western European countries also froze Iraqi assets in their territories, suspended trade and military cooperation agreements and ordered that measures be taken to protect all Kuwaiti assets ''to safeguard the interests of the legitimate Government of Kuwait.''
If Iraq fails to withdraw all its troops immediately, the European Community members warned, they will press for and carry out any ''mandatory and comprehensive sanctions'' ordered by the United Nations Security Council.
That seemed to imply that they would be willing to go so far as to send naval forces to the Persian Gulf if the United Nations imposed a blockade against Iraq. But community officials said military options were not discussed at a meeting here of senior political officers, which lasted more than three hours. 
One likely effect of the European action is to increase pressure on Turkey, which has been seeking membership in the community, to take anti-Iraqi measures.
A vital Iraqi oil pipeline runs across southern Turkey to Mediterranean ports, carrying 1.5 million barrels a day from Iraq's Kirkuk oilfields, equivalent to more than half of the country's total exports.
But officials in Ankara, the Turkish capital, said there were no plans to close the pipeline. That is likely to further discourage Saudi Arabia, which prefers not to act unilaterally, from closing its pipeline from Iraq.
The European Community's embargo ''is certainly the strongest signal to Iraq from anywhere in the world except the United States,'' said a Foreign Ministry official from Italy, which holds the community's six-month rotating presidency.
But the official cautioned that the real impact on Iraq depended ''very much on who else will follow us - the Japanese, for instance.'' He and others said that one aim was to goad the United Nations and other organizations, especially the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, into strong action of their own.
A ministry spokesman, Giovanni Castellaneta, said, ''As long as there is a single Iraqi soldier in Kuwait, as long as there is no legitimate and sovereign government, we will not be satisfied.''
President Bush, who has suggested that closing the Turkish pipeline is an option, called the Turkish President, Turgut Ozal, on Friday. But United States officials reached by telephone in Ankara said that there was no specific request for a cutoff.
 
Turkish Relations With NATO
Turkish Foreign Ministry officials have advised Mr. Ozal to move cautiously, but some of his advisers reportedly believe that the Middle Eastern situation offers an opportunity for him to prove that Turkey remains strategically important to its NATO allies.
That importance - and with it the prospects for Turkey's stalled application for membership in the European Community - is widely seen as having declined as NATO's military role changes in the new Europe. Even so, many Turks argue that a desire to be part of the West should not prompt any rash moves.
''Turkey cannot be the gendarme of the Middle East and does not have to move before its Western allies do,'' Cumhuriyet, a liberal newspaper, said in a commentary.
The European Community action today was a response to United States calls for stern worldwide sanctions against Iraq. Officials here said the proposal for a total oil embargo was made by President Francois Mitterrand of France in a telephone call to Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti of Italy, who serves as community president until the end of the year.
In a statement on behalf of the others, the Italian Foreign Ministry said that the 12 members ''reiterate their unreserved condemnation of the brutal Iraqi invasion of Kuwait'' and demand ''the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces.''
''They consider groundless and unacceptable the reasons provided by the Iraqi Government to justify the military aggression against Kuwait,'' the statement said, ''and they will refrain from any act which may be considered as implicit recognition of authorities imposed in Kuwait by the invaders.''
 
Big Buyers of Iraq's Oil
Statistics provided by European Community headquarters in Brussels indicate that Iraq and Kuwait supplied 10.9 percent of the members' combined oil imports last year. Europe, including countries that are not part of the economic alliance, absorbs roughly one-third of Iraq's exported oil, virtually the only thing it has to sell abroad.
So the assumption among those who gathered in Rome today was that their embargo constitutes an important economic weapon. Because some European Community nations have been important arms suppliers for Iraq, the ban on future sales could also be significant if it is sustained for a long time.
The measures do not come without pain, especially for some European countries. Denmark, for instance, was said to have received 54 percent of its imported oil last year from Iraq and Kuwait, far more than the average, so it presumably will have to scramble to find alternatives.
Freezing Iraqi assets and eliminating Baghdad's trade preferences were seen as relatively minor steps. But the decision to move collectively to protect Kuwait's sizable financial stake in Europe could deprive any Iraqi-backed government in Kuwait of assets worth billions of dollars.
 
JAPAN WARY ON SANCTIONS
TOKYO, Aug. 4 (Reuters) - Japan's extensive trade with Iraq is making Tokyo cautious about approving sanctions against Baghdad, a Foreign Ministry official said today.
Japanese trade houses and engineering companies raced with their South Korean and European counterparts to open or expand business in Iran and Iraq after the war between the two Gulf countries ended in 1988.
The Foreign Ministry official, Yukio Okamoto, said Japan was the largest creditor of Iraq, whose debts are estimated by trade experts at around $70 billion, and second only to the United States as a buyer of Iraqi oil.
On Friday, 49 United States senators urged Japan to join the United States and other Western nations in economic sanctions, and President Bush called Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu today to make a similar appeal.
Mr. Kaifu told Mr. Bush that Japan would comply with sanctions declared by the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Okamoto said.

HEADLINE: Colombia's Advances in the Drug War Are Costly

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Almost a year into a violent drug war, Colombia claims that it has cut cocaine production, undermined powerful drug organizations and hounded top drug traffickers.
But it has also had to pay a heavy price in deaths, injuries and damage to Colombian cities and the economy.
As President Cesar Gaviria prepares to take office on Tuesday, Colombians are reviewing the successes and failures of a no-holds-barred struggle with drug traffickers which began after the assassination of the leading presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan, on Aug. 18. The crackdown brought about a campaign of bombings and assassinations by the drug dealers which killed hundreds of people and left many Colombians wondering if the anti-drug fight was worth the price. 
On Friday, Colombia's drug traffickers, who supply about 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States, declared a unilateral truce in the drug war.
The truce has opened the question of whether the drug war will continue with the same intensity under Mr. Gaviria as it did under the departing President, Virgilio Barco Vargas.
Mr. Gaviria, a 43-year-old economist and like Mr. Barco a member of the Liberal Party, has received death threats from the drug cartels.
Colombian officials say the war against the powerful cocaine cartels is a long hard fight but they are gradually winning. Security forces have seized record amounts of cocaine, confiscated farms and properties from suspected drug traffickers, arrested scores of suspects and broken up dozens of cocaine laboratories.
Seventeen suspected drug traffickers have been extradited for trials in the United States.
The Government's biggest success was the killing by the authorities last December of the No. 3 leader of the Medellin cartel, Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. But the police have failed to catch other top leaders of the Medellin cartel, Pablo Escobar and members of the Ochoa family, who are all on the run.
Mr. Barco said the crackdown had smashed the myth of the drug cartels' power. ''It's the beginning of the end for those who have sown so much grief among Colombians,'' he said last month.
Colombian and United States officials say the crackdown has cut Colombian cocaine production by 20 to 25 percent. Colombian security forces have seized 38 tons of pure cocaine so far this year, far more than the 26 tons found in all of 1989.
''For the first time ever, the Government is winning the war. The Medellin cartel is in disarray,'' said an American official who asked not to be identified.
But the Government has had a difficult job persuading many Colombians that the anti-drug fight is worth it. Many see drug addiction as an American and European problem, not theirs, and question why Colombia should make such a sacrifice.
 
Retaliation for Crackdown
The drug traffickers extracted a heavy toll in retaliation for the crackdown. The victims of the drug war include three presidential candidates, more than 200 policemen, politicians, judges and journalists.
The most brutal attacks were the bombing in November of an airliner, killing all 107 people on board, and bomb blast on Dec. 6 at security police headquarters in Bogota, which killed 67 people and wounded 653.
Officials estimate damage from the attacks at around $1 billion. Colombia's economy has been damaged by loss of foreign investment and a sharp drop in foreign tourists.
One effect of the war has simply been to drive the problem into neighboring countries. Western diplomats say some cocaine production is moving to Brazil, Peru and Bolivia.

HEADLINE: Trinidad Puzzles Over Cause of the Uprising

BYLINE: DAVID E. PITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The chief preoccupations in this English-speaking nation of 1.3 million people are calypso, cricket and soccer. So the attempted coup against the Government, and the violence it spawned before its peaceful denouement on Wednesday, struck many Trinidadians as something alien.
''It's the craziest thing I ever heard of,'' said Kenneth Hamilton, a New York City public-school custodian who emigrated from his homeland 10 years ago and was vacationing with his family near the capital, Port of Spain, when he first heard the news of the coup last Friday. 
''We have lost our innocence,'' said Carson Charles, the Minister of Public Works, who predicted that Trinidad's easygoing ways would surely give way to an era of paranoia and increased police surveillance.
They and others agreed that the affair was far more violent than the upheaval that racked Trinidad and Tobago in the early 1970's after a ''black power'' uprising, inspired in part by the teachings of Malcolm X, helped to prompt an abortive military coup in which 15 people died.
The Government announced that at least 30 people were slain and more than 300 wounded during the siege just ended, most during a three-day looting spree by gangs of young men from the slums and by roving bands of the more well-to-do, who carted away their booty in pickup trucks and family sedans.
The leader of the rebels, Yasin Abu Bakr, a 48-year-old convert to Islam who once served in the country's mounted police, may have thought that he could repeat the example of Grenada in 1979, when a handful of leftists set off a popular uprising that ousted an unpopular Prime Minister.
Mr. Abu Bakr evidently believed ''that the people would rise up and help him,'' a Trinidadian businessman observed bitterly, surveying the devastation left by the looting and burning. ''Instead, the people rose up and helped themselves.''
 
Following of 300
There seemed little doubt that Mr. Abu Bakr's following of perhaps 300 people - most of whom lived on a lavishly appointed 10-acre commune, part of which had been illegally built on Government land - had drawn inspiration from the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East.
But it appears that the affair also grew out of Mr. Abu Bakr's sense of his own importance, combined with his accurate perception that Trinidadians were fed up with Prime Minister Arthur N. K. Robinson, who imposed stern measures after worldwide oil prices began to skid in the early 1980's, crippling Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy.
But clearly none of the discontent was enough to provoke an insurrection.
''As geographically close as we are to Latin America, the culture here looks down on violent, revolutionary politics,'' said Dr. Selwyn Ryan, a Trinidadian political scientist.
''Actually, the resentment over economic and racial inequality was much more widespread in the 70's,'' said a veteran Trinidadian journalist who asked that he not be quoted by name. ''There was a strong feeling that black people in this society were not being given their due, even under a black Government.
''What happened here last week had nothing to do with this.''

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
U.S. Is Seeking to Forestall Any Arab Deal for Kuwait

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Having joined with Moscow and the Western allies in a solid front of opposition to Iraq, Administration officials said today that the United States was now trying to make certain that the Arab states would not undercut efforts to force a total Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
The officials expressed concern that Arab countries might agree to continued Iraqi control over Kuwait in return for a promise that Iraq would not attack other neighbors.
The officials are concerned that the natural instinct of Saudi Arabia and its neighbors to bargain with Iraq could weaken efforts to force a withdrawal through a combination of a worldwide oil boycott against Baghdad and an American military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
 
Bush Meets With Advisers
President Bush met with his top national security advisers at Camp David today, as the Administration continued to consider its options to force the Iraqis from Kuwait and to alleviate the Iraqi threat to Saudi Arabia.
In the first comment from the White House since the reports that Iraqi troops had moved close to the Saudi Arabian border, the Presidential spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, issued a statement at the White House that said, ''We continue to seek the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and restoration of the legitimate Government of Kuwait.'' 
''As we have stated before, all U.S. options are under consideration,'' the statement said.
As senior Bush Administration officials see it, the long-term threat posed by the Iraqi invasion is this: If President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is able to annex Kuwait or install a puppet regime there in place of the Sabah ruling family, it would mean that Iraq would effectively control 20 percent of the world's crude oil, and therefore be in a strong position to manipulate pricing by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for years to come. If Iraq can also intimidate Saudi Arabia into falling under its oil policies, Baghdad would effectively control about 45 percent of the world's crude oil reserves.
 
How Iraq Wins or Loses
''If the Iraqis withdraw and the Sabah family comes back to power then Saddam has lost,'' an Administration policy maker said. ''If the Iraqis withdraw and they are able to install a puppet regime, then Saddam has won. Aggression will have worked and Saudi Arabia will only be quasi-independent.''
The official added, though, that assembling a solid economic and political front to isolate Iraq is one thing, ''maintaining it is another.''
''We can already detect,'' the official explained, ''a strong impulse on the part of many Arabs to think that they can put Saddam back in his cage by tossing him Kuwait as a bone. They look at the Sabah family and say: 'Hey, they have plenty of money in Switzerland. They'll be okay. Why fight over them. Let's cut a deal.' ''
 
Long Term, Short Term
If President Hussein has a puppet regime in Kuwait, the official concluded, ''then he has a sledgehammer over the Saudis and OPEC. The real key now is whether the Saudis can understand their long-term interests rather than only their short-term fears.''
Apparently one reason that the Arab mediation summit meeting scheduled for Jidda, Saudi Arabia, on Sunday was postponed was that President Hussein was not prepared to attend and the Saudis did not want to meet without him for fear that he would perceive this as an anti-Baghdad initiative.
Administration officials were heartened, even pleasantly surprised, by the fact that the 12-nation European Community today froze Iraqi assets, halted all oil imports from Baghdad and banned arms sales to punish Iraq for invading Kuwait.
The Administration felt that at this stage - when military force appears to be an unlikely option - it was essential to establish a united economic boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil to deprive President Hussein of the economic benefits he anticipated from the invasion and, along with the military buildup, to bolster the Arab states in their willingess to stand up to Baghdad.
An official said one of the main reasons Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was so eager to enlist the Soviets in a joint condemnation of Iraq was to send a signal to the Arab states that not only are the superpowers ready to stand together behind them, but also that they cannot use a split between the superpowers as an excuse for waffling on their part.
 
Safety in the Gulf
''We are trying to tell the Arabs that 'we are together, so it is safer for you,' '' an official said. ''If you no longer have half of the international community ready to go along with a Big Lie,'' such as the Iraqi invasion's being based on the grounds that Kuwait was stealing Iraq's oil. Then, he countinued, ''it becomes much more difficult to sustain and those who are wavering will find it harder to justify their inaction.''
Some American officials viewed as an ominous sign the fact that at the Arab League meeting in Cairo on Friday, 6 of the 20 Arab League states voting abstained on the resolution condemning the Iraqi invasion, including Jordan, which most annoyed officials in Washington. The Jordanians explained to American diplomats that they abstained to keep their mediation efforts with Iraq alive, but the explanation was not believed. American officials fear that King Hussein of Jordan has simply thrown in his lot with Saddam Hussein, who is no relation.
As for the Saudis, they voted for the resolution but otherwise have kept silent. They have abstained from inviting American forces to use Saudi territory for maneuvers or from making any statements against President Hussein. As one senior American official explained it, Riyadh is trying to juggle three different impulses: to avoid appearing provocative to Iraq, to give time for Arab mediation to convince the Iraqis to pull back and for self-protection.
 
'Not a Moment Sooner'
''The Saudis are being the Saudis,'' the Administration official said. ''They want us there to save them one second before the Iraqis invade and not a moment sooner. We know that they would like us to go beat up Iraq, then they can come out and condemn us and then go home and thank Allah 80 million times for what we did.''
American officials, who were clearly caught by surprise and unprepared by the Iraqi invasion, are now growing increasingly concerned that the Saudis will come to President Hussein and ask ''What is your price?''
''Imagine,'' one American official said, ''that Saddam comes to them and says 'I would love to get out of Kuwait, but I just can't get out and let the Sabahs come back. How could I explain that at home? I can't be embarrassed like that.' Our answer would be, 'You put yourself in this fix, you figure it out.' But the Gulf Arabs might use that as an opening to say, 'O.K., just get out of Kuwait and promise you won't threaten us. You can leave behind whatever regime you want.' ''
 
New Military Government
Baghdad announced today the formation of a new military government for Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. The new Kuwaiti leadership, announced on Baghdad television, consists of nine men identified as Kuwaiti army officers. Earlier in the day, Iraq said it was building a new Kuwaiti army to back the government it installed.
American officials increasingly feel that only a restoration of the Sabah ruling family, which was always prepared to adopt an independent oil policy, can keep Kuwait's oil production free from the sway of Baghdad.
President Bush today sent the ousted Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jabir al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who has taken sanctuary in northeastern Saudi Arabia, a letter stating Washington's ''strong support for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces and our support for the legitimate leaders of Kuwait,'' Deputy State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher said.

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
U.S. Says Bush Was Surprised by the Iraqi Strike

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Despite Iraq's heavy buildup of forces along the Kuwaiti border in late July, the Bush Administration was surprised by the invasion this week and largely unprepared to respond quickly, Administration officials say.
The failure to anticipate the Iraqi attack has provoked heated debate within the Administration over the quality of intelligence assessments in the days before the invasion, including an unusual public defense of its work by the Central Intelligence Agency.
But while much evidence suggests that the invasion on Wednesday evening caught senior national security officials unaware, it is less clear whether that was because of faulty intelligence or a misreading of the situation by policy makers who saw Iraq's buildup more as a show of force than as final preparations for battle.
Officials may also have been dissuaded from more forceful action by Arab leaders' desires to pursue their own diplomatic efforts.
 
Officials Involved Elsewhere
Word of the invasion, which reached Washington at about 9 P.M. on Wednesday, found key Administration officials involved elsewhere. The National Security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, was at home, having taken an early evening off from his job. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was preparing to accompany President Bush to Aspen, Colo., for a speech. The American Ambassador to Iraq was in London, having been told days before that she could take a holiday. 
A more certain picture of the unfolding Persian Gulf crisis might have enabled the United States officials to seek to discourage the Iraqis, and to prepare a response should they fail. For example, the United States could have dispatched more American warships to the region, issued clear warnings of American economic sanctions and possible military reprisal, and undertaken diplomatic efforts with allies to avert Iraqi action.
In addition, Americans in Kuwait could have been urged to leave, but the State Department said today that it issued no travel advisories on Kuwait until after the invasion.
The United States is not believed to have offered military assistance to Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, and neither country requested it, although Washington has an unstated agreement with its gulf allies to defend them if asked.
 
Kuwaiti Forces Stand Down
Indeed, two officials said, Kuwaiti forces stood down before the Iraqi action, either out of a belief that Iraq would not attack or that resistance was useless, officials said.
Whether such measures could have forestalled the invasion is arguable. Many Middle East experts say little short of a vast show of American force would have stopped the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein.
Details of American assessments of Iraq's pre-invasion intentions are unclear, partly because those reports are classified. The C.I.A., which said Thursday that it had given ''very useful and timely information'' on the crisis, refused Friday to comment on any aspect of its Iraqi intelligence. State Department and National Security Council officials also declined comment.
Still, it is known that intelligence experts told the Administration as long as a week ago that Iraq was likely to invade at least part of Kuwait, and that those forecasts appear to have evoked little response from Government agencies.
 
Pessimistic Reports
As outlined in interviews, intelligence judgments about the Iraqi buildup began cautiously in mid-July and grew increasingly pessimistic with each new day.
Initial reports, based on satellite photographs and information from human observers, documented a march of Iraqi armor and troops toward Kuwait. When the buildup became public two weeks ago, the concentration had reached 30,000 and Iraq was inviting observers to the scene.
The first intelligence analyses, Government officials say, concluded that Iraq was bluffing, to force Kuwait and other members of the OPEC oil cartel to raise prices and reduce surplus oil production. But while public reports stuck with the estimate of 30,000 troops at the border, intelligence reports in succeeding days documented increases to 50,000, 80,000 and, a week ago, some 100,000 soliders.
 
Uncertain Estimates
Two officials who received briefings or read analyses of Iraq's movements said intelligence experts advised last weekend that Iraq's forces were preparing an attack on Kuwait and were likely to invade if their oil-related demands were not met.
The C.I.A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency assessments grew bleaker this week as talks between Iraq and Kuwait faltered and the Iraqis began to move combat support units into the border region, suggesting preparations for military action, officials said.
But their estimates still left uncertain the size and scope of the expected invasion, saying only that Iraq could choose to seize oilfields, occupy a contested island in the Persian Gulf or take over all of Kuwait, as it eventually did.
One official who received a Defense Intelligence Agency briefing the day of the invasion, Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, said on Friday that the agency's experts forecast an attack then. But he said they appeared not to believe that Iraq would occupy all of Kuwait, partly because Mr. Hussein had previously assured the Saudis, Kuwaitis and Americans that no such invasion was contemplated.
 
Iraqi Advance Considered Likely
''I think the intelligence community believed it likely the Iraqis would advance to the oilfields and seize some territories that were previously disputed,'' he said. ''It also appears to me the Administration further interpreted, further reduced,'' the seriousness of that analysis, he added.
On the morning before the attack, intelligence officials told Middle Eastern experts at the National Security Council that an invasion was imminent, according to a former security council official who says he learned later of the warning.
A second official said intelligence warnings issued that day concluded for the first time that the Iraqi invasion was likely to be of such scope that it could extend through Kuwait and into Saudi Arabia.
Some officials who received those briefings said this week that they generally found little to criticize in the intelligence community's performance. One official who was familiar with the intelligence reports said that the agencies had benefited both from excellent technical intelligence, from satellites and electronic eavesdropping, and from what he called ''superior'' reporting from sources inside Iraq.
 
'Flawed' Assessments Described
The same information, however, left other senior officials unimpressed with the seriousness of the developing crisis. Some senior officials and other observers blamed muddled or faulty reports from intelligence agencies, and others complained that midlevel policy makers failed to heed the warnings they were given.
A senior White House official who demanded anonymity complained in an interview on Friday that C.I.A. assessments of Iraqi military aims were ''flawed'' and that the agency concluded that Iraq's saber-rattling was bluster, not genuine.
That was echoed by a ranking Pentagon official, who also refused to be identified, who said the C.I.A. concluded an invasion was imminent only hours before it occurred, far too late for useful military or diplomatic deterrents.
Some officials suggested this week that factors in addition to any lapses by intelligence agencies affected the American response.
They include an ingrained Government favoritism toward the Iraqis that dates from their war with Iran's despised former leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and an unfamiliarity by top officials with the ruthless nature of Mr. Hussein's two-decade dictatorship. The Administration has had little contact with Mr. Hussein or his top officials in recent years.
''This may be an instance where our intelligence community worked and the policy analysis failed,'' Representative Torricelli said.

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION: Man in the News;
Arab of Vast Ambition Saddam Hussein

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
With a single, swift military action, Saddam Hussein has dispelled the image he has assiduously tried to cultivate in the West as a man who can be trusted.
 
Iraq's 53-year-old
President is still the same radical revolutionary he was at age 22, when he attempted his first political assassination, and as unsentimental as he was 10 years ago when he presided over a firing squad as it executed more than 20 officials for disloyalty.
By seizing the desert sheikdom of Kuwait, Mr. Hussein betrayed and terrified his Arab brothers, destroyed the balance of power in the Persian Gulf, plunged the world's oil markets into chaos and challenged the assumption that the end of the cold war would bring peace to the world.
 
Expansionist Aims
Mr. Hussein sees himself destined to dominate the Arab world much as Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt did a generation ago. And as the world's biggest arms buyer, the commander of a battle-hardened army of one million men and the keeper of oil reserves second only to those of Saudi Arabia, Mr. Hussein has the tools to achieve his expansionist goals. 
These goals pervade the dozens of volumes of his writings, speeches and interviews, particularly those published in the years before the decadelong war with Iran sidetracked his political ambitions.
''We don't look on this piece of land here in Iraq as the ultimate limit of our struggle,'' he told a group of visiting Iraqi ambassadors in 1975. ''It is part of a larger area and broader aims: the area of the Arab homeland and the aims of the Arab struggle.''
After a coup attempt against him five years later, he called Iraq's political struggle a ''revolution which aims to destroy the bases of imperialism, to shine over the whole Arab world to make it a new power on the world scene.''
And only a few months before Mr. Hussein invaded Iran in September 1980, Mr. Hussein unveiled an ambitious pan-Arab charter for the decade, rejecting any superpower military presence in the Middle East, North Africa and the Indian Ocean and charting a course of regional nonalignment.
 
Threat to Israel
It was such boldness than prompted Mr. Hussein to invade Iran, a military miscalculation that cost tens of thousands of Iraqi lives and left him with a devastated economy, a dissatisfied population and an overblown military apparatus with nothing to do. Although the war gained no territory for Iraq, it marked the first time in recent times that an Arab country fought a war and did not lose, and Mr. Hussein emerged as a victor.
In the months before the invasion of Kuwait, he had predicted that another Mideast war was inevitable, threatening to ''scorch half of Israel'' with poison gas if it tried to attack Iraqi military installations.
Saddam Hussein was born into a landless peasant family in the village of Tikrit about 100 miles northwest of Baghdad on April 28, 1937. Orphaned as a child, he spent much of his youth quietly on the melon farm of an uncle who was a devout Sunni Muslim. But he became a member of the Arab nationalist Baath Party while still in high school, and at age 22 was one of 10 young party militants assigned to assassinate the dictator Gen. Abdel Karim Kassem.
The assassination plot failed and Mr. Hussein was arrested, but he escaped, fleeing 300 miles across the desert on a donkey to Syria and cutting a bullet out of his thigh with a penknife. Hearing of his adventures, President Nasser summoned the young revolutionary to Cairo, where he studied law and began the underground life of intrigue that would ultimately bring him to power.
 
The Ascent to Power
When the Baath Party seized power in a bloodless coup in 1968, Mr. Hussein became secretary and second-in-command to the new President, Maj. Gen. Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, although it was clear from the beginning that it was Mr. Hussein who wielded power.
Mr. Hussein's accession to the presidency in 1979 was accompanied by a campaign of self-congratulation that outdid even that of his archenemy, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who was then the Iranian leader. On 20-foot high posters throughout the country, he is portayed in various roles - as a desert horseman, as a young graduate in cap and gown, as Commander in Chief in aviator glasses and military beret. Despite his fondness for uniforms and medals, he is not a military man.
Married for more than 25 years to a first cousin, Sagida Khairallah Talfah, a former teacher, he is often shown smiling broadly in photographs with the youngest of his five children in his lap, a cigar in one hand.
That image of the benign ''father-leader,'' as he is known, is promoted on nightly television where the beefy, moustached Mr. Hussein is shown focusing on some of the more mundane pastimes of Iraqi life, from attending a ritual circumcision to swinging a sickle with peasants in a wheat field. Official Iraqi publications often liken him to Hammurabi, the great lawgiver of the ancient world; a poem calls him ''the perfume of Iraq, its dates, its estuary of two rivers, its coast and waters, its sword, its shield, the eagle whose grandeur dales the heavens.''
 
'Abysmal' Rights Record
Mr. Hussein's rule has brought Iraq, once a coup-plagued country, its longest period of stability. More feared than loved, he has secured his power by an organized party structure and an interlocking system of police, internal security and neighborhood organizations unrivaled in the Middle East.
His is a country where the penalty for publicly insulting the President is death, and he has survived a number of assasssination attempts, some of them documented in a book written by his half-brother Barzan. The State Department's human rights report for 1989 decribes his human rights record as ''abysmal.''
Curiously isolated, Mr. Hussein has never cared about such criticism. He was impervious to the international uproar that followed his use of chemical weapons against Iranian troops and against Kurdish civilians in his own country. Surrounded by advisers afraid to give him bad news, he is not a man who likes to change his mind.

HEADLINE: House Grows Edgy as Elections Near

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The House of Representatives is heading into an election season with anxiety growing, as polls show the voters in an angry mood, the savings and loan issue gathers steam and the stalemate over the budget injects a powerful uncertainty into the fall campaign.
Poll takers are reporting an increasing discontent with incumbents, but no one is certain how that attitude will translate at the polls. House incumbents have enormous advantages, particularly in raising money, and voters still tend to view their own representatives more favorably than they view Congress as a whole.
Still, as the House heads home for the monthlong August recess, starting today, many members are edgy. Democrats and Republicans are in a fierce struggle to fix the blame for the savings and loan crisis, which is already roiling House races from Oregon to Georgia. And as the House adjourned without reaching a budget agreement with the White House, it consigned the risky final moves of the budget negotiations, with all their implications for the economy, to the heat of an election season. 
The crisis in the Persian Gulf has added new economic variables to the election-year equation. ''If that leads to gasoline lines in the country, that will create a revolution in each of our districts in terms of citizen attitudes,'' said Representative Jerry Lewis of California, who as chairman of the House Republican Conference is the No. 3 man in the party's leadership in the chamber. ''Suddenly the politics of 1990 become entirely different from what we were thinking about.''
 
'More Turmoil Than Normal'
Representative Vic Fazio, vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus, said: ''I believe there will be more turmoil than normal. I think even where incumbents are re-elected, their margins will be down, and I think that's pretty much true for both parties.''
It is not unusual for House members to be anxious in an election year, and many analysts say the House elections could still end up the sleepy sideshow they were expected to be. But the presence of so many uncertainties - in world events, in the economy and in the public mood - has raised the possibility that these elections could be something more.
History suggests the Republicans may be particularly vulnerable. The last time a President's party gained seats in a midterm election was in 1934, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Many House Republicans still bear scars from the midterm election of 1982, when their party counted itself fortunate to lose only 26 seats during a grueling recession.
Moreover, after listening to the Republicans claim credit for the longest peacetime expansion of the economy, Democrats are certain to hold them responsible for any storm clouds. One of them appeared Friday, when the Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate climbed three-tenths of a point in July, to 5.5 percent, the biggest increase in four years.
 
Economy Could Be a Key
Representative Beryl Anthony Jr., chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, predicts that Democrats will add 2 to 5 seats to their current 257-to-176 margin. ''If the economy continues to soften,'' Mr. Anthony added, ''we have a potential for those numbers to go up.''
Republicans, clearly worried about the turmoil over the budget, are reluctant to offer predictions. ''I think it's very fluid,'' said Representative Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip. ''I think it's somewhere between up 10 and down 10.''
Many House Republicans, accustomed to running as tax-averse guardians of the public treasury, have been pleading with President Bush to take a more confrontational tone with Congressional Democrats in the budget talks. Many fear that Mr. Bush's willingness to discuss new taxes and the details of Republican taxing proposals that have leaked out in recent weeks have left their party badly exposed while extracting little from the Democrats.
''I think there's a real conflict between those urging the President to run a 1990 strategy and those who are urging him to run a 1992 strategy,'' said one House Democratic strategist, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. Mr. Fazio asserted, ''The President wanted the fallout to be this election, not next election.''
 
Feverish Finger Pointing
Already, the savings and loan issue is stoking public anger and discontent, many politicians say. Lawmakers have engaged in intensive efforts to limit the damage, with the House scrambling to pass legislation before adjourning this week to strengthen penalties for savings and loan crimes, including life sentences for major participants in savings and loan crises. The measure passed 424 to 4.
At the same time, both parties are engaged in a feverish round of partisan finger pointing. As Democrats blame the Republican White House for the crisis, Republicans are aiming at Capitol Hill - not only current Democratic members, but also past leaders like Jim Wright, the former House Speaker, and Tony Coelho, the former majority whip. Both resigned last year and both had political vulnerabilities on the savings and loan issue.
Alan Secrest, a Democratic poll taker who handles many House races, describes the savings crisis as a principal engine of the public's discontent. Interviews with voters also show they are frustrated over the budget difficulties and issues like the Congressional pay increase, he said. Both parties pledged not to use the raise as an issue when it was passed last year, but it is simmering at the grass roots, Mr. Secrest and other analysts say.
''The underlying theme is twofold -the perceived absence of common sense in Washington, and secondly, the perceived absence of accountability,'' Mr. Secrest said. ''What we don't know at this point is whether these disparate storm clouds will organize themselves into a political hurricane.''
Representative Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, said, ''If you're a Congressman, and you're in a 55-45 race, this could have a heckuva impact.''
 
Incumbents Still Have Advantage
Incumbents in both parties are hunkering down and counting on the formidable advantages of incumbency to protect them. Re-election rates in the House have been running extraordinarily high in recent years; in 1988, 409 House members sought re-election and 402 prevailed, a re-election rate of more than 98 percent.
''Whatever the public mood is, the way campaign money flows in House races will have a powerful effect on the ability of challengers to be competitive,'' said Fred Wertheimer of Common Cause, a Washington advocacy group that is a leading critic of the current system of financing campaigns. Both houses of Congress have passed measures that would change the system.
Mr. Wertheimer noted that for the 1988 elections, incumbents received $82 million from political action committees, while challengers received $9 million. ''The average challenger does not have the threshold amount of resources necessary to run against an incumbent of either party,'' he said.
Both parties, and presumably many potential challengers, have been viewing the 1990 elections as largely a holding action, with the real struggle coming in 1992, when redistricting and the likelihood of many retirements raise a large possibility for change.
 
Change of Mood Unexpected
Many decisions were made, both by challengers and party strategists, before the current mood and the current possibilities were clear. ''Sort of capriciously, out of the blue, we suddenly have something stirring that means better candidates, better funded, might have had a greater impact,'' Mr. Fazio said.
In the meantime, analysts say, the candidates who are running this year are adjusting. Mr. Gingrich says he would like to see Republicans build on the anti-incumbent mood by running against a Congress he portrays as a creature of 36 years of Democratic machine rule. ''I think you go to the country and say, If you're sick of incumbents, let me show you the guys who have been in charge since I've been 11,'' Mr. Gingrich said.
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic polltaker, says most incumbents are sensitive enough to their districts to recognize the sour mood toward Washington and to respond to it. ''Most members of Congress are doing a lot more this time to separate themselves from the institution and to make sure they are perceived as close to home,'' Mr. Garin said.
''The campaign commercials of 1990,'' he said, ''are much less about seniority and power and clout in Washington and much more about fighting the people's fights back home.''

The 'Seniors' at Summer Session Are of the Gray Variety

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis.

 BODY:
Many students at the University of Wisconsin have been surprised by the age of hundreds of their classmates at this year's summer session. These classmates are retirees, mostly from Florida, whose ages range from the early 60's to the early 80's.
''It was like a casting call for 'Cocoon,' '' said Barbara K. Wilder, a junior nursing major from Three Lakes, Wis., referring to the 1985 movie that depicted Florida retirees who became rejuvenated after swimming along with alien beings.
Harlande Samson, dean of summer sessions and intercollege programs, said about 450 non-Wisconsin residents, many arriving through packaged travel promotions, and about 90 in-staters over the age of 62 were auditing classes this summer. 
Auditors, who are like guest students, do not receive credit from the university for the classes that they attend free of charge. They are not allowed to take the exams given to the undergraduate and graduate students nor to ask or answer questions in the classes.
 
Some Resentment
But some undergraduate students resent the large number of the elderly who are crowding into their classes.
''I appreciate the fact that they want to be there, but sometimes it's disrupting,'' said Beth A. Moede, a senior from West Bend, Wis., who is majoring in history and journalism.
Ms. Moede, who is taking an American history class this summer in which about 30 of the 100 students are over 62, cited incidents when some of them interrupted the lecturer, talked loudly among themselves and sometimes even snored loudly in class.
''Students have to take the exams,'' she said. ''Sometimes the senior citizens take away from what I'm trying to get out of the class.''
Glen J. Gendzel, the visiting lecturer who is teaching Ms. Moede's class, disagreed with her assessment. ''I find they're pretty good,'' he said. ''Mostly they just want to contribute what they remember.''
He added that having people in the class who actually lived through the history that he was teaching could be a ''precious resource.''
Edmund Clingan, teaching a European history course in the summer session, said 53 of 85 students in his class were in their 60's. He said he allowed them in his class because the undergraduate enrollment was lower than he expected. ''There are some distractions, but in general, I found them to be quite well behaved.''
 
A Fee Proposal
Recently, the university's Board of Regents has begun talks about charging tuition to nonresident guest students over the age of 62.
The university now charges about $125 per credit for out-of-state guest students under 62. Under the proposal before the regents, elderly out-of-staters would pay half that amount.
Ruth and Bernard Zeigler of West Palm Beach, Fla., said they would like to return to Madison next summer but would reconsider if the price to attend classes was too high.
Mr. Zeigler, who is 83, and Mrs. Zeigler, 78, are both taking a European history class and an American history class this summer. They pointed to the large contribution that the elderly made to the local economy and said it would be unfair to charge them for classes.
 
Praise for Health Services
Madeline L. Livant, who is in her 70's and is also from West Palm Beach, is taking classes in European history and the opera this summer. She said the excellent health-support services led her to come to Madison for the summer.
''Madison's wonderful,'' Mrs. Livant said. ''But as old as we are, we need that available health possibility.''
The number of out-of-state guest students over the age of 62 has doubled since the summer of 1989, said Mr. Samson of the summer session and intercollege program. He attributed the increase to promotional campaigns by local private dormitory owners. ''They promoted Madison as a great place to spend the summer,'' he said.
William J. Levy, general manager of the Towers, a private dormitory in the campus area, said about 240 elderly people were living at the Towers this summer. He said most of them were from Florida or Arizona, where he travels each winter to promote the Towers and Madison. Eight weeks at the Towers costs $975 a person, which includes room and board, he said.
The Towers started to recruit the elderly nationwide in 1989, Mr. Levy said. The Towers would have had to lay off student employees during the summer without the elderly people staying there, he said.
Madison began offering free classes for guest students over the age of 62 in 1975, Mr. Samson said. He said that when the policy was enacted, very few of the elderly people attending classes were from out of state.
Not all the regular students are critical of the elderly guest students. Jamshid J. Sardar, a sophomore from Flossmoor, Ill., who is majoring in journalism, said he has enjoyed having the elderly in his comparative literature class this summer. ''I think it's good to see they're getting out and furthering their education at this stage of their life,'' he said.

Tuition Increase Inspires Threat From Governor

DATELINE: EAST LANSING, Mich.

 BODY:
Gov.
James Blanchard says he is planning to order tuition refunds to students at Michigan State University unless the university lowers a proposed tuition increase. 
On July 27, Mr. Blanchard eliminated a $7.4 million Research Excellence Fund for the university. He substituted a plan to devote $600,000 to a tuition-assistance fund that would limit the increase for in-state undergraduates to 6.5 percent, rather than the 7.2 percent approved by the university. The remaining $6.8 million would be added to the university's regular allocation from the state.
The increase would cost in-state freshmen and sophomores an additional $217 a year and juniors and seniors $225.
In the academic year starting next month, freshman and sophomores will pay $3,245 a year, including the increase. Juniors and seniors will pay $3,278. If the university does not lower the tuition, each of the 31,642 in-state undergraduates will receive about $20 from the state.
State Budget Director Shelby Solomon said the disbursement of the money had not been worked out.
The president of the university, John DiBiaggio, said he was sorry ''that there has been a reduction in allocations to the Research Excellence Fund, a fund created to spur economic development and jobs creation.''
Mr. Blanchard told all state universities last year that an increase of more than 6.5 percent for the 1990-1991 school year or a combined tuition increase of more than 14 percent for two years would be unacceptable. Michigan State had a total increase of 15.1 percent in the last two years.

Dim Sum: Pay-as-you-Chew Dining

 BODY:
These Chinese restaurants offer dim sum and other dishes for Sunday brunch. The listing was compiled by Bryan Miller from his restaurant visits, his reviews and articles in The Times and entries in his Diner's Journal column. Review and article dates are in parentheses. Prices are current.
 
Mandarin Court
61 Mott Street (Canal Street), (212) 608-3838 - It's fun and adventurous to eat dim sum, and economical as well: you can order as much or as little as you want and pay accordingly. Mandarin Court is one of the hottest dim sum spots in Chinatown. It is clean and contemporary, with pastel walls, sparkling tiles, sleek black tables and an open kitchen up front. On Sunday, the selection on the dim sum cart is fresh and varied. The dumplings are brightly seasoned and light, filled with sweet shrimp, scallops or delicious sweet and sour pork. Other options are turnip cake with Chinese sausage, roasted cubes of eggplant with a sweet hoisin sauce, and fried scallops with a black pepper sauce. 
Mandarin Court's recent additions to the menu emphasize dishes with minimal frying and lighter sauces: a seafood assortment in a pineapple boat, jumbo shrimp with mango, and shrimp and scallops with pine nuts. For dessert there are vanilla tapioca pudding, black sesame roll and coconut Jell-O.
Dim sum is $1.50 an item, and main courses range from $5.95 to $14.95. Sunday hours are 8 A.M. to midnight, and dim sum is served from 8 A.M. to 3 P.M. (Diner's Journal, Feb. 3, 1989).
 
HSF
46 Bowery (Canal Street), (212) 374-1319 - This clattering and colorful restaurant buzzes all day long, from its dim sum breakfast until midnight. The dining room is a gastronomic roller derby, with waiters spinning around the room behind carts overloaded with small portions of dumplings, roast duck, shredded chicken and all manner of shrimp, squid, pork, fish and pastries. The turnover at HSF is fast and furious, so the food is generally hot and fresh when you get it. Dishes on the regular menu include Peking duck, orange beef or chicken, and whole roasted sea bass with a sweet and sour sauce.
Dim sum ranges from $1.60 to $2.75 an item; main courses are from $6.95 to $16.95. Sunday dim sum is from 7:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. (Article, Dec. 23, 1988). A second branch of HSF offers a similar range of food at 578 Second Avenue, between 31st and 32d Streets, (212) 689-6969.
 
King Fung
20 Elizabeth Street (Canal Street), (212) 964-5256 - This restaurant is about as close as you can get in New York to the feeling of a boisterous and colorful establishment in Hong Kong. Large circular tables are occupied by three or four generations. This can be an amusing place if you are in the right mood, and some dishes on the budget-priced menu are first rate.
On Sunday, a dim sum menu is served for breakfast and lunch. The selection includes beef balls with watercress; steamed pork with bacon; fried shrimp, pork and vegetable dumplings, and sweet and sour spareribs. Other items are delicious whole Peking duck with pancakes; baked lobster Chinese style with soy sauce, scallions and black beans, and whole roasted flounder with a ginger-scallion sauce.
Dim sum ranges from $1.60 to $2; main courses are $5 to $13. Sunday hours are 8 A.M. to 11 P.M., and dim sum is served from 8 A.M. to 2 P.M. (Article, Dec. 23, 1988).
 
Oriental Pearl
103-105 Mott Street (Canal Street), (212) 219-8388 - The main dining room at this sprawling 500-seat Chinese party palace is a carnival of ceramic statues, dragons with flashing eyes and colored lights. Oriental Pearl serves superior and wide-ranging dim sum for brunch with fried and steamed dumplings (shrimp, scallop, chicken and ham), shrimp cake with chives, and spareribs with black bean sauce. Other selections on the regular menu include deep-fried shrimp with walnuts; scallops with black pepper sauce and broccoli; braised goose and taro root casserole, and braised duck with mixed vegetables. For dessert, there is the traditional semisweet red-bean soup or fruit.
Dim sum is $1.60 to $2.95 an item; main courses are $6.95 to $14.95. Sunday service from 8 A.M. to 11 P.M.; dim sum from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. (Review, April 28, 1989).
 
Shun Lee
43 West 65th Street, (212) 595-8895 - This is certainly among the more elegant and comfortable uptown Chinese restaurants. Patrons enter through the bar, where playful papier-mache monkeys frolic overhead. The dining room, which resembles an amphitheater, is done in black, creating a dramatic background for the tongue-thrashing, red-eyed dragons overhead. Shun Lee is now serving a dim sum brunch on Sunday featuring steamed dumplings; shrimp (har gau); mixed vegetables with coriander and peanuts called funggar, and honey-roasted pork bun.
Fried items include crispy chicken with lemon sauce and seafood roll with ham. Other dishes are beef chow fon with wide rice noodles ($7.95); family-style bean curd ($7.95); sizzling scallops with an oyster flavored sauce (10.50), and honey Peking ribs ($10.50).
Dim sum is $3.95 an item. Sunday brunch from noon to 2:30 P.M. (Review, May 4, 1990).

HEADLINE: FILM;
East Meets West In a Dying Steel Town

BYLINE: By HARRY KLOMAN; Harry Kloman is a film critic and contributing editor for In Pittsburgh Newsweekly.

 BODY:
On a humid Saturday in July, police stop traffic from passing along a largely abandoned two-block portion of the main street through Braddock, Pa. (population 4,775 and falling), to allow the Japanese film maker Hiroaki Yoshida to continue shooting his first American movie, ''Iron Maze,'' in some of the town's abandoned buildings.
As the sparse afternoon traffic detours along the bumpier side roads, an elderly man, his breath thick with alcohol, approaches the set and asks the production designer, Toby Corbett, for a cigarette. Mr. Corbett has just smoked his last one and recommends the man to a crew member nearby. ''These people live in the past,'' Mr. Corbett later remarks about his encounter with Braddock. ''And there's no future for them and no present. Many of them are hoping there will be a third World War.''
His observation referred to the heyday of Braddock, a once-booming steel town located up the Monongahela River about 10 miles from downtown Pittsburgh. In the 1940's, the city and its surrounding towns lived on the steel industry, and the region especialy profited during World War II, when man and steel together fought the Germans and the Japanese. In the last few decades, the flow of Japanese steel and automobiles to America has turned Braddock and other communities like it in the Pittsburgh area into decaying industrial landscapes. 
''We needed an American steel town where the industry was not healthy anymore and it was affecting the towns around it,'' says the film's producer, Ilona Herzberg, who grew up in East Germany, West Berlin and Toronto. ''There was never really any other city that was being considered.'' She calls the production's maze of economic and political ironies ''a mirror within a mirror within a mirror.''
''Iron Maze'' is based on a story idea by Mr. Yoshida (''Twilight of the Cockroaches,'' 1987), who took his inspiration from ''In a Grove,'' the 1927 Japanese novel by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, which was also the basis for Akira Kurosawa's classic 1951 film, ''Rashomon.'' Mr. Yoshida's latest movie concerns a Japanese investor, Sugita, who buys a dying Pennsylvania steel town and wants to turn its defunct mill into an amusement park. The investor is almost killed by an assailant in the empty mill, and a local man named Barry, who once worked in the mill, confesses to the crime. When the town police chief grows suspicious, an investigation unfolds in which various witnesses to the assault, including Sugita's young American wife (played by Bridget Fonda), tell their versions of what happened.
Japanese investors provided the film's $10 million budget, $7.5 million of which was spent in Pittsburgh. The company filmed nearly eight weeks in the area, and two of those weeks in Braddock, where Ms. Herzberg says the company tried, whenever possible, to buy local products and services. Though Mr. Yoshida had no time to meet Braddock residents, Ms. Herzberg would occasionally talk with people during breaks in filming, and she became familiar to some of them. ''If you had been here 30 years ago, you would have seen one hell of a town,'' said Steve (Straighty) Vasko, a Braddock native, to Ms. Herzberg on the last day of filming. Mr. Vasko happened upon Ms. Herzberg in front of a weedy lot between some abandoned buildings on Braddock Avenue, the main street. The two had met and spoken before, and Ms. Herzberg says the people of Braddock treated the movie's crew like good neighbors. The town's volunteer fire company used its hoses to create a rainstorm for the movie, and as a memento, Ms. Herzberg offered to photograph the firemen in a barroom set constructed in an abandoned Braddock building. She told the men they could ask ''the prettiest girls on the set'' to join them in the photo.
Ms. Herzberg recognizes the dubious honor bestowed upon Pittsburgh by the production's choice of the region as a place to make a film about industrial decline. So, too, does Mr. Yoshida, though both say residents showed them no resentment. The closest they came was in pre-production, when Mr. Yoshida and three other Japanese men toured an operating mill they were considering for use in the movie. The mill workers grew silent when the foreigners passed through because, according to Ms. Herzberg, they thought the visitors wanted to buy the mill.
Mr. Yoshida says he realizes that Americans who see ''Iron Maze'' may have trouble sympathizing with Sugita, but he insists his work has a wider context than mere politics or economics. ''Sugita has a dream,'' Mr. Yoshida says. ''He wants to build an amusement park. He's trying to realize his own dream, his own innocent dream. It's a very traditional American way, having a dream and trying to make it true.
''Before being an American,'' Mr. Yoshida continues, ''Barry is a guy who used to be very proud of his job and his town. Then he lost everything. Sugita is a Japanese guy, but before being a Japanese guy, his father is a successful businessman and millionaire, so he was born rich, and he doesn't know about danger. Before being Japanese or American, they're human. This exists all over the world.''
Though Mr. Yoshida hopes to enlighten people with his movie, he is going about it with a rather unusual philosophy. ''It's very important to make misunderstanding,'' he says, pausing to grin wryly. ''Right now, Japanese people are trying to avoid misunderstanding, but I don't think it works. Misunderstanding is very important to understanding each other. We cannot understand each other without making misunderstanding, without making trouble. So let's make more misunderstanding, so finally we will be able to be friends. It doesn't make sense to try to avoid trouble or conflict or struggle.'' Mr. Yoshida says his film involves many misunderstandings, some between Japanese and Americans and some among the Americans themselves.
One of the film's executive producers, Edward R. Pressman (''Wall Street''), says that having a Japanese director make ''Iron Maze'' may help buffer reactions to the subject matter. ''If a film portraying the influence of Japanese financial power - how it's brought to bear in a foreign arena like Pittsburgh - were described by an American film maker,'' says Mr. Pressman, ''it would perhaps seem like a self-evident, Japan-bashing kind of subject. The very fact that it's being told by a Japanese film maker makes it less confrontational.''
Most of the mill scenes in ''Iron Maze'' were shot in an empty mill in nearby Duquesne. A week before filming ended, Mr. Corbett said he found the decaying mill to be a safer workplace than an abandoned Braddock hotel and its mounds of diseased pigeon droppings on the third floor, which he had to transform into several sets.
A contract with the Regional Industrial Development Corporation, the mill's current owner, banned visitors from the set and required that the production company have the mill inspected by experts. A structural engineer determined that its catwalks could support camera equipment and dozens of crew members, and an environmentalist identified areas with hazardous materials, like asbestos and heavy-metal dust. On the environmentalist's advice, the production company removed the hazards and offered the entire company fitness tests and X-rays and masks to wear. ''It's not worth a movie to jeopardize anyone's health,'' Ms. Herzberg said of the precautions. ''It was a real education in environmental issues.''
Now that filming has ended, the mill's owner will tear down the steel-making buildings at the site and restore numerous others, such as machine shops, in an industrial development project that is designed to salvage 18 of the approximately 50 buildings there. Mr. Yoshida's film, then, will be the last use for much of the century-old mill, which made national news headlines in the mid-1980's when local residents fought to preserve some of its steelmaking operations after United States Steel, its owners at the time, announced the mill's closing.
Yet despite their grim recent histories, both the mill and the town of Braddock evoked brighter feelings for their foreign visitor. ''When I went to the steel mill the first time last year,'' Mr. Yoshida says, ''I felt I was in a church, or in some way I felt I was in an amusement park. I felt a lot of exciting or happy or interesting things in an abandoned steel mill. I don't feel it's a dirty place or a boring place or ugly place.

HEADLINE: Fiat's Thrust Into Eastern Europe

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: TYCHY, Poland

 BODY:
FRANCESCO GALLO, director of international operations for the Fiat Group, had the proud and worried look of an expectant father as he paced through the half-finished $1.3 billion assembly plant that Fiat is helping build here amid southern Poland's fields of hay and corn.
Mr. Gallo hopes that by next spring, assuming that Fiat can overcome such common Eastern European problems as parts shortages and a snail-like work pace, the new plant will begin producing 160,000 sprightly subcompacts a year.
As Fiat's point man for Eastern Europe, Mr. Gallo is in a pivotal position because his company has the most ambitious expansion plans for Eastern Europe of any Western corporation.
In the high-stakes competition to sell cars to the 420 million people in the fragmenting Soviet bloc, Fiat is pushing ahead with local partners on huge projects in Poland, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union that involve more than $8 billion in investment and may produce more than 1.2 million cars a year - more than the Soviet Union's output. Fiat has been busy forming joint ventures, taking equity positions and committing some of its best managers to the effort. 
''Eastern Europe will be the market with the greatest expansion over the next few years,'' said Mr. Gallo, during a pause in one of his whirlwind, once-a-month visits to check on Fiat's progress in Poland. ''We don't have to wait for demand to increase. There is already huge pent-up demand.''
Fiat, which has licensed designs and provided production expertise to Eastern European auto makers for decades, is vastly increasing its role now because it expects the region to develop quickly in the wake of Communism's collapse.
 
 'The Most Aggressive'
''It's clear that Fiat has been the most aggressive,'' said Stephen Reitman, automobile analyst with UBS Phillips & Drew in London. ''Fiat has a lot of products that match the aspirations of these developing markets.''
Mr. Gallo predicts that car sales in Eastern Europe, about 2.4 million units last year, will double within five years. Indeed, some auto executives see the market swelling to 7 million cars a year by the end of the decade, which would represent more than half the annual sales in the United States or Western Europe.
Expanding into Eastern Europe is a central part of Fiat's strategy because Western Europe's auto market promises to grow far more competitive as quotas on Japanese cars are phased out this decade - a development that could hurt Fiat more than other auto makers given Italy's strong quotas. The Turin-based auto maker is riding high nowadays, with a record $2.8 billion in earnings on revenues of $41 billion last year, and this enables it to devote so much money and effort to Eastern Europe. But Mr. Gallo says that Fiat, Italy's largest industrial group, fears losing prestige more than money if its Eastern European efforts fall flat.
Fiat was in a dead heat with Volkswagen last year to be No. 1 in Western European auto sales, but with Fiat leading the pack into the East Volkswagen has strained to keep close behind by moving aggressively in East Germany. With its expansion plans in East Germany and Hungary, the General Motors Corporation also intends to be a strong presence, while Ford, Peugeot, Renault and the Japanese lag far behind.
Here in Tychy - in what is the nearest to completion of Fiat's new Eastern European projects - the company is working with its state-owned Polish partner, Fabryka Samochodow Malolitrazowych (FSM), to produce small, but zippy, cars that will be a modest step upward from the tiny, underpowered models that Poles now drive. Fiat is also negotiating with Fabryka Samochodow Osobowych (FSO), a state-owned car maker based in Warsaw, to jointly produce 120,000 mid-sized cars a year by 1993.
But these projects are modest compared with Fiat's plans in the Soviet Union, where the company has agreed to pump in money, design expertise and production know-how to help produce 900,000 cars a year in Yelabuga, 600 miles southeast of Moscow. That project will create one of the world's largest auto complexes and nearly double Soviet car-making capacity. (See box.) ''These will be the first cars sold in the Soviet Union that carry a Western nameplate,'' said the 56-year-old Mr. Gallo.
The Fiat executive, who spent five years heading the company's American operations, sounds very much like the economics professor he once was in discussing the opportunities and obligations that Westerners face in Eastern Europe.
''We have a very strong interest that Eastern Europeans should progress,'' he said. ''They must solve their problems themselves. But we can contribute. We can help them to reinvent their economies.''
''The first priority is to give people a sense that something is being done,'' he said. ''They cannot increase production overnight. But we can increase the availability of goods through aid.'' In the Communist world, there has been little incentive to work hard, he adds, ''not because there isn't money, but because there is so little to buy with that money. We have to help provide better goods for them to buy.''
 
The Tychy Project
 Mr. Gallo's goals are being realized in Tychy, a community of weather-beaten houses, obsolete factories and patchy farms west of Cracow. FSM, based in nearby Bielsko Biala, is investing $650 million in the new plant, while Fiat is putting up an equal amount to buy machinery. FSM is to repay Fiat with the proceeds from 500,000 of the Polish-made cars, tentatively called Micros, that Fiat expects to sell to the West at the rate of about 70,000 a year. The plan to export Micros is part of a program in which Fiat will take more than 300,000 cars from its Eastern partners to sell to customers in the West. Last year, Fiat sold more than 2.2 million cars worldwide.
''With this new car, we will be expanding our product range in Europe,'' Mr. Gallo said. ''It is not economic to produce 70,000 cars like this in Italy, but it is economic to produce 160,000 in Poland, with us taking 70,000.'' Fiat, which may take an equity stake in FSM as part of the Polish company's future privatization, expects FSM to expand output to 240,000 Micros a year by 1993.
Fiat's cooperation with FSM is a signal example of East-West symbiosis in which Western companies benefit from new markets and low-cost, highly skilled labor, while Eastern European companies, consumers and workers arguably gain even more. For Poland, Fiat's involvement means new technology, more jobs and management expertise in fields like accounting and labor management.
What is more, the partnership will have a trickle-down effect since Fiat and its component suppliers are giving financial help and teaching Western ways to hundreds of FSM's suppliers, like producers of upholstery and ventilation systems.
''I don't like to boast, but you can say that this will be the most modern factory in all of Poland,'' said Jozef Popczyk, director of FSM's Tychy plant. ''Western help is essential for us. Without Western cooperation, we would remain at low technological levels.''
Like most Eastern European auto makers, FSM owes much of its past progress to a Western partner. FSM was a machinery manufacturer until 1971, when it signed an agreement with Fiat to assemble the Fiat 126, a minuscule car with a top speed of 62 miles per hour that Mr. Gallo calls a ''toy.''
After Fiat licensed the car design to FSM and built the Polish company's production line, FSM began making 200,000 126's a year.
The high-ceiling FSM factory, though a decade ahead of some Eastern European plants, remains backward by Western standards. Many basic welding procedures are done by hand, rather than by robot (there are only two in the plant). Instead of being at body level, as in new plants, the assembly line moves overhead, forcing workers to strain to reach up. FSM produces about eight cars per worker per year, one-quarter the ratio at many Western manufacturers. ''This is our plant of the 1960's,'' Mr. Gallo said.
 
Helping Hands
 FSM is not the only auto maker to seek Fiat's help. In 1966, Warsaw-based FSO asked the Italian company to help design and install production equipment. Lada, the Soviet auto maker, and Zastava, the Yugoslav car maker, have turned to Fiat to design and engineer cars and production lines. Zastava is negotiating with Fiat for the Italian company to significantly raise its stake, currently 18.5 percent, in the company that makes the Yugo. Indeed, Fiat boasts that half the cars sold in Eastern Europe are Fiat derivatives.
Other Eastern auto makers have also relied on Western assistance. Dacia, the Romanian auto maker, has worked with Renault. Skoda, Czechoslovakia's state-owned auto maker, asked Bertone, a Turin-based consultant, for assistance in designing and engineering its sporty Favorit. Porsche helped on the power train.
Thanks to Western help, the most advanced East European car makers, considered to be Skoda and Zastava with Lada placing third, are only a half-dozen years behind the West, industry analysts say. But the most backward manufacturers, like Dacia and East Germany's Trabant, are two decades behind in areas like sturdiness, design and pollution control.
''They don't have many of the more interesting gizmos and goodies that the Western companies have: multivalve engines, sophisticated suspensions, optional four-wheel drive,'' said Karl Ludvigsen, president of his own automobile consulting firm in London. ''They need Western help. They have not been active enough over the years in improving the cars to have sufficient indigenous engineering capabilities. They didn't have to worry about updating to keep up with consumer demand.''
Since the Iron Curtain began to crumble last year, Eastern and Western auto makers have engaged in an intricate mating dance.
In East Germany, Volkswagen linked up with Trabant to build 250,000 Polos a year in a $2.9 billion project, while G.M.'s Opel division joined Wartburg, East Germany's other auto maker, to produce 150,000 Kadetts a year.
In Czechoslovakia, virtually everyone is pursuing Skoda, considered by many to be Eastern Europe's top car producer. Industry officials say Volkswagen has the inside track.
In Hungary, Ford plans to invest $80 million in a components plant, while G.M. plans to build 200,000 engines and assemble 30,000 Kadetts a year.
''This is the most exciting market around,'' said Thomas R. Mason, vice president for sales at G.M. Europe. ''It's all business we haven't had before.'' One reason for setting up factories in Eastern Europe, he explained, is that many countries in the region restrict imports from Western manufacturers unless the companies build plants in those countries to generate hard currency.
Fiat has won more than its share of partners, in part because of its long history in the East, which includes selling cars and components to pre-revolutionary Russia in 1912.
No doubt Fiat's biggest challenge now is to insure quality in the Eastern-made cars that it sells to the West. Fiat has strained to improve its reputation for quality over the past decade, and the last thing it wants is to see that slip.
''Are we going to be able to reach the level of quality that will be adequate for the Western market? Our answer is yes,'' Mr. Gallo said. ''This doesn't mean it will be an easy task.''
 
The Search for Dealers
 He knows that under Communism, FSM workers were pressured to meet production quotas, and often let quality slide. He has heard about the Polish book called, ''126 Jokes About the Fiat 126.'' And so Fiat is sending 200 production experts to FSM from Italy to make sure that quality is good and the assembly plant runs smoothly.
Setting up dealerships in Eastern Europe is also a major problem. Instead of using dealers to sell cars, FSM and other Eastern auto makers relied on government offices where consumers trudged in to add their names to multiyear waiting lists.
''It is more bureaucratic distribution than a marketing system,'' Mr. Gallo said.
Fiat has not begun setting up a dealer system in Poland, but it and other auto makers have rushed to establish networks in fast-changing East Germany. G.M., for example, has established 300 dealerships there.
''The largest challenge is finding the individual entrepreneurs,'' said Mr. Mason, the G.M. vice president. ''The auto dealer is probably the epitome of the free-market entrepreneur, but these markets haven't had entrepreneurs for 40 years.''
The litany of problems for auto makers setting up in the East also includes coping with language differences and a painfully outmoded telephone system, locating dependable components suppliers and finding housing and making life comfortable for employees sent from the West.
 
Keeping Above Water
 But for Ryszard Welter, FSM's chairman, Fiat's involvement means salvation, rather than problems. At a time when the Polish Government's crash program to battle hyperinflation has caused purchasing power and industrial production to plummet, Fiat is helping to keep FSM above water. In addition to lending money to build the new plant, Fiat is providing cash to help finance FSM's inventories.
Fiat is also providing so much know-how that Mr. Welter says other Polish executives come around to ask him about Western technology and business techniques. The technology the new Fiat model brings to FSM includes rust-proof steel, catalytic converters, shiny metallic paint, electrostatic painting equipment and 100 robots for precision work and quality control.
''It's very unlikely that we would have the money or technological means to produce a car that's as good,'' Mr. Welter said. FSM's dream, he says, is to develop and market a car by itself, but he admitted this would be difficult ''because we are not well known in the European market and we don't have our own distribution network.''
As for FSM's 26,000 employees, Fiat's involvement is a godsend because it is giving FSM a future when many obsolete Polish factories have none. ''It's a big chance for us,'' said Jerzy Fedorczyk, a quality-control inspector.
 
THE BIG ONE: YELABUGA
 FIAT'S plans to help build 900,000 cars a year in the Soviet Union could become the largest Western project in Eastern Europe. Some industry executives say the manufacturing complex at Yelabuga will cost $7 billion, but Fiat officials say their equity will be just a few hundred million dollars.
Fiat will play many roles. First, in a contract for hard currency, it will provide design and production expertise for a factory that is to produce, by late 1992, 300,000 cars a year modeled on its small Panda.
For a second plant, Fiat is acquiring a 30 percent stake in a joint venture to produce, by late 1993, 300,000 cars a year of a new model the size of Fiat's somewhat bigger Uno. Fiat will export one-third of these to the West.
''To demonstrate that these are quality cars, we will bring some back to sell in Western Europe,'' said Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive.
Then Fiat is negotiating to help with a third factory that aims to assemble 300,000 mid-sized cars a year like the Fiat Tipo by 1995. Fiat will also join a venture to build a highly robotized plant to produce 900,000 engines and gear boxes a year.
Moscow chose Fiat to be its partner partly because it was so pleased with its 1966 contract with the car maker under which Fiat licensed its 124 model and helped design a 650,000-car-a-year plant.
Questions about the Soviet Union's political stability do not frighten Fiat, said Francesco Gallo, Fiat's director of international operations. He says Fiat, which helps assemble cars in dozens of countries, has learned to control risk.
''Outside of Europe you don't find many countries with social and political situations more stable than in Eastern Europe,'' he said. ''You must be satisfied that the risk is controllable.''

How Much Will Hussein Try to Grab?

 BODY:
Is Iraq's Saddam Hussein another Hitler, who will gobble up neighbor after neighbor, until finally stopped?
That view was spreading in America as last week ended, and with it a feeling of powerlessness to affect the outcome. Bombing Iraq would risk destroying the very oil that provides the United States with a national interest in the Persian Gulf. For now, economic warfare seems to be the order of the day. 
On Friday, as rumors spread of further Iraqi millitary action, perhaps against Saudi Arabia, financial markets quaked and fell. They stabilized only after the Soviet Union forecast an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
Oil prices zoomed upward, as traders bet that Mr. Hussein's original goal - $25 oil - would be realized. Only a few weeks ago, September crude oil futures were around $17 per barrel. On Friday, they traded above $26, although the price slipped to $24.49 by the end of the day.
Mr. Hussein seems to have the upper hand on oil supply. With his troops in Kuwait, it is unlikely that other oil exporters will wish to incur his wrath by discounting crude quotes. But demand may be another matter. There are adequate crude inventories now, and with the United States economy limping along, any substantial rise in oil could be enough to bring on a real recession, which in turn could force oil prices lower.
The United States would be in a better position if it used a lot less oil. Energy taxes years ago would have cut the budget deficits and encouraged conservation. But Congress was paralyzed by regional rivalries and the fear of reaction.
The sudden rise in oil prices leaves the Federal Reserve in a quandary, facing the decision whether to ease credit and fight recession or tighten it and fight inflation. Short-term rates fell, which may reflect a flight to safety or a hope the Fed will ease. But long-term rates rose, signaling that traders are not persuaded a recession is inevitable.
The panic hit stock markets around the world, with oil and precious metals stocks up and almost everything else down on heavy volume. But there was some buying late Friday, and share prices recovered about half what they had lost earlier in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week down 88.86 points, or 3.1 percent, to 2,809.65.
Small stocks generally performed even worse, with the Russell 2,000 down 5.1 percent for the week, and briefly trading on Friday at its lowest level in 18 months. The behavior of those stocks, not usually involved in program trading, coupled with the fact that index arbitrage was virtually impossible for most of Friday under a new Big Board rule, should at least keep program traders from getting the rap for the latest fall. Don't bet on it.
So far, it appears that individual investors have refused to join in the selling spree, betting that this sharp fall, like ones before it, is temporary and not a precursor of worse things. Whether or not that position proves to be wise may depend on how effective the world is at halting Mr. Hussein.

The Dollar Spirals Down

 BODY:
THE dollar fell just short of its post-World War II low against the German mark last week. Without Saddam Hussein it might have made it. The Iraqi President's invasion of Kuwait sparked buying of the dollar, a safe haven, on Thursday and there was enough support left on Friday to offset a worrisome economic report. The American unemployment rate jumped to 5.5 percent in July, from 5.2 percent, giving another signal that the sluggish economy may be near a recession. But because of the unrest in the Middle East, traders would not dump dollars in anticipation of lower interest rates. The dollar still closed at 1.5875 against the mark, its second-lowest level since the war. With any relaxation of tensions in the Middle East, the low of 1.5700 should not stand much longer.

The Unsettling Iraq Factor

BYLINE: Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
SADDAM HUSSEIN, the President of Iraq, bet that Kuwait was vulnerable and it was. So were most of the world's markets, which tumbled dramatically after Iraq's invasion of the emirate last week as the outlook clouded for oil prices, inflation, economic growth and the balance of power in the Middle East. .
The markets had been under stress before the invasion. Interest rates around the world are high. Many economies are slowing or are growing more slowly than anticipated. Earnings reports are coming in lower than expected - and the prospect is for less to come. 
The Amercan stock market was weakening and Japan's was already reeling. West Germany's market was worried by higher interest rates and, again, the cost of German unification. Italy has problems with its coalition government. Britain is near a recession.
Hong Kong, which had been reaching new heights regularly, was stunned by the invasion, which sent the Hang Seng index tumbling by 111.69 points or 3.4 percent. Oil-rich Norway, whose all-share index had been propelled to new highs four days last week by rising oil prices and the expectation that they would rise further after the invasion, fell 1.6 percent Friday under the weight of inflationary fears.
''We've been skittish on these markets anyway,'' said Madhav Dhar, global strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York. ''This was not a healthy environment. We expected markets to roll off anyway. And this will aggravate that.''
Cliche though it is, the only certainity now is uncertainity and it alone is enough to roil stock markets. The unknown - what the Iraqi leader might do next - kept traders and analysts close to their computer screens Friday and responding - by buying dollars as a safe haven or dumping stocks because of inflationary and interest rate fears - to bulletins like ''State Department says Iraqi troops within six miles of Saudi border'' or ''Shevardnadze says U.S.S.R. 'has been assured' Iraq to pull out soon.''
But about as fast as the Iraqi forces moved into Kuwait City, economists and analysts around the world were examining the longer-term impact, pushing numbers through their black boxes and churning out estimates of the inflationary, interest rate and economic growth consequences both of the invasion and of higher oil prices. These scenarios, none of them very good, will be digested by investors this week and should add to the downward pressure on markets.
Kieth Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel & Company in London, estimates that with a $25 per barrel price for oil, inflation in the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada could be five-tenths of 1 percentage point higher in the next year. And economic growth could be cut by as much as four-tenths of 1 percentage point from what it might have been. For the United States and Britain, whose economies could be near the brink of a recession already, this not comforting.
Guy Rigdon, director of strategy at UBS Phillips & Drew in London, said he expected interest rates in Europe will be pushed up about half of a percentage point. And in Japan, he said, the oil price rise (he is also assuming $25 a barrel) will insure that the Bank of Japan will raise the official discount rate, now 5.25 percent, and keep interest rates higher longer.
He estimates that, based on this rise in interest rates, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index, which fell 4.4 percent last week to close at 29,515.76, should drop below 28,000, the low it reached during the market collapse in the first quarter of the year. In Europe, he expects that markets could fall 10 percent to 20 percent from where they were.
Last week, West Germany was down 4.1 percent; Britain, whose decline was somewhat offset by the positive effect of higher oil prices on its North Sea oil production, fell 2.0 percent; France, 4.9 percent, Spain, 5.5 percent, and Italy, 4.7 percent.
Merrill Lynch, according to its chief international equity strategist, Thomas Robinson, has already changed its investment levels in several markets, cutting them in Japan and the United states and raising them in the few countries that will beneift from higher oil prices, like Norway, or are not as dependent on oil, like Switzerland.

For Foreign Investors, the Dow's Direction Is Relative

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
THE eruption of a shooting crisis at one of the world's pulse points typically sends nervous international investors scurrying for the safety of the dollar. Sure enough, when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday, the greenback soared - but only for a few hours. Then, the dollar sagged again, as investors pondered the impact costlier oil could have on the fragile United States economy.
Those concerns already had been felt in currency markets. On Tuesday, the dollar fell within hailing distance of its postwar low against the German mark - 1.57 marks on Dec. 31, 1987. German investors have watched the take-home value of the Dow industrials tumble more than 11 percent in the last year. For British investors, the decline has been 7 percent.
Japanese investors see the market differently. With the weakness of the yen, the Dow is worth about 14 percent more in Tokyo today that it was a year ago. And for the American home team? At the close on Friday, the Dow was 5.9 percent ahead of its level a year ago.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Utilities Get Some Takeover Action

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
BEFORE the eruptions in the Middle East sent the theorists back to their computer keyboards on Thursday, the Dow Jones utilities had been enjoying a rare market rally, gaining nearly 5 percent over the past two weeks. The reasons were largely defensive, analysts said. With the fearsome gyrations of the Dow industrials and the damage inflicted on the Dow transports by the recent decline in United Airlines shares, the dull world of electricity production - all those reliable dividends, all that recession-proof revenue - seemed especially peaceful.
The serenity scenario seemed to evaporate with the invasion of Kuwait. Utilities, after all, are purchasers of oil, and oil seems destined to become more expensive. Not only that, the pessimists argued, but oil-driven inflation might prompt monetary officials to boost interest rates, making the yields on utility stocks less attractive than those on bonds. All that second-guessing took its toll on the fledgling rally, and the Dow utilities index ended the week at 209.7, down roughly 11 percent since the start of the year. 
What is not yet reflected in the index, however - but what has become increasingly clear to some money managers and analysts - is the emergence of a slow-acting takeover virus in the utility industry. The first hostile takeover battle is playing itself out in Kansas. Some patient money managers are already cashing in on an arbitrage opportunity provided by the pending merger of two California utilities. And others are quietly stocking up on shares of some Ohio companies they see as possible takeover candidates.
All of which suggests that whichever way the global tug-of-war goes, life will be far from dull in the utility patch.
The local fireworks broke out on July 23, when the Kansas City Power & Light Company offered $27 a share, or $875 million, for the Kansas Gas and Electric Company. There have been friendly unions between utilities, but this first hostile deal has shaped up as a classic ''barbarian'' battle. Board meetings were hastily convened, at which somber directors weighed the pending offer. Squads of lawyers filed competing briefs on behalf of each utility, and shareholders chimed in with lawsuits of their own.
On Thursday, with the market's attention riveted on the Middle East, the directors of Kansas Gas turned down the Kansas City Power offer as ''inadequate,'' and said the acquisition would hurt the employees, customers and communities served by Kansas Gas. The rejection certainly didn't hurt Kansas City Power; with the utility stocks in a rout, the shares of Kansas Gas closed the week below $24, 11 percent less than the amount Kansas City Power had offered.
Analysts are predicting renewed bidding. Kansas City Power is seeking additional generating capacity and its takeover target has capacity to spare, said Barry Abramson, an energy analyst with Prudential Bache. Thus, the bid probably would have been made regardless of the drubbing the stock market has given utility stocks.
''Kansas City Power & Light sees a long-term strategic issue here, and was just taking advantage of a price decline,'' Mr. Abrahamson said. Given the breadth of that price decline in the utility sector, are other takeovers likely? ''Yes,'' he said, ''but I think they will be done for selective reasons, not as a wholesale consolidation of the industry.''
One deal in the works is the friendly merger of San Diego Gas & Electric into Southern California Edison, a unit of SCEcorp. But even friendly utility mergers move at a glacial pace, said Christopher Wiles, assistant vice president and portfolio manager for Federated Management in Pittsburgh. The deal was approved by the companies in November 1988, and officers of the San Diego utility predict that they will not get a green light from regulators before 1991.
But meanwhile, money-managers have not been idle. The merger agreement calls for investors to get 1.3 shares of SCEcorp for each share of San Diego Gas & Electric. As of Friday, 1.3 shares of SCEcorp cost $49.73 on the New York Stock Exchange, while San Diego cost $43.50 a share. ''So if you want to own Southern California Edison, and you think this merger is eventually going to go through, you can buy San Diego and get the SoCal at a 12 percent discount,'' Mr. Wiles said. (He does, and he has.) The prospects for utility takeovers are shaped as much by regional factors as by the stock market. The Pacific Northwest has power capacity to spare, and fast-growing utilities in nearby California seem likely to need additional capacity. Nevertheless, Mr. Abramson is not excited about the takeover prospects in that quarter. The weak utilities in the Southwest - including the El Paso Electric Company and the Tucson Electric Power Company - are so eager to sell their excess capacity, he said, that ''it is a buyer's market there now.''
Not so in Ohio, said Mr. Wiles, who has been investing in American Electric Power, which operates in six other states, the Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company and DPL Inc., which owns the Dayton Power & Light Company. All are solid utilities trading at prices that offer above-average yields, he said, because ''people are still punishing them'' for the mess they made of the Zimmer nuclear project several years ago.
''But now they are converting the plant to coal,'' Mr. Wiles said, ''and that project is coming in ahead of schedule and under budget.'' Although the coal conversion, being deftly managed by American Electric Power, raises concerns about future air-quality restrictions, Mr. Wiles believes that today's stock prices fully reflect those worries.
''Of course, you can't play these stocks just as takeovers, because those deals can take so long,'' he said, ''so you have to like the underlying company.'' Still, he added, American Electric Power is by far the strongest of the Zimmer trio and ''it wouldn't surprise me if A.E.P. bought one of its partners, most likely Cincinnati.''

HEADLINE: Life After Wall Street: Less Stress - Less Money, Too

BYLINE: By DEBORAH L. JACOBS; Deborah L. Jacobs, based in Brooklyn, writes on business issues.

 BODY:
She was an arbitrageur and he was a trader, and before they reached their mid-30's, they had a combined annual income that sometimes exceeded a half million dollars. In the days of 1980's glory - or high-speed greed, depending on the point of view - they were like many of their Wall Street colleagues: always running, and making more money than they ever thought possible.
Then Ann and Richard Adrian walked away from it all. Today, scattering across the country, people like the Adrians have embarked upon new and very different lives. Some have made the change voluntarily and, because they had had substantial savings, with relative financial ease. But many, forced out of their brokerage firms or investment banks by cutback after cutback since Oct. 19, 1987, have been unwilling converts to the life of lower pay. 
Whether or not they miss Wall Street, few have the option of returning, at least for now. Forecasts of further layoffs continue to sweep through downtown's winding, narrow streets. ''Unless there's a clear and rapid upturn in the business,'' at least half of the estimated 50,000 professionals who will have lost their jobs between the fall of '87 and the end of '90, may be expected to leave Wall Street, said John Artise, vice president at the New York outplacement firm Drake Beam Morin Inc. What, then, has become of the Adrians and the others? On Wall Street, Ann and Richard Adrian hedged their investment bets against inflation, rising stock prices or fluctuations in foreign currencies. Now, their hedges are against roses or, gardenias, say, as they have sold their Manhattan condominium, moved to the Hamptons on Long Island and started a gardening and landscape business.
The couple had dreamed of working for themselves ever since they met in 1983 at an office softball game. Mr. Adrian, formerly of Smith Barney Harris Upham & Company once had wanted to be a forest ranger, but switched his major at Yale from forestry to economics. A gardening and landscape business thus combined two interests.
Ms. Adrian was an elementary school teacher earning $8,000 in 1977 before she went to work on Wall Street, winding up at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. ''The stock market crash and slow year after made the decision easier,'' she said of their dual career change.
She and her husband had substantial assets and few debts and, thus, the luxury of devoting themselves with relative ease to the new life. They have been living on their savings for a year, plan to take landscaping courses this fall at the State University of New York at Farmingdale, buy a pickup truck and learn to operate a bulldozer.
On Wall Street, Mr. Adrian said, ''You're on every minute when you're at work. Now you have to worry about plants growing - but the response time's not as fast.''
They say they have no desire to go back to the Street. ''It's not like we've become illiterate about business,'' said Ms. Adrian, who still follows market developments. But now she can go water-skiing before breakfast. RICHARD DANBECK, 48, who says he had planned to leave Wall Street when he reached the age of 50, moved up the timetable after laying off junior associates whom he had trained.
A salesman of fixed-income securities who earned about $200,000 a year, Mr. Danbeck has become a Buddhist and is getting a master's degree in East Asian studies at Columbia University. He said his new schedule gives him more time with his family. ''You may have had time before, but you come home and you're so into yourself being a hitter that you don't really listen,'' said Mr. Danbeck, who used to leave his New Jersey home at 5:00 A.M. for the commute to Wall Street and sometimes did not return until 9 or 10 P.M.
While the Adrians and Mr. Danbeck left Wall Street by choice, many others have been forced out. Diane Gianfortune said her ''entire world'' - including her marriage - fell apart. Having risen from secretary to senior associate in Salomon Brothers's municipal finance department, Ms. Gianfortune, now 40, spent 14 years at the company and was earning roughly $100,000 annually when the bubble burst.
Unable to find a comparable job, she turned a hobby into a business and started Cheshire Gourmet Cheesecakes Inc. - named for the grinning cat in ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Her specialty, sold at the Four Bridges Shopping Plaza on Staten Island, is a (large) bite-size cheesecake that costs 60 cents. ''Wall Street took my heart,'' Ms. Gianfortune said. ''No matter what you did, someone else higher up always seemed to get the credit.''
Paul Lehman also opted for food. Now, less than three years after he quit his job as a stockbroker, his Steamer Hot Cocoa Inc. is in the black. Why did he leave his old life? Boredom, he says.
Despite all the complaining about Wall Street, many would like to return. It isn't easy.
Rita De Silvio, a job counselor whose New York headhunting firm specializes in brokerages, said that even ''the creme de la creme traders can't get jobs commensurate with their skills.''
Nella Barkley, president of the Crystal-Barkley Corporation, a New York career counseling firm, said that to help overcome the traumatic losses of security, prestige, job, title and steady income she advises clients to write each of their skills on a separate business-sized card. It's a ''subliminal message'' that they have assets apart from their jobs, she said.
A transition period of at least six months typically follows being dismissed or quitting without first having something else in place. And many who leave the Street are reluctant to speak openly about it.
One investment banker in his 40's, for example, who lost his job in December demanded anonymity in disclosing that he had spent the winter teaching skiing in Vermont.
Another Wall Street refugee - let go as a trader with a large bank, spent eight months looking for other employment before he found the only viable option, with a Florida arbitrage boutique. ''I was too caught up in the whole Wall Street machine,'' he said, adding that a year ago he never could have considered Florida. ''It took losing my job to see there was a whole country of people that had been making substantial livings outside of the canyons of Wall Street.''
Among the related alternatives to Wall Street are jobs in small businesses or consulting services that draw on skills or contacts in financial services. Laid off last year from a job as a fixed-income strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. that earned him nearly $150,000 annually, Michael F. Carr, 55 years old, looked briefly for other jobs, and then started his own portfolio management firm in Lodi, N.J. Ronni Burns, once a regional manager in limited partnerships at E. F. Hutton with a six-figure income, now conducts training seminars in the sale of financial products. WARREN HUDGENS, once an investment banker earning $125,000 a year, is 39 years old and a househusband with four children in Whitefish, Mont. (population: 3,500). The family is living in a brand-new, 3,000-square-foot house (purchased at a foreclosure sale for $80,000) on his wife's $25,000 salary as a part-time occupational therapist at a local hospital, plus about $15,000 in earnings on savings. The Hudgens have bought a cabin on 40 acres overlooking Glacier National Park. Mr. Hudgens uses the 400,000 frequent flyer miles he accumulated during his days as ''a hyperactive type A,'' to fund an occasional family vacation.
Though he said he treasures the time he spends with his family, Mr. Hudgens still subscribes to New York Magazine and reads about $100-a-person restaurant dinners that he could afford when he was working 80 hours a week and earning more than $125,000 per year. And occasionally, he said, he asks himself: ''How can I no longer be relevant?''
 
LIVING WITH LESS
The income cuts for those leaving high-stakes Wall Street are by no means easy.
Richard Danbeck, no longer pulling down $200,000 a year as a securities salesman, went back to school in January of last year and kept thinking ''Isn't this great, it's America.'' Then, he said, ''You realize that the February bonus check isn't there and you have no income.''
Mary Ann Sessler, formerly at Bankers Trust, once spent at least $100 a month to dry-clean the silks she wore to work. When she quit the bank to work in an adoption agency, Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children, her income was cut in half. She has used more than a third of her savings, now walks instead of taking taxis, entertains at home rather than at restaurants and has switched to a cleaner who charges by the pound, not the garment.
Diane Gianfortune, although her last name in Italian means ''great fortune'' and she once earned $100,000 at Salomon Brothers, is the sole support of two teen-agers. She used her severance and bonus from Salomon to start a gourmet cheesecake company, and last year took a second mortgage on her home in order to expand her business. ''It hasn't been an easy two years,'' she said.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Boris Yeltsin, Man of the Hour?

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
Vladimir Kvint, Professor of Political Economy of the U.S.S.R. and a former professor at the Communist Higher Party School in Moscow, is a member of the ''Siberian school'' of market-oriented economists. Professor Kvint, who is currently a distinguished lecturer at Fordham University, spoke with Joel Kurtzman of The New York Times through an interpreter.
 
Q. In June the Communist Party Congress met in Moscow and President Gorbachev emerged as the party's undisputed leader. What did Mr. Gorbachev win?
 
Professor Kvint: Gorbachev's victory was a Pyrrhic one. Heated discussions took place at the congress, but they were of no interest to anyone in the country. Why do I say this? Because it was very clear that the congress was attended only by people who are not really interested in the democratization of Soviet society and of the economy. 
 
Q. But didn't the congress reaffirm perestroika and give Mr. Gorbachev support for moving ahead more rapidly with the economic reforms?
 
Professor Kvint: In mid-1989, later than all the rest of the people, Gorbachev understood that he failed with his first economic reforms. He then moved immediately to protect himself from these failures by creating the institution of the presidency. From that point on he became a dictator in the sense that as President he is not responsible to the Parliament or the party.
Let me give you an example. Three weeks ago, Gorbachev issued a decree taking away the rank, medals and awards of General Oleg D. Kalugin, a general in the K.G.B. General Kalugin did not hamper perestroika's progress in any way but he made disclosures against the K.G.B. during the congress. It was the first time in the history of the Soviet Union that a K.G.B. general spoke out against the K.G.B. Kalugin said the K.G.B. still exerted total control over the Soviet people. He charged that the K.G.B. still listens to everyone's telephone conversations and that it still follows foreigners, and so on.
It was a brave step on the part of the general, but now he is not a general anymore. Gorbachev deprived him of everything he had gained during his life for criticizing the K.G.B.
 
Q. Does Mr. Gorbachev have the power to bring about true economic reform?
 
Professor Kvint: Soon, I think, Boris Yeltsin will take power away from Gorbachev. On June 12, Russia, under President Yeltsin, declared the sovereignty of Russian laws over Soviet laws. The Baltic republics did it earlier; the Ukraine did it two weeks ago.
Gorbachev will remain president of the Soviet Union, but his power will largely resemble the power of a president in a country where the prime minister is the main figure. That is why Gorbachev decided to join with Yeltsin last week to create a commission for economic reform. He is simply acknowledging that Yeltsin is now emerging as the country's most powerful leader.
The United States should recognize the role of Yeltsin as the real leader of the nation. After all, who stopped the blockade of Lithuania? It was Yeltsin. The day after he was elected president of the Russian republic, he declared that Russia would establish direct ties with Lithuania even if the Soviet Union wouldn't. That ended the blockade of Lithuania because Russia has 92 percent of the Soviet Union's oil. Although oil production is down, Russia could supply the United States with 2 to 2.5 times the amount of oil Iraq now sells it.
 
Q. How will we see Mr. Yeltsin's power emerge?
 
Professor Kvint: Yeltsin has said openly his way is the way to the market economy. When he left the Communist Party at the congress in June, it was not just a gesture.
Mr. Yeltsin already abolished more than half of the ministries in the Russian republic. He also created something unheard of before. Out of 28 ministers in Russia, he created 8 that are without ministries. Each has only 20 people working for him. The purpose of these eight ministers is to cut the central Soviet bureaucracy.
For example, although the oil resources are in Russia, they are governed by two central Government ministries. These two ministries in Moscow deprive the oil industry of its independence. Yeltsin wants to abolish the power of these ministries and make the enterprises totally independent.
 
Q. And after that?
 
Professor Kvint: The next step then is to make Russia totally independent of the Soviet Union in hard currency. The Soviet Union has always had a monopoly on foreign trade. Yeltsin has already established a new bank for foreign economic relations for the Russian Republic. This bank will reallocate to Russia all of the hard-currency profits that now go to the Soviet Union from Russia's exports. Now all of the profits from Siberia's oil and gas exports go to the U.S.S.R. Yeltsin will keep those profits in Russia. Q. President Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Kohl of West Germany have been talking about helping the Soviet Union by extending credits and aid. President Bush has been reluctant to join in. Which course is correct?
 
Professor Kvint: Bush's course is so correct I am amazed. The Europeans have proposed giving about $12 billion in aid to the Soviet Union. But the real issue is not how much aid to give, but to whom. Aid given to the central Government not only will be misused, it will be harmful. Today, if you give the central Government $12 billion, it means that they won't have to cut $12 billion from the military budget. It means that the Soviet Union can continue to give money to Castro and Libya and to other negative regimes. Don't forget, the Soviet Union, based on the size of its economy, gives proportionately six times more aid than the United States.
But even if all of the $12 billion in aid were to be used correctly with none of it going to the military, I have calculated that it would at best add only 0.5 percent to the Soviet Union's rate of economic growth. In 1977, when exports of Western industrial goods to the Soviet Union were at their highest, they also contributed only about 0.5 percent to its rate of growth.
President Bush's approach is right. First send in the specialists to look at the country, then give aid to specific projects, not the central Government.
 
Q. Do you see the climate improving for foreign investment in the Soviet Union?
 
Professor Kvint: Each region is different. Siberia has the best situation. Azerbaijan, on the other hand, is a very dangerous territory. But next to it, there is Dagestan, also a Muslim republic, but it is a republic that is stable.
In the near future, political risk will be reduced in the Baltic republics as they acquire real economic independence. But the key fact to remember is that the Soviet Union should not be thought of as a single unit. In fact, it will very soon cease to be a single state.

HEADLINE: A Testament to Sexism at High-Tech Companies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was disturbed by the voice in Howard Muson's article (''One Company's Short-Lived Loyalties,'' July 8). Thousands of people get laid off every day but perhaps only a few have a writer/husband who tells the world how terribly the ''little woman'' was treated. It would have helped all of us had she told the story herself. 
I have worked as an employee, executive and senior consultant with Fortune 200 computer companies and entrepreneurial high-technology companies over the last seven years of a 25-year professional career. Women are easy targets in the high-tech world, and this article fuels the controversy that ''this is a man's business.''
In my high-tech career, I have witnessed and experienced a discomforting amount of ''women bashing'' by male executives at all levels who are frightened about losing control and resort to attacking others whom they perceive as a threat to their economic well-being. Women who fight back are in a no-win situation. If the battle escalates, the corporate survival instinct still appears to favor the male.
I have also met and worked with a number of very bright and talented female managers who do an outstanding job as long as things are going their way. But as soon as things start to get rough, too many of them announce quite publicly that it is time for them to ''start their families,'' or whatever else will remove them from the fray.
I am disturbed by both of these trends. When I look at high-tech companies today, I see very few female managers in the pipeline for any executive office. If American business is to succeed in the global economy, we need to create environments in which the best and the brightest make it to the top.

HEADLINE: Michael Porter Redux: Yes, but . . .

 BODY:
In an article on the July 22 Forum page, Michael E. Porter, a professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School, discussed the issue of American competitiveness (''Japan Isn't Playing by Different Rules''). Professor Porter believes that the United States has been moving away from one of its fundamental principles - faith in competition - having been seduced by a mistaken view of the reasons for Japan's success in the world marketplace. He argues that a competitive ''home environment'' is a prerequisite for global success.
Some of the letters received in response to the article follow.
 
MITI Is Still Going Strong - Just Look at Boeing
 
To the Editor:
 Professor Porter demonstrates a woeful ignorance of big business and the economic situation in Japan. He argues that there is no difference between American and Japanese business environments and insists that Japanese industrial policy and guidance by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and other Japanese agencies is either nonexistent or ineffective. He says Japanese companies no longer participate in the consortiums and other Government-sponsored programs that characterized the successes of Japan in the past. 
This is simply at variance with the facts. To take just one area, there are 70 consortiums and Government-sponsored research efforts in high-definition television. Together, Government and industry have invested more than $2 billion in this important emerging technology. Likewise, there are major business and government consortiums involved in supercomputing, software automation, biotechnology, advanced ceramics, telecommunications and aerospace. Indeed, MITI orchestrated the deal between Boeing and the Japanese aerospace industry for development of the new 777.
These facts, which most observers of the Japanese industrial scene are well aware of, contrast sharply with the agonizing debate over ''picking winners and losers'' in the United States. Clearly the Japanese are not doing what we are doing.

Wall Street Scared The Daring Out of Industry
 
To the Editor:
 Michael Porter's powerful article is another right and proper wake-up call to American industry.
But he does not note that during the merger and acquisition-happy decade of the 1980's, Wall Street put enormous pressure on American chief executives to reduce costs and improve margins. The very idea of taking even prudent risk fell deep in fear's shadow. This same pressure did not exist in Japan where market share was the goal.
During the same period of wealth generation, the Nikkei average tracked the Dow Jones industrial average almost point for point. Isn't that curious in our free-market system?

Educators Arise, Business Needs You
 
To The Editor:
 Professor Porter's observations should not be missed by American educators. His characterization of a ''national environment'' that ''promotes rapid progress'' is reminiscent of the recent call by David Kearns, president of the Xerox Corporation, for business to tell education what its expectations are and then to support politicians and educators who, in Kearns' words, ''are willing to risk failure to gain success.''
It is an exceptional time to move beyond complaints and toward decisive action.

Stop the Rhetoric, Let the Exports Begin!
 
To The Editor:
 If we as a nation are going to compete with the Japanese, we need far less ideological rhetoric and far more exporting.
The United States, and in particular our high-technology companies, have products and services that are sought after around the world. Recent studies by the Commerce Department have concluded that our small and medium-size companies can export early and profitably, competing well with their Japanese counterparts. If this is the case, what's the problem?
The problem is, quite simply, that only five out of every hundred United States companies export. The rest stay home, content to watch their domestic market share erode to foreign competition, often Japanese.
These companies haven't realized that exporting makes good business sense. It is both necessary and profitable. After all, international markets are four times greater than the domestic market; 95 percent of the world's population is outside the United States, and global population is increasing 70 percent faster than the United States population.
Recognizing the window of opportunity now open for American exports is only the first step. Small and medium-size United States companies interested in seizing this moment to start an exporting venture need to develop international sales strategies and aggressively pursue overseas markets.
Now is the time for United States firms to take advantage of these global opportunities and regain our leading position in world trade. The payoffs from exporting will be increased profits, a strengthened economy, a better future and more jobs for our American workers.
The message for the 90's is clear: Export or expire!

Military Secrecy Did Business In
 
To the Editor:
 Professor Porter has ignored the pivotal reasons for our loss of global competitiveness.
It's not that Japan, Germany and the United States are playing by different rules. All three have strived for rapid improvement, innovation and upgrading as much as for economies of scale. The difference is one of strategies and priorities for industrial-economic security and growth.
American priorities and strategies have been for military-industrial growth, while Japanese and German priorities and strategies have emphasized civil-industrial growth.
For decades, about 60 percent of American scientists and engineers have been employed in the development and production of weapon systems, a process conducted in secret and exempted from accountability in a competitive open market - a requirement for civil-industrial competitiveness and growth.
Consequently, cost overruns, delays in deliveries and gaps between planned and actual performance capabilities of United States weapons, nuclear and space systems haveJU grown steadily. But our manufacturers of those systems continue to grow without risk of failure, because they serve vital requirements of the United States security establishment.
And yet our industrial and economic security has steadily eroded because our executives have become indolent, not only because of the exemptions from open-market accountability, but also from their dependence for growth on pork barreling by security powers.
Such companies as General Motors and General Electric used to be paragons of American national and global competitive leadership in markets for automotive and household electronic products. But, since acquiring military equipment manufacturing capabilities, they have lost their competitive standing in the consumer markets. Meanwhile, Japanese and German manufacturers of consumer products have based their growth in competitive markets on new technology developed by and acquired from United States defense contractors.
In the early 60's, to preserve the strength of the United States dollar in international monetary exchanges, the United States Government launched the Pentagon foreign arms sales program and canceled its policies for cooperative development and deployment of common conventional weapons with its democratic allies.
During the 80's, the United States Government pursuaded allies of Japan and West Germany to cooperate in efforts to devalue the United States dollar to decrease prices of United States products in export markets, thus reducing American trade deficits. Meanwhile, however, United States manufacturers have continued to close factories in the United States and to open them in industrializing countries of the Asian rim, Mexico or South America. And Japanese and European manufacturers have exploited advantages of the devalued dollar by building and operating factories in the United States.
In effect, the United States Government and industrial leaders have been more concerned about the security and vitality of the United States dollar than about the security and vitality of United States competitiveness, productivity and job security for American citizens. They have persisted with the growth of the United States military, even though such growth has exacerbated American trade deficits, financial deficits and political insecurity.

The Role of Competition in Two Great Depressions
 
To the Editor:
 Michael Porter complains that ''America has been retreating from one of the most fundamental principles that has distinguished our nation from others: our faith in competition.'' This sweeping defense is historically inaccurate.
Competition itself has widely been identified as the major cause of the two Great Depressions of the past century (in the 1890's and the 1930's). In the 1930-33 period, Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt and Bernard Baruch described the problem as ''cutthroat'' and ''destructive'' competition, and ''overproduction.''
Both presidents actively sought to revise the antitrust laws, and Roosevelt's original New Deal suspended them for a time. Baruch proposed a ''worldwide Supreme Court of business'' to regulate industrial output. Similarly, economic histories conclude that excessive duplication and overbuilding of railroads led to the crash of the 1890's.
These conclusions may have been incorrect, but it is disappointing that today's advocates of all-out competition never take up the question of why these conclusions were reached by people of presumably different ideological perspectives. True enough, economists often remind us that various forms of ''protectionism'' caused the debacle of the 30's, but why did everyone else disagree with them at the time?
The problem is easily explained in the form of a puzzle that should be given attention at the Harvard Business School, where Porter teaches. It is a principle of managment that duplication is wasteful, and it is a principle of economics that competition is efficient. How can both principles be correct when duplication and competition are synonymous?

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
A Marriage With Video Technology

BYLINE: Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
IN the future it may be impossible to tell the difference between a personal computer and a television set. The two technologies are colliding even today, and in a few years we are likely to see conventional business computers giving way to ''smart TV's'' or ''video computers.''
''It is safe to say that 10 years from now there will be more things that look like TV's but that on the inside are really personal computers than there are personal computers today,'' said Nick Arnett, editor of Multimedia Computing and Presentations, a newsletter based in Santa Clara, Calif.
Consider the recent classified advertisement that Mr. Arnett said he saw in a Silicon Valley newspaper:
''Software opportunity. Multimedia, High Definition TV. Current projects include architecture and design of futuristic multimedia work stations and the development of state-of-the-art HDTV systems for applications in the entertainment industry. Complex man-machine interface, windowing systems, object-oriented programming and data bases, real-time machine control, image/video processing.'' 
The advertisement was placed by the Sony Corporation, the giant consumer electronics manufacturer that suddenly sounds a lot like a computer company. In fact, Sony already makes an impressive line of scientific and engineering work stations, and it is in the vanguard in developing hand-held computers that recognize handwriting.
Radius Inc. of San Jose, Calif., a leading manufacturer of monitors, has also seen the future and decided it is video. The company recently introduced its Radius TV System, a remarkable television subsystem for Apple Macintosh II computers that sells for $2,795. It consists of a so-called video engine that plugs into a Mac expansion slot, an audio-video processor that sits outside the Mac and special software for controlling and manipulating video images.
When equipped with Radius TV and a color monitor (Radius, of course, but the Apple 13-inch RGB monitor can be used with an optional display controller), the Macintosh can display, store and manipulate any video image, including input from broadcast and cable television, video cassette recorders, laser disk players, video cameras and digital cameras.
The video can be displayed on the computer screen in real time, directly from a feed - at 30 frames a second, the same as televison - with no apparent loss of quality. In computer terms, the system displays 16-bit color images, which means that each dot making up the image has 16 possible color components, yielding images that are not quite photographic quality but certainly equal to what most television sets produce.
The Radius software presents a mouse-driven control panel on screen that lets the user change channels, switch among video sources and adjust such variables as brightness, contrast, color and hue. The size of the video window can be changed, up to the dimensions of a full 13-inch screen, and it can be moved around the screen.
A stock trader, for example, might wish to monitor the Financial News Network in a corner of the screen while keeping track of stock prices at the same time.
Granted, $2,795 is a lot of money for a television set, and if the computer user simply wanted to watch the baseball game in one corner of the screen while working on a spreadsheet, it would be far more economical to buy a little color portable and hook it up alongside the computer. But Radius TV goes beyond that, using all parts of the video signal, including parts that we often do not see. For example, ''close captioned'' programs are sent along with text, allowing hearing-impaired people to ''read'' the television. The text is sent along with the audio and video information in a form called ASCII (pronounced az-KEY), which a computer can read.
The lay user cannot currently perform such tasks, but the software that comes with Radius TV is a tool allowing programmers to develop such applications. Other applications might include instructing the computer to search incoming ASCII text for one or more key words - ''gold,'' for example, or ''no new taxes.'' When the computer detected those words in the video signal, it would capture the video and audio portions, or perhaps open a window on the computer screen and crank up the volume to let the user know that an item of interest was being discussed.
Up to three incoming signals can be monitored at once, ''sort of like a TV news clipping service happening in real time,'' said Tony Bove, co-editor of the Bove & Rhodes Inside Report on Desktop Publishing and Multimedia, published in Gualala, Calif. Some people might use Radius TV to capture and print the transcript from network evening news programs. While Radius TV is impressive in the ways it brings video and audio into a computer, it is not designed to send processed images back out. One cannot play back through a video cassette recorder a video clip that has been edited on the computer, but the edited materials can be distributed on a computer network.
The system has a lot of potential applications in desktop publishing. A person writing a newsletter on advertising, for example, might use Radius TV to capture a television commercial. Using the software that comes with Radius TV, the writer could ''grab'' a frame from the commercial, edit it and drop it into a newsletter. A newspaper graphics editor might capture the image of the President directly off the screen as he speaks at a televised news conference, process the frame and beat an otherwise impossible deadline.
Of course, some users might want to grab more than a frame. Radius TV could be used to process video segments taken with a camcorder on a factory floor, for example. Those segments could be digitized by Radius TV, manipulated and incorporated into a computer-based training program for workers.
Andrew Singer, vice president of engineering at Radius, said some corporate customers were exploring the use of Radius TV as the hub for a security system. Cameras placed around a building might be assigned different channels on a company cable television system, and the computer could be programmed to grab a frame every three seconds. The computer could also be programmed to switch to full motion video when an image changed significantly - for example, when a truck pulled up to a loading dock.
Some companies might figure out a way to use Radius TV to merge video, audio and electronic mail. Imagine the possibilities: The boss's scowling face pops up suddenly to fill the worker's screen and growls, ''Watson, come here, I want you.''
''For interactive training, multimedia applications, broadcast TV - for anybody working with more sophisticated pictures, images and graphics, particularly motion and animation, a whole set of tools is becoming available,'' said Stanley Klein, editorial director of the S. Klein Newsletter, of Sudbury, Mass. ''Radius is providing a platform for third parties to develop end-user applications.''

Iraq Marches, Kuwait Crumbles and the Markets Convulse
 
It's as if President Saddam Hussein of Iraq sat at a trading desk, with enough capital to suddenly, violently dump yen, unload Treasury bonds, buy oil, bid up the dollar, hoard gold, invest in Norwegian and Australian commodity stocks and sell shares almost everywhere else. Such were the convulsions after Iraq invaded Kuwait and seized its rich oil supplies. Some analysts tried to assure each other that, with the world's stockpiles high and extra production capacity available, oil prices will not soar as they did in the 1970's. But even before the invasion, many in the oil industry said that prices were likely to rise by 50 percent within five years. Now President Hussein governs almost 20 percent of the world's oil supplies. An additional 37 percent, in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are within half a day's drive by tank. Whether by intimidation or outright posession, said Christopher Flavin, vice president for research at the Worldwatch Institute, ''Iraq could control over half of the world's oil reserves. It lends a whole new tone to oil vulnerability.'' 
 
Japan Moves In on Europe
 
One of Europe's ''national champion'' computer makers is no match for a Japanese heavyweight. ICL P.L.C., Britain's largest computer maker, agreed on Monday to let Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan buy an 80-percent interest for $1.29 billion. The purchase, if approved by the European Community, will crown the expansion strategy of Takuma Yamamoto, the company's chairman, by making Fujitsu the world's second-largest computer company, behind Internatonal Business Machines. The Europeans have planned a loose network of technology companies - national champions - capable of taking on the Americans and Japanese. But since two other supposed champions - Olivetti of Italy and Groupe Bull of France - lost money last year, both are potential targets for the Japanese.
 
Yeltsin's New Credibility
 
Two years ago, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union called Boris N. Yeltsin undisciplined and disruptive, purging him as Moscow party chief. But by this May, not even Mr. Gorbachev's opposition could keep voters from making Mr. Yeltsin the President of the Russian Republic. Now Mr. Gorbachev has joined with Mr. Yeltsin to form a commission to revamp the nation's economy. Herbert S. Levine, a scholar of Soviet economics at the University of Pennsylvania, said that Mr. Gorbachev's move has ''enormous significance'' for the nation: ''Here's a man who has tremendous political instincts, but he has been reluctant to take economic risks,'' Mr. Levine said. And the intellectuals who derided Mr. Yeltsin as a buffoon now see him as the best hope for economic reform.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
The Looming Recession?
 
Thursday's invasion of Kuwait and Friday's unemployment report left virtually every economist talking of recession - some in the future tense, some in the conditional, a few in the present. Unemployment rose to 5.5 percent in July, the highest in two years and up three-tenths of 1 percent from June. Other figures last week - the leading economic indicators, the purchasing managers index - also indicated weakness. ''The economy is barely above water,'' said Alan C. Lerner, a managing director and economist at Bankers Trust. But wages that rose at more than a 7 percent annual rate last month and oil prices that are sharply higher keep the Federal Reserve from easing rates much without aggravating inflation, he said. Stocks plummeted on the week's news, recovering somewhat on Friday afternoon after the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, predicted that Iraq would soon withdraw from Kuwait.
 
Bank Fund Shrivels
 
Is a bank bailout in store? Probably not, said the nation's top banking regulator last week. But L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said that the fund to insure bank deposits will lose money in 1990 for the third straight year. He blamed weakening real estate markets and an onslaught of bank failures. The fund would be left with assets of only $11 billion, less than 60 cents for every $100 of insured deposits. ''The insurance fund is under considerable stress, and it is at the lowest point at any time in modern history,'' Mr. Seidman said. But he sees no need for the Government to replenish the fund. ''At this point, we believe we can handle anything we can see,'' he said on Tuesday. Will later news of a slowing economy change his views?
 
More S.& L. Bad News
 
Other bad news from Mr. Seidman: The Government will need another $100 billion in the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1 to finance the savings and loan bailout. Appearing before Congress in his other role, as chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, he said the money was essential for the agency to keep up its pace of closing and selling off failed savings and loans.
 
The Upside of Censorship
 
An old marketing lesson repeated for the 1990's: Better sales through censorship. Karen Finley sold out two performance art shows at Lincoln Center recently after the National Endowment for the Arts refused to renew her grant. And a No Excuses jeans commercial featuring Marla Maples aired on television newscasts free after the networks refused to accept it for pay. Ms. Finley's work deals with sexual themes, sometimes humorously, sometimes stridently. The No Excuses advertising agency, Lois/GGK was far more calculating, virtually guaranteeing network rejection by having Miss Maples toss out some supermarket tabloids that have pantingly covered her friendship with Donald J. Trump. But remember that ''Banned in Boston'' was once a movie's best endorsement. And even James Joyce picked up sales for all the trouble he had getting ''Ulysses'' into this country. Profiting from censorship has its limits, though. Whatever chocolate icing Ms. Finley wears in her performance, Duncan Hines is unlikely to ask for her endorsement.
 
Steinbrenner Pere et Fils
 
He earned his job the old-fashioned way. Hank Steinbrenner was named to take over the Yankees on Tuesday by his father, George, who was banned from running the team the day before. Fay Vincent, the commissioner of baseball, forbade father and son from so much as conversing about the team.
 
COMPANIES
 
Smaller Auto Makers in Jeopardy
 
Small cars sell well; the smaller car companies, maybe not. Some analysts say that each quarter brings the Chrysler Corporation, smallest of the American Big Three, closer to the point where a partnership will become essential. Second-quarter earnings dropped 47 percent from a year ago, to $180 million, and the company predicts a third-quarter loss. Slower sales and buyer rebates are hurting Ford and General Motors as well, but Chrysler is the most vulnerable. Several small auto makers have been taken over, entirely or in part, in the last year - Jaguar by Ford, Saab by G.M., and Fuji Heavy Industries, the Subaru maker, by Nissan. Chrysler has ended a joint venture with Renault, but still needs a foreign ally to share development expenses and reduce its dependence on North American markets. ''Long term, they would be in much better shape if they were able to combine resources with someone else,'' said Harvey Heimbach, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''Not necessarily merger, but joint ventures with another company.'' A possible partner: Fiat.
 
Honda's New Speed
 
Top speed 168 miles per hour. Zero to sixty in less than six seconds. These Ferrari-like figures come from the once-humble Honda Motor Company, in the new Acura NSX. The $60,000 price is a veritable bargain considering that $100,000 is usually the minimum cost of such road-burning performance. Honda hopes that the aura of its new car will brighten its entire Acura luxury line, propelling Honda's American car sales past Chrysler's.
 
Bumpy Weather for UAL
 
Investors fled from the UAL Corporation as banks reportedly backed away from financing an employee takeover. With higher oil prices threatening the company as well, its shares fell 41 points last week to finish at 122. The unions face an Aug. 9 deadline for their deal, with an extension possible. The stock, down from a 52-week high of 294, seems to have no more bounce than a 10-year-old airline seat cushion. But asking industry analysts about the airline's prospects practically causes them to twitch and tremble. ''You learn with UAL never to say never,'' says Thomas Longman, an analyst at Bear Stearns. ''They say around Wall Street that just about everybody has lost money one UAL at one point or another.''
 
Trouble at the Chicago Merc
 
Sorry is the man who risks becoming an example of the problems he says don't need fixing. Karsten Mahlmann resigned as chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade on Wednesday in a swirl of financial and legal troubles. Mr. Mahlmann and his fellow commodity traders have protested the Bush Adminstration's plan for greater Securities and Exchange Commission policing. We can govern ourselves, with help from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, they said. Now Mr. Mahlmann's company, Stotler Group Inc., has defaulted on its debt. The futures commission accused an affiliated firm of misusing customers' capital to shore up Stotler, and a Federal judge appointed an attorney to watch the money.

HEADLINE: Managing;
Inviting the Headhunters Inside

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
THE Baxter Health Care Corporation's Hyland division, a Deerfield, Ill., company that makes protein solutions from blood plasma, is looking for someone to fill a senior position. Several Hyland insiders qualify - but just barely. So Hyland has asked Conex Inc., a New York recruiting firm, to evaluate the insiders, compare them to outsiders and then present Hyland with a slate of candidates from both groups.
''Even when the inside people are good, there is always that flicker of hope that someone ideal will turn up,'' said Cleopatra Gomez, Hyland's staffing manager. 
What was once a clear-cut division of duties - top management evaluated insiders for promotion, search firms scoured the rest of the world - has become yet another casualty of the tumult of the 1980's. The barrage of mergers, divestitures and restructurings has meant that many executives are being asked to evaluate subordinates they barely know. And, the wave of downsizing has put so many experienced people out of work that it is hard for top management to resist checking what's available on the unemployment lines before promoting even the most deserving insider.
The result is that companies are setting aside once-sacrosanct promote-from-within policies and asking executive recruiters to help them choose between their own people and those available outside.
''I think it is healthy for an insider to actively compete in a formalized way with other candidates,'' said David K. Downes, executive vice president of the Equitable Capital Management Corporation, a New York asset-management company that often asks search firms to evaluate insiders and outsiders for open positions. ''It is time that people realized that being next in the hierarchy no longer means they will automatically be deemed the right person to move into the job above them.''
Recruiters say Mr. Downes's attitude has grown prevalent. ''Companies no longer promote people who have most of the traits they are looking for, when there might be someone outside who has all of them,'' said Paul R. Ray Jr., chief executive of Paul R. Ray & Company, a Fort Worth recruiting firm. Nor should they, added Lester B. Korn, chairman of Korn/Ferry International in Los Angeles. ''At high levels, the board owes it to shareholders to see if they can't find someone better outside,'' he said.
Reasons for bringing recruiters into the internal evaluation process vary widely. William J. Turner, for example, felt he had no choice. He had been chairman of Forstmann & Little Industries Inc.'s four industrial businesses for less than six months when he had to fill a couple of executive positions. He asked Heidrick & Struggles, New York recruiters, to help him evaluate candidates. ''It's a cop-out for a hands-on business manager to ask an outsider to evaluate his people, but I hadn't been around long enough to know the insiders well enough to judge them myself,'' Mr. Turner said.
Partners in joint venture companies often turn to recruiters to assuage fears that either partner might try to stack the corporate deck with its own people.
When the president of Centel Facilities Communication, a joint venture between Centel Business Systems and the Houston Sports Association, recently resigned, he was replaced with someone from Centel Business - but only after the Paul R. Ray firm presented him as a top candidate for the job. ''By going outside for help, we didn't have to worry that the Centel people had been prejudiced in his favor,'' said Neal Gunn, executive vice president of Houston Sports, which owns the Houston Astros and operates the Astrodome.
Indeed, executives who do wind up promoting from within often say they are glad they brought a recruiter into the processs - if for no other reason than to hear a competent outsider register a vote of confidence in the internal staff. WHENEVER he cannot find a clear-cut internal candidate to fill a job, Thomas Havern, director of human resources at Hiram Walker-Allied Vintners Inc., asks Sidney G. Stricker, a principal at Stricker, Sur & Associates, to evaluate insiders and outsiders alike. Mr. Stricker has handled numerous searches for the company - so many, in fact, that many of the insiders he is asked to evaluate are people that he originally placed in their jobs, and thus knows quite well.
As often as not, Mr. Stricker comes back with a recommendation to promote one of them into the vacant position - an eventuality that delights Mr. Havern. ''Sometimes, looking outside makes you realize how good your own people are,'' he said.
Still, most recruiters say that internal search can represent a political minefield if handled incorrectly. Gerard R. Roche, Heidrick's chairman, put it this way: ''The chairman may think he is just asking for added input, but the typical insider will say, 'Hey, I've been working for you for four years, and you need Roche to do a two-hour interview before you know how good I am?' They really resent this.''
Conversely, the recruiter can serve as a lightning rod for that resentment if the insider does not get the job. Fred Siegel, Conex's president, guesses that sometimes that is the only reason he is asked to evaluate insiders. ''It's political,'' he said. ''Management wants us to take the flack when the vice president who thinks he's a shoo-in for president gets turned down.''
 
RECRUITERS WITHIN: THE ADVANTAGES
 
* Top management is new and does not know the insiders well.
 
* The recruiter originally placed the inside candidates with the company.
 
* The recruiter can deflect blame from management if an outsider is hired.
 
* It is easier to have one person compare insiders and outsiders.
 
* An impartial outsider can minimize political battles over hiring.

HEADLINE: SHOPPER'S WORLD;
Argentina's Glittering Trove

BYLINE: By Cristina Carlisle; Cristina Carlisle is on staff at The Times bureau in Buenos Aires.

 BODY:
Excited by stories of a mountain of silver, the colonizing Spanish in the early 16th century gave the name Rio de la Plata - River of Silver - to the great South American river system that ends at Buenos Aires. In the Andes, along the continent's western rim, their dreams would be fulfilled. So abundant was the supply of the glittering metal that in the 17th century, in Potosi alone - now part of Bolivia - more than 3,000 mine shafts were opened. Visitors of the time were amazed to find chairs, tables and even the most ordinary of household objects, such as sinks and pitchers, made of sterling silver or silverplate.
Though the Indians had already mastered sophisticated silverworking techniques by the time the conquistadors arrived, the new European influence would make itself increasingly felt throughout South America. Silversmiths arriving with the flood of artists and craftsmen from Portugal, Spain and Italy into Buenos Aires when it became the capital of a new Spanish viceroyalty in 1776 began a tradition that has been handed down from father to son and is very much alive today. 
Colonial (as well as contemporary) silverwork has long been a passion for Argentines. Now, with prices as much as a tenth of those in New York - partly because decades of economic turmoil have forced Argentina's impoverished middle class to sell off family treasures - the market here is beginning to attract international attention. Christopher Hartop, a silver specialist for Christie's New York, recently visited Buenos Aires and said he found that although there were few exceptional pieces, prices for antique pieces were often much lower than in New York.
Possibly Buenos Aires's most distinguished silversmith is Juan Carlos Pallarols. His workshop (Defensa 1094; telephone 361-7360; no set days or hours), filled with his personal collection of colonial furniture and silver objects, is in his home overlooking Plaza Dorrego in the colonial district of San Telmo - an area that has become the center of the city's antiques trade.
Descended from a line of prestigious Catalan silversmiths, whose works are found in the Vatican and in major Argentine collections, museums and churches, he is training two of his sons to become the seventh generation of Pallarols in the trade. His own creations, he says, are in the hands of King Juan Carlos of Spain and President Francois Mitterrand of France, and are often selected by the Argentine government as official gifts to foreign dignitaries.
Mr. Pallarols's work - exclusively in sterling silver (with a purity level of 925 out of 1,000, or 92.5 percent silver) - reflects both the curvaceous lines of the southern European tradition to which he was born and the imagery of his native South America: delicately chiseled cockatoos from the Amazon, condors from the Andes, thistle flowers from the Argentine countryside or passion flowers from Paraguay and northern Argentina.
Prof. Hector Schenone, art historian and expert in Latin American colonial silver, describes Mr. Pallarols as ''an excellent silversmith who can do anything.'' He says there are other good Argentine silversmiths, all working outside Buenos Aires in provincial towns, but that they are more limited in the styles they can do.
Aside from his colonial pieces, similar to 17th- to early 19th-century European models, many of Mr. Pallarols's more elaborate creations are in a style known as plateria criolla, or creole silverware. Originating in the 19th century - when the growth of commerce in Buenos Aires after the fragmentation of the viceroyalty and subsequent independence from Spain led to a large increase in cattle-raising gauchos on the Pampas - it consists of objects and attire used by these Argentine cowboys, as well as richer versions made for the owners of the estancias, or ranches.
Creole items include whips called fustas or rebenques, knives called facones and belts called rastras. Decorated with silver and sometimes old coins, these wonderful thick leather belts were worn by gauchos with bombachas - wide trousers that narrow toward the bottom and fasten at the ankle.
Even the gaucho's horse was decked in silver. Its chapeado - halter, bridle, reins, stirrups, breastplates and saddle trimmings, called cabezales - was made of leather inlaid with silver, or more luxuriously, with both silver and gold. Some estancia owners went so far as to have chapeados made of solid silver or gold. A symbol of status, the gaucho's glittering apparel was paraded during religious holidays or other festivities. Even today, a special occasion will still find gauchos in full regalia.
At Mr. Pallarols's shop and elsewhere, you will also find the mate (pronounced MAH-tay), a vessel from which a traditional bitter herb tea is drunk. The custom of drinking mate was passed on by the Indians to the conquering Spaniards and today is especially popular in Argentina and Uruguay.
The first mates were simple gourds from the calabash tree. Later a great variety of shapes, sizes, styles and ornamentation evolved. Sometimes they were embellished with silver trimmings, sometimes made entirely of solid silver and even of solid gold. A mate normally comes with a bombilla, a separate straw, often made of silver, with a strainer at the lower end to trap the leaves.
Prices for works by Mr. Pallarols vary widely, depending on the size of the piece, the intricacy of the work and the amount of silver involved. Custom work is welcome. At the lower end of the scale are pillboxes, some inlaid with rhodochrosite, or Incan rose, a glassy, rose-red semiprecious stone found in the Argentine Andes, as well as simple money clips, both for $30 (because of Argentina's long history of inflation and the fluctuating exchange rate, dealers quote silver prices in dollars).
Tupos - copies of the delicate silver clips used by Indians to fasten shawls or ponchos - sell for $30 to $150. A calabash mate with silver trim costs $80 to $100, and solid silver mates range from $300 to $500. Facones cost $200 to $3,000; picture frames, $80 to $800; silver chandeliers, $1,000 to $4,000, and very large, heavily ornamented colonial-style mirrors, $12,000.
Samuel (Cacho) Setian has a solid reputation for his knowledge of facones, the knives used by gauchos. He and his wife, Alicia, have a spacious shop, Alhambra, facing Plaza Dorrego (Bethlem 423; 361-1097; open noon to 7 P.M. Sunday through Friday). Here an assortment of antique furniture, porcelain and other pieces surrounds cabinets stocked with colonial and creole silver and his renowned collection of knives.
Originally a fighting weapon, the facon was also used by the gaucho in his daily tasks. It was normally tucked into his belt behind him, with the sharp edge pointed upward inside the sheath - ready for battle. The blades were imported from Europe, but the handle and sheath were made by local silversmiths.
Mr. Setian has a unique piece made for a 19th-century Argentine president, Gen. Justo Jose de Urquiza, by his Sicilian silversmith, Pablo Cataldi, that is inlaid with gold and estimated to be worth $50,000. He also has many knives priced at $2,500, $1,000 or even $250.
Three years ago, the brothers Javier, Jose and Jaime Eguiguren opened a shop called Eguiguren (Libertad 1389; 812-6328; open Monday through Friday 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. and 4 to 8 P.M., Saturday 10 A.M. to 1 P.M.) in the elegant Barrio Norte neighborhood. Their silver is tastefully arranged in display cases or set among period furniture that is also for sale. Three-quarters of the stock is usually from the 19th century, with a few objects from the 17th century and a bit more from the 18th. They also deal in creole silverware and some contemporary items.
Prices for mates at Eguiguren begin at $400. A 19th-century rastra belt with silver coins and a silver thistle flower at the front sold for $800. Two 18th-century altar plaques, beautifully embossed with botanical motifs, sold for $11,000. A pair of 19th-century five-branched candelabra with central flower-form vases from colonial Peru was $14,000.
Ricardo Pardo heads Casa Pardo (Paraguay 782; 313-8170 or 312-0980; open Monday through Friday 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. and 3:30 to 7:30 P.M., Saturday 10 A.M. to 12:30 P.M.), a traditional silver shop in the financial district, founded in 1892. Over the years, Pardos have served as advisers in the formation of major private and museum silver collections. Much of the firm's business still consists in acting as a contact between potential buyers and collectors with things to sell.
In addition to some less interesting pieces, the shop - a large, nondescript rectangular room - houses some exceptional items, such as an elaborate bridle, halter and rein set made in Buenos Aires in the late 19th century that sold for $1,500. A chain of little silver barrels and eagles made up the bridle and rein; the halter had large silver flowers on either side.
A wide assortment of silver items can be found at the Sunday antiques fair at Plaza Dorrego. They typically include Art Deco broaches studded with marcasites ($40 to $80), brushes and mirrors ($200) or cigarette cases ($30 to $200). Shopping here is fun, and the occasional find is possible, but it takes a trained eye to distinguish quality and authenticity.
Of the major auction houses in Buenos Aires, Sarachaga (Juncal 1248; 812-8424 or 814-2591), owned by Juan and Martin Sarachaga, is the only one specializing in colonial and creole silverware. Two sales a year offer 150 to 180 pieces each, usually including mates, antique spoons and soup ladles, soup terrines, bowls, round trays known as pailas and coffee and tea sets. The sales are catalogued by Hector Coscia, one of Buenos Aires's most renowned silver specialists. Buyers receive a certificate identifying their purchase and extending a money-back guarantee should doubt arise as to its authenticity.
Because silver pieces in the colonial style were, in fact, being produced up until the beginning of the 20th century and very few bore the silversmith's mark, authentication and dating are very difficult. Most of the everyday items made from silver in the 17th and 18th centuries were melted down and reused, and copies of early pieces abound. Those original early works that do survive are mostly held by private collectors and museums, though authentic 18th-century religious artifacts, such as chalices, missal holders and crucifixes, are easier to come by.
Some of the colonial silver was done with purity levels of 900 or 950, but many of the items for daily use had a higher copper content to make them more durable. Their silver purity level is usually 800. Shops scattered all over Buenos Aires have copies of classic European silver pieces, including trays and flatware, but virtually all of that is silver plate.
Those who do not have an expert eye should confine their shopping to the handful of prestigious dealers and keep away from places that claim to have abundant offerings from the 17th or 18th century. Some price negotiation is acceptable.

HEADLINE: Anecdotes in Wood, Paint and Cast Iron


BYLINE: 
By Kathering Ashenburg; Katherine Ashenburg, who often writes about architecture, is the editor of the Arts and Books section of The Globe and Mail in Toronto.

 BODY:
The clerk in the well-stocked Point-a-Pitre bookstore smiled at me when I asked if he had any books on the island's architecture. ''One does not visit Guadeloupe for the buildings,'' he said. Probably not, in most cases. But even on a tropical island blessed with beaches, Brobdignagian flora and a usually dormant volcano, the houses tell graphic and often delightful stories.
The styles of France and Africa, the constant threat of hurricanes and earthquakes, the economies of plantation life, attitudes about death, trading links with New Orleans - all these and more are in Guadeloupe's buildings for the reading. Not sermons in stone, but certainly anecdotes in wood, paint and that most beloved of Caribbean roofing materials, corrugated iron.
Architecture writers (including the authors of ''Caribbean Style,'' published by Clarkson N. Potter) trace the humblest of Guadeloupe's buildings, the case (popular house), to African slaves imported to work the coffee and sugar cane plantations in the 17th century. These unprepossessing structures, whose dark interiors are typical of houses of the poor in hot climates, are everywhere on Guadeloupe, from the hilly villages of Basse-Terre (the western island) to the towns and countryside of Grande-Terre, the more populated eastern island. 
In essence a wooden cube whose sides can be as small as three to five yards, the case exists in some form on all the Caribbean islands. On Guadeloupe, the traditional house contains from one to three rooms; its corrugated iron roof may be flat or gently pitched. In either case, the roof is always nailed to the frame in a deliberately gingerly fashion, so that very powerful winds can shear it off neatly without damaging the house itself. (And it works, judging by the number of new roofs on old houses seen on a post-Hurricane Hugo visit last February.) The Guadeloupean case is often set on stone blocks, partly to minimize contact with termites and centipedes, and partly to make house moving easier. Guadeloupeans own the houses but rarely the land. When the lease on the land is up (or, as often happened in former times, the owner of the case was needed to work a distant field), the little house is simply put on a wagon or truck and transported to its next destination.
One can dismiss the case as dilapidated and primitive; indeed, the British writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, wandered around the outskirts of Guadeloupe's biggest town, Point-a-Pitre in the late 1940's, and the size and shape of the houses reminded him of ''derelict confessional boxes,'' he said in his book ''The Traveler's Tree.'' While Guadeloupeans enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean, many continue to live in cases, perhaps because most island living is done out of doors.
The case can afford unexpected pleasure to sympathetic eyes. When something is stripped to its essentials, the subtle variations - the scalloped edge on a veranda, the pitch of a roof, the regular rhythm of shuttered French doors - take on a powerful charm.
What strikes most visitors first on a walk through a village such as Ste.-Anne or St.-Francois or driving through the outlying sections of Point-a-Pitre is the Guadeloupeans' canny use of color. Some cases are still unpainted and their weather-beaten boards have their own silvery beauty, but when house paint became widely available in the Caribbean between the two world wars, the islanders discovered a most congenial medium.
There are regional differences: Haitians favor frenetic shades like orange and turquoise and the English islanders prefer primary colors, while the French islanders on Martinique and Guadeloupe admire what they call tendres couleurs.
The tender (or, less romantically, pastel) colors of Guadeloupean cases include melting ice cream tones of peppermint pink, lemon, creme de menthe and cafe au lait. The trim on shutters, frames and doors is often brighter and unexpected - eggplant for a pale blue house, a knowing combination of aquamarine, sky blue and black for a white house.
Another inexpensive way to beautify these tiny boxes came by way of a 19th-century American invention, the jigsaw. Whenever possible, a case has a veranda, and the jigsaw brought forth the veranda's trim on the posts - the cutout suns, moons and flowers that encourage breezes while filtering sunlight. When cutout trim is too expensive, something of the same airy, perforated effect is achieved with decorative concrete blocks.
Guadeloupeans are sternly protective of the privacy of their case and may look up threateningly at a tourist who so much as glances in the open French doors. It's possible to get some sense of the proportions and dimness of a case, albeit a converted one, on the outskirts of Point-a-Pitre on the main road from Ste.-Anne. On the left as you approach the city, in the middle of a long row of workers' houses, the sign outside a beige house says ''Bibliotheque Municipal'' (Municipal Library). When I stepped inside, books were ranged methodically along the dark walls, a stern librarian sat behind a vase of tropical flowers, and a lone little boy was reading ''Tintin.''
As families grew more prosperous and added rooms, the case merged into the low-slung veranda-encircled house found in hot countries around the world. The owners of Guadeloupe's plantations lived in enlarged versions of this informal style, or in houses that recalled French farmhouses or manor houses. Most of the island's plantation houses have either disappeared or are inaccessible, hidden behind vast hedges of croton or hibiscus or dimly glimpsed at the end of an avenue of palms.
The easiest plantation house to see from the outside (privately owned and not open to the public) is Zevalos on the road between St.-Francois and Le Moule on the eastern side of Grande-Terre. However, Zevalos is highly uncharacteristic. Legend has it that the house's prefabricated cast-iron frame was made in the late 19th century in Gustave Eiffel's Paris workshop and destined for Louisiana. When the ship transporting the frame ran into trouble near Guadeloupe, the director of the sugar plantation at Zevalos bought the elements and built himself a house amid the fields of cane. Today the fields have given way to suburban houses, but Zevalos remains - a two-story exercise in cast-iron lace that looms up dramatically from the flatlands of Grande-Terre.
The actual house, of yellow bricks, is deliberately upstaged by the curlicues and arabesques of the white-painted iron veranda and balcony that wrap around it. Time has robbed Zevalos of its proper setting, but even so it looks strangely citified and imperturbably French with its dormer windows, tiled roof and symmetrical French doors. Its size, its detail and its undeniable elegance are impressive, but Zevalos also looks, well, prefabricated.
The only other building on Guadeloupe of this type, the St.-John Perse Museum (9 Rue de Nozieres, Point-a-Pitre) is much more appealing. Smaller and surrounded by a lush little garden, it looks surprisingly at home on its city street close to the market. Surprising because the museum is unabashedly fantastic. Unlike at Zevalos, its exaggeratedly overhanging balcony, also made of prefabricated cast iron, is not balanced by a veranda on the first floor, and this top-heavy effect gives the house the look of a Swiss chalet realized in pastels and transported to the tropics.
It's Swiss too in its neatness and passion for decorative detail: beside the lacy cast iron, the accessories here include scalloped tin borders, white wooden trim that aspires to the condition of eyelet embroidery, rosettes, medallions and Moorish tiles. As at Zevalos, the house is yellow brick and the cast-iron parts are white, but a lavish use of aquamarine trim adds to its festive air. Guadeloupe's best-known poet, St.-John Perse (1887-1975) was born on a nearby street when this house was relatively new, and today the museum houses an island drawing room furnished with 19th-century artifacts, changing exhibitions and a breezy attic reading room with books by and about the poet.
Another Point-a-Pitre museum, the Schoelcher Museum (24 Rue Peynier), is also a fantasy, a Beaux-Arts jewel box that was built in 1887. Victor Schoelcher was a Frenchman largely responsible for freeing the slaves in the French West Indies, so it seems partly ironic, partly appropriate that the museum dedicated to his life and achievements is an architectural copybook of ornate Franco-classical motifs. Columns, pilasters, urns, wreaths, swags, filigree balconies and gates are knit together in a building that should be pompous but only manages to be irresistible. Its charm is partly due to its unerring proportions, partly to its color: how can you be intimidated by a museum the color of strawberry sherbet, with pistachio trim? Patrick Leigh Fermor disliked Point- a-Pitre more every day he was there, describing it as an accumulation of shacks and comparing its central streets to the ''more squalid thoroughfares of Salonika.''
He was needlessly harsh. If Gabriel Garcia Marquez wrote in French instead of Spanish, Point-a-Pitre would be the kind of romantically decrepit town where his characters might act out their half-glamorous, half-seedy fates with ease. Few of Point-a-Pitre's buildings date from before 1845, when an earthquake destroyed much of the town, and the central streets around the Place de la Victoire and the Cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul are lined with cheerful 19th-century townhouses. Their cast-iron balconies are reminiscent of New Orleans's French Quarter, which is only natural given the 19th-century commercial links between the two French-speaking ports. But the jaunty, rather raffish neighborhood, with its paradoxical air of languid purposefulness and its shifting affinities - now with France, now with Africa, always with the tropics - is very much Guadeloupe.
The Guadeloupean touch with color is also evident here, from the yellow and white double-balconied Maison Hayot, at the northwest corner of the Place de la Victoire, to a very smart, very citified blue, cream and pink town house one house away from the northeast corner of the same square.
The Place de la Victoire, with its solemn sandbox trees, government buildings and statues of local heroes, is Point-a-Pitre's civic showplace, and the houses bordering it are necessarily the town's spiffiest. A few blocks away, in the streets around the cathedral - Rue Lamartine, Rue Alsace-Lorraine, Rue Bebian - the atmosphere is more relaxed. The cathedral's Spanish stucco facade is the color of mango sherbet; inside, thanks to its cast-iron skeleton and wooden roof, its palette is cool, nearly monochromatic.
The owners of the neighboring townhouses were less restrained, trimming a mint green house with orange, lining pale gray doors with the creamy peppermint pink that is one of Guadeloupe's signature colors. The generous S-brackets supporting the balconies, the Gothic arches or curlicues on the balcony railings, even the accommodating curve with which a building rounds the corner soften the two- or three-story houses' vertical lines. The ground floors are generally commercial space and those above domestic. The details grow more delicate as the eye ascends upward, from the massive rounded doors on the main floor to the 19th-century cutout trim and decorative tin borders on the upper floors.
In common with other Caribbean islands, Guadeloupe reserves its most varied and playful architecture for the dead. The cemetery at Ste.-Anne is characteristic: as you approach the village on the main road from Point-a-Pitre, suddenly a miniature city crowded with cathedrals, classical temples and chunky modernist structures climbs a hill on your left. It's a boldly black and white necropolis, the family vaults patterned with ceramic tiles in diamonds, stripes and checkerboards, almost as if a tiny city planner had gotten a great deal on bathroom tiles.
THE hilly little streets in Ste.-Anne's cemetery are crammed with more architectural styles than living Guadelopeans can claim. The mausoleums are crammed too, with ceramic crucifixes bursting with roses and pansies, portraits of the departed, real and plastic flowers, tall red glass vigil candles, plaques marked ''Regrets'' or ''Notre Mere.'' But the scene is far from lugubrious; it's domestic, even cheerful. In one tiny cathedral, large formal portraits of a couple - he in his best suit, she holding an immense handbag and wearing the traditional foulard (madras scarf) - flank an altar with a crucifix, several statues and a plaque in their honor. A mop and cleaning materials stand in one corner, and there's a bench where friends and family can relax.
A group of women and girls on an early morning visit entered the cemetery, chatting and laughing, as we were leaving. Gaudelopeans dislike being photographed and often shake a warning finger at cameras, but I needn't have worried about their reaction to ours. The oldest of the lot nodded approvingly and hoped we had made some nice pictures: ''C'est joli, n'est-ce pas?'' We agreed: it was indeed pretty.

HEADLINE: About Men;
The Quick, the Dead

BYLINE: By Mark McGurl; Mark McGurl is on the staff of The New York Review of Books.

 BODY:
The year my family invested in Florida real estate I decided the world was meaningless. I had nothing in particular against Florida, or investments for that matter - I simply happened to be 15. It was a hormonal kind of thing.
I took the insight seriously, though. I reduced my repertoire of facial expressions to two: scowl for nighttime, smirk for day. I chucked the colorful parts of my wardrobe, draped my limbs in dogmatic black. I wandered the earth, or more accurately the town in New Hampshire where I lived, and I showered it with contempt. I prayed, casually, for clouds and rain. For floods. Earthquakes. I also prayed, somewhat hypocritically, that my voice wouldn't crack in class and that the girl with the red notebook wouldn't notice that my nose had reached adult proportions a few years in advance of the rest of my face.
The investment in Florida was one my father would later regret. In the meantime, though, we had what was, for us, a shocking luxury: a fairly slick apartment high up in a building on the beach. We installed ourselves there to celebrate a tropical Christmas. 
From the balcony, one had the impression of being at the bridge of a very tall ship; the azure sweep of the Atlantic halted, invisibly, somewhere beneath your feet and the whole world seemed water. When the clouds hugged the shore, you could glimpse, in the distance, swatches of ocean where the sun still peeked through. Beyond the horizon somewhere was Haiti, and beyond that, France, Zanzibar, Afghanistan. An embracing immensity. I might even have found it comforting. The afternoon I arrived, I stood on the balcony and pronounced the vista meaningless.
I soon settled into a vacation torpor. I woke up past noon, ate some doughnuts, fell asleep again. I thus avoided many unnecessary conversations. I emerged from the apartment in late afternoon. By then the temperature had cooled a bit, the light had softened and the honeysuckle was releasing its perfume in earnest. Walking down the road to the 7-Eleven to buy breakfast - a Slurpee and some Milk Duds -I nearly gave way to transcendence. I resisted.
And then, one evening, a tremendous storm. Our building, one apartment thick, shuddered clear through with every thunderclap. As I peered out the glass doors over the balcony, the sea seemed to have swollen malevolently, overfed by the rain.
Beach-front property suddenly didn't seem such a luxury. Perhaps thinking this very thought, my parents turned in early. For my part, I did not believe in the possibility of my own death, so I stepped out onto the balcony as soon as I heard their door shut. The world was angry. Holding onto the railing, slapped by the wind, I stood mesmerized by the sea. The last glow of dusk had been extinguished, and the water surged in various dark shapes. Leaning over, squinting against the rain, I could see straight down to the beach, where there was some light; the surf crashed a few feet from the first floor of the building, sending up a spray of luminous white. In the spray I spotted a flash of yellow. Whatever it was, it seemed substantial, but it was hard to tell in the darkness. I watched it for a long time, then decided it was driftwood.
In fact, as I later learned, it was the wreckage of an old boat, which, until the storm hit, had been afloat a few miles off the coast, headed to shore. It had been filled with Haitian men and women at tempting a night passage to a land with an economy that could support them.
I woke up surprisingly early the next morning. I went down to walk along the beach. The sky was a piercing, perfect blue, and the ocean had receded to an apologetic calm. The sand was littered with junk of every sort: shoes, Clorox bottles, a mangled life vest. I was half-looking for the big yellow thing, about which I was still curious, but it appeared to have floated elsewhere. I had the beach to myself.
Up ahead I saw something tumble forward in the surf, tumble back with the wave's retraction. I started forward to investigate. It was the body of a man. By the time I got to him, he was free of the water, warming in the sun. He was a large man, naked above the waist, clothed below in green polyester bell-bottoms. While the rest of his body was brown, his face was eerily white, and swollen. His eyes, mercifully, were closed.
What I remember above all was his stillness. In a childhood game you can, if you try, still your breathing remarkably. You can play dead, and for an instant your friends will be scared. If they keep staring, however, they will notice a tiny heaving in your chest, and they will laugh. They will prod you until you laugh as well. This man's chest was utterly still. I watched it for several seconds, focused in. My eyes, through pure force of habit, kept expecting to see him move. Perhaps from staring so hard, I grew slightly dizzy. All of a sudden I felt very young; I wanted help.
Six or seven bodies washed up on the beach over the course of the morning, but after the first one there was always a crew of men with gaffing poles and body bags ready to clear them away.
A small group of people, mostly residents of my building, gathered on the sand to watch. Instinctively, I joined them. I thus learned the origin of the yellow driftwood. Haiti was poor, the onlookers said, it was ''third world.'' People practiced voodoo there and had a bad government. I accepted all this, though I remember being perplexed that such a desperate place could be just over the horizon. There was talk of a meaningful irony: of aiming for the Gold Coast, and getting there, but getting there dead. A grim parody of a sunbather. Although I didn't fully understand what was being said, the important thing was that someone nearby was succeeding in making sense of it all, talking the horror down to size.
There was some compassion in what the adults I stood with said, but there was also a sense of great distance. Of course. The dead and the living, in this case, had never had much in common. As we talked, the scene before us seemed to flatten out, lose a dimension. I was not in the habit, back then, of falling into line with anything, but on this occasion something changed. The group's perceptions became, suddenly, my own: I was watching misfortune, not participating in it. In exchange for my pretentions to complete independence I was given something a little more realistic - the independence of one group - those who are safe - from another - those who aren't.
By nighttime I considered myself a minor expert on Haitian affairs. At the dinner table, I waxed sociological, repeating to my parents what I had heard on the beach, as though the words were my own. I guess you'd call this ''acting like a grown-up.'' The expression describes with unusual precision what I did that afternoon and evening, and what I would do more and more as years passed, until I had learned my lines by heart and was no longer really acting.

HEADLINE: On Language;
Acronym Power

BYLINE: By Jack Rosenthal; Jack Rosenthal is the editorial page editor of The New York Times. William Safire is on vacation.

 BODY:
One way to stand out in a world swimming in mere abbreviations is to assemble the letters into pronounceable words. As several recent examples show, acronyms fall into distinct categories.
The most obvious reason to coin an acronym is mnemonic, to make a term easy to remember. Mothers Against Drunk Driving are plenty MADD. Students Against Driving Drunk are surely SADD. They have now been joined by a group of black fathers in Omaha eager to provide role models for their sons. Men Against Destruction/Defending Against Drugs and Social-Disorder are Mad Dads.
There is an obvious danger in straining for acronyms. An editorial in The Times once sighed that perhaps the time had come to create, for the name alone, the Action Committee to Reform Our Nation's Youth Morals. 
Other acronyms provide shorthand for technical terms. The Pentagon has turned this kind of acronymics into an art form. Slickem, Glickem and Mirv - the terms sound more like a law firm than the vocalized names of missiles. SLCM's are sea-launched cruise missiles; GLCM's are their ground-launched cousins, and MIRV's (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles) are long-range missiles with more than one warhead. Such terms, like laser and scuba, eventually become so commonplace as words that we forget their acronymic origin. (Laser: light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation; scuba: self-contained underwater breathing apparatus.) Modern electronics offers some arresting new shorthand, like LUTS, which stands for ''light units, Times Square.'' Question: How much is a LUTS? Answer: It's equivalent, its creators say, to 85 foot-lamberts. Question: So, how much is a foot-lambert? Answer: The amount of brightness radiated from each square foot of area as measured from street level. Question: Yes, but why does anyone care? Answer: Because the underlying concern here is that the Great White Way remain light and lively. That's why New York City requires special lights and signs for the new buildings already soaring along Broadway and Seventh Avenue and on the towers soon to rise in the massive 42d Street redevelopment project.
Mitts is another acronym spawned by modern technology. It stands for ''minutes of telecommunications traffic,'' a statistic to measure voice, fax and data transmission on public circuits to other countries. It's the idea of Gregory Staple and Mark Mullins, consultants to the International Institute of Communications in London. Who has the most Mitts? The United States, with so many phones, has the largest total - 5.3 billion in 1988. But on a per capita basis, the United States ranks only ninth, well after Hong Kong, Singapore and (because of its many calls to the United States) Canada.
While some acronyms are shorthand for the technically complex, others are shorthand for the socially profound. Not mere cute fads, they provide useful and convenient ways to describe widely experienced realities. That makes them more truly new words, likely to last.
Nimby - ''not in my backyard'' - has been familiar in New York since the mid-1980's, but now it is becoming understood everywhere, because it describes attitudes expressed everywhere, whether by neighbors upset by the prospect of a shelter for the homeless in suburban New York or a new airport in exurban Denver. The neighbors, these days, are much less likely to submit to municipal authority with docile good citizenship.
Another such acronym is Gomer - for ''get out of my emergency room.'' It's not a new term. Medical insiders' lingo, it refers to whining, undesirable patients. More recently, however, the term has taken on a particular meaning, referring to old, poor patients. As pressure to curtail medical costs increases and as the number of inner-city physicians diminishes, more ailing old people are likely to struggle to get to hospital emergency rooms, and more attendants are apt to think, if not say, Gomer.
Nimby and Gomer have several points in common. Both seem to have survived the 1980's and made their way into the language. And both terms may indirectly typify the 1980's. They both involve exclusion, and they have the letter M in common: M as in ''my.''
 
THE LAST, AH, WORD
Just as new names and new concepts generate occasional new words, an underlying imperative of language regularly pumps them up also: the desire to be novel, expressive and colorful.
A circular example is neat! In the 1950's, it was the youthful word of choice to express superlative approval. That changed to terrific, pronounced TRIF-fack by the New Frontiersmen in the 60's. Then came super, which yielded in turn to EX-cellent. What is it now? Students home from five colleges in the Northeast report that EX-cellent endures, but a new in word is also heard: neat!
Several other neologisms have endured long enough to take seriously:
Blowing off. This started as a collegiate term meaning ''ducking'' or ''avoiding.'' Now it has entered political speech and taken a bow on page 1 of The Washington Post. Here is Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, the public-interest lobby, talking in February about questionable campaign finance practices: ''Both Democrats and Republicans acted in a way that is blowing off what parties can do in House races.''
Random. A collegiate term that has become a staple of speech in Boston-area schools and elsewhere is used as an adjective and as a noun. As an adjective, it retains its usual meaning of ''haphazard'' or ''purposeless,'' but it's also used to mean ''ambiguous,'' as in ''That sure was a random movie.'' As a noun, it describes miscellaneous people or activities, as in ''Who was at the party?'' ''Oh, randoms.'' Or ''What did you guys do last night?'' ''Oh, random.''
Outing. A harsh tactic that bears no relation to a picnic in the park. The term describes the efforts by some gay people to disclose the secret homosexuality of public figures. It is derived from ''coming out of the closet,'' the act of publicly acknowledging one's homosexuality. Some writers for gay publications defend outing as a way to assail public officials who are privately homosexual but present themselves as homophobic. Others denounce the tactic as an intolerable invasion of privacy.
Spending down. This social-welfare term describes what is often a nightmare for older adults whom society deems not yet poor enough. It refers to what they must do with their assets - in some cases, even selling their home - before Medicaid will pay for long-term nursing care.
Word or Word up. These are terms popularized in rap music that mean ''truly,'' ''honestly,'' as in the expression ''you have my word.'' The term has been popular in black and youth culture for some time. ''Word Up'' is the title song of an album by Cameo issued in 1986 (''Come on, ba-by, tell me what's the word - A word up'').
Now the term has broken out into more general use - in a Pepsi-Cola television commercial by BBDO Worldwide. It is performed by Young MC, a rap performer and Grammy Award winner who has a degree in economics from the University of Southern California.
The ad, called ''Cool Cans,'' provides printed translations of the rap. For example, he chants: ''So yo! Stop kicking. Your pace better quicken/Before they run out or your clock stops ticking.'' Translation: ''Get this limited edition while supplies last.'' The closing reverses this patter pattern. Young MC says, in standard parlance, ''Really, I'm not kidding.'' The translation this time: ''He says, 'Word Up!' ''
And that, word up, is the last word.

HEADLINE: Why Rabbit Had to Go

BYLINE: By JOHN UPDIKE; John Updike's novel ''Rabbit at Rest'' will be published in October.

 BODY:
''Rabbit AT Rest'' will be the fourth and last of my so-called Rabbit books. Each of them occurs in the ninth year of a decade and was written, more or less, in the ninth year of the decade.
The first one, ''Rabbit, Run,'' was written in 1959 with no thought of there being a sequel. It was composed by a youngish man, 27 I believe I was, who had received a Guggenheim grant by promising to write a novel - hence, having accepted the grant, I felt obliged to write the book. I had published one previous, quite short novel, ''The Poorhouse Fair.'' My sense of myself was of a sort of sprinter. My name, if known, was known by way of contributions to The New Yorker magazine. My original concept had been to write two novellas, to be bound into one volume, which would contrast two approaches to the game of life: one would be the rabbit approach, a kind of dodgy approach - spontaneous, unreflective, frightened, hence my character's name, Angstrom - and the second was to be the horse method of coping with life, to get into harness and pull your load until you drop. And this was eventually ''The Centaur.'' But I began the rabbit book first. 
It was subtitled, in my conception of it, ''A Movie''; I imagined the opening scene as something that would happen behind credits, and I saw the present tense of the book as corresponding to the present tense in which we experience the cinema. There is no real past in the movies; things happen, one after the other, right there in front of us. The present tense, in the late 50's, was not at all a common device in American fiction. The only instance that I had encountered was in a novel by Joyce Cary, the British writer, called ''Mister Johnson,'' about an African civil servant. I don't know if it's remembered or forgotten, but it's a wonderful book, one of the best novels about Africa - certainly one of the best books written by a white man about Africa that there is. I have been told since that Damon Runyon wrote in the present tense, but for me Joyce Cary opened the door.
I discovered as I began to write how delicious the present tense is. Instead of writing ''she said and he said'' it's ''he says and she says,'' and not ''he jumped'' at some past moment, but ''he jumps,'' right now in front of you. Action takes on a wholly different, flickering quality; thought and feeling and event are brought much closer together.
And so the present tense proved to be a happy one and I wrote on and on in a little room in the corner of East Street and County Road in Ipswich, Mass., a town I'd moved to in an attempt to get away from the charms and distractions of New York City. I was there provisionally, seeing if I could be a freelance writer. I had had a job in New York, I had done my New York thing, I could tell Uptown from Downtown, I had undergone the Manhattan initiation rites that writers should undergo, and was up in New England experimentally, out on a limb as it were. I sat in that little room, the old sewing room, looking out at a very complex telephone pole, and the excitement of writing a novel was so great for me that my feet, in scuffing, wore two bare spots on the floor, which might still be there.
Anyway, I completed the book; it was indeed a full-length book, too full-length to include with the horse novel, which I then made into another separate book. And that of course is the way we accumulate a shelf of books, every idea subdivides and becomes two and then four, and in that manner you can have written 37 books and not have had very many ideas.
''Rabbit, Run'' was published, with mild sales, fair reviews. People asked me about the ending; they found it ambiguous. What really happened? The hero is last seen running. I thought that Rabbit's immersion in the blind act of running was a sufficient ending for the novel; it didn't occur to me we needed to know more about this man.
But the decade passed, a decade that brought me good news and bad, and that brought the country a lot of news. The 60's were an exceedingly newsworthy decade, from John F. Kennedy's assassination on. A lot of things happened, things that were more or less distressing to Americans older than 30.
I had written a book called ''Couples,'' which had sold enough to make me feel entitled to write a long poem, all about myself, under the false impression that that would be interesting to people. But I made the useful discovery that in fact an author is interesting only as a storyteller, only as the conduit whereby certain imaginary events get onto the page. And so my long poem about myself, called ''Midpoint,'' fell quietly into the void - more quietly than a stone down a well, which at least does make a sort of little plip.
It was then my notion to complete a kind of Pennsylvania tetralogy. I'd written a book that took place in the future, ''The Poorhouse Fair,'' one that took place in the immediate present, ''Rabbit, Run,'' one that took place in the remembered past, ''The Centaur,'' and I wanted to write a historical novel about James Buchanan, Pennsylvania's only President - a fascinating man, at least to me. I did so much research I began to dream about him. One day I woke up and told my wife, ''James Buchanan is my best friend.''
Well, it was one thing to fall in love with James Buchanan but another to try to write a historical novel. I found that I couldn't bring myself to do all the fakery necessary in writing a historical novel. Never having lived in a log cabin, I found myself inhibited about describing one; never having participated in a Washington 19th-century political parley, I found myself at a loss to imagine exactly what went on. Even things like buggies and spittoons loomed as mysterious. So I found myself balked in the attempt to write the Buchanan novel and I finally made it into a play, putting upon the director and the set designer all these difficult particulars that eluded me.
By now it was high time for me to write a novel. I had made a deal with myself at the beginning of this freelance career I've spoken of: I would give my publishers, to make up for the losses they'd suffered on the intervening books, a novel every other book, with collections of something or other in between. So the rhythm would go, presumably, loss, small gain, loss, small gain. It was novel time, and Buchanan hadn't worked out as a hero.
And there was all this distress around me - Vietnam distress, race riots, marches, agitation of all sorts. Suddenly it seemed to me that Rabbit Angstrom of Pennsylvania, about whose future some people had expressed curiosity, might be the vehicle in which to package some of the American unease that was raging all around us. And so I wrote ''Rabbit Redux.'' It felt good to be back in the present tense and good to try to locate in this small section of southeastern Pennsylvania echoes and ramifications of the national and international disturbances that were so preoccupying in the late 60's.
Having composed, then, one sequel, and having had the sequel fairly well received, obliged me, it seemed, to write another; one sequel leads to another. A motive of the artistic life, after all, is the completion of sets. That childhood instinct we have to make collections, to tidy up and round out, affects adult enterprises as well.
But in the meantime, I had a whole decade to live, on my own track. People would ask me, ''What's Harry doing?'' as though he was a real person, but I had no idea what he was doing. For one thing, I lived in Massachusetts and he was living in Pennsylvania. I didn't even know he'd become a car dealer.
When the time came, when 1979 came - each novel, by the way, was written in a different house, as it turned out, at a different address - I was in a different town, I had a different wife, a different sense of myself. I was full of beans, really, looking back on it from my present relatively beanless condition. I was in my mid-40's, just a kid. The town we lived in, I should say, was away from the sea and in size and social atmosphere reminded me of the town in Pennsylvania, Shillington, that I had grown up in. The house was even the same shape - long and narrow, with a deep backyard. From the room I wrote in, I saw rows of yellow school buses. I was at home in America, all right.
I needed a hook, into 1979. I mean, what can you say? Although the first novel had had a few overheard news items in it, it wasn't really in a conscious way about the 50's. It just was a product of the 50's; it was a helplessly 50's kind of book written by a sort of helplessly 50's guy. The 60's were much more self-conscious, much more conscious of themselves as a decade. The 70's seemed somewhat amorphous.
But we happened to be in Pennsylvania, staying with some friends of my wife's, and it was June, and there was some anxiety about our getting away because there were terrible gas lines all over the state. And my host was so hostly, or else so keen on our departure, that he rose very early in the morning and got in my car and went and waited in a gas line to get me gas to get out of there. So the gas crunch became my hook: running out of gas, which is the first phrase in ''Rabbit Is Rich.'' The general sense of exhaustion, inflation, Jimmy Carter's fainting during one of his trots - all that seemed to add up to a national picture.
The paradox was that although the theme was running out of gas, I was feeling pretty good. And so the book is kind of an upbeat book in spite of itself. It's really a cheerful book, very full, it seems to me insofar as I can be a critic, of itself and its material. I really had to cut it short at the end - it was threatening to go on forever. Tennyson said what he wanted was a novel that would go on forever, but it's not what I want. So I moved briskly to the arrival of Angstrom's granddaughter in his arms; the book is really about his becoming a grandfather, written years before I myself became one. He is rich in a number of ways, and discovers of course that to be rich is just another way of being poor, that your needs expand with your income and the world eventually takes away what it gives.
But it's a big, basically bouncy book that won prizes. Why some books win prizes and others don't is a mystery. In part it was that by this time, I'd been around so long, and was obviously working so hard, that people felt sorry for me and futhermore hoped that if Rabbit and I received a prize we would go away and put an end to this particular episode in American letters. But no, I've felt obliged to produce a fourth!
Again, I groped for the hook. It was quite easy to have a blank mind about the 80's; there was a distinct fuzziness about it. It was Ronald Reagan's decade and very cool, in the McLuhanesque sense, and all I really knew was that my hero would be 10 years older and probably feeling no better than I did, and maybe even a little worse - since he had peaked earlier than I did. I saw him in Florida. I thought a new state might perk up Rabbit readers. The Updikes - a branch of them, my father's brother and sister - went down to Florida in the 1920's when their own father, my grandfather, became ill with tuberculosis, and so Florida has some personal relevancy for me - a warm spot in my heart, you might say. Also, my mother for almost as long as I knew her had been trying to write a novel about the discoverer of Florida, Ponce de Leon. So I made some trips, in 1988 I think it must have been, to gather background.
I couldn't wait to begin the book; the opening of it occurs late in 1988, after the Presidential election and just after the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie. In writing, I several times had to stop to let real time catch up with my fictional time. The private events are the main thing, of course, but you don't want some public event, atomic war or a giant earthquake, to cancel the world and make everything anachronistic. A few months after I began, in April of 1989, my mother was hospitalized, and from then on I had to keep making trips to Pennsylvania to check on things. I had a hard time keeping momentum, and noticed in rereading, even on the last set of proofs, some repetitions and inconsistencies.
You might say it's a depressed book about a depressed man, written by a depressed man. Deciding to wind up the series was a kind of death for me. Even though I left Pennsylvania in the early 50's, as long as my parents were alive I had a living link with the state. My father died in 1972 but my mother lived on, and so I had continuing reasons to visit Rabbit's territory, to refresh my sense of it and check up on changes. But as she became older I saw that my link would end someday, and end with it my grip on Rabbit's world. My mother died in October, 10 days after I finished the first draft; her dying became interwoven with my own sense of aging and my hero's even more severe sense of aging.
Yet all those visits, to her in the hospital and out of it - I hadn't had such a strong dose of my native turf since leaving it for college. My fictional city of Brewer is, I guess it's no secret to say, based on Reading, in Berks County. And though I was raised in a suburb of Reading, I had never lived there, and putting Rabbit into Brewer in ''Rabbit, Run'' was actually an act of fantasy, something like the country of Kush in ''The Coup,'' and I got the geography all scrambled up, and it's all rather vague and, as it seemed to me at the time, enchanted. In ''Rabbit at Rest'' it's less vague - the area at last, in my taking leave of it, began to make sense.
Another reason for winding up: I felt that if I was going to make a kind of meganovel out of the series, and bring all the threads to a gathering, four novels was about the limit. We've all heard of tetralogies, but after that there's no word for it. And with sequels, there is an accumulation of loose threads, of characters you invented and used, so that the elements increase geometrically, and beyond four would become very messy. Even so, each Rabbit book has been longer than the preceding, and this is the longest.
The action ends in October; I used Hurricane Hugo to round out the climax, but of course the events that now seem important about 1989 - the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe - occurred quite late in the year. But Rabbit feels them coming - at one point he asks himself, ''If there's no Cold War, what's the point of being an American?'' His sense of being useless, of being pushed to one side by his wife and son, has this political dimension, then. Like me, he has lived his adult life in the context of the cold war. He was in the Army, ready to go to Korea, hawkish on Vietnam, proud of the moon shot, and in some sense always justified, at the back of his mind, by a concept of freedom, of America, that took sharpness from contrast with Communism. If that contrast is gone, then that's another reason to put him, regretfully, to rest in 1990.
This essay is adapted from remarks made before the American Booksellers Association convention in Las Vegas in June.

To the Editor:
Perhaps I should be grateful to Andrew Hacker for mentioning my book ''Preferential Policies'' (July 1) during his long editorial on affirmative action. However, I must reply to his sheer invention of ''Mr. Sowell's contention that the ways groups get distributed are largely a matter of choice'' - an invention that sets up his cheap shot that my position leads to the conclusion that a predominantly black custodial work force at Queens College would indicate ''black people prefer sweeping up.'' 
Contrary to Mr. Hacker's remark, ''Preferential Policies'' - like all my other books on race and ethnicity - argues that there are innumerable factors determining economic outcomes. For example, on page 129 I refer to ''the many variables determining the interest, skill, and performance of those individuals from various groups who are being considered for particular jobs, roles, or institutions.'' After discussing two of these factors, I then refer to ''innumerable other factors, of varying degrees of complexity and influence.'' Did Mr. Hacker not read that far? Or did he find it necessary to reduce a serious, painful and dangerously polarizing social issue to a false dichotomy between ''choice'' and racial discrimination?
Nor does it help matters for Mr. Hacker to make the lofty but confused statement that ''the line between choice and constraint is seldom distinct.'' There is no such line, distinct or indistinct: all choices are made within constraints. The nature and variety of those constraints, the nature and variety of the incentives at work and the nature and variety of the groups involved are what ''Preferential Policies'' is all about - not Mr. Hacker's cheap dichotomy.

To the Editor:
As an African-American who worked at the United States Consulate in Madras, India, for four years, I feel compelled to respond to the terribly distorted parallel Thomas Sowell attempts to draw between the unique experience of the ''scheduled castes,'' or so-called untouchables, in India and that of affirmative action for African-Americans.
While Indira Gandhi was perhaps one of the most Machiavellian politicians I have ever observed up close, it is a credit to her administration that she (a light-skinned member of a privileged group) persistently pushed for an enlightened response to the deplorable economic and social conditions of the darker-skinned scheduled castes in her country. An estimated 500 million people in India still live in villages, and many of them are part of the scheduled castes. Did Mr. Sowell look closely at the rationale for reserving places at the universities for the darker-skinned ''untouchable'' applicants to Indian medical and engineering schools? If so, he would have found that the privileged classes can buy their way into and through these professional schools with rupees and dollars. In a nation where a servant must survive on $15 to $40 a month in wages, which is tantamount to economic bondage even in India, very few members of the scheduled castes have access to sufficient amounts of money to assure them a place in a medical or engineering school.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: House Auctions;
Stirring Up the Buyers in a Slow Market

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
The housing auctioneers put in a good day's work June 23 at the grand ballroom of the New York Hilton Hotel. With 800 people in the audience, 68 apartments at a condominium called Executive Plaza, at Seventh Avenue and 51st Street, went on sale.
They were the remaining inventory still held by the sponsor after a conversion of the 1,400-room Taft Hotel in 1986 to a mixed-use building. It has separate condominiums for stores and a seven-floor luxury hotel, now the Parc One, as well as a 445-room residential component.
''We built one of the finest hotels in New York City and the assumption was that the stuff upstairs would appreciate,'' said Andrew S. Goodstein, vice president of Goodstein Development Company, a partner in the sponsorship group. ''But when the market turned down we decided we might as well sell.'' 
Of the 68 units, with a total offering-plan price of $17 million, a total of 57 were sold at the auction for $9.3 million. That was 32 percent below the pre-auction offering prices, but enough to satisfy the sponsor, who held back only 11 apartments. ''People had been afraid to buy because they thought the market might drop further,'' Mr. Goodstein said. ''But seeing everybody bidding on the same unit assures the buyer of value.''
For buyers and seller alike, the Executive Plaza auction seems to have been a success. But there have been unsuccessful auctions as well, few buyers turn out, few bid, and the seller withdraws the units. Poorley conceived or designed housing is not necessarily going to attract competitive bidding at auction, although it might help establish what the true market for the housing is.
The longer-term question is whether the auctioneers will succeed in making the technique a fixture in American home sales once the market gains strength.
Some are trying, but it won't be easy. ''In general the public believes the auction is the ultimate fire sale,'' said Louis Goodkin, head of the Goodkin Research Group in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Fla., noting that they had been used extensively after the 70's slump in Florida real estate. About a third of the buyers were investors, ready to rent out the housing and await appreciation after the developer, or an institutional lender who had taken over the inventory, had given up.
Sellers themselves usually do not think of auctions as fire sales and auctioneers do not promote them that way. They are essentially trying to stir up excitement in a drab market. A sizable sale at a reasonable discount can provide more cash than the seller would get after a long holding period and expensive sales costs.
But some brokers believe that auctions could serve a wider and longer-term purpose. Perhaps they could be elevated to the status of art and antique auctions, which have hardly led to price depreciation for those products. It will not be easy, in American society. But the auctioneers, who typically earn a negotiated commission based on gross sales, like to look abroadf fror precedent.
Kenneth M. Lusht, chairman of the department of insurance and real estate at Pennsylvania State University, tells of house auctions in Melbourne, Australia, in a study sponsored by the National Association of Realtors.
Auctions there are held in established neighborhoods for property in high demand, he said. There is no announcement of what price a seller will accept, and he can refuse the best offer. The auction is used in rising markets by sellers to get better prices. Mr. Lusht found that prices averaged 7 percent higher in auction sales than in privately negotiated sales for similar houses.
''It's a Saturday morning sport it to go to the house and watch a $500,000 sale on the front lawn,'' he said. ''In the United States, the mindset is that if there's an auction, something is wrong. If people could be educated that an auction is not a distress sale and it would be used in active markets, then as far as I could tell it would benefit the seller.''
In New York City, the Corcoran Group and Halstead Properties would like to enlist high-priced properties in auction sales. Corcoran expects to hold an auction in October of 15 to 25 Manhattan condominiums that have asking prices of more than $1 million. It will avoid co-ops on the theory that resistance from boards of directors might complicate matters.
Halstead says it is exploring the possibility, gearing its approach to smaller apartments in newer condominiums with oung owners who need to move. ''We would agree with the sellers on a confidential reserve price,'' said Clark Halstead.
But these plans clearly are a response to the soft market. Barbara Corcoran, president of the Corcoran Group, said that the condominiums she plans to auction have been on the sales market for an average of six months. Most of the sellers are individuals still living in their apartments but eager to sell and move. They are asked to advance 1 percent of the asking sale price for the promotional fee for the auction.
The longer-term consequences of the use of auctions are disturbing to those interested in sustaining longterm home values. The general home-owning public no less than home builders have a stake in nurturing long-term appreciation in the face of cycles in the sales market.
Martin Berger, a principal in the Robert Martin Company of White Plains, one of Westchester's largest developers, said that auctions create instability and make people feel that what may be their main investment in life is insecure.
He criticizes developers for auctioning off property even in a soft market. ''In a soft market the last thing that anyone needs is an atmosphere of instability,'' he said.
But smaller builders with unsuccessful sales cannot necessarily hold out. Carrying their pitch to developers, auctioneers like Sheldon Good, the Chicago real-estate man who organized the Executive Plaza sale and many others nationally, says, ''Discounts off asking prices now can range between zero and 20 percent. In a slow market with the high cost of carrying property, in a year or two they'll need 50 to 60 percent discounts.''
At Executive Plaza, centralized location was a telling factor for a youthful, international buying clientele that probably does not intend to remain too many years using that location for a fulltime primary residence. The sale cost the sponsor $500,000 plus a negotiated commission, probably somewhat below the 6 percent of gross sales the auctioneer asks.
Abraham Eisner, executive vice president of Gelt Funding, which provided mortgages for most buyers, said that 30 of the 55 buyers it supplied with loans were either private investors or corporations seeking apartments for their transient people. Only 19 sales were made for owner-occupancy. Six of the purchasers were buying Manhattan apartments for occasional use.
Sometimes, auctions can stimulate sales in family housing as well. In Brooklyn, several thousand people turned out for an auction of 50 apartments by Sheldon Good in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn. They were in Borough Park Village, a 122-unit gut rehabilitation of five buildings on 51st and 52d Streets between 18th and 19th Avenues. Apartments had sold so well at $140 a square foot in 1986 that the sponsor raised them to $180 a square foot, said Shmuel Lefkowitz, president of Prime Resources Group, the selling agent. Sales slumped.
''Even in the summer of '87 the economy began going down,'' said Mr. Lefkowitz. But all 50 units sold in one auction at 25 percent to 35 percent below the book price. Four-bedroom, 1,800-square-foot apartments that had been offered for $312,000 typically went at auction for at about $230,000.
Borough Park Village exemplifies a development that even before the auction had attracted buyers. But it needed the stimulus of the auction approach to shove it out of the sales doldrum at realistically lower prices. The first 12 apartments were offered on an absolute basis, and the sponsor, satisfied with the prices, gradually offered the rest that was as the auction proceeded.
The successful auctions - the only ones the sellers are willing to talk about - have proven that there is a market ready to buy property. They have occurred in a weak market and probably will have the salutary effect of reducing inventory and laying the groundwork for greater firmness and stability to come.
But the longer term use of auctions in the marketing of houses to users seems more questionable. A house in its setting is a unique product. Most sellers will not want to take the risk or accept the expense of offering their houses for sale in such a process. And most buyers probably won't want to leave their decisions on where to live or when to move to the uncertainties of an auction process.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
The Art Of Politics Goes Abstract

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT gubernatorial races have generally been pretty straightforward affairs: two parties, two candidates; no muss, no fuss. Each side lined up, snarled a bit and retired to the voting booths, where Democrats usually voted Democratic, and Republicans lost.
This year, you can't track the permutations and possibilities without a scorecard. The theme, however, remains clear: nothing is quite what it was. For Democrats, Republicans and those somewhere between, the old equations about how one reaches the governor's chair have been complicated by new variables - from the mixed legacy of a departing incumbent, to the implications of an angry electorate and an ailing state economy, to an independent candidate who has party stalwarts rethinking their loyalties and priorities.
''It's uncharted territory,'' said Everett C. Ladd, a professor of political science at the University of Connecticut and the director of the university's Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. 
Former United States Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., of Greenwich, is generally considered a major source of the atmospheric disturbance that has sent so much of the old order flying. A Republican who jilted his party to run as an independent, Mr. Weicker has led the opinion polls since he joined the race and has garnered endorsements from people in both parties. His clarion call, in speeches throughout the state, is that voters should throw out the bath water and not worry too much who or what gets lost in the process.
''We have deregulated very many things,'' Mr. Weicker said recently. ''It's high time we deregulated politics.'' A monopoly on power by the two-party system, he said, has had the same effects that monopoly has in business: ''bad product and high prices.''
Bound up with Mr. Weicker's appeal, but separate from it, pollsters say, is a groundswell of anger and dismay among voters about taxes, the state's floundering economy and what people appear to feel is a decline in the state's quality of life. Gov. William A. O'Neill, who led the state through the 1980's, felt the wrath first, and he ultimately withdrew from the race for re-election in March, as his approval ratings plummeted.
The leading Democrat who is trying to succeed Mr. O'Neill, United States Representative Bruce A. Morrison, of Hamden, has been forced onto what he has conceded is something of a tightrope. His campaign has been based around encouraging voters to vent their feelings about the need for change, but not too much change. All Democrats should not take the blame, he argues, only the old ones, like Mr. O'Neill.
''There's a potential for conflict,'' Mr. Morrison said in discussing his message to voters. ''But my idea is that we need to get back to basics, what the Democratic party has stood for.''
The possibility of a state income tax has been a major theme of the Democrats' intraparty debate. Mr. Morrison, who is considered one of the most liberal members of the state's Congressional delegation, has spoken in favor of a progressive wage tax that would ease tax burdens on the poor. Mr. O'Neill, by contrast, stood staunchly against an income tax.
This summer, however, Mr. Morrison began to step away from an income tax, saying he would veto it unless it was proven to have the support of a majority of voters. Mr. O'Neill, on the other hand, has appeared to tacitly endorse the one candidate in the race who openly supports a wage tax, State Representative William J. Cibes Jr., of New London, who will face Mr. Morrison in the Democratric primary on Sept. 11.
 
'Force for Change'
Although Mr. O'Neill has not publicly endorsed Mr. Cibes, he has repeatedly called him a good and loyal friend whose efforts to be heard as a candidate should be supported. Members of the Governor's staff are also working on Mr. Cibes's behalf, as are the Governor's chief campaign fund-raisers.
Mr. Weicker, who remains a Republican while running under his owner Connecticut Party banner, has said he would endorse Mr. Morrison if he were not running himself.
The Republicans' candidate is Representative John G. Rowland, of Waterbury.
''Who is the force for change?'' asked Professor Ladd. ''Is it Wiecker, or Rowland, or in some sense is it Morrison? I think the race could be very volatile in those last weeks.''
He said he believes that the winner in November will likely be the candidate who most thoroughly convinces voters that new breezes will blow in Hartford, and that despite Mr. Weicker's lead in the polls, ''it's not clear yet how the impulse for change will attach itself.''
A poll released last week by the Roper Center's Institute for Social Inquiry indicated that the race has tightened. Of 500 residents statewide questioned between July 23 and July 30, 37 percent said they liked Mr. Weicker, down from 41 percent in mid- to late-June. Twenty percent said they supported Mr. Rowland, up from 11 percent in June.
 
Political Evolution
Mr. Morrison's support also increased, though by a smaller margin, to 13 percent of the respondants, up from 9 percent. Mr. Cibes fared even more poorly, with only 7 percent saying they would support him in a three-way race against Mr. Weicker and Mr. Rowland. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
Among the Republicans - the minority party in the state, with about 470,000 registered voters, compared with about 680,000 registered Democrats and 580,000 unaffiliated voters - there have also been plenty of signs that political life is evolving.
There have been party jumpers, party joiners and those who - against every grain of party tradition - say they want the Democrats to do well in November, because that might hurt Mr. Weicker, who has shown popularity among Democrats.
There also seems to be a bit of confusion: the Republican Party's state chairman, Richard Foley, argued for months that people who desert the party are turncoats who should no longer be trusted. Among those who came under particular fire was the Republican minority leader in the State Senate, Reginald J. Smith, of New Hartford, who went to work for Mr. Weicker.
Then, last month, Mr. Rowland decided he wanted a Democrat, Joan R. Kemler, for State Treasurer on his ticket. Ms. Kemler, who served as a temporary Treasurer under Mr. O'Neill in 1986, promptly changed her party affiliation. Then Mr. Foley said that Republicans should seek qualified people whereever it can find them and not be blinded by party labels.
A spokesman for Mr. Rowland, Jack R. Goldberg, said Ms. Kemler was chosen because she was the best person for the job, but he added that if Democratic voters are wooed into accepting Mr. Rowland's ticket as a hybrid, ''that would be fine.''
 
'Major Party' Status
Leaders of both traditional parties are wondering whether this year's three-way race could change Connecticut's political landscape, especially if Mr. Weicker should win by a large margin. If the Republican or Democratic candidate receives less than 20 percent of the general election vote, for example, his party would lose ''major party'' status under the state election law. For the losing party, that the blow could be devastating. Currently, in a town election, if a majority of voters approves a Republican ticket for the board of selectmen or the school board, the minority position on the board automatically goes to the Democrats.
If the Democrats or Republicans were squeezed under that 20 percent wire, Mr. Weicker's Connecticut Party, would become the state's new major party, entitled to a position on all those local boards.
''For both Republicans and Democrats, the priority is to beat Lowell Weicker,'' said Mr. Cibes's campaign manager, Jonathan Pelto, the former political director the state Democratic Party. ''With Mr. Weicker out of the way, the long-term threat is eliminated.''
On other hand, Mr. Pelto said he believes Mr. Weicker's candidacy has helped the Democrats in their hopes of retaining control of the General Assembly. With both Mr. Weicker and Mr. Rowland scrambling for campaign funds among Republicans, Mr. Pelto said, the pool of money available to Republican Assembly challengers has been cut.
''Six months ago, I would have said that the Democrats would have lost control of the Assembly,'' he said. ''Now I think they will probably remain in control.''

The Long Island Power Authority is the wrong agency, at the wrong time, doing the wrong job in an ineffectual and inefficient manner. The threat of taking over Lilco is no longer credible, and we certainly don't need the Long Island Power Authority to decommission Shoreham. 
The problem at Lilco now is a runaway management that subordinates the public interest to personal greed and the whimsical meanderings of an ever expanding ego.
Any company which, at about the same time, has the highest rates in the nation, a chief executive with salary and benefits to rival a maharajah, a reliability record approached only by ''wrong way Corrigan'' and an advertising budget that knows no bounds is a company out of control. All the press releases by Governor Cuomo, Mr. Kessel and the local politicians will not get it under control. The Public Service Commission is as useless as the Long Island Power Authority and the Consumer Protection Board.
What is needed is something like what the Municipal Assistance Corporation (Big Mac) was for New York City. We need legislation to set up an agency to oversee Lilco's budgets (including salaries, bonuses, pensions, consulting agreements and golden parachutes), enforce standards of service reliability and curb the excesses of Lilco's management. The rationale for such an arrangement would be the bail-out given so generously to Lilco by New York State. If we don't do this, we can anticipate that a runaway Lilco management will continue to suck the life out of Long Island's economy.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY OPINION;
Florio's Tax Changes: Courageous, but More Are Needed

BYLINE: By John Atlas; John Atlas of Montclair is a public-interest lawyer and co-chairman of New Jersey Citizen Action, a coalition of 65 civic, community and other groups, based in Hackensack.

 BODY:
IN the face of a huge deficit, a school finance crisis and a tax structure unfair to working families, Gov. Jim Florio's tax increase was an act of courage and leadership.
He broke with Democratic leaders across the country who have been too timid to challenge the Republican tax policies that favor the rich at the expense of nearly everyone else. Jim Florio may be the Roosevelt of the 90's, ushering in a new era of progressive reform.
As Governor, he inherited a tax system that taxed the middle class at a much higher rate than millionaires.
A recent study by Citizen for Tax Justice, a research group based in Washington, shows that a middle-income family of four (making about $53,000 a year) in New Jersey actually shells out a larger share of its income in state and local taxes than a family earning more than $900,000. The middle-class family pays 9.7 percent of its income in property, sales, excise and income taxes; the wealthy family pays only 8.2 percent of its income in these taxes. 
Meanwhile, low-income working families pay 12.7 percent of their total family income - 50 percent more than millionaires' tax rate.
In other words, the current state tax system takes its biggest bite out of families who are already being squeezed the hardest, those who find it tough just to pay the bills.
New Jersey's unfair system relies too much on regressive property and sales taxes. These are ''flat'' taxes that are not related to the ability to pay. The state's property tax rate is one of the highest in the country, hurting the middle-class homeowner. Meanwhile, the income tax rate on millionaires is one of the lowest in the nation.
Governor Florio's bold plan raises revenue from the well-to-do, who are currently paying far less state and local tax (as a share of income) than average working families.
It targets that money to finance education and to provide badly needed property tax relief for most New Jersey families. It also shifts financing responsibility for certain services (e.g., family support services) from localities to the state while implementing a property tax credit to provide relief to average-income homeowners. The Florio plan represents genuine leadership on tax reform. Entering office in January, Mr. Florio faced a daunting task trying to address the enormous state deficits, the need to pump new dollars into poor and middle-class school districts and the unfair tax system. His solution: tax the wealthiest New Jerseyans, the same folks who got a tax windfall under Ronald Reagan and who have paid so little at the state level. This initiative has earned Mr. Florio a national reputation as a bold, straight-talking leader.
Since 1968, Republicans have dominated national politics by wooing the middle class with populist attacks on inflation, social programs and so-called ''big government.''
Mr. Florio is trying to show the Democrats how to woo a new coalition that brings together the poor, the working class and the middle class. In doing so, he is seeking to overcome racial and cultural divisions that have separated working-class whites from minority voters and middle-class liberals.
Will the Governor emerge as the populist national figure blazing a path for a timid Democratic Party? The pendulum of American history is on his side. Political experts suggest that the era of the Reagan revolution is over.
But policy shifts are not inevitable. Those concerned about education, the environment, public ethics, homelessness, civil rights, affordable health care, a fair tax system and closing the gap between rich and poor have a stake in Mr. Florio's success. The eyes of the nation will be watching New Jersey to see if his policies work, politically as well as economically.
Mr. Florio's plan is not perfect, though it stands as the best that could be accomplished now. A better plan would be more progressive and provide more property tax relief.
Despite criticism from conservatives, the Florio plan makes a very regressive system somewhat less regressive.
Under the Florio plan, the richest families are still taxed at a rate that is less than that of the poor. The richest 1 percent of New Jerseyans will pay 11.3 percent of family income; the poor will pay 12.8 percent.
The gap is even wider when Federal income tax deductions for state and property taxes (a benefit that accrues only to homeowners who itemize) are included. The total burden on the poor (who do not itemize) stays at 12.8 percent while falling to 8.8 percent for the $900,000-a-year family.
A better plan, like the one proposed by New Jersey Citizen Action, a nonprofit organization whose purpose is to increase citizen participation in government, would do the following:
* Furnish more property tax relief by providing for state financing of the judiciary, which is now paid for out of local property taxes. The Governor's plan does not provide state financing.
* Adopt a tax credit of up to $750 for both homeowners and tenants, which kicks in whenever property taxes exceed 4 percent of family income, for families with income up to $75,000. The Governor's plan has a tax credit of only $500 for families with income below $70,000.
* Eliminate some of the sales and excise taxes, which hurt the middle class and the poor. The Florio sales and excise tax increase takes away part of the relief it provides elsewhere to middle-income and lower-income families.
* Eliminate special advantages that a few large, profitable corporations enjoy. The Florio plan is for the most part silent on the issue of corporate taxes.
* Impose a top marginal income tax rate of 8 percent for those whose income exceeds $250,000. The Governor's top marginal rate is 7 percent for those whose income exceeds $150,000.
In addition, the Governor needs to develop a closer working relationship with grass-roots groups that espouse the political and economic concerns of poor and middle-class people and the elderly, on a wide range of issues - from the environment, to education, to jobs and housing. Independent grass-roots groups can help sell and support his policies.
The wealthy are already mobilizing, arguing that the Florio plan will hurt New Jersey's economy. But corporations across the country realize that services are as important as taxes in assessing the relative strengths and weaknesses of the business climate from state to state. Issues like financing for schools and roads, which affect the quality of life, are often more important to business than corporate tax levels.
Taxes are not the most critical factor. If they were, everyone would locate in low-tax and poor states like Mississippi.
We must streamline state government, improve services for the public and reform our unfair tax system. We can do all three.
The state's fiscal crisis is real. Government must be cost-effective. There is no excuse for waste, cronyism, sweetheart contracts and a bloated management cadre. These are unacceptable vestiges of a brand of politics we can no longer afford.
We cannot stick our heads in the sand and pretend that spending cuts can solve everything. We cannot ignore legitimate public needs, slough off more responsibility to local government and return to an unfair tax structure.
A more progressive tax system and the mobilization of grass-roots citizens can help Jim Florio ride the crest of history.

HEADLINE: Brodsky's Role Sets Campaign Agenda

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
AS Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky sees it, the recently concluded legislative session in Albany was a nearly unqualified success. ''We ended spring borrowing, funded the libraries, improved reimbursement rates for hospitals, increased school aid'' and, in general, ''cut spending by state agencies while improving fiscal aid to local governments.''
Mr. Brodsky, a four-term Democrat who sees himself as the leader of the Westchester delegation in the Assembly because of his seniority in that Democratically controlled chamber, said, ''Westchester did fabulously, with its best year economically.'' He said the ''county's share of budget actions in aid of municipalities is just over $45 million.''
The view from elsewhere in Westchester produces a different image, however, even among fellow Democrats. They see a mixed record, with most of the criticism focused on a single item: the inability of the county's elected officials to persuade the Westchester delegation in Albany to press for an increase in the county sales tax. 
 
$96 Million to Share
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, a Republican who resisted Mr. Brodsky's efforts last year to replace him as the county's top elected official, had proposed raising the tax by 1.5 percent, to 7.25 percent, with villages, towns and the cities of Peekskill and Rye, their school districts and the county government sharing an estimated $96 million in increased tax revenues.
Proponents said that enacting the tax would help forestall another steep rise in county property taxes next year, but it never came up for a vote in Albany. Although the Westchester delegation was split on the issue, Mr. Brodsky was identified with its eventual demise.
''Why did I oppose the sales tax?'' he asked rhetorically in a recent interview. ''Because to throw good money after bad for this government,'' he said, referring to Mr. O'Rourke's administration, ''is crazy.''
He described Mr. O'Rourke's budget helmsmanship as ''a fiscal basket case.'' He said the county government was ''out of control, and without a spending cap and spending cuts there is no point in giving them huge new revenues.''
 
Brodsky as Gatekeeper
The image of Mr. Brodsky setting terms as the legislative gatekeeper in the Assembly has bothered county government officials and annoyed some Democratic legislators, who see say Mr. Brodsky as ignoring a bipartisan effort on the Board of Legislators to find budget cuts. It has also fixed the political agenda for this year's Assembly election in Greenburgh.
Mr. Brodsky is being challenged by Louis Giampiccolo Jr. of Tarrytown, a 29-year-old International Business Machines employee. He is making his first run for elected office, but knows a political issue when he sees one. Beginning his campaign with a broad attack on ''Democratic spending policies,'' he has since narrowed his comments to the sales tax impasse and his opponent's role in it.
Mr. Brodsky ''can't have it both ways,'' Mr. Giampiccolo said. ''His demands that the county government cap spending are ludicrous, to say the least, when he voted to increase state taxes and fees by a record $3.2 billion - $1.4 billion last year and $1.8 billion this year.''
The Republican candidate, who also has Conservative Party endorsement, said Mr. Brodsky ''has voted against Republican initiatives seeking a cap on state spending, but he never fails to vote for state mandates that the county must enact and tax local taxpayers for.''
 
What Increase Would Have Meant
Not surprisingly, Mr. Giampiccolo has translated what he said the proposed sales-tax increase would have meant to the town of Greenburgh, which represents most of the 87th Assembly District he is seeking to represent. The rest of the district is in northwest Yonkers.
The sales tax, if enacted, would have represented $4.2 million to the town's six villages, $2.5 million to the eight school districts and $4 million to the town government itself, Mr. Giampiccolo said.
Mr. Brodsky said there was no question that the towns, villages and school districts ''deserved'' sharing in the proposed sales-tax increase. ''But why shouldn't all of it go back to the communities,'' he asked, ''since the tax is generated in those communities?
''In fact, if Greenburgh wanted to go from 5.75 percent to 7.25 percent, it could do so today without a law and it would be up to the county to pre-empt it. I'm willing to engage in constructive discussion with anyone, including Andy and the Board, about what it would take to get my support.''
 
Democrats Challenge Brodsky Role
Mr. Brodsky's position has been challenged by some Democrats on the Board of Legislators. A bipartisan resolution seeking the Albany delegation's support in getting the proposed sales-tax increase on the floor of the Legislature included a pledge ''of a zero percent increase in the property tax,'' said Sandra R. Galef, the Democratic minority leader.
''That would apply to the first year, with any increase in the second year limited to the cost of living,'' Mrs. Galef said. ''This legislation had the full support of the Democratic caucus'' on the Board of Legislators, ''and the Albany delegation should have at least put it on the agenda.''
Although Mr. Brodsky had not been shy in accepting responsibility for the proposal's rejection, she said that ''he was not the only member of our delegation opposed to it.'' At least one other Democrat, Assemblyman Ronald C. Tocci of New Rochelle, opposed it.
Only one Republican in the county's Assembly delegation, Assemblywoman Cecile D. Singer, who represents Eastchester, Scarsdale and northeast Yonkers, said she favored putting it on the agenda. In the State Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, it also failed to reach the floor despite entreaties by Mr. O'Rourke.
 
'Quarrel Is With County Executive'
Legislator Audrey G. Hochberg, Democrat of Scarsdale, who is co-chairman with Legislator Timothy S. Carey, Republican of Montrose, of a newly formed committee seeking new revenues and spending cuts, said they were fully engaged in looking for the savings Mr. Brodsky was seeking.
She said she thought ''Richard's quarrel is more with the County Executive'' than with the Board of Legislators.
''This is only the first year of a new approach on the Board to deal with county issues through a bipartisan coalition,'' Mrs. Hochberg said. ''I don't think people outside of county government know how sincere and hard-working the coalition is.''
The coalition was formed late last year after Republicans ousted their long-term chairman, Edward J. Brady, Republican of Thornwood. It agreed on a replacement, John E. Hand, a Yorktown Heights Republican, who took office in the new session beginning in January.
Even before that, the coalition of six Republicans and five Democrats in the 17-member chamber worked together to reduce Mr. O'Rourke's proposed $1 billion budget for this year from a level that would have required a property-tax increase of 27 percent to one requiring a 17 percent increase.
 
Way Is Opened for a Higher Levy
Some funds were later restored, mostly through the use of 1989 surpluses that would otherwise have been used to reduce next year's budget. This procedure, frowned on by county budget officials, opens the way for an even higher property-tax levy next year and the need for the special commission on additional revenues and capital enhancements headed by Mr. Carey and Mrs. Hochberg.
Mrs. Hochberg said, ''We saw the sales tax proposal as a way of containing property-tax increases, and we did get some support, from Young, and Zaleski,'' she said, referring to Assemblymen Terence M. Zaleski of Yonkers and Gregory P. Young of Mount Vernon, both Democrats, ''and from Cecile Singer,'' the Eastchester Republican.
As for the Board's special commission, ''we have seen some slowdown in hiring,'' she said. The administration has agreed to the Board's request for quarterly reports, enabling the legislators to follow spending and hiring trends rather than getting their first look in November, when the next year's proposed budget is presented to the Board for approval.
As for the legislative session recently completed, ''It was very bad for us in terms of revenues,'' Mrs. Hochberg said. ''We were actively working toward entering Offtrack Betting, but changes made by the State Legislature would make it a less viable revenue source,'' she said.
The increased reimbursements for hospitals will be ''helpful,'' she said, ''but it will be somewhat offset by an increase in the county's payouts for Medicaid.'' The library financing, $15 million for the next three years statewide, represented a ''very small amount of money,'' she said.
 
Brodsky Cites Grants
Mr. Brodsky spoke enthusiastically of the environmental-quality bond act on the November ballot, ''which includes $300 million in matching grants for local recycling, of which Westchester should get $15 million.''
The county will collect an extra $2.4 million in sales-tax revenues, and its municipalities $2 million, he said, as areas covered by the tax were expanded to include auto rentals, parking, 900 additional-charge call-in telephone numbers and other services.
Mr. Brodsky also spoke of his role in heading the Assembly's Investigations Committee. The work of the committee, Mr. Brodsky said, has led to a reform of proprietary business schools, findings that the state's biggest polluters were state agencies and that local governments were violating prevailing wage laws.
 
The Opponent's Background
The Assemblyman's opponent, Mr. Giampiccolo, was born and raised in Tarrytown, where he said his family has lived for 60 years, and his father, Louis Sr., is the former deputy commissioner of public works for the town of Greenburgh.
The candidate graduated from Sleepy Hollow High School in 1978, from Fordham University in 1981 and from Pace University, where he received a degree in b usiness administration, in 1982.
He began working for I.B.M. in 1983 and is now a systems engineer in the marketing department of I.B.M.'s New York Media Branch office in Manhattan. He is a captain and a company commander in the U.S. Army Reserve where he began serving nine years ago, having graduated from Fordham's ROTC program.
 
Fed Up With 'Tax and Spend'
Mr. Giampiccolo said he was a Republican district leader in Tarrytown and has participated in community activities there. ''The reason I got involved in this year's election race,'' he said, ''was that, like many other taxpayers, I got fed up with the tax and spend attitude of our State Legislature.''
He said he would be asking Mr. Brodsky ''When are you going to stop running for County Executive?''
He said the Democrat also ''should be asked to tell his constituents why he does not support the proposed sales tax, even though it had overwhelming support in the Board of Legislators, where they agreed to a sunshine clause that if communities were not applying the new tax directly to tax relief, the state could revoke it.''
The Right to Life Party candidate in the 86th Assembly District race is Geraldine Timoney of Yonkers.

HEADLINE: THE SUMMER REPORT: CURRICULUM;
The Home Front

BYLINE: By Thomas C. Hayes

 BODY:
SUMMER is the relative calm before students storm their local educational institutions, be those institutions public or private, geared to youngsters or adults.
BUT even now, thunderclouds are gathering: a popular movement to train adults to be their children's first teachers is rumbling in the middle distance; commercial learning centers are raining on the independent tutoring market; community colleges are building up a new front, and parents are realizing with lightning clarity that the cost of college far exceeds tuition.
TIME to break out the umbrellas.
 
EACH WEEK, Blanca Nieto brings a storybook, a coloring book and printed sheets describing simple games and puzzles for Maria Acosta to explore with her youngest sons, who are ages 4 and 5. ''They are learning fast,'' said Mrs. Acosta, whose two older children go to school. ''They know colors, up and down, and how to compare big and small. I want them to get what we did not: to go to college, to get a career.'' 
Mrs. Nieto and Mrs. Acosta, Mexican-born daughters of migrant farm workers, are high school dropouts who married in their teens, bore children by their mid-20's and settled in the neighborhoods of West Dallas. They are also part of a broadening movement, with Mrs. Nieto as a group leader, that in the last few years has trained thousands of parents nationwide, including many from low-income families, to teach their young children in the home.
Missouri became the first state, in 1985, to offer an in-home preschool learning program to all residents. Today, school districts in Southern California, New Mexico, Texas, North Carolina, New York and Ohio are experimenting with Missouri's Parents As Teachers (P.A.T.) approach.
An Israeli model, the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters, has taken root in 13 states, including Texas, Arkansas and New York. Next month it will add Connecticut, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. Unlike P.A.T., this program, known by its acronym Hippy, aims for an older group, preparing 4- and 5-year-olds for the classroom and their parents for guiding and helping them learn.
 
'Programs Will Grow'
''Quality preschool programs can have an impact, especially on families with disadvantaged backgrounds,'' said Dr. Wade F. Horn, commissioner of Federal programs for children, youth and families in the Department of Health and Human Services. ''There is no question that these preschool, home-based programs will grow.''
Government support will likely spur that growth. The Bush Administration wants Federal spending for Head Start to rise by $500 million next year, to $1.8 billion. That would expand home education for preschoolers in low-income families to 60 percent of eligible households, from 37 percent, Federal officials said.
Bills pending before the House and Senate would use $100 million over five years to begin Parents As Teachers programs in 1,000 school districts. The bills envision Federal contributions declining to 75 percent of the original funding in three years and to 25 percent in five years. The legislation would also set up a National Parents As Teachers Center to advise state officials in training parent educators.
The new impetus for in-home preschool learning comes partly from recent studies showing that such programs give youngsters - especially those from low-income families - an edge after they enter grade school. Missouri educators, for example, found that 3-year-olds whose parents participated in the program since their children's birth were more adept at problem-solving, language and social skills than others not in the program.
Parents also seem to benefit, sometimes enrolling in classes to attain the diplomas that were beyond their grasp as teen-agers. Others are learning to read and write.
 
'Wants It for Her Child'
Deborah Troy, an unmarried mother of two children, 4 and 7, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, said that in the group of 10 parents she leads, a mother who cannot read is one of the most active members.
''She didn't get the education,'' Ms. Troy explained, ''so she wants it for her child.''
Ms. Troy, who is 28, said she wanted to complete secretarial courses at La Guardia Community College when her daughter, now 4, starts school. She said she had to quit college when her daughter was born.
The nation's most comprehensive, state-financed program for preschoolers is in Missouri. State Educators spread advice on child development, based on the writings of the child development experts Burton White and T. Berry Brazelton, to 100,586 families in the state with children ranging in age from week-old infants to 3-year-olds, with a few programs for 4-year-olds. State financing has grown to almost $13 million in the coming school year, up from $2.7 million in 1985-86, for a program that includes screening for medical and learning disorders.
The Missouri program aims to give parents or other care providers a practical awareness of child development stages from birth through age 3, using a combination of in-home visits and group sessions.
Karol Ackermann, a former program coordinator for a children's hospital, who lives in Florissant, Mo., a St. Louis suburb, signed up for the program at the hospital immediately after her son, Nathan, was born. Two weeks later a parent educator arranged a first visit. Nathan is now 3, and since his birth Mrs. Ackermann has worked with two parent advisers.
''I was concerned at one point that Nathan wasn't rolling over as soon as a lot of other mothers had told me their children had rolled over,'' she said. ''I was super-sensitive about this and overly concerned about a number of things. But the parent educator told me Nathan was setting his own timetable, and she pointed out areas where he was normal.''
Such tips are reinforced by monthly group meetings at a local elementary school or early childhood resource center. Participants range from affluent suburbanites past the age of 40 who are having their first child to impoverished, unmarried teen-age mothers.
 
Less Stress, More Fun
''Our assumption, going into any home, is that here are parents who love their children, want the best for their children and want to get information that can make parenting less stressful and more fun,'' said Sue Treffeisen, training coordinator for Parents As Teachers in St. Louis.
Home visits are scheduled in evenings, early mornings and on weekends, if necessary, to accommodate working parents or other care givers, such as grandparents or other family members, Mrs. Treffeisen said.
Hippy also assumes that parents, or other primary care givers, are a child's first teachers. Developed during the 1970's in Israel to bring literacy and learning skills to preschool children of low-income families, Hippy spread during the 1980's to a half-dozen other countries, including the United States. By September, some 4,000 American families, including those of Mrs. Nieto and Mrs. Acosta in Dallas and Ms. Troy in Brooklyn, will be teaching their youngsters using materials developed 21 years ago by Dr. Avima D. Lombard, now director of early childhood education at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
So far, no public funds have been budgeted specifically for Hippy in the United States; rather, local administrators eke out financing elsewhere. In Arkansas, which has 2,000 families in Hippy, the most of any state, local school districts use Federal money budgeted for low-income children's programs such as Head Start, and for programs involving parents in school activities.
The Save the Children Foundation is administrator and major financial source for the Bedford-Stuyvesant program, which currently involves 70 families. In Dallas, the city's public school system sponsors a program for 30 families using state and Federal money allocated for bilingual studies and migrant-worker education. The Ford Foundation, the Lowe Foundation, the Wolens Foundation, the Hearst Foundation, the Hasbro Children's Foundation and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. have given Hippy USA in New York grants.
Dr. Miriam Y. Westheimer studied the causes of high dropout rates in New York schools for a dissertation at Columbia University's Teachers College. She has been national director of Hippy USA since it was organized two years ago under the auspices of the National Council of Jewish Women.
Dr. Westheimer said that tensions between community groups and school administrators and teachers in inner cities and low-income areas make cycles of bad learning habits, classroom frustration and unemployment hard to break. ''But if you can take kids when they are just starting out in school, and get parents and the community working with the schools, the chances of bridging those differences are much greater,'' she said.
Hippy's weapons in this battle include 18 storybooks, 60 activity packets and a set of 16 plastic shapes, which parents use with their preschoolers.
 
The First Teacher
In Dallas, parents, grandparents or other relatives in the program bring the children to group meetings every two weeks with their parent trainers and the program coordinator from the public schools.
''Hippy builds on the basic bond between parent and children,'' Dr. Westheimer said. ''Hippy works to make parents their children's first and most important teacher, which they are anyway.''
To accomplish this goal, Hippy requires local administrators to recruit and pay paraprofessional trainers, usually mothers with children already in Hippy, to distribute and collect learning materials every week. Trainers also explain the materials' use, often taking the role of the parent, with the parent responding as the child.
The paraprofessionals ''are the key,'' Dr. Westheimer said, noting: ''We would not allow a program to start where retired teachers, social workers or other professionals go into the home. By seeing eye to eye with the families, being from the community, paraprofessionals have a much better sense of the issues families face.''
Parents like Mrs. Nieto, one of two group leaders in the West Dallas home-study program, have more credibility with other low-income mothers, Dr. Westheimer said. ''People like Blanca tell us immediately that it's not that parents don't want to do anything for their children, which is said too often about low-income parents,'' she said. ''It's that they don't know what to do to get their kids to succeed in this system.''

Mrs. Nieto, who is 28, joined the program with her 4-year-old daughter, Violeta, last year. Despite a full-time job on the night shift at a nearby manufacturing company, she said she worked as much as 80 hours a month on home-instruction visits and group sessions.
Her oldest son, Luis, who is 9, and her husband, Jose, a carpenter, also read stories to three younger children from books she brings to her home and to the homes of 14 other families in her group. In some cities, English and Spanish versions of the original Israeli materials are available, but for now Dallas administrators use only Spanish versions.
The Dallas school system pays Mrs. Nieto $7.48 an hour as a group leader, or nearly $1 an hour more than she earns at her factory job. School officials said the home-instruction effort costs an estimated $400 per child. By contrast, administrators of Missouri's P.A.T. say that that program costs between $210 and $225 per family.
Mrs. Nieto said she left high school, which she attended in four states each year as her parents kept step with farmers' harvesting and hiring seasons, after the 10th grade. But that wasn't because she didn't think education was valuable.
''I kept an encyclopedia for 10 years that one of the schools was going to throw out,'' she recalled, standing near a row of yellow tulips she tends in her front yard. ''The time we as parents can spend with our little children is special. I want all the education for my children that I can give them.''

HEADLINE: THE SUMMER REPORT;
Cultural Imperatives

BYLINE: By Margo Kaufman

 BODY:
SUMMER is the relative calm before students storm their local educational institutions, be those institutions public or private, geared to youngsters or adults.
BUT even now, thunderclouds are gathering: a popular movement to train adults to be their children's first teachers is rumbling in the middle distance; commercial learning centers are raining on the independent tutoring market; community colleges are building up a new front, and parents are realizing with lightning clarity that the cost of college far exceeds tuition.
TIME to break out the umbrellas.
 
WHILE educators feud over what constitutes ''cultural literacy'' and the best core curriculum for the nation at large, Americans go on cheerfully being regionally different in speech, thought, attitude and cultural referents. What is knowledge in Texas is ignorance in Minnesota, and vice versa. 
''Here, you have to know about the desert,'' said Nancy Baldwin, a program coordinator for the General Instrument Education Center, a management training company in Phoenix. ''You have to understand about heat. It can be 110 but you don't feel it because it's dry heat. The humidity is low so you don't sweat like you do when it's 90 in New Jersey.''
Should you still need to cool off, however, the shore is closer than it looks on a map.
''Because we're in the desert they've built this thing called Big Surf where you can go surfing,'' Ms. Baldwin explained. ''There is a manmade ocean wave with a sandy beach, palm trees and some quonset huts. For seven bucks a day you can go lie on the beach. It's like being in San Diego.'' Not exactly. ''You have to know when the tide is low,'' said David Bradley, a writer who divides his time between San Diego and Philadelphia. ''The difference between the beach being crowded or not in summertime depends on how much beach there is. When the tide is high there's 25 percent less beach than when the tide is low. Every January you get a tide book from the lifeguard department. It also lists the expected grunion runs.''
San Diego illiterati take note. Grunions are little fish that come up on the beach several times a year to spawn. ''It happens at night,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''You take beer and a friend down to the beach and watch.''
Every city has its own definition of a hot date. In San Francisco, it's dinner at Stars and a night at the opera. In Fort Lauderdale, it's racing the cigarette boat down the Intracoastal Waterway and - barring an unfortunate encounter with the Florida Marine Patrol - dinner at Shooters. In Chicago, it's two good seats at a Cubs night game.
''Someone once asked me to compile a cultural-literacy guide to Charlottesville,'' said Joseph Kett, a history professor at the University of Virginia and co-author of the ''Dictionary of Cultural Literacy,'' which just shows how culturally ignorant of Charlottesville that someone was. ''It's called Hookville'' among local cognoscenti, Professor Kett said. ''It was C-ville, but the 'C' is shaped like a hook, so it simply became Hookville.''
To save strangers from further humiliation, Professor Kett also noted that ''If you're referring to the University of Virginia, you don't call it the Campus, you call it the Grounds.''
At Harvard the campus is the Yard; at Stanford, the Farm.
''There is potential for miscommunication all the time,'' Professor Kett said. ''There are lots and lots of subcultures each with its own language.''
And menu. ''You've heard of Wheaties, the Breakfast of Champions?'' asked Rene Pena, a specialist in community education service for Children's Television in Dallas. ''In Texas, it's menudo,'' a spicy soup made of cow innards. ''Texans eat it a lot,'' Mr. Pena said, ''normally in the morning, after they've been partying all weekend.''
In Chicago, culinary sophisticates ''know what's 'everything' on a hot dog with everything,'' said Patrick Clinton, a journalism professor at Northwestern University, who confided everything: ''mustard, relish, celery salt, tomatoes, onions, a dill pickle spear that goes the length of the hot dog and two or three pickled peppers.''
The ''Tom Cruise'' at the Stage Deli in New York City comes with sliced brisket, grilled tomatoes, served open face and topped with melted mozzarella. In Cleveland, Tom's his old New York self. But in Los Angeles, Tom comes with shrimp salad, egg salad, lettuce and tomato served open face.
There are guidelines for achieving local cultural literacy. ''You need to know about the dominant economy of an area because so many different people's lives are connected,'' said Jerry Jellison, a psychology professor at the University of Southern California. ''Like if you're in a small town in the Midwest you need to know about farming and agribusiness. And in Los Angeles, you have to know about the film industry. You have to know who Peter Guber is,'' and the grosses on the latest releases.
In Michigan, ''people who work for the automobile industry, they'll say, 'I work for Fords, not Ford,'' said Gerald R. Miller, a communications professor at Michigan State University. ''If you didn't know, you might think it was a drugstore.'' Professor Miller added that even Michiganders outside the automotive industry are hyperaware of which models are selling how well nationally and internationally.
Their car-conscious California counterparts even recognize makes and models at 85 miles an hour.
Names in higher education are the ones to drop in Boston. ''Knowing who the president of Harvard is and the president of M.I.T. and the president of B.U. is an absolute must for having a conversation, even at a train station,'' said Marian Bach, a trust administrator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (This is an especially difficult trick these days when two of those names are changing and the third could become Massachusetts' governor.) ''And then there are certain industrial family names that have been in New England ever since we got started.''
Professor Jellison agreed that one must know something about history to comprehend culture. ''There's factual history,'' he said, ''like who was the mayor, and key events,'' like when the local team won back-to-back National Basketball Association championships. ''And then there are the local icons.'' Like the elephant that attacked its keeper and was chained for the rest of its life - a name (Ziggy) that comes trippingly to the tongue of in-the-know Chicagoans. (The keeper was Slim Lewis.) ''You also have mythic history,'' Professor Jellison said. ''In Texas, you have to know about being a cowboy. In Minnesota, you don't complain about the weather, and in Portland, you understand about being an outdoors person. This is how people define themselves.''
''New Yorkers are great shoppers,'' said Pat Thaler, associate dean at New York University's School of Continuing Education. ''They love to get things at a fair price and if they can get wholesale or a discount, all the better. We have the Lower East Side; Sunday is the day to go. We have discount stores. Of course, New Yorkers aren't going to buy cheap if it isn't good.''
Professor Miller maintains that the culturally literate know how people talk about getting from place to place. ''In Michigan,'' he said, ''if you asked how far it is to a destination, we would say 25 miles. But in California, they would say half an hour,'' because Californians don't look at the odometer when they're stuck on the freeway; they look at the clock.
New Yorkers judge distance by blocks, which they cover fast and aggressively, treating ''Don't Walk'' signs like polite suggestions. ''We don't necessarily wait for the right light,'' Dean Thaler said. ''But New Yorkers are very quick. Most of us know how to get across the street in one piece.''
Most Californians are well versed in the vagaries of earthquakes, while Floridians could probably list the names of hurricanes for the last 20 years. Middle Westerners know the year of the ''Big Snow,'' and residents of Washington State can recall in excruciating detail when Mount St. Helens ''lost her top.''
Of course, no matter how much you know, you can never know enough. Mr. Bradley, though, has devised a minimum competency test. ''When I moved to Philadelphia, I turned on a black radio station and they were announcing a concert,'' he said. ''The disk jockey said tickets were available in all the usual places. I had no idea what the usual places were, so I asked my friends where to get tickets. And they said, 'Oh, the usual places.' ''
''If I had to come up with a definition of cultural literacy,'' Mr. Bradley said, ''it would be that when people say 'the usual places,' you know.''

Degrees in Whole Earth

BYLINE: By Kathleen M. Berry

 BODY:
MUCH as the creation of a women's studies major reflected a kind of consciousness-raising for students in the 1970's, so environmental studies may be a generational barometer for the 1990's, as colleges and universities increasingly create curriculums on the environment and grant their graduates degrees.
''Many of the smaller private colleges have students who are very active in the environment,'' said Dr. Verne Howe, chairwoman of the National Association of Environmental Educators and a professor at Southern Vermont College in Bennington, Vt. ''But there's no consensus on how many programs there are nationally.'' 
At the University of California at Berkeley, undergraduates can choose between a bachelor of arts in environmental sciences or a bachelor of science in conservation and resource studies.
Southern Vermont's environmental-studies degree program enrolls about 15 undergraduates annually, with courses on forest ecology, environmental history, cartography and environmental law.
Perhaps the most far-reaching program, though, is at Tufts University in Massachusetts, which established an Environmental Literacy Institute last year. By teaching awareness of the environment to faculty members - 24 took part in the new program this spring -the university hopes to integrate environmental topics into courses campuswide. This fall students who take economics, accounting, literature and history will have environmental articles and books woven into their courses.
Engineering schools are responding to the environmental clamor by offering undergraduate and interdisciplinary programs that combine subjects like physics and microbiology with aspects of environmental management.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently created an undergraduate program in environmental engineering. Carnegie-Mellon University has added a designated minor in environmental engineering in which students choose two-thirds of the required courses outside their major field of study.
''Educators are realizing that we must teach more than just the technological aspects of the field,'' said Prof. David E. Marks, chairman of the civil engineering department at M.I.T. ''There's no such thing as a free environment and students are learning about the costs of pollution, which the technology community has avoided.''
As a result, the tenor of the new programs is generally pragmatic. Many students are combining a major in environmental studies with another in communications, history, business management or political science.
Prof. Richard G. Luthy, chairman of Carnegie-Mellon's civil engineering department, said recent events such as the San Francisco earthquake and the Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska, had triggered a demand for courses from students.
''These are enormous problems in remote locations that have outraged many citizens,'' Professor Luthy said. But he added that, when presenting the material, ''We must teach more than how oil disperses from tanker spills.''
In response, many business schools have integrated environmental problems into the study of crisis management. Lester B. Lave, a professor of economics and engineering and public policy at Carnegie-Mellon, teaches a ''Health, Safety and Environmental Regulation'' course for business students. In one class, students brainstorm ways in which they could become millionaires by controlling pollution or population growth.
''Students think business managers are there just to maximize stockholder concerns,'' Professor Lave said. ''I try to deal with the non-obvious issues, the ones they're not likely to encounter on the job until real trouble happens.''
Graduates typically are finding jobs in state and Federal agencies working with water-quality control or regional planning. Educators warn, however, that in environmental studies career interests often exceed opportunities.
As Robert Singer, executive director of the Coolidge Center for Environmental Leadership, which counsels universities in the Boston area, noted: ''We have the unfortunate task sometimes of discouraging people from following a career track in the environment.''

HEADLINE: Tax Plan Sticks New Yorkers With Bailout Tab

 BODY:
To the Editor:
New Yorkers should be aghast at your distressingly shortsighted editorial (''The Right Way to Raise Taxes,'' July 25) in support of placing a cap on the Federal returns for state and local taxes. This provision could mean a change in the Federal marginal bracket for New York taxpayers from 36.1 percent to 39.8 percent.
Such a proposal, if enacted, will levy a disproportionate tax burden on New Yorkers, who live in the highest taxed state in the country. It could be argued that a portion of New York State's taxes reflects the assumption by the state of social costs not borne by other states or that ought to be borne more by the Federal Government. But it is difficult to rationalize this burden by contending, as you do, that we are reaping the advantages of these taxes in the form of ''improved schools and other public services.'' New Yorkers would seriously question such alleged benefits, as well as their costs. 
There is a further bizarre inequity. This proposal transfers to residents of highly taxed states, such as New York, a heavier share of the cost of cleaning up the savings and loan mess. A majority of the thrift failures occurred in Texas, Florida and Southwest states with low or no income taxes. Their residents will experience no increase in their tax bills if this proposal is enacted, while New Yorkers will be asked to pick up the lion's share of a cost created in states whose taxpayers will enjoy the advantage of having New Yorkers pay the bill. It is difficult to discern tax fairness in such an absurd result.
The high-tax states will be the losers, as taxpayers realize the advantage of living in states with less regressive tax policies. The effect on the New York State economy could be chilling in times of economic difficulties. Your reader base may remain unchanged, but a larger percentage of readers may choose to live in Florida.

HEADLINE: Tax Plan Sticks New Yorkers With Bailout Tab;
Our Spending Problem

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Right Way to Raise Taxes'' (editorial, July 25) is a perfect example of the politicization and obfuscation of economic reality in this country. There is no economic theory that supports any tax increase as a remedy to a weakening economy.
The United States does not have a ''revenue shortfall'' (our total revenues as a function of our gross national product have been consistent for decades) or a ''deficit'' problem (we have more than adequate national net worth to handle our deficit financing). What we have is a spending problem. Any economic analysis that is not politically biased can see our spending is run amok. 
You should be directing indignation toward a broken-down ''democratic'' process in the way we spend our tax dollars. We have special-interest groups out of control dictating to a corrupt, self-perpetuating Congress. Our Federal Government has become analogous to the inefficient charitable institution whose beneficiaries receive 5 cents of every $1 in contributed donations. The bureaucracy has to be reorganized.
Are the ''poor'' awash in all the red ink we are spilling? I think, rather, our bloated government bureaucracies are so deep in the public trough, they can only cry out for more taxes!
Your recent opinion poll reported 60 percent of the American public disapproved of the President's handling of the deficit and 52 percent disapproved of increased taxes.
The news media's cynical, arrogant analysis interprets this as a public that wants the spending but refuses to pay for it. The public has repeatedly sent a mandate to the White House to hold the line on taxes, that is, stop transferring money from the productive to the nonproductive (our bureaucracy). Unlike you, I didn't hear a national wave of relief at President Bush's tax capitulation, but a wave of disgust.

Blow to Homeowners

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Right Way to Raise Taxes'' (editorial, July 25), endorses removal of tax deductions for home mortgage interest and state taxes, instead of increasing tax rates.
By virtue of losing this Federal tax deduction, residents of states with high income taxes, such as New York, California, Hawaii and Vermont, would pay higher taxes. Most states impose income taxes in the top range of 6 percent to 8 percent. Texas, Florida, New Hampshire and Washington impose no income taxes. Their residents would pay no additional Federal income taxes.
Homeowners will suffer. Our Government has encouraged homeownership by a tax deduction for mortgage interest and realty taxes. The increased income tax cost to a typical homeowner with a $100,000 mortgage will exceed $4,000 a year in after-tax dollars, representing $6,000 of pretax earnings. Without the deduction, some homeowners will be unable to meet mortgage costs. Foreclosures will increase. Fewer young families will be able to buy a home. Fewer homes will be sold. Home resale values will tumble. The building industry will suffer. A pyramiding effect on jobs and the local economy will ensue.
Our country has a mobile population, which follows opportunities, jobs, better and less costly living. Higher taxes cause both families and factories to move to low-tax states, compounding economic disruption in high-tax states.
A fair and simple revenue-raising alternative would be to increase the tax rate on higher levels of income, above $150,000, say. Increase it again as income passes $500,000, $1 million and beyond.
In addition, untold tax revenues would result from properly funding the Internal Revenue Service and training its personnel to enforce the law effectively.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Making A Killer

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
Iraq's capture of Kuwait is, of course, a declaration of war against Western power and economic independence.
It is so obvious that the only two questions remaining are how the West will respond and why it came as a surprise.
They are inseparable. Unless the West at last faces the truth about why it failed to see the plain danger, it will not be able to act decisively now. That will make another adventure by the Iraqi dictator simply a matter of a little time. 
Only a few months ago, Saddam Hussein made shriekingly clear his intention to use his million soldiers, his Soviet tanks, French planes and American technology to destroy Israel and control the Middle East and the oil that moves the world.
The way to stop him before he attacked was an immediate Western embargo. When an enemy points a pistol and says he will pull the trigger, there is no high moral obligation to wait until he does.
Now it will cost more, to staunch the blood. The ultimate goal now has to be the elimination of the incurably murderous Baghdad dictatorship by Western, Japanese and Israeli economic and military reprisals.
Total air and naval blockade of Iraq, including turning off Iraqi pipelines running through Saudi Arabia and Turkey, could ruin Iraq and bring about the dictator's end.
So far President Bush has reacted with the minimum steps needed to look his ashen face in the mirror. That gives him a little time to see if our allies will join us in effective action - or whether we will all just thrash around, amusing Saddam Hussein with futile bluster.
Mr. Bush needs time, which is costly, because Western leaders failed in their duty to prepare action against the plainest threats of aggression since Adolf Hitler.
Why in the name of sanity is there a Western alliance, glistening with planning staff and elegant headquarters, if not to agree in advance on how to meet such a threat?
Saddam Hussein, like other serial killers, wrote ''Stop me'' on the wall. First, he cried out his lust for empire. Then he handed the West his first battle plan by threatening to attack Kuwait for lowering oil prices. Then he moved his troops to the frontier.
Intelligently, he wanted to find out if the West had any intention of trying to stop him. When he discovered the answer, he moved across the border.
Now, with or without direct invasion, Iraq can control the ruling clans of Saudi Arabia and Jordan - or blow them away. Both families are already terrified by the meagerness of their popularity at home.
In 1970, the Israelis saved King Hussein of Jordan from the Syrians. Who will save him from Saddam? The Iraqis plan to attack Israel one day. In 1981, the Israelis destroyed the Iraqi nuclear reactor and were piously denounced in the West. After Kuwait, does Senator Robert Dole still want to cut military support for Israel?
The West was blind to the truth about the Middle East because it had put out its eyes with the dagger of its own lies.
The first lie is that Israel is the root of danger in the Middle East, but that if it would only agree to some kind of Palestinian state, peace would follow.
But Palestinians cannot give Israel peace. Only the Arab nations can do that. For decades they refused and still do.
One victim of the Kuwaiti invasion was any lingering Palestinian dream of a separate state. It would be run by Saddam Hussein's Palestinian allies. He would then be a pistol shot from Israel's heart.
The invasion proves one more weary time that it is not Israel that prevents Middle East peace. It is the Arab tyrannies, eager not only to destroy Israel but to shed blood in their perpetual feuds and wars.
But decade after decade the West sold weapons to the dictators. Greed for cash and oil was the reason. And for cash and oil, the West deluded itself into thinking that the sheiks and kinglings created by its colonial offices and oil companies were real political rulers.
The second suicidal lie: The Arab threat is only dangerous to Israel. Too bad for the Jews, sure, but look, not as important for the West as oil. And not as important for Moscow as selling all those Soviet tanks, now on view in the streets of Kuwait.
Now, Saddam Hussein has made the mistake of showing the West that tyrants cannot be appeased, neither with money and guns, nor with lies.
That is the mistake all tyrants make. And that is how they are brought down - but only if truth finally brings courage.

HEADLINE: The Endangered Civil Service

BYLINE: By Paul Volcker; Paul Volcker was chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.

 BODY:
However well-intentioned and enlightened its policies, any government, from the White House to the local motor-vehicle registration office, is only as good as its workers. For the Federal Government, this undeniable truth has recently spelled trouble. It seems to be getting ever harder to staff top-flight political positions, where the turnover rate on average has been about 18 months. Meanwhile, morale, and with it commitment to the job, have been declining among civil servants. Their pay is inadequate. They face an apparent lack of public respect. And not surprisingly, recruiting needed talent is proving more difficult.
In light of these facts, it isn't entirely coincidental that last year began with stories of outright corruption in Pentagon procurement. Then the political scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development competed for headlines with evidence of influence-peddling in Congress. And now a mixture of short-sighted public policy and maladminstration will force taxpayers to pay hundreds of billions of dollars to make good the Federal guarantee of savings and loan deposits. 
It should come as no surprise that such shortcomings weaken that fabric of public trust so essential to a democracy. Another serious cost is that fewer of our most talented young people see government service as a worthwhile and challenging career.
No doubt, some of the problem stems from a general weakening in our collective obligations to good citizenship. Among the world's democracies, we are near last place in that most fundamental form of citizen participation, casting ballots. This year the Internal Revenue Service estimates that for the first time unpaid taxes will exceed $100 billion. We seem reluctant even to be counted for the census.
Three years ago, 36 public-spirited Americans, from both sides of the political aisle, joined with me in a private ''National Commission on the Public Service'' to address the erosion in the quality of the Government's workforce. Our report described a ''quiet crisis'' among government employees. Since then, the situation has worsened.
The most basic of our recommendations for reform was addressed to the nation's educators. They need to elevate the importance of civic education and community service in school curricula. In addition, we have recommended a well-publicized, competitive program providing college scholarships to some of the best of our young people in exchange for a few years in government service.
No less important is leadership, above all from the Oval Office. After two presidents who campaigned against Washington, George Bush has clearly changed public rhetoric about government. This could have a substantial impact on how the American people view the public service.
Pay and ethics reforms make up another essential impovement. When such changes were enacted for the top levels of the Federal Government last fall, pay improved at least for senior Federal executives and judges. Hardly generous, the increases at least got salaries of senior Federal judges up to something visibly above what major law firms are paying new law graduates! We must now give a higher priority to fairer pay for the rank and file of the Civil Service.
Also high on the agenda is the problem of rapid growth in the number of political appointees. Presidents understandably want to name people to ensure policy action consistent with their political goals. But their present number - 3,000, compared with barely 200 in Franklin Roosevelt's time - dilutes the effectiveness of presidential leadership. It leads to a loss of professionalism. Moreover, the promotion prospects of the career service are undercut.
Another important component of reform is reducing the complexity of conflict-of-interest rules and reporting requirements that are discouraging qualified people from political posts.
All of this emphasizes the need for some mechanism to keep the state of the public service under continuing review. So, we urged that a ''National Advisory Council on Public Service'' be put in place by Congress and the President. Legislation to that effect has passed both houses of Congress and is awaiting the President's signature. A council could also be a means to involve the private sector more systematically in efforts to improve the public service. Both business and government, for example, face a challenge of productively employing a larger proportion of minorities.
In this exciting and challenging time for all Americans, nations everywhere seek to emulate our democracy, our freedoms and our economic success. How tragic it would be if at this time of unparalleled challenge and potential success, we let the ordinary processes of democratic government erode - and put the whole enterprise at risk.

HEADLINE: Isolate Iraq

 BODY:
Iraq's Arab neighbors have canceled the summit meeting scheduled for today; they can't bring themselves even to try to stop Saddam Hussein's million-man army and undo his conquest of Kuwait. That's now the world's business, and it can be accomplished only with unity and leadership that produce hard-hitting sanctions.
If there's any good news at all about the invasion, it's that other powers seem to recognize they must act, before Iraq's megalomanic war lord gains control of nearly half the world's oil. 
Washington and Moscow pointed the way Friday. Creditably and courageously, the Soviet Union broke with Iraq, its longtime ally, and joined with the United States in demanding an immediate Iraqi withdrawal and urging a total arms embargo on Iraq. Yesterday, the European Community imposed essential preliminary sanctions. Japan has taken some similar steps.
In grabbing Kuwait, Saddam Hussein has affronted nearly everybody. This is the first invasion of any Arab state by another, thereby shattering the cherished myths of pan-Arabism. Every oil-importing country suddenly finds its supplies imperiled and prices soaring. And all nations have reason to be outraged by a violation of frontiers tantamount to armed robbery.
And now, Saddam Hussein has exposed as a sham his promise to withdraw his troops. Who will replace them? ''Volunteers'' for a new Kuwaiti army, recruited from his own soldiers. The bitter joke typifies his lawless cruelty. The only rational response is to isolate Iraq and compel its unconditional pullout. United outrage can turn the often-toothless United Nations into a tiger. It can invoke the Charter's punitive Chapter 7 to impose mandatory and powerful economic sanctions. And these could be enforced by turning the oil weapon back on Saddam Hussein, by severing the pipelines through which Iraq exports 90 percent of its oil.
Leadership from President Bush is essential to achieving such unity. He has rightly warned that for Iraq to cross Saudi Arabia's borders would tread on vital U.S. interests, and just as rightly, he declines to rule out a military response.
But he needs to do more than reassure Iraq's terrified neighbors. He can now work with the Soviet Union and other powers to overcome the Arab fears of outside help and to win support for essential countermeasures.
The first retaliatory steps have been taken. But asset freezes and trade embargoes are scarcely adequate. A blockade in the Gulf would not cripple Iraq's economy. But it could be devastating if coupled with closing the pipelines.
Turkey and Saudi Arabia control those pipelines. Each has reason to fear reprisals by Iraq and neither relishes being viewed as a Western surrogate. But how different their position would be if the Security Council unanimously invoked the U.N. Charter to impose mandatory sanctions against Iraq. Collective diplomacy to isolate Iraq could finally realize what the Charter envisioned: collective security.
There is no reason to concede the fruits of aggression to the aggressor. There is every reason for a world united in outrage to press for the total isolation of Saddam Hussein.

When Imitation Isn't the Sincerest Form of Flattery

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
IF America's armchair quarterbacks ever voted for their favorite piece of furniture, chances are they might elect the La-Z-Boy recliner. With huge cushions that gently mold to the supine contours of the heftiest fan and a footrest that stretches obligingly forward to prop up weary feet, the La-Z-Boy has become an icon of middle-class creature comforts.
It is also one of the most copied pieces of furniture in the United States. Rival manufacturers can duplicate every La-Z-Boy design and refinement with little fear of being sued under patent and trademark laws, and generally sell their products for less. 
''We put an awful lot of money into these designs,'' said Richard Micka, La-Z-Boy's vice president for administration. ''But the minute you show them off at the furniture shows, people start knocking them off.''
A debate over whether and how to curb such practices has come sharply into focus because of proposed Federal legislation that would allow companies to protect the design of their products much the way an artist or writer copyrights works of art.
A powerful alliance of business groups and a bipartisan coalition of Congressional leaders are pressing for legislation that would entitle companies to protect new designs with what amounts to a 10-year copyright. A company would have only to show that its design is different from that of earlier products.
Something as small as a distinctive curve on an automobile bumper would be covered by the new law, and virtually every kind of product marketed in the United States could be protected: automobile bodies, coffeemakers, running shoes, sunglasses, furniture and luggage. Clothing would be exempt.
Supporters of the bill, which was introduced last year, insist that innovative design is a pillar of manufacturing strength, and that protecting creative companies from low-priced copycats is essential to American competitiveness.
''It's important that we do anything we can to protect American jobs and American companies, which are being eroded by people deliberately producing copycat products,'' said Representative Carlos J. Moorhead, the California Republican who is the bill's principal author.
Opponents contend that the bill would impose an enormous tax on the public by eliminating competition and raising prices throughout the economy.
''After all, we're talking about creating monopolies here,'' said Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier, the Wisconsin Democrat who is the measure's leading opponent. ''If you look around your living room and everything in it is subject to protection, one wonders what the transaction costs of life will be.''
Indeed, say critics, the measure could even thwart the Pentagon's efforts to obtain low-cost spare parts for weapons systems. In the early 1980's, the military was embarrassed by discoveries of exorbitant prices paid for seemingly mundane parts. Investigators later concluded that the biggest problem was that parts could be obtained only from the original weapons manufacturer. For the last five years, the military has been trying to foster as many alternative parts suppliers as possible in an effort to bring down prices through competition.
Underlying the tug-of-war are basic issues. What is innovation? Does it involve a tangible improvement over an earlier product - a faster computer chip, a quieter dishwasher, a more reliable anti-lock braking system for cars?
Or is an innovation merely something that is different from earlier products - the distinctive casing for a telephone, or the curve of an automobile bumper?
Would new protection for design stimulate innovation by providing extra financial incentives, or would it stifle competition and harm consumers?
These arguments have produced unusual political alliances. Representative Moorhead's bill has been endorsed by the Bush Administration and top Congressional Republicans, but one of its biggest champions is the House Majority Leader, Representative Richard Gephart, the Missouri Democrat.
Business supporters include a long list of manufacturers and trade associations. Among them are all of the nation's automobile and truck companies, as well as the United Auto Workers; luggage manufacturers like American Tourister and Hartman; furniture makers like La-Z-Boy and Herman Miller; and the Kohler Company, a manufacturer of bathroom and kitchen equipment.
The opposition is equally diverse. The Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America and the Center for Auto Safety all say that the measure would mean higher prices. Automobile insurers are also opposed, arguing that the measure would add as much as $400 million to the cost of automobile repairs because it would eliminate independent supplies of low-cost body parts. Large discount retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the K mart Corporation are fighting the measure, which they fear will block their access to appealing but low-priced merchandise made abroad.
The most basic change envisioned in the Moorhead bill would involve altering the standard for what constitutes a protectable innovation. Under current law, companies can obtain design patents. But to do so, a company must show that its design is more than just different. It must be new and useful and it cannot be ''obvious'' to others skilled in the same field.
These are the same tests that have been applied throughout most of American history to patents for new machines or chemical processes. But manufacturers complain that these tests are too rigorous for designs, which are not based on new technology but on small flourishes that add to a product's esthetic appeal or comfort. As a result, they say, design patents often take years to obtain and are difficult to enforce.
The new law would essentially reduce the burden of proof. A company would merely have to register its design and demonstrate that it is different from what already exists. Both sides agree that the measure would undoubtedly cover things like automobile bumpers and fenders, even if these are not innovative in any profound sense.
''This elimination of any creativity requirement is a radical departure from existing intellectual property laws,'' argued Clarence Ditlow, the head of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group, in testimony this spring.
''Clearly, though,'' he said, ''the new 'design copyright' would create enormous private benefits - profits - for proponents of the legislation, at the expense of U.S. consumers.''
Product designers consider their work every bit as creative as that of painters and sculptors. But lobbyists for design protection argue that technical innovation is not the real issue. The bigger point, they say, is that companies invest millions of dollars to promote and market their designs, only to have imitators ride their coattails.
They also point out that governments in Europe and Japan have long maintained design protection. In fact, those countries have asked the United States to adopt stronger protection to cover their own products when imported here, and the issue is expected to come up in the next round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.
The main opponent to passage is Representative Kastenmeier, who heads the House subcommittee responsible for patent legislation. Indeed, the Senate passed similar measures five times before 1976, only to have the Wisconsin Democrat kill the measure through inaction.
Recently, Representative Kastenmeier described himself as a lonely skeptic. ''Almost everybody on my committee supports this legislation, except me,'' he said.
It remains unclear whether he will try to kill the bill again or yield to the wishes of his own party's leadership.

More New Magazines, And These Beckon To Black Readers

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
FROM Los Angeles to Boston, black entrepreneurs, swimming against the tide of falling advertising pages and high mortality rates in the magazine industry, are establishing magazines aimed principally at black readers.
Many are drawn to the business by a belief that an estimated $300 billion in spending power among American blacks in the 1990's will propel advertisers to search out new ways of reaching this market. A diversity of interests in the black community - from fashion and beauty to politics and the arts - also will feed a demand for their magazines, they say.
''The increase in black-oriented magazines is a result of the emerging black middle class and their varied interests,'' said Samuel J. Chisholm, president of the Mingo Group, a New York advertising agency specializing in targeting black consumers. ''And because the interests in the black community are varied, there seems to be a need for information that supports those varied interests.'' 
Today at least 25 black-oriented magazines are competing for a national readership. American Visions, a five-year-old magazine based in Washington, focuses on the arts, history and culture. The magazine began to turn a profit last December. New York-based Emerge, offering articles on politics and lifestyles to middle- and upper-income readers, made its debut last year. The magazine is 80 percent minority-owned, with Time Warner Inc. owning 20 percent. Reach New England, a Boston-based quarterly in its first year, is aimed at minority entrepreneurs in the region.
It often takes years for a new magazine to make a profit, and it is not surprising that Emerge and Reach New England are still in the red. Even in the best of times starting a magazine is a struggle. Figures from the Standard Rate and Data Service, a magazine reference guide, indicate that of the 225 magazines that have started since 1988, 119 have failed.
This year has been especially bad for the industry. Manhattan Inc. and 7 Days recently folded. Time's advertising pages were down 7.5 percent for the first six months of this year from the same period last year, and Ebony's were down 9.4 percent.
Like many magazines, Ebony is privately held, and its owner, Johnson Publishing Company, does not disclose profits. Another established leader of the market, Black Enterprise, which is owned privately by Earl Graves Ltd., reported sales of $15.1 million last year, up from $6.6 million in 1980. Newcomers are having a harder time attracting and keeping advertisers than these older black publications. They say that financing is difficult in a weak economy, that investors are warier than ever of highly risky ventures, and that advertisers are scarce.
Emerge has averaged only 20 advertising pages an issue. In recent issues ad pages rose, but it has yet to reach its break-even point of 35 pages (the magazine has scheduled 34.6 pages for its October anniversary issue). American Visions, on the other hand, sold 40 pages of ads in its June issue, double the number it needed to break even.
Experts say that some of the newer black publications have an edge: low overhead. With desktop publishing and new printing technologies, they have been able to start magazines without huge capital expense or personnel requirements. And some introduce their publications without the usual start-up costs associated with buying subscription lists and putting out expensive mailings.
 
Carving Out a Niche
These new publishers insist they have identified an important segment and that they are waiting for advertisers to arrive at the same conclusion. ''There is always a tight and small pie for black print media advertising dollars,'' said Wilmer C. Ames, editor of Emerge. ''But we're not competing against 1,000 magazines, and the market is growing by leaps and bounds.''
Others in the field are less optimistic. ''It is hard to believe that all of these new efforts will survive because, to most advertisers, black magazines are an afterthought,'' said Charles N. Jamison Jr., executive vice president of Jamison and Leary Advertising Inc. in New York, which specializes in the black consumer market. ''You will find enough advertising support for, say, three or four magazines on hunting alone to survive, but black magazines are not perceived as being a viable target.''
Advertisers privately say that they are already reaching black consumers through ads on television and in other magazines. A large share of the readership of GQ, Sports Illustrated and Elle is black, researchers say. And some advertisers say that with any one of those plus either Black Enterprise, Ebony, Essence or Jet, they can meet their advertising target.
''There is no real difference in the eyes of advertisers because a magazine is black,'' said Hugh J. O'Brien, executive vice president of the Dallas office of Bozell & Jacobs, which includes American Airlines, Greyhound and Dial among its clients.
''New publications have a hard time, because major advertisers are not willing to take a chance. Advertisers are not going to carve money out of a budget unless they have already defined that market as being of interest to them.''
''The advertising situation is the most frustrating part of running this magazine,'' said Keith T. Clinkscales, a 26-year-old Harvard Business School graduate who publishes Urban Profile, a two-year-old quarterly offering an 18- to 35-year-old black audience a mix of social commentary and political articles. ''It is difficult to convince makers of tennis shoes, soft-drink companies and major upscale cosmetics producers that there is a value to advertising in black media.''
''There is a certain invisibility of blacks in the eyes of the American business system, and that system doesn't like to extend parity to black business,'' said Rene John-Sandy, the publisher of Class, an 11-year-old magazine providing news, the arts and celebrity features to an American and Caribbean readership.
Despite the problems and the likelihood that some of these magazines will fail, publishers of older established publications and their newer counterparts say they hope that the market has room for all. ''There are 35 million blacks in the United States, and Ebony, Jet and Essence are only reaching about two million of them,'' Mr. John-Sandy said.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Noonan Q & A;
What She Said At the University

 BODY:
PEGGY NOONAN, speechwriter for Presidents Reagan and Bush, answered questions at a forum last week at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Following are excerpts:
Question: As the person who came up with the ''Read my lips - No new taxes'' phrase, what are the implications of that phrase for the future, now that it looks like that pledge is sort of wavering?
Answer: That tends to be the first question I'm asked these days. I think the change of the President's position on ''read my lips'' was truly a watershed event. The President and the Republican negotiators had better come up with a really good reason for the end of the read-my-lips vow. When you say really blunt, declarative things in a really blunt, declarative style, it will be memorable. And when people remember that you said it and then you change your mind, they will hang you with that sound bite. It was a real gamble on Bush's part. 
Q. Isn't it humbling to have been part of an era of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, according to government statistics, and a meaner America?
A. Humility for anybody who's been involved in any kind of public life is definitely appropriate, but my analysis of the past decade differs with yours. I do not see it as having been a retrogression at all. I do see it as a rather stirring time. Big things happened in the world. Communism was defeated. The American economy - I think we're in the 93d straight month of unprecedented growth.
Q. What about things like the banking and the housing scandals?
A. Well, the S.& L. thing is complex. As a staunch Republican, I could make a speech where we blame it on the Democrats. I think it is an awful, awful mess. And certainly in terms of the way we all live, and in terms of public policy, it is certainly a much bigger thing than stuff that loomed so large just a few years ago, like Iran-contra. But essentially, I think Reagan was a pretty good President. I think he will probably rank among the best of this century. I'm sorry to make you throw your head back like that. I guess you've read the Kevin Phillips book [''The Politics of Rich and Poor''].
Q. It seems one little sound bite can make or break you. Is this a necessary evil?
A. It's a media problem. The young people who do speeches for major politicians, they've heard the whole buzz about sound bites. And now instead of writing a speech, which is to say a serious text with serious argument, they just write sound bite after sound bite.
Q. Now that Communism seems to be declining, what fills the void as the major platform for the Republican Party?
A. I don't know. We're all depressed. Look, there will always be trouble. Somebody said the other day the big dividend of the peace dividend is peace. It doesn't mean you can tear up your entire defense structure. This isn't the end of history. Qaddafi will get the bomb - all sorts of interesting and horrible things could happen. So I personally don't mourn the departure of Communism as an issue.
Q. The Bush campaign staff must have been extremely happy with the big victory in 1988, but wasn't it a campaign full of name-calling and mud-slinging?
A. No it wasn't. There should have been more name-calling, mud-slinging and fun. It should have been rock-'em-sock'-em the way great campaigns have been in the past. It was tedious. As for name calling, there was just precious little. I think you are referring to what has been called the ugliness of the campaign in terms of the Willie Horton ads. Is that what you mean? I think the Willie Horton issue was a legitimate issue, and I don't think Bush has anything to regret in that area because it speaks of styles and ways of governance. In that case Dukakis's.
Q. Do you foresee that in 1982 or any time soon?
A. No. I think in '92 they'll still go through every day as saying, ''We got our one shot on the evening news and apart from that let's not make a mistake, because if we do that's the lead and we look stupid.'' What is the answer to that problem, I don't know. It is a media problem.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
In Europe, Immigrants Are Needed, Not Wanted

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
A BRIEF walk along any street in downtown London, Paris, Frankfurt or Milan immediately shows how immigration from the third world has turned many Western European cities into melting pots. But 30 years after this process began, a surge of racist incidents, smoldering hostility toward immigrants and new moves to keep out poor foreign workers show how Western Europe still has to come to terms with this change.
With new prosperity making Western Europe the most powerful magnet for poor immigrants after the United States, plans by the 12-nation European Community to eliminate its internal borders after 1992 have suddenly turned immigration into the region's most explosive social issue. In country after country, polls show that the public is strongly opposed to new immigration and, in some cases, even favors repatriation of some of the 12 million immigrants now in the region. 
Yet, as the United States has discovered in trying to curb the influx of undocumented aliens, economic forces - the flight from poverty and the chance of a relatively well-paid job - are invariably more effective in attracting new immigrants than border controls and hostility are in keeping them out.
The appeal of moving to Western Europe is steadily growing, not only to those without hope in the traditional emigrant countries of North Africa, but also to those newly unemployed in Eastern Europe. Today, just as young Moroccans risk their lives to reach Spain in small boats, the railroad stations of Berlin and Vienna are crowded with Poles, Romanians and others seeking a new life farther west. ''You don't have to be a visionary to predict that the Turks in Germany will be pushed into France and Spain or that Italy will soon face grave difficulties,'' a French commentator, Yann de l'Ecotais, wrote in L'Express magazine, referring to the 1.4 million Turks in West Germany and the growing numbers of North Africans in Italy.
In some places, immigrants have become the scapegoats for high unemployment, although they often do manual or low-paid jobs that natives refuse. And non-white or non-Christian immigrants are often seen as a threat to ethnic, religious and cultural traditions.
In the medium term, another force may come into play. With a slump in birth rates and a jump in life expectancy, experts believe that by the turn of the century Western Europe will need immigration to sustain its growth. ''In the coming years, Western Europe will have to coexist with hostility toward immigrants and a demand for immigrants,'' said Jean-Claude Chesnais, a population expert at France's National Institute of Demographic Studies.
But for today's politicians, the immediate priority is clear: to be seen to be addressing the immigration problem in such a way as to reassure electorates that their national identities are not about to be transformed by alien influences.
For example, in France, where anti-immigration feelings are feeding the growth of the extreme rightist National Front, the Socialist Government recently dropped plans to allow immigrants to vote in local elections, fearing it would lose more French votes than it would win immigrant votes. In Spain and Italy, countries with long traditions of emigration, governments are trying to reduce illegal immigration from North Africa. Similarly, London has ruled that no more than 250,000 Hong Kong Chinese will be granted British passports before the colony reverts to China in 1997.
When a single regional market is formed at the end of 1992, foreigners entering one European Community country could travel freely to the 11 others. Finding a common policy involves not only deciding which outsiders will require visas to enter the Community, but also insuring that illegal immigrants, political refugees, drug traffickers and terrorists do not profit from the border-free region. London, for example, insists on the right to check citizens from non-Community countries who enter from another Community country. Bonn favors a more liberal visa policy for Eastern Europe than France and Britain favor. Spain is alarmed at the prospect of having to demand visas of citizens from its former colonies in Latin America.
Aware that even stricter measures may be insufficient to neutralize the pull of prosperity and the push of poverty, the Community is also turning its focus toward aiding countries that export most migrants - although in Eastern Europe it is also motivated by the need to encourage democracy and capitalism.
In the case of North Africa, Spain, Italy, Portugal and France have decided to sponsor a more ambitious initiative. If successful, the planned Conference on Security and Development in the Mediterranean would not only address the relationship between immigration and North Africa's problems of poverty, population growth and unemployment, but would also tackle questions of security and economic development throughout the Mediterranean area.
Long-term programs of this kind, though, seem unlikely to alleviate the social tensions currently being stirred by the immigration problem. Rather, many politicians believe the only real answer lies in fully integrating existing immigrant communities. But most Western European countries still seem reluctant to accept that they have already become multi-ethnic societies.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The United Nations Comes of Age, Causing Some Anxiety

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
WITH the end of the cold war, the United States and the Soviet Union are forging a working alliance at the United Nations that offers the organization its first real chance in 45 years to function as it is supposed to.
The two superpowers and the three other permanent Security Council members - Britain, France and China - are finding that they can play their assigned role as custodians of international order, working together to try to resolve conflicts in the Persian Gulf, Namibia, Central America, Cambodia and the Western Sahara.
After Iraq's troops stormed into Kuwait last week, the Soviet Union and the United States were shoulder to shoulder again in the Security Council, running their first joint crisis-management exercise in the United Nations. They pushed through a resolution condemning the invasion and threatening Iraq with global economic sanctions if it did not pull out.
The more cooperative atmosphere within the Security Council is rubbing off on the General Assembly, encouraging the third-world majority there to drop its anti-Western polemics in favor of consensus. 
Over the last year, the General Assembly has unanimously endorsed the importance of free markets and democracy in development, banned ecologically harmful fishing nets, accepted white South Africans' right to safeguards under black rule and agreed to negotiate a treaty on stabilizing the world's climate by 1992, all at the urging of the United States and the Soviet Union.
But the superpowers' emerging partnership belies wide differences in their perceptions of the organization. It also arouses the suspicions of third world countries, who fear that the organization will become an instrument for imposing the views of the northern industrialized nations on the developing south.
''Since the renaissance at the United Nations is closely linked to the strengthened role of the permanent Security Council members, it raises fears in the south of an hegemonic directorate,'' Olga Pellicer, Mexico's deputy representative at the United Nations, said in a recent address.
In recent years the Soviet Union has gradually set forth a vision of the United Nations as the cornerstone of a more cooperative world order, guided by a powerful Security Council ready to intervene in crises and tackle environmental perils and other new threats to security.
Moscow has backed its vision with cash, agreeing to pay more than $210 million due the organization. This year it upgraded its presence at the United Nations by appointing a Deputy Foreign Minister, Yuli M. Vorontsov, as its new chief delegate.
But while Moscow was warming to the United Nations, Washington was lukewarm at best. For most of its two terms the Reagan Administration was openly contemptuous of the organization. President Bush, a former Ambassador to the United Nations, appears more sympathetic, but America's response to Moscow's change of heart remains cautious.
American diplomats argue that the existing machinery should be given a chance to work and stress the difficulty of financing grandiose initiatives like those suggested by Moscow.
Many members of Congress continue to view the United Nations and its agencies as inefficient, bloated bureacracies often hostile to American interests. Their skepticism has led to the withholding of $675 million due the organization.
 
Ending the East-West Deadlock
Washington and Moscow also differ sharply over the Middle East, with the United States opposing Soviet demands for a major United Nations role in making peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
In a new Council on Foreign Relations study, George L. Sherry, a former United Nations official, says America's caution may reflect the fact that it is torn between competing impulses.
After winning the cold war, Washington is tempted to pursue a unilateral foreign policy, he argues, as suggested by the Panama invasion. On the other hand, he says, Washington also knows it now has a rare chance ''to establish a peaceful, civilized world order.''
Sir Brian Urquhart, the former top peacekeeping official at the United Nations, said he believes that the United States is not moving fast enough to exploit Moscow's changed views and develop the peacekeeping potential of the organization. He likened present arrangements to ''a sheriff's posse'' that rides out only after the rustlers have gone.
The most dramatic manifestation of the new American-Soviet cooperation at the United Nations came in last year's jointly sponsored General Assembly resolution in which the two superpowers promised to work together to strengthen the United Nations.
The Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, John R. Bolton, the top Bush Admninistration official in charge of United Nations issues, said the resolution reflects ''major changes in our bilateral relationship that will end the East-West deadlock at the United Nations.'' Many observers believe that Moscow's enthusiasm for the United Nations stems directly from a commitment to change at home and reflects a belief that a more peaceful world will allow it to cut military spending and develop its own economy.
''For the Soviets the United Nations is emerging not as a vehicle of retreat but as a less costly and more legitimate way to influence events,'' wrote Thomas G. Weiss of Brown University and Meryl A. Kessler of Harvard University in a new study of Moscow's United Nations policy.
Although Moscow was looking for a better relationship with Washington before Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985, it was only in September 1987 that the Soviet leader set forth his view of a pivotal role for the United Nations. It came in a landmark article in Pravda uninvitingly titled ''The Reality and Guarantees of a Secure World.''
 
'A Wilsonian Vision'
During the cold war, Soviet leaders had treated the United Nations with suspicion, seeing it as at best a platform for anti-Western propaganda, at worst an obstacle to world revolution.
But in the article, Mr. Gorbachev offered what Prof. Richard N. Gardner of Columbia University calls ''a Wilsonian vision'' of a world ruled by international law, with a reinforced Security Council, expanded use of peacekeeping forces, a stronger World Court and new organs to deal with global challenges.
Many developing countries fear that the emerging United States-Soviet cooperation means that the superpowers will be tempted to impose the industrial world's priorities, like environmental protection, human rights and fighting the drug trade. Third-world nations fear that their overriding concerns, like debt, falling raw-material prices and developmental aid, will be overlooked.
''It is always their agenda, not ours,'' Mrs. Pellicer, the Mexican diplomat, said.
As a result, the third world is now fighting a rear-guard action against the superpowers' growing influence. Developing countries have thwarted efforts to give the Security Council a say in environmental matters and the war against narcotics.
While the Security Council is resolving some civil wars, Ethiopia, the Sudan, Somalia, Mozambique and Sri Lanka testily resist United Nations mediation in their internal conflicts.
Many diplomats say that the more assertive third world mood will make it harder to achieve new global agreements, particularly environmental accords that require developing countries to comply with new international standards.
And if the United Nations cannot produce global solutions, nations may prefer regional answers. As part of its efforts to knit a divided continent together, the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe plans its own institutions for resolving disputes, protecting the environment and enforcing human rights.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Operative Word in America: Deficit

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
CONGRESS is packing itself off for an August vacation, leaving untouched the nasty business of cutting enough spending and raising enough taxes to squeeze $50 billion out of the ever-swelling budget deficit.
If the scene sounds familiar, it should. It has been played and replayed for more than a decade by lawmakers and the Administration as resolve gives way to blue smoke and mirrors. But this time the stakes on all sides are higher.
What distinguishes this year's budget drama is the sheer size of the deficit: as much as $232 billion for 1991, even by the Administration's estimate, when the cost of bailing out the savings and loan industry is included. Even under the most optimistic forecasts, the numbers get worse before they get better. 
The message lawmakers will take home to constituents is that at least for the foreseeable future, any ''peace dividend'' from the end of the cold war will be washed away by the sea of red ink. But the message that could have much more significance is the one of deepening frustration and cynicism that constituents seem to be sending back.
''People are mad about the savings and loans, about the HUD scandal, about the budget,'' said Representative Mickey Edwards, an Oklahoma Republican. ''The perception out there is that 'we called the leaders and there was nobody home.' Every incumbent ought to take a poll; what they'd find is that their ratings are 10 points lower than they think.''
But frustration also afflicts the lawmakers as they try, with little effect, to reward or serve or at least placate their constituents. For the last decade most creative energy in Washington has been devoted not to policymaking but to budget legerdemain - and to avoiding the automatic spending cuts that are supposed to provide the threat of discipline.
Meanwhile, lawmakers and Administration officials have learned that there is little percentage in inventing programs for which there is no money, and little reward in making things work better when what matters politically is the appearance that the deficit is being reduced.
From the beginning, the $120 billion Medicare program, which helps cover health care costs for the elderly, was and continues to be a convenient place to look for savings. Too convenient as far as Gordon H. Russell is concerned.
Mr. Russell is the administrator of the Hi-Plains Hospital, Nursing Home and Clinic in Hale Center, Tex., one of hundreds of rural hospitals feeling the severe pinch of Federal cuts.
The private hospital, which serves several communities with a total population of about 20,000, was built in 1946 and operated profitably until 1983, when Congress changed the Medicare reimbursement formula to save money.
The problem, Mr. Russell said, was that under the new formula rural hospitals got less than urban hospitals but still had to compete in the same markets for staff and supplies. ''A year ago we were in critical condition and had to borrow to pay salaries,'' he said. ''We're fragile now, and we're holding our breath on what will happen this year with the budget talks in Washington.''
Many health policy experts say the Federal budget crunch has only accelerated a trend that was inevitable, the closing of rural hospitals that are simply too inefficient and unprofitable. But a senior Congressional budget aide who shares that view argues that it misses the point.
''The Federal Government made a decision at the end of World War II to subsidize the country,'' the aide said. ''Over the course of the 1980's, that decision has effectively been reversed.
''It may be the correct policy, but the shift has occurred not because lawmakers decided it was a good idea, but rather because they were backfitting policy to meet budget deficit demands.''
Those demands seem infinite. Donald F. Kettl, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, said that although the savings and loan debacle has become the focal point for the cynicism and mistrust of Government, other big fiscal messes are on the way.
''I don't think the real economic, political and programmatic effects of a decade of deficit politics have come home to roost yet,'' he said. ''There are more monsters out there: the nuclear waste cleanup, the Medicare trust fund, F.H.A. and the unemployment insurance trust fund.''
One of the most far-reaching effects of the Federal budget crunch has been a shifting of the burden for many social welfare programs to the states. During the early years of the Reagan Administration, this was called ''New Federalism,'' an approach meant to give the states more control over the design and administration of their programs and premised on the notion that cutting Federal taxes would still leave the states some room to increase their own.
Many states did. But as the Federal Government's own budget problems have grown, forcing President Bush to abandon his no-new-taxes pledge, Washington has looked to higher Federal taxes on beer, wine, alcohol, cigarettes and gasoline - all of which have been traditional sources of revenue for state and local governments.
A leaked Administration proposal that calls for limits on deductions for state and local income taxes may never formally make it to the budget negotiating table, but the idea brought protests even from states that have little or no revenue from local income taxes as well as from those, like New York, that depend heavily on them.
''Congress reached its limit and discovered the states as a credit card,'' said one state budget official, referring both to the tax proposals and to Federal mandates for expansion of the Medicaid program, under which states share the costs. ''We're already in trouble out here, and the last thing we need is more help from our friends on the Potomac.''
 
Between Branches
A decade of futile efforts in Washington to bring down the deficit has also had more subtle effects on the Government, increasing the inherent strains between between Congress and the White House and undermining the internal balance of power in Congress, even fundamentally altering the way that Congress conducts its business.
''When the first thing you have to ask is what does it cost and where do you get the money, it totally distorts the policy process,'' said Robert Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan economic research agency that Congress created in 1974 to act as a counterweight to the President's Office of Management and Budget.
''Congress doesn't do what it used to do, look at problems and try to fashion solutions,'' he said.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, refers to a conspiracy, a deliberate plot by President Reagan and his top economic advisers to blunt Congressional power by running up defense spending and cutting taxes so that the resulting deficit would ''strangle the beast.''
Professor Kettl, at the University of Wisconsin, said that while deficit politics may have initially given the White House the upper hand with Congress, the Presidency has also suffered.
''The President has lost his ability to announce any new initiative that costs money,'' Professor Kettl said. ''That's why you see these symbolic causes - the flag, abortion, family values.''
Mr. Moynihan agreed, lamenting especially the loss of American influence at a time of dramatic change in the world. ''They wanted to strangle the beast and they ended up paralyzing the Government,'' he said. ''At the moment in foreign policy we've waited for and worked toward for half a century, we're broke.''

HEADLINE: POWER GRAB;
Iraq Makes Its Bid to Run the Show in the Middle East

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR years now President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has been the bad boy of Arab politics, a classic bully who lived by the credo that crime pays and absolute crime pays absolutely. The Iraqi strongman was at it again last week, invading his neighbor Kuwait, holding up the whole country for its oil and gold, and then daring the world to do something about it.
The Iraqi heist set off alarm bells across the Arab world, in international financial markets and in the corridors of power from Washington to Moscow to Jerusalem. The shock was compounded by the fact that after all the velvet revolutions in Eastern Europe in 1989, the world had been lulled into thinking that such naked acts of aggression were a thing of the past. That was an illusion. Indeed, the Iraqi actions and the global reactions revealed many enduring truths about both international and Arab politics.
For the Arab world, the Iraqi blitzkrieg on Thursday was simply the latest version of the oldest power game in the Middle East: the struggle between Egypt and Mesopotamia, Iraq's ancient forebear, for regional domination. In this game a decisive winner would get all the countries in between. 
Because Iran, the traditional counterbalance to Baghdad in the Persian Gulf, had its strength sapped by the nearly decade-long war with Iraq, in the last two years Saddam Hussein has been relatively free to throw his weight around the neighborhood and begin competing again with Egypt for broader Arab leadership. President Hussein invaded Kuwait in order to steal enough money and oil resources to finance the panoply of big-ticket projects he wants to build to speed Iraq's recovery: steel mills, railroads, petrochemical plants.
But in the struggle between Baghdad and Cairo neither side ever seems to win decisively - at least for long - because of the natural tendency of all the states in between to band together and form a counterbalance. That realignment started last year when Syria began cozying up to Egypt, even making positive noises about peace with Israel, while Egypt itself, long shunned for its relations with Israel, was embraced anew by the Arab oil states just as Saddam Hussein's shadow began to darken their doorsteps.
This realignment offers intriguing possibilities for Washington. If ever there was a time when it might want to try to patch up its relations with Syria and Iran it is now, when they share an interest in restraining President Hussein; Administration officials say they have already communicated that sentiment to Damascus and Teheran.
But in this never-ending do-si-do of nations, there is more at stake than simply who dances with whom. What is at stake is who sets the agenda for the Arab world and for OPEC. If Iraq gets away with devouring Kuwait and intimidating all its neighbors, a climate of fear will be created in the Arab world that could make it impossible for Egypt to continue trying to promote Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. What Egyptian or Palestinian would risk defying the line laid down in Baghdad of unremitting hostility to Israel? And how could Saudi Arabia maintain its policy of keeping oil prices down so the West does not develop alternative energy sources, when Saddam Hussein, who wants prices to soar, will be sitting on King Fahd's doorstep with a loaded pistol aimed at his head?
For the Kuwaitis themselves, the Iraqi invasion brought to an end a double game they had been trying to play for years. Kuwait, like most other Gulf oil sheikdoms, was less a country than a family-owned oil company with a flag and a seat at the United Nations. No wonder that Iraq's initial fierce attack with tanks, artillery and air strikes suppressed Kuwaiti resistance so effectively that Baghdad was able to send in its reinforcements by bus.
Like its neighbors, Kuwait had survived by its wits, buying off an enemy here and shifting alliances there to stay ahead of the power curve. But it had always wanted it both ways. The Kuwaitis wanted the superpowers to hang around the Gulf to protect them from bullies like Saddam Hussein, but they always wanted them to hang around in someone else's backyard so their Arab nationalist credentials would not be tarnished by accusations of contracting with a colonial power for protection.
Throughout the 1980's, while the Iran-Iraq war raged, the United States literally begged the Kuwaitis and other Gulf states to put some teeth into their strategic relationships by granting the Americans basing or naval installations, even if only for maneuvers. Every time, they got a polite ''No thanks.'' Sure, the Kuwaitis whispered, they wanted American protection - but with no hands.
But in a wilderness of tigers like the Middle East, no one respects no-hands diplomacy. So it was probably only a matter of time before the Iraqi tiger, which has long coveted Kuwait and nibbled at it before, devoured the little Croesus. It was also no surprise that Kuwait's five allies in the Gulf Cooperation Council - lately dubbed by some Middle East analysts as the Gulf Capitulation Council - suddenly forgot that they had signed a mutual defense pact agreeing to defend any member that is attacked. Maybe next time.
Indeed, for the whole Arab world the invasion highlighted the degree to which the region has fallen behind the times. In an era when dictators have been ousted throughout Eastern Europe, just across the Mediterranean, the Arab world is still consumed by tribal feuds and dominated by the same class of leaders who have been in power in many cases since the 1960's. The region is innocent of glasnost or perestroika, velvet revolutions or democracy movements. History knocked on the Arab world in 1990, and nobody answered - nobody but Saddam Hussein.
For Israel, the invasion is a mixed blessing. Militarily speaking, Israeli officials are wishing Iraq and its Arab neighbors a long and healthy war. The longer the better. The more energy they expend on each other the less they will have left for Israel. Politically speaking, the Iraqi invasion is also good news for the right-wing Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, since it underscores his argument that the real source of instability in the region is not the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but rather the threat posed by aggressive, belligerent Arab states.
To be sure, Mr. Shamir has a point. The Middle East is a bad neighborhood, and the weak-kneed Arab response to the Iraqi invasion raises a legitimate point from the Israeli perspective: If they won't stand up for Kuwait, imagine what would happen with us? If Israel relinquishes land for a peace treaty, how long would that treaty be honored if some Arab tough guy like Saddam Hussein orders everyone to tear it up?
But this can also become an excuse for Israel to sit back and do nothing. The political danger now, argued Galia Golan, an Israeli expert on superpower involvement in the Middle East, is that the Shamir Government will use the invasion, and the diversion of attention it creates, to escape from making any hard choices on the Palestinian issue. ''Just because Iraq is dangerous does not change the fact that we have 1.7 million Palestinians living under our control,'' said Ms. Golan. ''That problem is not going to go away, simply because the world is looking in another direction.''
As for the United States and the Soviet Union, their joint response to the Iraqi invasion has demonstrated that in a post-cold war world they really have stopped competing in most regional conflicts. Ten years ago, the Soviets would undoubtedly have shielded their ally Iraq from world condemnation and economic sanctions. This time, instead, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze got together with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in Moscow and issued a joint condemnation of Iraq and called on all countries to cut off the aggressor's supply of arms.
This not only reflected attitudinal changes in the Kremlin, but also a sense of where Soviet economic interests lie. In the 1990's, neither superpower has an interest in promoting tribal ambitions that might interrupt the world's oil supplies. Even if the fighting in the Arabian Peninsula goes no further, the uncertainties are already raising prices at American gasoline pumps and threatening to interfere with Washington's efforts to avoid a recession. And a healthy Western economy is something even Mikhail S. Gorbachev needs if he is to attain his long-range goals of revitalizing his society through cooperation with the West. What Will Work? The bad news, though, is that the superpowers have joined hands about 10 years too late. If they had been able to cooperate a decade ago, when the two of them had a near-monopoly on the world arms trade, they might have been able to impose any solution they wanted.
But today, said Mark Heller of Tel Aviv University's Stategic Studies Center, the idea of a Soviet-American condominium in a multipolar world is obsolete, which is precisely why President Bush has not only turned to Moscow but to the European Community, NATO and the United Nations for help in building opposition to Iraq. But how long will they hold together?
''The idea of a Soviet arms cutoff to Iraq is an empty threat,'' Mr. Heller said. ''The same with economic sanctions. Too many other people are in the arms business today. Economic power has become too diffused as well. The Iraqis can get arms from China to Brazil, and after a few months half the world will be buying their oil. It is probably no accident that the United States and Soviet Union can only converge at a time when it is no longer meaningful.''
So the United States and the rest of the world are groping for the right response to Iraq. They will always be at a disadvantage, though, as long as they are not playing the game by the same rules as Saddam Hussein -which are no rules at all. One should never come to a hockey game prepared only to play by the rules of touch football. The Middle East is a hockey game - with no referee.

HEADLINE: VIEWS OF SPORT;
P.G.A. MUST GO BEYOND TOKEN CHANGE

BYLINE: By SAM LACY; Sam Lacy is the sports editor for the Afro-American Newspapers.

 BODY:
Once again racism has met its match: money.
And a segment of southern black leadership has retreated to embrace tokenism.
The P.G.A. Championship golf tournament will proceed this weekend under a facade of harmony because the host agreed to a pseudo-desegregation.
The Shoal Creek Country Club near Birmingham, Ala., accepted a black insurance executive, Louis Willie, as an honorary member on Tuesday, ending its tradition of ''No Blacks Allowed'' and thus quieting the furor raised by its racist policy. 
But acceptance came only after six powerful sponsors - I.B.M., American Honda, Toyota, Anheiser Busch, Lincoln Mercury and Spalding - pressured the P.G.A. of America, which runs the P.G.A., with withdrawal of their television advertising support.
And it should be noted that Willie's status for the weekend is ''honorary,'' a condition that can be terminated at will - possibly as early as Monday.
The fact that the P.G.A. of America scheduled its championship at a site where black membership is excluded actually came as no surprise. To blacks who follow golf, the surprise was that the P.G.A. had the audacity to claim it was not aware of the Shoal Creek policy of discrimination. Or that professional golf has a history of fielding its events in an atmosphere of exclusivity.
Augusta National, in the wake of the Shoal Creek episode, has announced a willingness to consider blacks as applicants for membership.
The National, home of the fabled Masters, maintained not only a ban on membership but on tournament entry by black players as well until 1976. That was the year Lee Elder waded through the tournament's maze of eligibility requirements and gained what many blacks believe to be a begrudging invitation.
It also was the year that the writer felt the retentive sting of bigotry at the Masters.
Armed with bona fide press credentials for the major events of baseball, football, boxing, plus Forest Hills and five Olympics, my organization, Afro-American Newspapers, requested similar courtesy to cover the Elder story at the Augusta National.
The late Clifford Roberts, self-styled Master of the Masters, extended ''sideline privileges'' with the stern warning that the holder would find the press tent ''off limits.''
There are hundreds of golf and country clubs throughout the nation that cling to a rigid ban on black participation. And, although they do not expect to be placed on the PGA schedule, these clubs reflect the attitude of Shoal Creek.
Moreover, Shoal Creek's earlier defense that it is difficult to find a black willing to pay the $35,000 initiation fee to join is ludicrous. For example, a similar explanation was used at the Salisbury Country Club in Midlothian, Va., near Richmond until 1977.
That was when a pro football hall of famer, Willie Lanier, applied for membership. At the time Lanier had just retired from an illustrious career as captain of the Kansas City Chiefs and was back in his native Richmond to accept a job as director of labor relations for the Phillip Morris Company. Salisbury turned him down. Concluding that he had not been in the area long enough to protest, Lanier urged Dr. Tom Wright, a longtime local physician, to apply for membership at the club.
Wright also was rejected, but the doctor immediately filed suit attacking the tax-exempt status of Salisbury.
The local court ruled in favor of the club, but that judgment was hastily reversed in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Both Lanier and Wright told this writer later that neither was interested in becoming a member; they simply wanted to establish the right of any black to join if he or she so desired.
Lanier today is vice president of the Wheat-First Securities Corp., which recently underwrote a $29 million bond issue to aid Morgan State University, Lanier's alma mater.
There is further evidence that black economics is not a plausible excuse for putting down black participation at many country clubs. In November 1988, a young black man named Charlie Vinson was in Ocala, Fla., to spend a weekend with a white friend at whose wedding he served as best man. His host, Don Delprete, is the son of a 20-year member of Ocala's Golden Hills Country Club.
As a gesture to his son, the father, Danny Delprete, made reservations two weeks in advance for Don's group to play 18 holes at Golden Hills in lieu of a bachelor party. But when Don and his friends showed up at the appointed tee time, the club pro said he had not been informed that ''this black guy'' would be among them. The rest could play but Vinson, was not welcome.
Vinson at the time was an Emmy Award winner, a five-time recipient of Tony Awards, a producer of ''The Cosby Show,'' ''Motown Returns,'' ''Benson,'' ''Christmas in Washington 1987'' and ''The Martin Luther King Special.''
It should be noted, though, that country clubs were not alone in their zeal to retain an all-white fraternity in golf. Cities in some areas helped to perpetuate the system.
The writer and many of his acquaintances encountered this reality early in life. While there was no attempt ever to gain membership in a country club, personal rejection came from various sources.
Public courses in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia held firm to antiblack policies. In Washington, for instance, only a nine-hole course in West Potomac Park was available. That course and the Carroll Park course in Baltimore were equipped with sand greens, none of which were larger than the average rug in an inner-city home.
Moreover, at Carroll Park, a public course operated by the city in Baltimore, it wasn't until the mid-1950's that blacks were allowed to play more than one day in a week.
That ended under the threat of a lawsuit by the Afro-American Newspapers vice president, D. Arnett Murphy, and a group of his business and professional associates.
Under that threat golf and tennis facilities in Baltimore were thrown open, though with a measure of undisguised revulsion.
Finally, it is ironic that the P.G.A. now finds itself in a deep sweat when it has never before shown any sign of sensitivity regarding black protest. And it is obvious that its present concern is only brought about by the withdrawal of support by powerful corporate sponsorships and their money.
For years the P.G.A. was aloof to black disenchantment, issuing invitations to Gary Player, Harold Henning, David Black, John Fourie and others from South Africa, all of whom represent - even if they do not publicly espouse - the vicious apartheid system of government in a homeland they support with money won on American golf courses.
So, when one considers this continuing indifference to black concerns it is not hard for one writer to believe the P.G.A. deserves to squirm a little.

HEADLINE: GOLF;
Golf Strikes Sensitive Nerve

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
The last time Louis J. Willie used his golf clubs, he played on a public course in Birmingham, Ala. Willie's most vivid memory of the day was having to tee the ball up on every shot to avoid breaking his clubs on rocks that dotted the course. That was in 1970. Twenty years later, as the result of a bizarre chain of events that has shaken the golf establishment, Willie is able to play the silklike greens and picture book fairways of the Shoal Creek Country Club in Shoal Creek, Ala.
Last week, club officials conferred honorary membership status on the 66-year-old businessman, making him the club's first black member. The appointment also temporarily ended a controversy that has engulfed Birmingham for the last three weeks and threatened to mar the P.G.A. Championship that begins at Shoal Creek on Thursday.
But while the club's move was an effective end run around Shoal Creek's immediate problems, the three-week episode has sparked protest and stirred debate within the black golfing community. 
From celebrity players like Michael Jordan to wealthy entrepreneurs and avid golfers with average incomes, the Shoal Creek incident opened several old wounds, pricked sensitive nerves and raised new, penetrating questions for many blacks about access and acceptance.
Ironically, Willie, who moved from Texas to Birmingham 33 years ago and heads the largest black-owned insurance company in Birmingham, said he accepted the membership to keep the peace.
''It's not embarassing to me at all to accept an honorary membership,'' said Willie, who joins 10 other honorary members at Shoal Creek. ''We defused an explosive situation in this city. Now the city is calm and peace is in the making.
''This doesn't have primary importance,'' he added. ''Joining a country club was never a high priority in my life. I'm 66 years old. My goal was never to join a country club. My main goal was to build a business, hire people, employ people, going to church saying prayers.''
Asked if he thought that the Shoal Creek move, forced by economic sanctions and another week of negative publicity, lacked a moral imperative, Willie said he thought that it did not. Birmingham stands to gain an estimated $30 million in revenues as a result of PGA-related business.
''It does have a moral ring to it,'' he said. ''Suppose they went ahead with the picketing and the pickets were met by violence and someone was killed. Isn't it moral to keep peace? Isn't it moral to keep people from dying?''
For others, Willie's appointment and much of the PGA's deference appeared precipitated by economics, not morality. Thus, the issue of whether substantial change is in the offing is not clear.
''That was totally a move to push some of the controversy away from the tournament,'' Jordan said Thursday in an interview with The Omaha World Herald. ''I think its going to be very interesting to see when the next official member, not honorary, but the next official member is going to be invited into that club.''
Jordan belongs to four country clubs: in Durham, N.C.; North Barrington, Ill., outside Chicago; San Diego, and Hilton Head, S.C. Each of the clubs he belongs to was established within the last two years.
''I've never had a problem getting in,'' he said. ''I guess that's one of the advantages of being who I am or being the projected person that I am. I've never tried to apply to all-men's clubs, all-Jewish clubs or anything like that. I've never even thought about it.
''But because of that whole incident,'' Jordan said, referring to Shoal Creek, ''I think it's something you have to look at and evaluate.''
While Jordan's stature allows him to play as a guest on some the nation's most exquisite courses it is interesting to note that the clubs to which he belongs are new counterparts of old established clubs in the same area whose policies have been questioned.
But for several black executives and athletes, Shoal Creek encapsules a continuing deep-rooted struggle for equal access to the nation's resources and pleasures.
''This is really not a sports issue,'' said Arthur Ashe, a former Wimbledon and United States Open tennis champion. ''It has very little to do with sports; sports is just a catalyst. The issue here is access. One of the last bastions of exclusion and nonacceptance of African Americans is about to capitulate.''
Ashe belongs to the semiprivate Doral Country Club in Florida, where he has been the tennis director for 20 years. While he has received offers from members of two clubs to pursue membership, Ashe said that status, reputation and income have not been tickets into elite, exclusionary clubs.
''If I would have lived in Birmingham, I would not be a member of Shoal Creek; I would not have been offered a membership,'' Ashe said.
He also disagreed with the notion that the country-club issue is more economic than ethnic.
''Hall Thompson let the cat out the bag,'' Ashe said, referring to the Shoal Creek founder.
''He said, 'Look, we don't discriminate against anyone except blacks.' A lot of clubs have Japanese members who are not even American citizens. You are favoring foreigners over native-born Americans who can afford it and have corporate credentials. It's got very little to do with economics.''
For several black professionals, country-club membership is no longer a luxury item. Golf and club membership are seen as essential tools of the corporate trade. The more elite, the better.
''It is an opportunity to conduct networking among people who are the movers and shakers in this society,'' said Donald Watkins, a civil and corporate attorney based in Birmingham.
Last week Watkins volunteered to be Shoal Creek's first black regular member and said that he was prepared to pay the $35,000 initiation fee.
''I viewed it as a business opportunity and a business investment,'' he said. He noted, however, that Shoal Creek was not a grass-roots issue in Birmingham.
''This was not a high-priority issue in the black community because it only affects a handful of blacks,'' he said. ''There are other pressing problems that the city has to deal with, like job opportunities and housing.''
Bobby Thomas said that he finds it difficult to empathize with well-heeled black business people who, he thinks, are involved in an elitist protest.
Thomas, 64, is a barber at Myrtle's His & Hers shop in Brooklyn and describes himself as an avid and serious golfer. He has played for more than 20 years and never belonged to a country club.
''I considered it once, but I figured it wasn't necessary,'' he said. ''I feel that golf is a recreation sport; it's an outlet. I don't feel discriminated against because I play with all people. If I go as a single, I'll team up with people of other ethnic groups and we just have fun.
''When you get to the point where being in the club is almost like politics, then you're not there just to relax and enjoy yourself. It's just an extension of the type of thing we're trying to eliminate. For me, it's recreation. I don't see color. I play the sport.''
Of course, for the pure golfer, there are advantages to playing courses at well-appointed country clubs and they have little to do with politics and making deals.
''By and large most municipal golf courses are designed, not so you can enjoy what you're doing, but so you can play and get off,'' said Eddie Payton, the head golf coach at Jackson State University and a former National Football League running back.
Payton, whose younger brother, Walter, is the N.F.L.'s leading career rusher, is a highly regarded amateur golfer and has played on many of the nation's exclusive courses with ideal facilities and conditions.
The lack of easy access to these country-club conditions, he said, adversely affects the development of young black golfers.
''Most of the college coaches that I know won't give a kid whose high school team plays at a municipal golf course a second look over a kid who plays in the country clubs because they figure their game is going to be more advanced,'' he said.
Robert Brown was raised in a poor section of High Point, N.C. Now he is founder and chief executive officer of B & C Associates in High Point. Brown is a member of the Pinehurst (N.C.) Country Club, the Pinehurst National Country Club and the Old Waverly Country CLub in Westpoint, Miss. For him, the lesson of Shoal Creek is not economics or opportunity but the stark emphasis placed on race.
''When I was growing up, it was hard for me to conceive that I would ever have enough money to get some expensive golf clubs and to buy expensive golf balls,'' he said. ''Now I probably have 10 sets of golf clubs, and I've got more balls than I'll ever know what to do with and I belong to three country clubs. That to me is the great thing about this country.
''But if a young black person is coming up now, has enough money, meets all the criteria, crosses all the T's and dots all the I's, and then somebody tells them that can't do this because they're black, that's going to cause animosity and great friction in this country and we don't need that.''
''If a group wants to be segregated, they should be, but you don't have the right to be a part of any kind of public institution,'' he added.
''I don't think they should get any kind of tax breaks and I don't want them to advertise any of these I.B.M. computers that I buy. I don't want to advertise for anything that I or anybody in this country who happens to be black or a woman can't be a part of. I abhor that and I intend to fight it with every fiber in me, and I think that most black people feel the same way. Even the ones who don't play golf.''

HEADLINE: Study Says U.S. Needs to Attack Infant Mortality

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug 5.

 BODY:
A high-level Bush Administration study calls for spending about $500 million a year more to reduce the infant mortality rate in the United States, now higher than in 19 other countries, including Singapore and East Germany.
The report, which reminds the Administration of President Bush's campaign promise to ''invest in our children,'' was begun more than a year ago and appears to have been put on hold.
''A nation's destiny lies in its children,'' says a confidential draft of the report by the White House Task Force on Infant Mortality, which includes officials from nine Cabinet departments. It says Mr. Bush should ''build a fence of national urgency'' and raise the issue of infant mortality to the top of the public policy agenda because ''this country cannot afford its current infant mortality rate in economic or in human terms.'' 
 
Difficult Campaign Promise
The report said that merely through the application of existing knowledge, the United States could prevent 10,000 of the 40,000 infant deaths that occur in this country each year. The same techniques, including improved prenatal care, could also prevent vision and hearing loss, mental retardation and other handicaps that afflict 100,000 newborns each year, the panel said.
''The United States has not achieved its national goals for reducing infant mortality,'' said the study group, headed by Dr. James O. Mason, Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, who served as director of the Centers for Disease Control from 1983 to 1989. ''Unacceptable racial disparities and significant geographic inequities are still evident, and progress in reducing the rate of infant mortality has slowed significantly, especially among blacks.''
A copy of the report was obtained from an official involved in the study who supported the recommmendations and felt that they were being ignored. Others involved in the study said it had been shelved because it was an inconvenient reminder of Bush campaign promises that would be difficult to keep.
Alixe R. Glen, a deputy White House press secretary, said the study, begun in July 1989 by the task force for the President's Domestic Policy Council, was continuing and would probably be completed late this month or early next month.
Another Administration official said the report had been sent back to Dr. Mason's group for further work. ''There is nothing politically or intellectually wrong with it,'' the official said. ''But it's not ready for prime time.'' Blacks at Twice the Risk The draft report comes to light at a time when Congress and the Administration are considering cuts in a wide range of domestic programs, including those the report described as effective in reducing infant mortality and disability.
The draft noted that the infant mortality rate for blacks had ''consistently been about twice the white infant mortality rate.'' It said the disparity reflected ''the cumulative consequences of poverty from preceding generations.''
The task force said steps recommended in the report would save money in the long run but would increase costs to Federal and state governments in the short term.
''Early prenatal care has been shown to reduce the cost of medical services to both infants and children,'' the report said. Hospital care for low-birthweight babies costs $2 billion a year, it said, and ''each infant death represents an estimated $380,000 in lost productivity.'' Babies with birthweights of under 5.5 pounds account for nearly 60 percent of infant deaths.
 
Failing National Goals
The infant mortality rate measures the number of deaths in the first year of life for every 1,000 live births. In 1987, the last year for which final data are available, the overall rate for the United States was 10.1. The rate was 17.9 for blacks and 8.6 for whites.
More than a decade ago the Public Health Service declared a goal of reducing the nation's infant mortality rate to 9 by 1990, and it said no racial group should have a rate exceeding 12. Neither goal is likely to be achieved. Dr. Joel C. Kleinman, director of analysis at the National Center for Health Statistics, said the Government was projecting an infant mortality rate of 9.2 for the nation this year. For blacks, the projected rate is 16.6.
The tone of the report was reflected in its epigraph, from the Talmud: ''If we save but one life, we save the world.''
 
'A Very Sad Document'
The report recommends 18 specific steps costing a total of $480 million a year, or roughly one-tenth of 1 percent of the total spent annually on personal health care in the United States. The steps include expansion of Medicaid to cover 120,000 additional pregnant women and children in low-income families, an increase in Federal spending on prenatal care and a requirement for states to provide a uniform set of Medicaid benefits to pregnant women.
Parts of the White House study sound like reports from the Children's Defense Fund, a nonprofit group that lobbies for children. When shown a copy of the report, Sara Rosenbaum, program director of the fund, said: ''It's a very sad document. It confirms what we and others have been saying about the effectiveness of prenatal care and Federal programs. We could be saving 10,000 lives and sparing 100,000 infants from disability every year.''
The report quotes from a paper issued by the Bush campaign in October 1988: ''We must give our children a better start in the world. George Bush will see that quality health services so critical for improving maternal and infant health will be available to the pregnant women and young children in our nation.''
The panel said the Government could reduce infant mortality by expanding Federal programs to deter smoking, drinking and drug abuse during pregnancy.
 
Conference on Infant Health
In addition, it urges President Bush to convene a White House conference on children, with infant health as the major theme. ''Each state will be encouraged to hold a governor's conference on infant mortality before the White House conference,'' it said.
The study said employers should be encouraged or required to cover prenatal care if they offer health insurance to employees. ''Nearly nine million women of childbearing age have no health insurance,'' it said. ''One-fourth of all mothers either begin prenatal care after the first trimester or receive no prenatal care at all.''
States are required to offer Medicaid coverage to pregnant women and children under 6 years of age if the family income is no more than 33 percent over the Federal poverty level. The White House panel said the income limit should be set at 50 percent above the poverty level, which would add 70,000 women and 50,000 infants to the Medicaid rolls. For a family of four, the poverty level was $12,675 last year. The report said Japan had proved that ''with a national commitment and accessible health services it is possible to make substantial improvements in infant health.'' Japan's infant mortality rate was 20 percent higher than the United States' in 1960, but is now the lowest in the world, about half the American figure, the report said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Forces Evacuate 74 After Threats in Liberia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
A reinforced company of 225 United States Marines flew into Liberia today to evacuate Americans and foreign dependents, after a rebel leader threatened to start taking foreign prisoners.
State Department officials said that 74 people, almost all of them American Embassy officials and their dependents, were flown to a Marine vessel off the coast of Liberia.
But more than 300 Americans remain in Liberia, including some United States citizens who may be unable to reach the evacuation point at the embassy compound in Monrovia because of the fighting in the capital, State Department officials said.
 
A Dual Threat for Foreigners
In recent weeks, Americans and other foreign nationals were under threat not only because of the fighting between Government forces and rebels, but also due to clashes involving rival rebel factions. The bloody war has been stalemated in recent weeks, with President Samuel K. Doe's troops controlling only a small portion of central Monrovia. 
Relief workers, missionaries and diplomats say that at least 3,000 mostly unarmed civilians have been killed and many more wounded since rebels began the war to oust the President Doe last December. The Government and rebel leaders have predicted that many more are sure to die as fighting intensifies in the capital.
The American military operation appears to have been spurred by a threat from a rebel leader in Monrovia, Prince Johnson, to start arresting Americans and other foreigners to force foreign intervention.
Mr. Johnson, whose troops have occupied much of the city, including the diplomatic enclave at Mamba Point, where the American Embassy is situated, told reporters on Saturday that his roundup would begin on Monday, focusing first on American, British, Lebanese and Indian civilians. But he insisted they would not be harmed.
 
West African Nations to Meet
Although there appears to be no enthusiasum from Western governments to be drawn into Liberia's war, there are moves under way among a number of West African nations to intervene. The latest developments are expected to be discussed on Monday in Gambia, where leaders of the Economic Community of West African states called an emergency meeting to discuss a plan to send an intervention force to Liberia and to rescue foreign nationals and try to establish a cease-fire. [In Lagos, Nigeria, Reuters reported that Government officials said Nigeria was mobilizing a joint army, naval and airborne force with three other countries to secure a cease-fire. The force could move soon after receiving the backing of the Economic Community meeting.] President Bush ordered the evacuation after a meeting on Saturday at Camp David with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and General Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
 
Marines' Presence Indefinite
The White House notified Congress of the action at 4 A.M. and announced it several hours laters, saying that a reinforced rifle company of 225 Marines moved by helicopter from their ships off Liberia to the American Embassy compound. The company is to join the Marine Guard at the embassy and a total of 237 Marines are to remain indefinitely to guard the embassy and remaining staff, including the Ambassador, Peter De Vos. The United States plans to maintain a staff of 41 officials at the embassy.
''The Marines will remain in Liberia as long as necessary to insure the safety of U.S. citizens in that country,'' the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said.
''The Marines are there to protect lives,'' Mr. Fitzwater added. ''They are authorized to use whatever means are necessary to do that. And they are there in a battle situation. And we have notified the Congress to that effect.''
The Marines at the embassy are a small part of the 2,100 Marine Amphibious Ready Group deployed off Liberia on four ships, including the U.S.S. Saipan, an amphibious landing ship, and a destroyer.
Mr. Fitzwater said the United States had no intention of intervening militarily in the conflict.
 
Obstacles to Evacuation
The 74 evacuees airlifted to the Saipan, most of them American Embassy employees and their dependents, included 12 foreigners - 8 Liberians, 2 Italians, 1 Frenchman and a Canadian, a State Department spokesman said. The group was to be transported to Sierra Leone.
The Marines also evacuated two Americans from two American communications sites in Liberia that handle diplomatic and intelligence messages in Africa south of the Sahara. The sites were shut down. A State Department official said the Marines would continue the evacuation of remaining Americans and foreign diplomats and their dependents.
There is no telephone communication in Monrovia, and as a result, officials said, the United States does not know how many additional Americans may want to leave.
Those who want to be evacuated must reach the American Embassy compound. American officials said there was sporadic shooting on Saturday in the surrounding Mamba Point area.
''We cannot set down helicopter in people's back yards where we have people shooting weapons,'' a State Department official said.
The United States has previously offered to evacuate President Doe, hoping that such a move would lead to an end to the fighting. A State Department official said, however, that a request now from Mr. Doe for his evacuation would have to be re-evaluated in terms of the risk to American forces.
The rebels have accused Mr. Doe, who seized power in a bloody coup in 1980, of human rights abuses. Witnesses have said that Mr. Doe's troops were responsible for the massacre last Sunday of hundreds of civilians who had taken refuge in a Lutheran church in Monrovia.
The evacuation today, named Operation Sharp Edge, involved 17 aircraft, including 11 Sea Knight and Sea Stallion transport helicopters, 4 Cobra attack helicopters and 2 Harrier attack planes.
 
Praise From Lawmakers
Mr. Fitzwater said that the Marines did not encounter any fire during the evacuation.
But a spokesman for the other rebel faction, led by Charles Taylor, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that his forces almost fired on a Marine helicopter by mistake.
The Marine action drew praise from lawmakers, including Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois.
''The President's action is a proper one, and I support his decision,'' said Mr. Simon, chairman of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on African affairs.

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
Experts Say Embargo May Work If Nations Maintain Commitment

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
With Japan joining the United States and Europe yesterday by agreeing to halt oil imports from Iraq and Kuwait, the industrialized world has begun an economic campaign against Baghdad that for the moment relies on an embargo but holds out the possible use of a naval blockade.
While economic embargoes have rarely succeeded, oil analysts and Middle East experts say the sanctions against Iraq could hobble its economy as long as Western unity and commitment to enforcing the embargo holds.
 
A Checkered History
The modern history of economic embargoes is checkered at best. The effectiveness of an embargo is sometimes blunted by a lack of international cooperation and enforcement, so that the target nation can still buy and sell in the global marketplace. And breaking sanctions against oil trade is often made easier by the fact that oil is a commodity, not branded or labeled for easy identification. 
But the embargo against Iraq is different in certain crucial respects, Middle East experts and oil analysts say. It has enlisted a larger measure of international support than previous sanction efforts and is aimed at a war-weakened economy whose income is almost solely derived from one product - oil - that is shipped abroad from a few easily monitored locations.
Still, the embargo plan appears to have broad international appeal. The United Nations Security Council is expected to approve a worldwide ban on oil purchases from Iraq and occupied Kuwait today and to prohibit all other trade and financial dealings with those countries. [Page A6.] ''Tracking and enforcing an embargo against Iraqi-controlled oil exports should not be a big problem,'' said Henry Schuler, director of the energy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''The problem will be sustaining the commitment.''
 
A Test to Come
The real test of the West's commitment may well come if the embargo is successful. Iraq has been exporting about 2.6 million barrels of oil a day, while Kuwait ships about 1.2 million barrels. Together, they account for more than 20 percent of OPEC exports.
If the oil from Kuwait and Iraq is taken off the world market, energy prices will jump unless other producers increase their output. The nation most capable of filling the oil shortfall is Iraq's oil-rich neighbor, Saudi Arabia, which now produces 5.5 million barrels of oil a day. But, experts estimate, it could quickly increase its output by another 2 million barrels a day.
The Saudis, the experts agree, will be unlikely to pump more oil and risk antagonizing President Hussein without a guarantee that the West will come to Saudi Arabia's defense if it is attacked.
''For this embargo to work without driving up oil prices and slowing economic growth, the Saudis will have to produce more oil,'' said Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an oil consultant. ''The Saudis will only cooperate if the international consensus that has emerged in the past few days is backed up with Western - and specifically, American - military power.''
 
Different Restrictions
The boycott of oil imports from Iraq and Kuwait is also different in that previous economic embargoes tried mainly to restrict the flow of goods from many different countries to one nation, such as Rhodesia or South Africa. By contrast, the sanctions against Iraq are an attempt to put pressure on a nation by refusing to buy its main export.
Iraq's oil is shipped to the West by just three routes: a pipeline through Turkey to the Mediterranean; a pipeline across Saudi Arabia that runs to the Red Sea port of Yanbu, and loaded directly into tankers in the Persian Gulf. Kuwait's oil is exported via tankers in the gulf.
So if Turkey and Saudi Arabia, assured of Western military protection, shut down the pipelines across their territory, most of Iraq's economic lifeline would be gone. Even if they do not, the ship movements to and from the ports handling Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf can be monitored without too much trouble, according to oil experts, both by observation and tracking ship movements by Western military satellites.
A naval blockade would insure that Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil never reach foreign buyers. Should Washington and its allies try a naval blockade, the task would not be too daunting because the ''choke points'' are few and in comparatively narrow waterways, according to one shipping analyst.
 
Techniques of Disguise
Without a blockade, there are several techniques oil traders can use to disguise the identity of an oil shipment, including falsifying documents that show a tanker's identity, switching oil from one tanker to another and bribing port officials to allow oil from an embargoed nation to be unloaded. Concealing the origin of an oil shipment is made easier by the freewheeling nature of the international oil business. The ownership of a tankerload of oil can frequently change hands several times from the time it leaves its home port to the time it unloads weeks later, halfway round the world.
All these gambits have been employed since 1979 to sidestep the voluntary embargo, backed by the United Nations General Assembly, on oil shipments to South Africa to protest its apartheid policies. The oil embargo against South Africa has increased its oil bill, because it has paid millions in fees to middlemen to help Pretoria elude the sanctions. But the voluntary embargo did not stop oil from reaching South Africa.
Veterans of the South African oil trading curbs say the embargo against Iraq should be much more difficult to circumvent. ''This is a much more concerted international action than the restrictions on trade with Pretoria,'' said a Rotterdam oil trader, who asked not to be identified. ''It should be much easier to track shipments out of Iraq, especially if American military technology is being used, than it has been to monitor oil tankers from all over the world heading for South Africa.''

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
BUSH, HINTING FORCE, DECLARES IRAQI ASSAULT 'WILL NOT STAND'; PROXY IN KUWAIT ISSUES THREAT

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Committing the United States to roll back Iraq's conquest of Kuwait, President Bush said today that he would not settle for anything less than a total Iraqi withdrawal and would not tolerate the establishment of a puppet regime in Kuwait.
In a forceful statement to reporters as he returned to the White House from Camp David, Md., Mr. Bush all but committed himself to use military force against Iraq if diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions fail to produce an Iraqi withdrawal.
Mr. Bush dispatched Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to Saudi Arabia tonight in hopes of obtaining permission to send United States armed forces there to deter an Iraqi attack on that country, Administration officials said.
 
'This Will Not Stand'
Visibly angry, Mr. Bush said: ''I view very seriously our determination to reverse this aggression. There are an awful lot of countries that are in total accord with what I've just said.'' 
''We will be working with them all for collective action,'' the President added. ''This will not stand. This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.''
Asked how he could prevent the installation of an Iraqi-sponsored government in Kuwait, the President shot back, ''Just wait, watch and learn.''
Mr. Bush said he had consulted by telephone over the weekend with other world leaders to line up support for international economic sanctions against Iraq. He said he would meet in Washington on Monday with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and with the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Manfred Worner.
 
Cheney's Two Objectives
Mr. Cheney's trip, which is being made at Washington's initiative, has two primary objectives, Administration officials said. The first is to persaude the Saudis to allow the United States to use Saudi airstrips and naval installations as staging bases if Washington deems it necessary to respond to Iraq's military moves. In particular, Washington wants to be able to deploy fighter planes and bombers.
''When the need arises we want options available to us,'' a Pentagon official said.
Mr. Cheney is carrying a significant amount of information gained from intelligence reports to show the Saudis the full extent of the Iraqi threat and to demonstrate the importance of the United States' having ready access to Saudi military installations.
His second objective, the officials said, is to persuade the cautious Saudi leadership that President Bush is sincere when he says that the United States intends to confront President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. The Saudis fear that if they adopt an aggressive posture toward Iraq and are attacked by Baghdad, Washington will not come to their rescue.
To tighten the economic noose around Baghdad, Administration officials are trying to persuade Turkey and Saudi Arabia to close the Iraqi oil pipelines that traverse their countries and carry 90 percent of Iraq's crude oil to tankers for shipment abroad. Because virtually all of Iraq's Persian Gulf ports were put out of action by the Iran-Iraq war, these two pipelines are critical for the country's economic survival.
 
Iraqi Warning on Pipelines
Iraq has warned Turkey and Saudi Arabia against shutting down the pipelines, and Administration officials say these threats have proved effective so far. The officials said that if the Turks and Saudis decline to take such a step they will consider organizing an international naval blockade to prevent any tankers from picking up Iraqi oil piped through Turkey and Saudi Arabia and to prevent the export of oil from Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
While the Bush Administration stepped up its anti-Iraqi oratory, it still seemed to be groping for a strategy that would induce President Hussein to withdraw the estimated 100,000 Iraqi troops in Kuwait.
Up to now, the Iraqi leader, an expert at brinksmanship, has shown no sign of being intimidated by the economic and diplomatic sanctions carried out by the West.
''Nobody is willing to accept anything less than total withdrawal of the Iraqi forces and no puppet regime,'' the President said. ''We've been down that road, and there will be no puppet regime that will be accepted by any countries that I'm familiar with. That signal is going out loud and clear to Iraq. And I will not discuss with you what my options are or might be, but they're wide open, I can assure you of that.''
Administration officials said intelligence reports indicated that Iraqi troops, rather than withdrawing from Kuwait as Baghdad asserted they did today, were digging in and building up their units along the border with Saudi Arabia.
''Iraq lied once again,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They said they were going to start moving out today and we have no evidence that they're moving out.''
The officials said that some 20,000 additional Iraqi troops were deployed along the Saudi border, augmenting the smaller expeditionary units that probed that area yesterday, in what could be preparation for an Iraqi strike at Saudi oilfields.
While an incursion into Saudi Arabia by Iraqi forces cannot be ruled out, American officials say the latest Iraqi deployments are more likely intended to make the West and the Arab world so concerned about defusing a potential threat to Saudi Arabia that they would be relieved to accept the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
 
Cabinet Formed in Kuwait
The Iraqi invasion force has replaced Kuwait's 250-year-old Sabah monarchy with a new Cabinet supposedly composed of nine Kuwaiti Army officers. Kuwaiti diplomats and other officials abroad contend that the cabinet is made up of Iraqis.
The Washington Post for Monday reported that President Bush had ordered Government agencies to begin a secret planning effort aimed at destabilizing and eventually toppling President Hussein. Efforts to reach United States intelligence officials to confirm The Post's account tonight were unsuccessful.
Administration officials are increasingly concerned about the unwillingess of Saudi Arabia and the other leading Arab countries to stand up to Mr. Hussein. Officials say they detect a strong tendency in the Arab world to try to appease Baghdad by letting it swallow Kuwait in hopes that this will spare Iraq's neighbors a similar fate. Privately, American officials are expressing contempt for most of the Arab leaders.
In the first public hint of such repugnance, Mr. Bush publicly chastized unnamed Arab leaders for their reluctance to condemn Mr. Hussein and to join in Western-initiated efforts to roll back his invasion.
Asked if he was disappointed by the way his friend King Hussein of Jordan abstained from an Arab League resolution denouncing the Iraqi invasion, Mr. Bush said: ''I want to see the Arab states join the rest of the world in condemning this outrage and doing what they can to get Saddam Hussein out. I am disappointed to find any comment by anyone that apologizes or appears to condone what's taken place.''
 
'A Very Serious Matter'
Apparently referring to King Hussein or to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Mr. Bush added: ''I was told by one leader that I respect enormously - I believe this was back on Friday - that they needed 48 hours to find what was called 'an Arab solution.' That obviously has failed. And of course I'm disappointed that the matter hasn't been resolved before now. This is a very serious matter.'' For now, the Administration's plan for dealing with the gulf crisis is focused on diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions. Working with the Western allies and the United Nations, it is trying not only to deprive Iraq of any economic benefits from occupying Kuwait, but also to punish it with an oil boycott and possibly broader economic sanctions now being considered by the United Nations Security Council.
These economic measures are being reinforced by an effort to isolate Iraq diplomatically and to prevent the Iraqi-installed government in Kuwait from being accorded any legitimacy within the Arab world or beyond. It is the Administration's hope that these diplomatic and economic moves will eventually induce a cash-starved Iraqi leader to withdraw.
Among the military options under review by the Administration, a multinational naval blockade would seem to be the most feasible and carry the least risk of widening the conflict. It also seems to enjoy the broadest support within the Administration at this time.
Far more controversial and dangerous would be any attempt by the United States, either alone or with its allies, to dispatch ground troops or fighter aircraft to Kuwait in an attempt to force the Iraqis out.
For now, Administration officials say, only an Iraqi incursion into Saudi Arabia would automatically bring direct American military intervention.

HEADLINE: With Care, U.S. Presses Kenyans To Open Their Political Process

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug. 5

 BODY:
A senior American official, in Kenya to patch up ruffled relations, has urged the Government to open up the political process but has been careful not to insist on multiparty democracy as the only prescription.
The four-day visit of the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Herman Cohen, which ended today, came after the Kenyan Government reacted angrily to statements by Washington and the American Ambassador here criticizing the detention of political opponents and advocating pluralism.
Mr. Cohen said after a meeting with President Daniel arap Moi that while the United States favors a multiparty system, ''Who are we to say it is good for everybody?'' Kenya's only legal party is the Kenya African National Union.
But Mr. Cohen made it clear that the United States expects a recently established party commission to come up with fundamental changes in the political system. 
 
Reaction to Detentions
Kenya is the largest recipient in sub-Saharan Africa of American economic and military aid, and Washington reacted to the detentions by freezing half of Kenya's $10 million military aid and a small amount of economic aid. The detentions, presaged by a statement by Mr. Moi that advocates of a multiparty state would be hunted down ''like rats,'' led to three days of rioting that left at least 20 people dead.
Three leading multiparty advocates, Kenneth Matiba, Charles Rubia and Raila Odinga, have been in jail without charges since early last month. Four detainees have been charged with trying to bring down the Government. Six more political opponents are said to be held without charges.
Mr. Cohen said he discussed the detentions with Mr. Moi but was not at liberty to say what the Government intended to do about the detainees. Mr. Moi must make that announcement, Mr. Cohen said.
American officials here have suggested that for Congress to release the frozen aid to Kenya, the detainees would have to be freed in the next month or so.
 
Support for Ambassador
There were also reports here that President Moi would ask the United States to recall its ambassador, Smith Hempstone, who has been outspoken about political reform. In his meeting with Mr. Moi, Mr. Cohen expressed support for Mr. Hempstone. Publicly, Mr. Cohen said, ''Ambassador Hempstone was expressing the truth when he said that the United States favors pluralistic democracy, individual rights and civil liberties.''
But unlike the ambassador, Mr. Cohen was not seen with any Government opponents. He appeared to have succeeded in his mission to placate the Government. Mr. Moi said today that relations were ''back to normal.''
American officials said in private meetings that Mr. Cohen tried to leave the impression that the future of Kenya's relationship with Washington was at stake. ''The country is at a crossroads,'' an American official said.
Officials said that Kenya, once considered a good example of an emerging democracy with relatively free elections, had backtracked and the Government needed to initiate change.
 
Pressure to Broaden System
President Moi has been under increasing pressure from church leaders and lawyers to broaden the one-party state, which has been in place since 1982. But unlike other one-party African leaders, Mr. Moi has staunchly resisted demands for a multiparty system and has instead said he would consider reforming the Kenya African National Union.
The new party commission, headed by the vice president, George Saitoti, has been holding hearings around the country to determine public opinion on how to change the party.
The hearings have been marked by loud criticism of election rigging and the abolition of secret ballot in primary elections. An Anglican bishop thought to be friendly with President Moi made a surprise attack on the political system at a hearing last week.
The bishop, Alexander Muge, said Parliament should be immediately dissolved and fresh elections held with a secret ballot. He said the president should be limited to two five-year terms, and in an effort to get at the pervasive corruption among politicians, he said candidates for public office should declare their wealth and how they got it.
A group of 54 lawyers made similar demands last week.

HEADLINE: Vietnam's Allies Faltering in Cambodia

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The new American policy on Cambodia has been warmly welcomed here, but it does not alter a domestic situation that, 11 months after the withdrawal of most Vietnamese troops, is slowly deteriorating.
Direct contact by Washington with Phnom Penh as well as Hanoi is a logical extension of the policy, announced on July 18 by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. The policy withdraws diplomatic support at the United Nations for an opposition coalition that included Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
In the first formal talks on Cambodia between the United States and Vietnam, scheduled to begin on Monday in New York, the Vietnamese will press for an expansion of the discussions to include a representative of the Phnom Penh Government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, senior East European diplomats say. The Government is supported by Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1979 and withdrew its troops last September. The talks are aimed at setting up a council to conduct elections for a new Cambodian government, ending the civil war involving the Hun Sen Government and the three factions, including the Khmer Rouge, opposed to it. 
At home, Mr. Hun Sen's Government is coping with a weakening economy, an inflation rate of some 200 percent a year, cuts in aid from Communist countries, political infighting and an increase in the Khmer Rouge's guerrilla war in the countryside, which has produced up to 130,000 displaced people in at least seven provinces.
 
A Year of New Challenges
Diplomats and relief workers say that Phnom Penh faces unprecedented challenges in the next year, and it is actively seeking both Western aid and recognition to restore confidence and replace declining Soviet-bloc support.
But at the same time, these challenges have caused the Government to tighten up internally, diplomats say, with an evident chastening of Mr. Hun Sen, who is also Foreign Minister, by older, senior party leaders more skeptical of the West, closer to Vietnam and more concerned about their own positions in a post-settlement government.
The most prominent of them is Chea Sim, 58 years old, who is president of the National Assembly and controls the Interior Ministry, which he used to head in the early 1980's. A former Buddhist monk, he is considered by diplomats to be a populist, nationalist and traditionalist, and he does not grant interviews to the Western press.
But these assorted developments do not yet represent a crisis, and no credible analyst or official here sees any imminent political or military collapse.
 
A Rickety Economy
The main concern, they say, is the economy, which the Khmer Rouge is trying to disrupt. Economic collapse could lead to the kind of panic that would quickly undermine an army that is still holding its own. The Khmer Rouge ruled the country from 1975 to 1978 and carried out a brutal reorganization of society that killed more than one million people.
While the level of popular concern in Phnom Penh and district capitals like Kompong Speu and Kompong Chhnang has increased, especially given inflation and the presence of refugees, life goes on as before.
Indeed, many urban Cambodians are making a great deal of money on free markets, and the amount of Thai and Singaporean goods for sale, from beer and clothing to medicine, spare parts and motorbikes, has been increasing dramatically over the last year.
One of the main problems for the Government, with so few trained specialists and a weak and widely abused taxation system, is to obtain even a modest share of the foreign exchange surging through the urban economy.
 
Coping With Inflation
The Cambodian currency, the riel, has gone from 190 to the dollar a year ago to 485 to the dollar now, and the price of rice has more than doubled in six months. While already low Government salaries went up 50 percent in January, inflation has made a mockery of the increase, and the number of commodities like rice, gasoline, clothing and cigarettes given to state employees for resale has been cut to only rice and gas.
As a result, state workers are more frequently absent to work second jobs or run private businesses, or are more corrupt. The result is a gradual lessening of the grip and impact of the national administration, which in the longer term, along with economic difficulties, can only help the Khmer Rouge.
''Frankly speaking, we don't know how to deal with the economic situation,'' Cham Prasith, a deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, said last week. ''We will have to face more and more difficulties. Our survival depends on the West.''
While the Khmer Rouge have been pushing out from their redoubts to hit soft targets closer to population centers, they avoid large scale battles.
 
Khmer Rouge Tactics
After failing to take Battambang and Sisophon, important provincial capitals in the northwest near their sanctuaries in Thailand, the Khmer Rouge have reinfiltrated their forces in the mountainous, heavily forested areas of provinces closer to Phnom Penh, like Kompong Speu, Kompong Cham, Kompong Chhnang and Kompong Thom.
Since the spring, they have intensified the well-known tactics of guerrilla war, designed to disrupt the economy and agriculture, destroy roads, bridges and trains, and undermine people's confidence in the local and national administration.
It thus remains a war of hit-and-run tactics, booby traps and mines. But since early June, in particular since the isolation of the Khmer Rouge at talks in Tokyo, the guerrillas have stepped up their activity in most provinces, moving farther from their traditional redoubts to attack closer to major district towns and cities.
This has caused the Government to pull back the more remote military district headquarters in Kompong Speu, Kompong Chhnang, Kompong Thom and Battambang provinces. With the headquarters have come thousands of civilians - some fleeing the fighting, others moved by the Government to try to deny the Khmer Rouge food, money and recruits.
 
People's Needs Are Unmet
These civilians, now in roadside shacks and huts, need food, medicine, clothing and farming utensils, which the Government and aid agencies here cannot supply in full.
But when Government troops mount campaigns even in these regions, the Khmer Rouge fall back or cross provincial borders, only to emerge again when the troops themselves return to headquarters.
Khmer Rouge commanders have said the increased fighting is to insure that they are not left out of any diplomatic solution and to pressure the Government to make more concessions.
For the moment, senior diplomats here believe the Khmer Rouge is incapable militarily of doing much more.
 
More Civilian Targets Hit
But since June, the Khmer Rouge seem to be hitting more civilian targets, including attacks in July on two trains in Kampot and Kompong Chhnang, in which more than 100 civilians were killed and others robbed and forced to carry ammunition and food.
The guerrillas are also seeding more rice fields with mines, burning more villages and seizing more cattle and rice.
''These tactics would seem to undermine their incremental efforts to rebuild any political credibility,'' a senior diplomat said. ''The evidence is still thin, but there may be a shift of tactics. Still, as they move farther from traditional strongholds, they are in areas where they have almost no political support.''
The current situation could go on for a long time, the diplomat said, barring a chain reaction of economic, psychological and military collapse.

Getting By in Israel, or, How to Stretch a Shekel

BYLINE: By SABRA CHARTRAND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 5

 BODY:
If Israelis are hard on the outside and sweet on the inside, as local folk wisdom says, then a good part of their toughness probably comes from the constant struggle against a battered economy, where taxes are all-encompassing, prices are higher than in Manhattan, and meager salaries seldom stretch to the end of the month.
This is one of the world's most heavily taxed nations, with levels of up to 250 percent on imported goods, sales taxes of 16 percent on all purchases and a stiff tariff on all foreign travel. As a result, a four-door Subaru sedan costs the equivalent of $41,000, a standard 21-inch color television set, $1,245, a frost-free refrigerator, $1,600, and permission to leave the country, $125.
Yet the average combined salary for a two-income family of four is $16,800, or $1,400 a month. And that is before taxes that range quickly up to 48 percent. The same average family spends $1,650 a month on basic expenses, leaving a gap of at least $250. 
Mysteriously, despite all that, Israelis are devoted world travelers. And they buy extraordinarily expensive cars, VCR's and compact disk players at an impressive rate.
 
The Unreported Income
So how do they manage?
''If someone figures it out, please let me know,'' says Jay Kalish, a Jerusalem lawyer. Mr. Kalish, an American immigrant who runs his own business translating legal documents from Hebrew to English, and his wife, Judy, a part-time secretary, earn about $1,900 a month, quite a drop from what they earned in New York before moving here in 1987.
Largely for economic reasons, more than half the Americans who move to Israel give up and move back within the first two years. But families like the Kalishes that decide to stay have devised a broad variety of strategies for economic survival.
As in other countries, many people simply do not report a part of their income to the tax authorities - from plumbers or auto mechanics who give discounts if clients pay cash and do not ask for a receipt, to radio technicians who fix stereos at home or doctors who see patients in off-hours.
Prof. Reuben Gronaur of the Hebrew University economics department says that given the gap between the average salaries and the cost of living ''you have to infer that there is something wrong'' with the Government's income figures.
''The data on expenses is collected very carefully, but the data on income much less so because anyone can show a monthly salary slip without showing everything he earns,'' Mr. Gronaur said. Sweetening the Salary Avoiding taxes is not the only way Israelis have found to get by. Some of the more creative devices are for supplementing income.
In most of the public sector, which makes up 90 percent of the workforce, salaries are pathetically low. Doctors and nurses often earn $1,000 a month in state hospitals and teachers and educators earn as little as $800. To attract and keep employees, state institutions have to supplement basic salaries with ''extras.''
At the Government-run Israel Radio, for example, employees earn fixed salaries that rarely exceed $1,500 a month. Rather than increase the basic salary, which would violate wage freezes, the network, like most other employers, enhances income by reimbursing employees for transportation costs, auto insurance, phone bills, even meals eaten at work.
Employees are also paid for a fixed number of overtime hours, whether they have worked them or not. These extras can double a worker's income.
But for most people, augmented wages or tax evasion just bring the income in line with expenses. As a result, Israeli businessmen, merchants and consumers have come up with several unusual ways of stretching buying power.
Israeli banks routinely permit clients to overdraw their accounts by up to two times the amount of the client's monthly salary. Since nearly all Israelis have their salaries directly deposited into bank accounts, the bank is more or less guaranteed reimbursement.
As a result, hundreds of thousands of Israelis habitually and endlessly overdraw their bank accounts. Living in debt to the bank is commonplace, although not without penalty. If the overdraft is approved, which most are, interest on the debt hovers around 25 percent. But if the account holder doesn't have the bank's permission, interest rates can soar to about 45 percent a year.
 
On the Installment Plan
Merchants sell just about anything in installments. Furniture, applicances, clothes - even food - are often advertised by the monthly installment price without any mention of what the items would cost if paid for in full. To buy a new television set or toaster in 12 easy payments, all anyone has to do is hand over 12 signed, post-dated checks for each monthly installment.
The banks, the retailers and the customers all know that the checks are probably written on accounts that are perpetually overdrawn and are based on a guaranteed salary deposit that hardly meets basic living expenses. But that's the system, and everybody lives with it.
If they didn't, Israelis probably would not be able to cope with rises in the cost of living that easily outstrip salaries. Since 1986, the consumer price index has gone up 93 percent, while wages have risen by only 73 percent.
''Our expenses are the bare necessities for the most part,'' Mr. Kalish said. ''We spend on child care, heat in the winter, upkeep for the car. Food is an enormous expense, so instead of the supermarket we shop at the shuk,'' the local open market.
When it comes to putting money away for the future, Mr. Kalish said, ''At this point I can't see that it's possible.''
''It's frightening, but for some reason you get used to it,'' he added. ''The first time we saw a negative balance on our bank account, we turned ash gray, but all our friends just laughed and said 'Welcome!' ''

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
A President Puts Himself on the Spot

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Foreign policy, which lifted George Bush so high in the esteem of his fellow Americans, making him seem for months on end like the man with the infallible touch, now threatens to bring him low.
There is no doubt among those who are responsible for strategic political thinking in the White House and the Republican Party that the crisis in the Persian Gulf has the potential to cripple the President politically, just as double-digit inflation and the Iran hostage crisis, earlier products of the instability in the Middle East, fatally wounded President Jimmy Carter.
Aware that Mr. Carter and other Presidents had worsened their problems by seeming to temporize, Mr. Bush sought to project an image of boldness this afternoon by pledging that ''this will not stand, this agression against Kuwait.'' But in all but commiting himself to expelling Iraqi troops from the desert sheikdom, the President increased the stakes for himself. 
''The storm is mighty,'' a White House official said. ''The boat is small and the oars are short.''
 
Where Bush Is Strong
For the moment, to be sure, Americans are rallying around the President, as they did during the Panama invasion last December and as they always do in times of stress. Democratic politicians say the furthest thing from their minds is taking partisan profit from the situation.
Mr. Bush's reservoir of good will in the country, built up over 16 months in which he benefitted from changes in Eastern Europe, from Democratic disarray and from his successful management of a complex relationship with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, will stand him in good stead in the coming weeks.
Should Iraq invade Saudi Arabia, and should the United States spring to Saudi Arabia's defense, Mr. Bush could almost certainly count on solid backing from an electorate that is always slow to criticize Presidents at war. The same would be true if he used force to drive Iraqi units from Kuwait. But by drawing a line in the sand, he gives a hostage to fortune; failure would open him to criticism from Democrats and others. Had he not drawn the line he would have run the risk of seeming supine in the face of aggression, like Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain of Great Britain in the 1930's. A Puppet for Baghdad? The Iraqi strategy, in the view of politicians, diplomats and Middle East scholars, is to remain in Kuwait, with troops or a puppet regime or both, and use it as the base for a long campaign of intimidation against Saudi Arabia and the small, weak oil-producing emirates to the southeast. If far less melodramatic than American combat involvement, that would be still be bad news indeed for Mr. Bush.
Unless successfully challenged through an embargo of improbable thoroughness, a naval blockade or another measure, like closing the two Iraqi oil pipelines, President Saddam Hussein could be in a position to dictate Saudi production levels. Then a ''country that has shown a ruthless hostility'' would have achieved, as former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said today, ''a stranglehold on the world oil supply.'' And that could produce economic wreckage in the United States.
Higher oil prices tend to cut growth and accelerate inflation, which is hardly what the President, whose poll ratings for handling the domestic economy are lower than they are for his management of foreign affairs, wants as the 1990 Congressional and gubernatorial campaigns get under way.
A lengthy downturn, of course, could hurt the President himself as he seeks re-election in 1992. Now retail gasoline prices are leaping. More important perhaps, that phenomenon is being driven home by news organizations; in the Midwest this weekend, where several pivotal 1990 races are concentrated, local television news programs and local newspaper front pages have been dominated not by news from the Middle East but by pictures of service-station pylons with the new, higher numbers in place, accompanied by stories warning of much more to come.
 
Politics of the Pump
''Seems like we ought to be able to get ourselves out of this, those people over there dictating what happens here,'' said a man interviewed by a Cleveland television station on Saturday while pumping costlier gas into his car. The comment illustrates a central reality of the post-cold-war world.
Regional conflict has not been swept away by the rapprochement between Moscow and Washington; the superpowers find themselves less able to influence the course of events in areas where the fear of nuclear conflict used to act as a kind of damper.
Pressure to act would increase exponentially, of course, should anything happen to the 3,000 to 3,500 Americans believed to be in Kuwait, with which telephone communications have now been severed for almost 72 hours.
There are other problems. The tortuous negotiations on a domestic budget settlement, for example, have been based on a tacit understanding that some sort of energy tax would be necessary. The idea seems doomed at a moment when gasoline and fuel-oil prices are rising. Any sort of tax increase with recession threatening is likely to be considered economically and politically inadvisable, making it very hard to see how the cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation will be possible to achieve.
 
Guns Gain on Butter
Last week's developments had a few positive implications for the President. They are likely to slow, though not to stop, the rush to cut military spending, something Mr. Bush and his aides had been unable to do previously. And the President, as an adoptive Texan, will no doubt be pleased that that state's long-suffering economy is likely to snap back, with its expensive oil better able to compete with more expensive oil from the gulf. But in global or even in national terms, those are relatively small considerations, and the overall picture is an ominous one for Mr. Bush.
The President will need all of his experience, all of his cool and all of his skill in rallying other nations to the cause to handle the diplomatic side of the crisis. He will need great political skills under stress, perhaps more than at any time since he stood on the verge of elimination from the 1988 Presidential contest in New Hampshire, to explain to the American public why, having spent tens of billions of tax dollars in the gulf in the last decade, American influence in the area is so limited.

Transcript of News Conference Remarks by Bush on Iraq Crisis

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's news conference yesterday in Washington, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a transcription service:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
Well, I just wanted to fill you all in on the diplomatic activity that is taking place, intensive diplomatic activity around the world. I've got to go in now; I'm getting another call from President Ozal of Turkey, with whom I have been in previous conversation. Yesterday, I talked to him. I talked this morning to Prime Minister Kaifu, and I applaud Japan's stance, cracking down on the imports from Iraq. I just hung up, up there in Camp David, talking with Prime Minister Mulroney. We're all in the same accord, he and President Mitterrand, with whom I've spoken, Chancellor Kohl, Margaret Thatcher. And I think the alliance, the NATO alliance, is thinking exactly the same way on this. I also talked yesterday to Kuwait's Emir and gave him certain assurances. 
What's emerging is nobody is -seems to be showing up as willing to accept anything less than total withdrawal from Iraq, from Kuwait of the Iraqi forces, and no puppet regime. We've been down that road, and there will be no puppet regime that will be accepted by any countries that I'm familiar with. And there seems to be a united front out there that says Iraq, having committed brutal, naked aggression, ought to get out and that the - this concept of their installing some puppet leaving behind will not be acceptable.
So, we're pushing forward on diplomacy. We've gotten - tomorrow I will meet here in Washington with the Secretary General of the United Nations - I mean, the Secretary General of NATO - and Margaret Thatcher will be coming in here tomorrow, and I will be continuing this diplomatic effort. And I'm sure you know of the meeting I had in Camp David with some of our top military people, and I will continue that kind of consultation as well.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Q. How are you going to - how are you going to keep the puppet government from being accepted and installed? And are you going to -
 
A. There is no intention on the part of any of these countries to accept a puppet government, and that signal is going out loud and clear to Iraq. And I will not discuss with you what my options are or might be, but they're wide open, I can assure you of that.
 
Q. The Saudi Arabians and the Turks, have they - have you talked to Saudi Arabia and the Turks about turning off the oil pipelines through their countries? And are they -
 
A. All options are open and there is a strong feeling on the part of the NATO countries to whom I've talked, Turkey being one of them, that we must have concerted, and I'd say -well, concerted action to isolate Iraq economically. And you can - you can just assume from there that those matters are being considered.
 
Q. Are the Saudis inclined to cut off the pipeline, Mr. President?
 
A. I can't tell you the state of play. I've discussed this with King Fahd and I - whether I'll be talking to him again today, I don't know. But I'm not going to characterize their position on this. Let them speak for themselves.
Yeah?
 
Q. Mr. President, what is the situation on the ground? Do the Iraqis appear to be dug in or are they readying -
 
A. Iraq lied once again. They said they were going to start moving out today and we have no evidence that they're moving out.
 
Q. Do we have evidence that there's 18 divisions, new divisions coming in -
 
A. I'm not going to discuss the intelligence situation on the ground right now, but I've not heard a figure of 18 new divisions going in.
 
Q. Have you given any -
 
A. Just a minute. Anne?
 
Q. Are Americans in danger in Kuwait or other areas down there? And can you -
 
A. I wouldn't want to say they're in danger, but I - you know how I feel about the protection of American life and willingness to do whatever is necessary to protect it. But I don't have the feeling that they're in imminent danger right now.
 
Q. And the people who are now in control in Kuwait are saying they may close some of the embassies in Kuwait City, that they will regard any reaction against them as - you should take care if you have your nationals in our country. Isn't that a threat?
 
A. I'm not trying to characterize threats. The threat is the vicious aggression against Kuwait. And that speaks for itself. And anything collaterally is just simply more indication that these are outlaws - international outlaws and renegades. And I want to see the United Nations move soon with Chapter 7 sanctions. And I want to see the rest of the world join us, as they are in overwhelming numbers, to isolate Saddam Hussein.
 
Q. Mr. President, how can you and other world leaders prevent the installation of what you've termed a puppet government?
 
A. Just wait. Watch and learn.
Yeah?
 
Q. Mr. President, have you, in fact, tried to reach Saddam Hussein since you're calling all these other people?
 
A. No. No, I have not.
 
Q. King Hussein has embraced him.
 
Q. Mr. President, have we asked the Saudi Arabians for the use of their military bases?
 
A. Hmm?
 
Q. Have we asked the Saudi Arabians -
 
A. I'm not going to discuss what I'm talking to the Saudis about. I'm not going to discuss anything to do about military options at all.
Yeah?
 
Q. Mr. President, have you talked to King Hussein of Jordan since he indicated his support -
 
A. I talked to him once and that's all.
 
Q. Are you disappointed in what he said?
 
Q. But he's embraced Saddam Hussein. He went to Baghdad and embraced -
 
A. What's your question? I can read.
 
Q. Are you disappointed in what King Hussein said -
 
A. I want to see the Arab states join the rest of the world in condemning this outrage and doing what they can to get Saddam Hussein out. Now, he was talking - King Hussein - about an Arab solution, but I am disappointed to find any comment by anyone that apologizes or appears to condone what's taken place.
 
Q. Is Secretary Cheney going to Saudi Arabia?
 
A. I'm not going to comment on anything that we're doing of that nature.
 
Q. Mr. President, are you disappointed in the failure of the Arab -other Arab nations to make more progress toward resolving the situation?
 
A. Well, I was told by one leader that I respect enormously - I believe this was back on Friday - that they needed 48 hours to find what was called an Arab solution. That obviously has failed. And of course I'm disappointed that the matter hasn't been resolved before now. This is a very serious matter.
I'll take one more and then I've got to go to work over here.
 
Q. Have you already taken steps to protect Americans over there? Have you moved -
 
A. I am not going to discuss what we're doing in terms of moving of forces, anything of that nature. But I view it very seriously, not just that, but any threat to any other countries as well, as I view very seriously our determination to reverse out this aggression. And please believe me, there are an awful lot of countries that are in total accord with what I've just said. And I salute them. They are staunch friends and allies. And we will be working with them all for collective action. This will not stand. This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.
I've got to go. I have to go to work. I've got to go to work.

HEADLINE: The Editorial Notebook;
Thailand, the Next Tiger

BYLINE: By David C. Unger

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand

 BODY:
Economic development in Thailand is as visible as Bangkok's polluted air or the buildings that seem to spring up overnight. Less obvious but just as important is its political development, a steady consolidation of democratic institutions to match the economic gains. And there is an increasing sophistication and self-confidence in Thailand's foreign policies. 
Self-confidence seems to be the key. Thailand managed to avoid the European colonialism that engulfed most of its Southeast Asian neighbors. Now it faces the convulsive changes of urbanization and industrial capitalism with impressive aplomb.
The social costs of rapid change, like environmental degradation and a growing AIDS problem, are recognized and, to a limited degree, addressed by Government policies. But there is surprisingly little hand-wringing about the threat to traditional culture or the surge of foreign capital. Thailand, opinion leaders seem to believe, will absorb all the world has to offer and make it serve Thai purposes.
Thailand is headed for a third straight year of hurtling economic growth, after a 13.2 percent advance in 1988 and 12.2 percent in 1989. These rapid gains coincide with the Government of Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, who, unlike most of his recent predecessors, is a democratically elected member of Parliament.
The Chatichai Government has been dominated by businessmen, and plagued by suspicions of ministerial corruption. Still, it remains highly popular.
The Government's main foreign-policy theme has been to turn war-plagued neighboring countries into peaceful markets. In Myanmar, once Burma, that has led to Thai complicity with the murderous military regime of the Slorc, the State Law and Order Restoration Council.
In Cambodia, Bangkok has advanced an imaginative peace diplomacy that helped wean Washington from its shameful indirect association with the Khmer Rouge. The common theme is that Thailand is capable of exercising regional leadership as it emerges from its earlier automatic deference to the wishes of Washington and Beijing.
There's the excitement of an emerging economic and political power in Bangkok these days, as it takes its place alongside the ''Asian tigers'' of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. The economic energy now surging through Thailand is frequently raw and crude. Yet Thais typically take in all these changes with a look of serenity and a knowing smile.

HEADLINE: Khmer Rouge Poised to Gain From U.S. Policy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Since 1979, the United States has ostensibly pursued two policy goals toward Cambodia. First, to punish Vietnam for invading Pol Pot's Cambodia and installing the current Government in Phnom Penh; second, to prevent a Khmer Rouge return to power.
The United States has achieved the first at the expense of the second. It has given diplomatic recognition to the Khmer Rouge-dominated coalition at the United Nations, and covert lethal and overt nonlethal aid to that coalition and has imposed a devastating economic embargo on Cambodia. 
This shameful policy of aiding the architects of yesterday's genocide continued until July 18, when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d recognized after 10 months the Vietnamese troop withdrawal and announced that the United States would discuss with Vietnam how to stop the Khmer Rouge. But this long-overdue move could be too late.
The reason is that the Khmer Rouge have long prepared for it. Interviews with high-level defectors that one of us, Roger Normand, recently conducted in Cambodian refugee camps show that since 1988, Pol Pot's strategy has been to infiltrate thousands of cadres into villages throughout Cambodia. Through propaganda and outright terror, they plan to control any elections. The danger of their success is growing.
Meanwhile, Khieu Samphan, the Khmer Rouge negotiator, has been carrying out Pol Pot's instructions to use his veto power over the peace negotiations, and ''delay elections'' until Khmer cadres get a tight political and military grip on the countryside. Khieu Samphan will not agree to elections unless and until Pol Pot feels the country is ''ready.''
Yet according to Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the Administration continues to believe that elections in the context of ''a comprehensive settlement involving all factions is the best way - and probably the only way - of preventing the Khmer Rouge from returning to power'' (Op-Ed, July 26).
Such a settlement would play directly into Pol Pot's hands by granting his followers the two things they desperately need: more time and an internationally sanctioned mechanism by which to return to power.
Instead, the United States should encourage a new Cambodian coalition that excludes the Khmer Rouge by working with Vietnam to foster power sharing, and also condition further aid to the non-Communists on splitting from the Khmer Rouge.
While the hard core of the Khmer Rouge would continue to fight, they would do so from outside the Government. Faced by a unified, pluralistic Cambodia, a weakened Khmer Rouge could never again return their countrymen and women to the killing fields.

HEADLINE: Buffalo's Economic Revival Owes Much to Albany Investment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 20 report on Buffalo's economic revival neglects the key role New York State has played in rebuilding the western New York economy. Six years ago, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo targeted the region - then suffering staggering unemployment and economic decline - for special state attention. He established the Western New York Economic Development Corporation, an Urban Development Corporation subsidiary, to channel state resources to job-generating projects and take a regional approach to long-range planning.
Since then, state investment in the region has been substantial, more than $100 million. Last year 28 percent of all state funds spent on economic development were spent in western New York, $39 million.
Pilot Field, for example, could not have been built without a $22 million state contribution. Dunlop Tire might have moved 1,500 jobs if the state had not created a $34 million incentive package. We have also funded high-tech research facilities at the University of Buffalo for earthquake studies and at Roswell Park Institute for cancer research. We have provided financing assistance to keep companies like Moog Inc., Harlequin Books and Freezer Queen Foods thriving and expanding in the Buffalo area.
We are working hard to sustain the resurgence, creating programs to help small businesses and starting to act on a plan for the Lake Erie shoreline. And not only western New York but also the rest of the state will benefit from the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement.
We believe western New York can play a pivotal role in the global economy and are dedicated to providing help to the region.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Buffalonians love admiring attention, such as your July 20 article on the Buffalo boom. Certainly, our proximity to our free-spending Canadian neighbor is not to be gainsaid in any analysis of our good fortune. And certainly our new baseball park, Pilot Field, where ballplayers perform on grass and fans can feel close to the action contributes to the positive way we feel about ourselves and to the perception of us by strangers.
But I was disappointed that you did not mention the State University of New York at Buffalo as a major employer and source of cultural and intellectual energy for Buffalo. Buffalo has a business life and a social life (yes, chicken wings are a favorite here), and it has an intellectual and cultural life as well.
Buffalo would be a very different place without the State University campus.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Reacting To Iraq

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
The Bush Administration, which was surprised by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, now faces two daunting tasks - to force an Iraqi withdrawal and a restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty, and to move the United States substantially toward independence from Middle Eastern oil.
Neither task will be easy and the first may well be impossible. It demands the effort anyway - not least because the Iraqi invasion was an outrageous violation of international order and decency that neither the U.S. nor any other law-abiding nation can allow to stand unchallenged.
Practically speaking, moreover, if Saddam Hussein gets away with the seizure of Kuwait, his increased oil reserves and production capacity, together with the military threat he would pose to other oil-producing nations in the region, would give him virtual control of OPEC and world oil prices. 
The Arab nations, however, are already pondering that military threat, which means their unity in condemning Mr. Hussein will be hard to achieve. For him to withdraw and restore the Kuwaiti ruling family would require an arrogant man to admit a mistake and a defeat, and to suffer profound humiliation, in the world and before his own people. In a nation already suffering economic deprivation from the war with Iran, as well as Mr. Hussein's harsh dictatorship, he might not even survive a reversal in Kuwait. So he won't back down easily, if at all.
Calls will no doubt be heard for Western military action to force an Iraqi withdrawal. But that could destroy oil production capacity the West now needs. It could put Israel at risk from a ruthless leader who has already threatened to ''scorch'' it with poison gas and perhaps other deadly weapons. And it might well require a long and bloody land war, not just a quick application of relatively antiseptic air and sea power.
At least until Mr. Hussein tries something as nearly apocalyptic as an invasion of Saudi Arabia, military intervention is not an attractive option. Better by far to clamp tight and total economic sanctions on Iraq, including shutting off the oil pipelines through Turkey and Saudi Arabia on which Iraq depends. Mr. Bush apparently is considering that step, among others.
Agreement by European nations and Japan not to import Iraqi oil is a necessary beginning; so are the decisions by the Soviet Union and China not to sell more arms to Iraq. Mr. Hussein does not need more arms now, but it's useful to let him know there'll be none available in the future.
But squeezing Iraq economically is by no means a sure thing. Will the fearful and politically facile Saudis, for example, agree to such tough action as closing the pipeline? Will Arab leaders consider it the better part of valor to concede Kuwait to Mr. Hussein in return for his promises - for what little they would be worth - to leave them alone? How long will oil-hungry Western nations, or Japan, be willing to boycott Iraq? Can its imports really be withheld altogether, or blockaded?
For all these reasons, the Bush Administration's second task - increasing oil independence - is imperative, not just for the moment but for a future not dependent on imported oil.
Gas prices at the pump already are rising, and as things stand Mr. Hussein may push them higher - which means rising inflation and falling economic growth in this country. More immediately, bipartisan efforts for a $50 billion to $60 billion tax increase to reduce the Federal deficit probably are at an end. With oil prices threatening a recession, such a tax increase might make it certain. But by the same reasoning, a needed energy tax to cut consumption seems unlikely anytime soon.
Nevertheless, a start on greater energy independence can be made by conservation, and by the development of new energy sources. For only one example, if new cars were to achieve fuel efficiency of 65 miles per gallon by the mid-90's, which is technologically possible, all the 533 million autos expected to be on U.S. roads by the year 2000 would average 48 m.p.g. - and require 2.9 million fewer barrels of oil per day than did only 319 million cars in 1982.
Developing new energy sources is feasible, too, and actually might be aided by higher oil prices, which make some high-cost processes more competitive. Many possibilities exist - not, in my judgment, excluding re-examination of the potential for nuclear power. If reactors that do not breed weapons material and are safe enough to win public confidence -two big ifs - can be developed, that potential is too important to disregard.

HEADLINE: Congressman Flake's Indictment: Good Works or Greed?

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
In southeast Queens, where the war against drugs and deterioration is a daily struggle, the white-steepled Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church is surrounded by a complex of tan brick buildings that some call Flakeville, in honor of the minister-turned-politician who built them.
For it is there that Representative Floyd H. Flake, one of 13 children of a Houston janitor, arrived 14 years ago to assemble a spiritual and secular empire that is the envy of many ministers across the city.
An energetic and charismatic preacher -with administrative skills honed in business school and academia - he built a private school for 480, an apartment complex for the elderly, renovations to broken-down stores, a home health care agency, a health clinic and social service center, a credit union and a congregation that has grown to 6,000 and doubles as a political field operation on Election Day.
But prosecutors now say that in the flush of his successes at the Allen A.M.E. Church, Mr. Flake turned from good works to greed to pay for an increasingly lavish life of fancy cars and clothing. 
 
Complaint About a Seduction
The complaints by an executive assistant, who said Mr. Flake had seduced her into an adulterous affair, stirred a former church trustee to come forward with allegations of fiscal improprieties. That in turn resulted in a 17-count Federal indictment last week, charging Mr. Flake and his wife with diverting thousands of dollars in church money to their own use.
Mr. Flake, in a statement, said his use of church money was proper. But even as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District, Andrew J. Maloney, announced the indictment, he went out of his way to praise Mr. Flake. ''In fairness to the Congressman,'' Mr. Maloney said, ''his church has done some outstanding work.''
The career of Mr. Flake is a story of uncommon idealism and ambition centered on a 155-year-old church, the oldest in Queens, in a largely black neighborhood of small single-family homes. The church, on the corner of Linden Boulevard and Merrick Boulevard in Jamaica, was at the center of a long-established black community. By the time Mr. Flake arrived as an idealistic 31-year-old college administrator in 1976, there were signs of abandonment and an encroachment of drugs and other social ills.
 
Janitor's Son Preaches at 15
Mr. Flake was born in Los Angeles, but grew up in Houston, where his father worked as a janitor at night to support his family.
Mr. Flake said he was totally caught up in church activities by age 10, and accepted the call to preach by age 15. When not leading youth activities at church, he said, he was selling black newspapers on his paper route.
The first member of his family to attend college, he graduated from Wilberforce University, an African Methodist Episcopal school in Xenia, Ohio, in 1967. He continued preaching while trying his hand at business, as a sales representative for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and a marketing analyst for Xerox.
After working as an associate dean at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, the nation's oldest private, predominantly black college, Mr. Flake was recruited by Boston University to be the director of a black student center. He later served as the acting university chaplain. In his spare time, he took business courses at Northeastern University.
 
Door to Door to Koch
In his official biography, Mr. Flake says he was also dean of students at Boston University. But one former administrator at the school, Steven J. Trachtenberg, now president of George Washington University, said that while the job was offered, Mr. Flake turned it down. Instead he went to work at the Allen church.
At the church, working alone with a secretary, Mr. Flake set out to bring services to his neighborhood, going door to door at government offices, clipping public notices in newspapers and applying for grants.
''I would go downtown two or three times a week,'' he said. ''Even when there were no projects available I would still go back to say hello.''
He struck up a cordial relationship with former Mayor Edward I. Koch, at a time when the Mayor's relationship with many other black community leaders was growing more troubled. He became known in City Hall as one of Mr. Koch's favorite ministers and community leaders.
 
Financial and Spiritual Growth
The efforts paid off. The church's budget of $250,000 grew to $16.7 million, of which $9.7 million came from local and Federal government grants and programs. The church and its subsidiary corporations now have more than 700 employees, most of whom provide home health care services.
The spiritual life of the church surged as well. Mr. Flake, an imposing figure, 6 feet 1 inches tall, with closely trimmed hair and goatee, resplendent in royal blue robes, proved a popular and powerful orator. The congregation raised funds to build the Allen Christian School.
Membership in the church soared to 6,000 today from less than 1,500. Now the choir, more than a hundred strong, is seated first come first served, and three services are held each Sunday, the first, at 6:30 A.M., to meet the demand for seats. The church just spent $1 million for land for a new 2,500-seat sanctuary it hopes to build next year.
''He is a role model for the clergy,'' said the Rev. Carl Flemister, regional executive minister of the American Baptist Churches.
 
'He Is a Master Builder'
The Rev. Herbert Daughtry, pastor of the House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn, said, ''He is a master builder.''
In 1986, after the district's longtime Congressman, Joseph P. Addabbo, died of cancer, Mr. Flake, at the urging, he says, of other local ministers, took on the regular Democratic clubs.
Running as an independent, he narrowly lost a special election to the Democrat, Assemblyman Alton R. Waldon Jr. But a few months later he came back to defeat Mr. Waldon in the Democratic primary and won a full term in the Sixth District.
Hundreds of congregants inundated polling places in the district - and many street corners between - for their beloved pastor.
 
'An Army in His Church'
''You always hear about ministers who can do things like this, but when they run against political clubs, it almost always turns out to be baloney,'' said Jerry Skurnik, a political consultant and former Koch aide. ''He had an army in his church working for him.''
While in Congress, Mr. Flake continues to run his church, a dual role that keeps him in perpetual motion, colleagues say, rushing back home several times a week after a full day in Washington to attend church or community events at night.
Mr. Flake has a moderately liberal voting record, but in his first two terms he has had little impact on legislation, and some constituents have begun to grouse that he has been spending too much time on church work.
''Most of the economic development work done by Representative Flake is done by his church,'' complained Nat Singleton, the head of the Association of Minority Enterprises in New York State and a former supporter. He said other neighborhood groups were not getting enough help.
Mr. Flake lives in a large three-story brick house, bought by the church for his use, with his wife, Margarett Elaine, who works for the church, and four children.
In addition to his Congressional salary, he reported earning $20,000 from the church. Motor vehicle records show that he owns a 1989 red Mercedes and previously owned a Lincoln and a BMW. Edwin Reed, an aide to Mr. Flake, said the Mercedes was actually owned by the church.
 
Willingness to Cut Corners
Even as his church empire grew, the events that led to Mr. Flake's indictment were quietly under way.
From the first, Mr. Flake showed a willingness to cut corners to get things done, sometimes for the church's benefit, sometimes, prosecutors say, for his own.
Church records provided by a lawyer for a former church trustee show that the church used $530,000 from a Federal loan for housing for the elderly to pay for parts of the Allen Christian School.
When the misuse of funds was discovered, and the church was ordered to repay the money, Mr. Flake persuaded officials in the regional Housing and Urban Development office to forgive the misspending. He argued that some of the elderly residents did volunteer work at the school.
The decision to forgive the error, rescinded last year by the agency, was made by same Federal housing officials later caught up in a scandal over political favoritism at the H.U.D. regional office. The church was ordered to repay the money.
 
Accused of Misusing Account
Later, according to prosecutors and church documents, Mr. Flake became more flagrant. He set up a private church bank account at his home, used to pay for transportation for residents of the housing complex to local shopping areas. Mr. Flake paid a local van company about $480 a month but billed the housing project $3,000 for the service, and diverted $75,200 to his own use, the authorities say.
The indictment also charges him with putting much of his basic salary into a church expense fund as a way of evading Federal income taxes on $66,700 of income.
The allegations might never had surfaced if not for the grievances of Mr. Flake's former executive assistant, Thelma Singleton-Scott.
Mrs. Scott, a congregant who was married with two children, was hired by Mr. Flake as his executive assistant in 1983. She said that they soon began an affair, an accusation Mr. Flake denied.
 
Accusation of Affair and Revenge
When she tried to break off the relationship a year later, she said, Mr. Flake dismissed her from her job, and when she complained, her name was stripped from the membership rolls of the church.
Mrs. Scott took her grievances against Mr. Flake to the church hierarchy, and demanded that he be dismissed. She took a lie-detector test, and secretly recorded conversations with Mr. Flake. Church officials backed Mr. Flake, but not before, Mrs. Scott's lawyers contend, she was offered a large settlement to drop her complaint. She later filed a suit charging, among other things, ministerial malpractice.
Mrs. Scott also consulted a lawyer, Robert H. Harris, who eventually took the evidence of financial malfeasance to the United States Attorney.
Mr. Harris said a former church trustee and retired Navy accountant, Elza W. Axon, called Mrs. Scott and said he had accumulated substantial evidence of financial improprieties by Mr. Flake. Mr. Harris turned the material over to Mr. Maloney.
While some officials and congregants in South Jamaica said Mr. Flake was the victim of a political or racial vendetta, the prevailing feeling following his indictment was sadness.
Mr. Flake said in an interview that the indictment was a ''difficult and traumatic'' moment for his family.
''They have a hard time understanding how you can put this much into something and have this as the end result,'' he said. ''They have seen me sacrifice them to perform for the church.''

HEADLINE: Man Accused of Stealing 25 Cabs

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
A Queens man has been charged with stealing 25 medallion taxis during the last month and using them to pick up fares to support his crack habit, the police said.
The suspect, Peter McGowan, 26 years old, of 30-42 80th Street in Jackson Heights, was arrested at his home at 2 P.M. Saturday and charged with two counts of second-degree robbery and four counts of grand larceny of an automobile. 
At the 108th Precinct station house, he was picked out of a lineup by several of the 25 drivers the police believe he stole the cabs from, said Sergeant Nicholas Vreeland, a police spokesman.
Sergeant Vreeland said Mr. McGowan was unemployed and drove the cabs around the city, picking up riders and keeping the fares, which he used to buy crack.
All 25 cabs were stolen from the drivers in Queens starting on July 4, Sgt. Vreeland said. ''He stole his first cab by simulating that he had a weapon in his pocket,'' Sergeant Vreeland said.
Using one cab, the sergeant said, Mr. McGowan posed as a taxi driver and then, pretending that he needed assistance with a flat tire, would wave down another cab driver. When the driver would leave his cab to help, Mr. McGowan would jump in the new cab and drive away, leaving the driver stranded with the old cab, the sergeant said. He stole his last cab on Saturday, the sergeant said.
An anonymous caller led the police to Mr. McGowan, Sergeant Vreeland said. Detectives in the 108th Precinct have not determined how much money Mr. McGowan made.

HEADLINE: 2 Companies, Big and Little, Clash Over Plan on Missiles

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
A proposal to convert aging nuclear missiles into cheap rockets for launching satellites has presented the Government with a difficult choice between conflicting goals: cashing in on the peace dividend and promoting American competitiveness in high-technology industries.
The Lockheed Corporation, the sole builder of submarine-launched ballistic missiles, wants to buy surplus Poseidon missiles being retired by the Navy, remove the warheads and use the missiles to carry small satellites for the space agency, the military and commercial customers. It says its plan could save taxpayers millions of dollars, providing income to the Navy while cutting its costs.
But Lockheed's plan would mean unwelcome competition for small companies that are just entering the commercial rocket business. One of them, the Orbital Sciences Corporation of Fairfax, Va., says it would undercut the Government's promise to spur commercial space technologies. 
''America won't be able to compete using 1970's technology in the 21st century,'' said Barbara Zadina, a spokeswoman for Orbital Sciences. She added that it would be unfair to make Orbital Sciences compete with a product made possible by what she called ''Government dumping,'' the cut-rate sale of used military hardware.
 
Government Is Torn
The young company, which has staked its future on the development of an innovative rocket for launching small satellites, may be on the verge of a commercial breakthrough with its Pegasus rocket. For the first time, the Pegasus this year proved itself able to carry a small satellite into space from under a high-flying airplane instead of from a launching pad on earth.
So far, Government officials remain torn between the conflicting goals, said Richard DalBello, director of the Commerce Department's Office of Space Commerce.
''One is loath, in the current budget conditions, to throw away assets that are already paid for,'' said Mr. DalBello. ''On the other hand, you don't want to hurt people like Orbital Sciences Corporation, who have spent real dollars, not government dollars.''
In June, Lockheed, Orbital Sciences and two other companies submitted bids to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for a contract to launch at least seven small scientific payloads into orbit, beginning in 1992. The competition is being conducted under new rules meant to spur the development of the commercial rocket industry after NASA, which used to launch all satellites for commercial and Government customers, dropped out of that business.
 
Global Telephone Potential
The space agency and the Air Force say they will need additional launchings of small satellites in the years ahead, and companies in the communications business are expected to demand hundreds of launchings of small satellites as well, for purposes like building global cellular telephone networks.
But that market could be served entirely by rockets built from surplus military missiles, analysts say. More than 350 Poseidons, including spares, could be scrapped under terms of the long-range missile treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. Many land-based missiles might be scrapped as well.
Although all the missiles would need extensive modifications, and the costs of using them to carry satellites remain unknown, they clearly could be economically competitive with newly designed rockets built from scratch, industry officials said. The military missiles generally are not big enough to lift big satellites like those carried on the Space Shuttle or the Titan, Delta and Atlas classes of rockets.
The Navy has told NASA that it will allow contractors to buy its excess Poseidon missiles. But under pressure from Orbital Sciences, the Senate Armed Services Committee has questioned the idea.
 
Senators Exert Pressure
Senator John W. Warner of Virginia and Senator John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans, persuaded the committee to call for further study as part of its report on the 1991 military budget. In addition to its headquarters in Virginia, Orbital Sciences has a subsidiary in Arizona.
The committee report acknowledged that selling off the unneeded nuclear missiles ''is an appropriate use of such assets,'' since it would reduce launching costs and expand the nation's space launching capabilities.
But the committee added that it ''firmly believes that the impact of the release of significant numbers of excess Government ballistic missiles on the nascent commercial launch industry must be thoroughly understood and weighed before such release occurs.''
The committee urged the Defense Department not to release the missiles until the White House National Space Council, an inter-agency committee headed by Vice President Dan Quayle, had reviewed the idea.
Lockheed points out that Orbital Sciences itself has benefited from Government assistance. It launched its first test satellite under a contract to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, from a specially equipped B-52 bomber operated by NASA.
Orbital Sciences argues that more benefit from the old missiles is not necessary, that the taxpayers have already collected enough of a dividend from their investment. ''The Poseidons have done their job, they have helped to win the cold war,'' said Ms. Zadina. ''The country has gotten its money's worth already, from deterrence of war.''

HEADLINE: Minor Blessing for Mexico, But Not Really a Windfall

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The sharp jump in oil prices after Iraq's seizure of Kuwait comes as a minor blessing for Mexico, a nation that enriched itself in the early 1980's by exporting high-priced oil but can no longer raise its production to benefit from a new windfall in prices.
Mexico might collect an extra $10 million a day in oil revenue from the higher prices. But it has invested so little in oil exploration in recent years that production has declined to about 2.5 million barrels a day, from a peak of nearly three million barrels a day in December 1982. About half of the production is sold domestically, and 1.2 million barrels are exported each day. 
''Maybe they can squeeze an extra 15,000 barrels a day from their wells, but that's minuscule,'' said George Baker, a Mexican oil industry expert at the Consortium for Research on Mexico, at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Pemex, the state oil company, cut capital spending from nearly $6 billion in 1981 to just over $1 billion today. ''Without new investment, the company sees a gradual decline,'' Mr. Baker said. Venezuela, by contrast, has roughly a million barrels a day in idle production capacity that could be used to increase sharply the 1.6 million barrels that it currently exports each day, most of it to the United States.
The United States, then, would turn to Venezuela rather than to Mexico if its oil supplies from the Mideast were restricted, said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an oil analyst at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. The United States imports more than eight million barrels of oil daily, getting from Mexico only 600,000 barrels, or 7 percent of the total.
Most of the output is purchased by four oil companies: Royal Dutch/Shell, ARCO, Chevron and Exxon. The rest of Mexico's exports go principally to Japan, which buys 150,000 barrels a day, and to Spain and Israel, which buy smaller amounts.
Whoever buys its crude oil, Mexico is unlikely to realize any benefit from the sharply higher prices if Iraq withdraws from Kuwait in the next week or so and world oil prices subside to their June levels.
One reason is that Mexico would need at least 18 months before exploration could begin to raise production levels, Mr. Baker said. And, second, the contracts Mexico signs with foreign purchasers of its oil fail to recognize a short-lived price spike.
Mexico sells nearly all of its oil under contracts that specify a single price for the oil shipped abroad in a given month. The single monthly price is the average of the daily prices in that month. A price increase would have to be sustained for a week or two for the monthly average to rise significantly.
 
Range of Prices
The prices of Mexico's three types of crude - Isthmus, Olmeca and Maya - ranged in June from about $9.35 a barrel to $14.57 a barrel. Since then, each of the prices has risen by about $8 a barrel, with much of the increase coming last week.
The various benefits of a higher oil price begin to show up for Mexico after a month or so, oil experts and economists say. At an extra $8 a barrel, revenue would rise by nearly $10 million a day and $3.6 billion a year. That would greatly reduce Mexico's merchandise trade deficit, which DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting agency, estimates at $3 billion for this year. The extra money would also ease the burden of interest payments on Mexico's $80 billion in foreign debt. And Pemex, which accounts for about $15 billion of the foreign debt, might begin to invest in exploration and production.
''Mexico should plow all this money back into oil,'' said Christopher Whalen, an international trade analyst in Washington. He and others contend, however, that even with higher oil revenues to insure repayment, foreign banks are not likely to renew lending to Pemex.
 
Fear of Pemex Debt
''People are scared of Pemex debt,'' Mr. Baker said. ''All the money that Pemex earned during the oil boom years really went to the central Government as general revenue.''
Nevertheless, Mexico might have the largest untapped oil reserves of any nation outside the Middle East and the Soviet Union, according to an estimate by a petroleum engineer for the United States Geological Survey. The engineer, Bernardo Grossling, said there might be as much as 730 billion barrels of undiscovered crude oil in the Gulf of Campeche and in the jungles along the Mexico-Guatemala border. Proven Mexican reserves now stand at 68 billion barrels.
What's more, the cost of recovering crude oil in Mexico averages less than $10 a barrel, even though a big percentage of the production is from offshore wells. The low production cost, less than half the outlay in the United States, should make Mexico a prime target for exploration. But foreign companies express reluctance to invest in drilling, in large part because Pemex has declined to give these companies a percentage of the revenue from any oil they discover.

HEADLINE: The Price of Confronting Iraq in the Oil Market;
Japanese Joining In Embargo Despite Impact on Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Japan said last night that it would join its allies in halting all purchases of oil from Iraq and Kuwait, cutting off an eighth of the country's entire supply of oil.
The action, which followed a three-day debate about whether Japan might doom its economic growth, effectively leaves Iraq with no large customers for its oil among leading industrial nations.
Japan imports virtually all of its oil, and Government officials said last night that the embargo, if prolonged, might be far more damaging than the twin oil shocks that sent the country into an economic tailspin in the 1970's.
Indeed, investors in the Tokyo stock market greeted the news with a wave of selling today. The 225-share Nikkei index plunged 1,058.29 points, or 3.59 percent, 28,472.09, in early afternoon trading. [Page D7.] Grudging Agreement Over the weekend, even Japan's politically powerful industrial giants grudgingly agreed that there was little choice but to follow the lead of the United States and the European Community, which announced similar embargoes after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday. 
On Friday, Japan announced that it was freezing Kuwaiti assets here, which are variously estimated at $14 billion to $25 billion, mostly in stocks.
But an embargo of oil is politically a far more delicate issue, especially in a country that measures virtually every move by how it could affect the national economy. Some large companies in Japan still observe the longstanding Arab boycott of Israel, largely because they treasure the access to Middle Eastern oil.
Last year Japan imported more than half a million barrels of oil every day from Iraq and Kuwait, which were the country's eighth- and ninth-largest suppliers of oil. The United Arab Emirates was Japan's biggest supplier, providing more than 20 percent of its oil, with Saudi Arabia producing 17 percent and Indonesia about 14 percent.
 
No Improvement Seen
''As time goes on we expect that this may have a considerable impact on the life of the Japanese people, and a heavier impact on Japan than on some other countries,'' Makoto Watanabe, a former ambassador to Jordan who heads the Middle East and African Affairs section of Japan's Foreign Ministry, said last night. ''But the situation on the ground in Kuwait is not improving.''
As part of its announcement, Japan said last night that it would also embargo exports to Iraq and Kuwait, including light and heavy machinery. Last year exports to the two countries combined amounted to more than $1.1 billion. Japan is also freezing economic cooperation with Iraq. Saddam Hussein's Government already owes about $5 billion to Japan.
Despite the Government's fears, experts say that Japanese industry is in far better shape than at any time in its postwar history to cope with markedly higher oil prices and reductions in supply.
Since the Arab oil boycott in the 1970's Japan has built up an extensive petroleum reserve, which officials say will last the country 142 days. But more important, Japan's domestic industries have improved energy efficiency in recent years more than in any other industrial nation.
According to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., $1,000 in goods and services requires half the amount of energy to produce in Japan that it did in the late 1970's. Over the same period of time, the United States also improved the energy efficiency of its industry, but by not nearly the same pace.
 
Reliance on OPEC Reduced
Moreover, at a time that the United States has grown more dependent on oil from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Japan has reduced its reliance on OPEC. According to the Petroleum Association of Japan, about 86 percent of Japan's crude oil imports came from OPEC in 1980, but last year the figure was down to about 70 percent. In that time China and Mexico have become important suppliers.
''Right now the supply and demand situation is no problem,'' said Shigeki Koyama, the president of the Institute of Middle Eastern Economies, a Tokyo research organization that keeps a close watch on energy matters. ''Initially, in fact, big price increases in oil would probably hurt America more than Japan. But over time there could be slow damage to Japan's economy, of an extent that nobody knows.''
That realization was visible here all weekend as the Government wrestled with the question of whether it was willing to risk angering one of its biggest oil suppliers in the name of solidarity with its allies.
 
No Commitments Made
The debate began in earnest early Saturday morning in Tokyo, when President Bush called Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and asked him to join in the embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. So far the embargo is the chief tool for stepping up pressure on Iraq to leave Kuwait. But Mr. Kaifu made no commitments, other than to say that Japan would act after the United Nations Security Council decided on an embargo or other sanctions.
Cutting short a vacation in the Japanese mountains, Mr. Kaifu spent much of the weekend in Tokyo, meeting with Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and the Minister of International Trade and Industry, Kabun Muto.
An official said Mr. Kaifu was given several projections of what might happen to the Japanese economy, which is currently growing at 7 percent annually, if oil prices rose and Japan barred deliveries from Iraq and Kuwait, which together provide 11 to 12 percent of the country's oil. Officials refused to release those projections publicly.
 
Memory of the 1970's
What may have led to their hesitations was the memory of the 1970's. The 1973 oil shock led to a 29 percent inflation rate, taxi driver strikes, toilet paper shortages and riots by Osaka housewives who were angry over shortages of kerosene. Public hostility increased when Japan's Petroleum Association and 12 companies were indicted for creating a cartel to raise prices at the pump.
Japanese officials cited the chaos caused by the last oil shocks to explain the Government's slowness in acting. ''In '73, the oil shock was only a reduction of 5 percent,'' said Yukio Okamato, the head of the American desk of the Foreign Ministry here, who has been deeply involved in the negotiations with the United States. ''Now we are talking about a reduction of 12 percent. That is something we have to take note of.''
But Mr. Okamoto said he sensed ''a healthy evolution of national consciousness'' about the need to stand with the allies. In addition, he said, ''in the ensuing 17 years, the economy has become much more resilient.''

President of US West Named to Chief's Post

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
US West Inc., the Colorado-based telecommunications holding company, has named Richard D. McCormick as its chief executive to succeed Jack A. MacAllister.
Mr. McCormick, who is 50 years old, has been president and chief operating officer. He will now be president and chief executive, and will not be replaced as chief operating officer. 
Mr. MacAllister, 63, was named to head U S West shortly after the breakup of the Bell System was announced in 1982. He will continue as chairman.
''In the size company we have and the issues facing us,'' Mr. McCormick said on Friday, ''we both felt that we should signal the change early so that I can handle the future-oriented issues and he can handle the ones that can be resolved fairly quickly.''
With legislation in Washington, regulation, court rulings, new technologies and markets well beyond the geographic home base, running a regional telecommunications company takes a variety of management skills. ''It's a very complicated industry,'' Mr. McCormick said. He is proud of the company's expansion internationally. ''We've had some real successes in developing our international ventures,'' he said. The company has cable operations in Britain and cellular ventures in Czechoslovakia and Hungary among its international activities.
Mr. MacAllister and Mr. McCormick have had similar careers. Mr. MacAllister began his career with the Bell System in 1950 as an installer-repairman in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Mr. McCormick, a graduate of Iowa State University with an electrical engineering degree, first went to work as an engineer with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in Kansas City, Mo., in 1961, moving to Northwestern Bell in 1969.
He worked in North and South Dakota and Minnesota before being named president of Northwestern Bell in 1982, a job that Mr. MacAllister held before him. Mr. McCormick, a native of Fort Dodge, Iowa, joined U S West in 1985 as executive vice president.
Mr. MacAllister said he planned to spend more time with his family and work on two of his interests, educational excellence and finding employment opportunities for the economically disadvantaged.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks Plunge Again As Mideast Tensions Grow

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Volume was extremely low at 170 million shares for the morning session, about half the level of an active half-day. The trading was so thin that 15 percent of the stocks on the exchange did not open for trading, analysts said.
The analysts and traders described the thin volume as an indication not of panic but of extreme nervousness, which was driving most investors to the sidelines. The dominant theme in the market was uncertainty. 
''It was not so much a drop as a markdown,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, an economist here with Salomon Brothers Inc., the American securities house. ''Nobody is willing to buy in this atmosphere.''
A senior trader at a Japanese brokerage added: ''I can tell you for sure, there are no buyers. There isn't heavy selling, just no bids. Period.''
The market experienced another setback when interest rates spurted upward, in reaction to concerns that higher oil prices might cause inflation in Japan and in other industrialized nations. The yield on the Government's 10-year bonds jumped to 8 percent this morning, up from 7.70 percent a week ago.
The markets were tumultuous in spite of economists' perceptions that Japan would be less affected by an embargo on imports of Iraqi and Kuwait oil than the United States or other large oil-importing countries. Japan is believed to get from 10 percent to 15 percent of its oil from the countries.
On other markets, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong plunged by 162.33 points, to finish the morning session at 3,194.62, and stock prices also fell in New Zealand and Thailand.
 
ISRAELI ISSUES PLUNGE
TEL AVIV, Aug. 5 (Reuters) - The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent Israeli stock prices tumbling today to their biggest one-day drop in seven years. Prices of blue-chip issues plunged 7.57 percent on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. The index, the market's main barometer, dropped by 19.65 points, to close at 240.03. Traders said it was the biggest one-day decline since 1983. Share prices fell 3.63 percent on Thursday, the previous trading day. Trading volume was a record $36 million on Sunday, compared with an average of $23 million in July.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Recession and Inflation Fears Rise

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The credit markets are expected to be whipsawed again this week by the powerful prospects of recession and inflation.
Recession fears were heightened last week by increasingly negative economic indicators, which were topped Friday by the Government's report of a sharp rise in unemployment last month.
The inflation fears were unleashed by the surge in oil prices that followed Iraq's seizure of Kuwait. The two countries are among the biggest oil exporters. In New York, the price of the American benchmark crude oil, West Texas Intermediate, soared to $24.50 a barrel Friday, from $20 the week before and $17 a month ago. 
 
Fall in Rates and Yields
Short-term interest rates and yields fell sharply during the week as investors moved out of the deteriorating stock market and into Treasury securities. Also pushing down the returns on short-term securities was the growing belief that a steadily weakening economy would soon cause the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates in order to avoid a recession.
Because Treasury bills and short-term notes would be immediately affected by lower interest rates, demand for bills was strong. The discount rate on 90-day bills, for example, fell to 7.33 percent last Friday from 7.54 percent the week before, and the yield on two-year notes dropped to 7.79 percent from 8 percent.
But fears that the Iraqi invasion and a possible disruption of oil supplies would lead to a burst of inflation weighed heavily on longer-term Treasury securities and high-grade corporate bonds.
 
8.55 Percent for Long Bond
The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year long bonds rose to 8.55 percent, from 8.47 percent a week before. The long bond's yield would have been higher, save for the widespead belief that the Federal Reserve will soon have to lower rates to head off a recession.
''The Mideast situation that erupted in midweek turned the bond market completely around,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''After bond investors had been lured into thinking that the prospect of a recession would diminish, their hopes were dashed by the new specter of oil-fueled inflation.''
Now, Mr. Sullivan added, bond investors have to worry about the effects of higher oil prices, the reduced chances of cutting military spending and the Federal budget deficit, as well as a recession that will reduce tax revenues on the Federal, state and local levels. ''The prospect of stagflagtion is not very promising to the bond market,'' he said.
 
Gloom on Economy
Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation, the domestic arm of the giant Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo, was even gloomier about the economy but more optimistic about the possibility of a reduction in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
''The July employment data served to erase any lingering doubts in the Street that the economy has deteriorated to the point that the Fed must now take action to prevent a recession from developing in the fourth quarter and then spreading into 1991,'' he said on Friday. ''Indeed, we had expected the Fed to announce a move to cut interest rates before this day was out.''
What heightened concerns about a recession, Mr. Braverman continued, was not so much the drop of 219,000 nonfarm jobs last month, but the loss of 439,00 jobs as measured by a Government survey of households.
''If a person is on someone's payroll even a few hours a week, that person is considered employed,'' Mr. Braverman said. ''But the household survey of employment is considered a far better yardstick of this key economic indicator.''
 
Increase in Hourly Wages
To make the latest employment figures even more upsetting to credit market investors, the Government's report also noted that hourly wages rose six-tenths of 1 percent in July, up from the five-tenths increase the month before.
Approval at the end of last week by the House and the Senate of emergency legislation providing the Treasury Department with $72 billion in additional borrowing authority through Oct. 2 permits the Treasury to hold its mid-quarter refunding auctions this week. The Treasury will auction a record $32.25 billion of debt, consisting of $11.5 billion of three-year notes tomorrow, $10.5 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday and $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday.
Maria Fiorini Ramirez, who heads a investment consulting company bearing her name, said on Friday that, ''had the Fed moved to reduce interest rates today, it would have helped the Treasury in its record refunding auctions next week because many investors would once again be rushing to lock in yields before they declined further.''
As it is, Mrs. Ramirez said, ''most countries that once exported capital now need it themselves, including the Japanese and Germans.''
''In fact, the Japanese may not be as enthusiastic about next week's refunding as they have been,'' she said. ''In any case, we expect good demand for the three-year notes, with somewhat less interest in the seven-year. As for the new 30-year long bond, it could be attractive with a 8 5/8 percent coupon. But looking at the rate structure, we do not expect long-term rates to come down in the foreseeable future.''

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Coming to a Doorknob Near You: a Bag of Ads.

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The prospect of sharp increases in most postal rates next year has breathed new life into the effort to create a nationwide private delivery network that would compete with the United States Postal Service in distributing magazines, catalogues and advertising circulars.
As a result, newspaper companies - which have usually concentrated on distributing papers - must soon decide whether they will try to expand into a much more elaborate business or risk having such rivals as bulk mailers set up such a system to deliver advertising in their markets.
''If newspapers aren't in it, I believe they will have their lunch eaten,'' said Patrick J. Tracy, the general manager of the Commonwealth Printing Company, a subsidiary of Landmark Communications Inc., which owns newspapers in Norfolk and Roanoke, Va., and in Greensboro, N.C.
 
Fierce Competition
The stakes for newspapers are high. They have long faced fierce competition from the mail delivery of advertising circulars, and a private delivery service, charging less than the Postal Service, would only add to it. And in the current weak advertising climate, many newspapers are seeking ways to broaden their business. 
Stan Henry, the chairman of Alternate Postal Delivery Inc., one of the fledgling private delivery operations, is going from city to city to extol his vision: a hugely profitable new venture that would deliver magazines, catalogues and circulars and become what United Parcel Service is to the delivery of packages or Federal Express is to overnight letters.
''I'm not creating a business; I'm creating an industry,'' Mr. Henry said, though he conceded that his new industry was just beginning, with only a few operations in such markets as Buffalo, Omaha and Milwaukee.
Another company, Publishers Express Inc., was formed last year by nine communications companies, including The New York Times Company and Time Warner Inc. It has been experimenting with alternative ways to deliver magazines and circulars in the Atlanta area.
Mr. Henry said he was trying to organize a national network of locally owned delivery operations in the 95 largest markets over the next three or four years. And because most newspapers already have detailed listings and demographic data regarding the households in their markets, he considers them obvious candidates for joining Alternate Delivery's network.
But Mr. Henry said he was also negotiating with local entrepreneurs, cable television systems, weekly papers and bulk mailers, who might have similar household listings.
Landmark is among the first newspaper companies to sign a contract to deliver magazines, catalogues and circulars as part of Alternate Postal Delivery's network, which is based in Grand Rapids, Mich.
Under the system, the network signs contracts with publishers like the Hearst Corporation and retailers like the J. C. Penney Company to deliver national magazines and catalogues in certain ZIP codes where it has affiliate delivery operations.
In those areas, subscribers receive copies of Better Homes & Gardens or Popular Mechanics or more than a dozen other magazines in a plastic bag hung on their doorknobs rather than in their mailboxes.
Included in the bag are such ''ride along'' materials as catalogues, circulars, samples and other promotional materials that Alternate Delivery sells or are sold by the local operator, like Landmark.
 
More Precise Target
Providers of ride-along materials pay a premium price to be delivered with the magazine because their advertising reaches a more precise target. For instance, a hardware store might want its circular delivered with Better Homes & Gardens.
The magazine, on the other hand, would be charged less than the Postal Service's rate. Frank R. Heselton, an assistant Postmaster General, said the cost of mailing a typical magazine weighing about a pound would be about 37.4 cents in 1991 if the proposed rate increases were approved, compared with 29.7 cents now.
Alternate Postal Delivery pays Landmark about 15 cents a household to deliver each magazine, Mr. Tracy said. He then sells additional advertising worth an average of 30 cents a household to go in each bag. His average cost for handling and delivery is 24 cents a bag, giving him an average profit of 21 cents a bag, he said.
 
Talks With Newspapers
Mr. Henry said he was talking to such papers as The Washington Post, The Sacramento Bee, The San Jose Mercury, and The San Francisco Examiner and The Chronicle.
In each city, Mr. Henry requires the local deliverer to set up an operation to serve only a few ZIP codes for six months. If that works to everyone's satisfaction, it is expanded.
While Alternate Postal Delivery is concentrating mainly on building the nationwide house-to-house delivery operation, Publishers Express is focusing on refining the way the delivery packages are assembled.
Howard Rosen, the president of the company, said that when Publishers Express expanded into other markets, it could offer more sophisticated services than Alternate Delivery.
 
Different Versions of Time
For instance, he said, there are typically six different versions of Time magazine delivered in the Atlanta area, each with slightly different advertising tailored to a particular area or even subscriber.
While Publishers Express can deliver a particular Time to a particular house, the Alternate Postal Delivery system cannot.
Though Mr. Rosen and Mr. Henry said there were no plans to merge their operations, several people in the industry said each company complemented the other because Publishers Express had the processing ability while Alternate Delivery was establising the market-by-market distribution techniques.

HEADLINE: SECURITY COUNCIL VOTES 13 TO 0 TO BLOCK TRADE WITH BAGHDAD; FACING BOYCOTT, IRAQ SLOWS OIL: THE IRAQI INVASION;
PULLOUT DEMANDED

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council today registered its outrage over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait by ordering a far-reaching trade and financial boycott on Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
The sanctions, approved just five days after the Council condemned the invasion and demanded that Baghdad immediately withdraw its forces, prohibit all United Nations members from buying oil from either Iraq or occupied Kuwait or having virtually any other commercial or financial dealings with them. [Text of the resolution, page A9.] The embargo won the support of 13 of the Council's 15 members, including all five of the permanent members, which have veto power in the Council - Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the United States. Yemen, the only Arab member, and Cuba abstained.
 
Third Use of Trade Sanctions
This is only the third time in United Nations history that the Council has sought to discipline a country defying its orders by imposing trade sanctions. 
The earlier actions involved Rhodesia in 1967, after its declaration of independence from Britain, and a ban on arms sales to South Africa.
The vote was welcomed by many participants as a sign that the Security Council was emerging from a long period of cold war paralysis and starting to exercise its responsibility under the Charter for enforcing peace and security around the globe.
 
Council Action Praised
Britain's representative, Sir Crispin Tickell, said the Council had ''faced its responsibilities'' and must now ''succeed where the League of Nations failed and the Security Council itself had faltered in the past.''
The United Nations has only limited means of enforcing compliance with today's sanctions, leaving its members to insure that the measures are respected.
The Security Council has powers to ask member states to use military force to insure compliance, although this provision of the Charter has only been used once, in 1950 during the Korean War.
Otherwise, the only practical means of enforcement are political pressure.
But the United States and the 12 European Community nations have already announced severe economic sanctions against Iraq that would fulfill the intent of the United Nations resolution.
 
Rare Unity Impresses Kuwaiti
''In my nine years of experience, I have not seen a cause attract such whole-hearted support,'' said Mohammed Abulhasan, representing the exiled Kuwaiti Government, shaking his head in wonder.
Just before the vote, the United Nations representatives of the established Kuwaiti Government and Iraq clashed in a bitter war of words when they addressed the Council.
Gesticulating and poking at the air with a pencil as he spoke, Mr. Abulhasan accused Iraq of lying when it promised that its troops would start withdrawing on Sunday, saying it is ''increasing and consolidating its military presence on our sacred land.''
He called Iraq's plans to form a new Kuwaiti army ''a cover for the occupying forces already there.''
But he said the resolution the Security Council was about to approve represents a ''historic shift in the Council's work'' and means ''the international community is imposing its will on a country which had flouted all international principles, standards and norms.''
 
Decorum Is Not Forgotten
But even Mr. Abulhasan could not bring himself to ignore completely the parliamentary decorum and the expressions of fraternity that pervade most debate here.
''We have had good relations with them. We loved them. We still love them,'' he said of the Iraqis. ''They are only following their Government's policy. I am sure they feel shame for the situation Bagdad has put them in.''
Iraq's representative, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, insisted that his Government has started to pull out its troops. But the sanctions plan, he said, will ''exacerbate tensions in the Gulf and impede the troop withdrawal.''
He called the embargo ''null and void'' because it was the work of the United States and signified that Washington was trying to use the United Nations to achieve its ''hegemonic aims'' in the gulf area, ''as if the Security Council is simply its Foreign Ministry.''
Mr. Anbari finished his remarks with an appeal to the Security Council ''to annul this resolution.''
 
U.S. Sees Lesson for Iraq
The United States representative, Thomas R. Pickering, said the sanctions plan would show Iraq that ''its disregard for international law will have crippling political and economic costs, including but not limited to arms cutoffs.''
''Our concerted resolve,'' he said, ''will demonstrate that the international community does not and will not accept Baghdad's preference for the use of force, coercion and intimidation.''
The Soviet Union reiterated that it condemns the invasion of Kuwait and supports the sanctions resolution against Baghdad.
The resolution commits the Security Council to ''bring the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraq to an end and to restore the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Kuwait.''
Invoking its authority under Chapter 7 of the Charter, which gives it coercive powers to deter aggression, the resolution must now prohibit ''any activities by their nationals or in their territories which could promote or are calculated to promote the export or transshipment of any commodities or products from Iraq or Kuwait.''
 
'Sale or Supply' Forbidden
It also forbids the ''sale or supply, by their nationals or from their territories or using their flag vessels, of any products or commodities, including weapons or any other military equipment, whether or not originating in their territories.''
All investment in Iraq and Kuwait is banned as well as all payments and monetary transfers to these countries. The only exceptions to the embargo are medical supplies, famine relief and payments intended for strictly humanitarian purposes.
The Council says United Nations members must not recognize the provisional government that Iraq is seeking to install in Kuwait and also requires them to protect the foreign financial and other assets of the established Kuwaiti government.
Finally, it asks the United Nations Secretary General to report regularly on compliance with the sanctions and establishes a special committee of the Security Council to monitor the working of the embargo.
 
Substitute for Military Action
Aside from Cuba and Yemen, the resolution was supported by the Council's 10 rotating members, including Canada, Finland and Romania, representing the industrialized northern countries, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Zaire from Africa, the single Asian member, Malaysia, and Colombia, which with Cuba forms the Latin American contingent.
Britain and Finland said that the embargo was a substitute for military intervention in the dispute and should not be seen as a prelude to it.
But Mr. Pickering, said that ''by this resolution we declare to Iraq that we will use the means available to us provided by Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter'' to obtain the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
Chapter 7 provides both for economic sanctions and, where these do not work, the use of force against countries that defy the Security Council's orders.
Several diplomats speculated that the United States or other major powers may decide to blockade the pipeline terminals in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, through which most of Iraq's oil reaches the outside world, as well as Kuwait's oil port on the Gulf.
Taking one measure of the sense of urgency in the Security Council was Gilberto Schlittler, director of the Political Committee's Division of the Security Council and a 26-year veteran at the United Nations. ''This,'' he said, ''is the first time we have skipped lunch - certainly in the past 15 years.''

HEADLINE: SECURITY COUNCIL VOTES 13 TO 0 TO BLOCK TRADE WITH BAGHDAD; FACING BOYCOTT, IRAQ SLOWS OIL: THE IRAQI INVASION;
BLOCKADE IS HINTED

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
American and British officials said today they would be prepared to organize an international naval blockade of Iraq to insure enforcement of economic sanctions imposed on the country by the United Nations.
Bush Administration officials emphasized, however, that for now they would far prefer to enforce the sanctions by persuading Turkey and Saudi Arabia to close the Iraqi pipelines that run across their territories.
Closing the pipelines, which carry about 90 percent of Iraq's crude oil to market, would deprive Baghdad of its main source of foreign income.
 
Only if Sanctions Fail
Only if nonmilitary initiatives fail, and Iraq succeeds in maintaining trade despite the United Nations sanctions, will the Administration and allies like Britain and France opt for a blockade, Administration officials said.
The officials said that Washington had not sounded out the Soviet Government on participating in a naval quarantine of Iraq, which officials said could be organized under United Nations auspices or directed by Americans. 
Turkey receives oil and derives substanial revenue from the Iraqi pipeline. To persuade the Turks to close it, the United States has asked the exiled Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, to guarantee that he will compensate Turkey for any economic reversals, the officials said.
The Emir still controls the estimated $100 billion in Kuwaiti investments abroad, and Bush Administration officials said he seemed receptive to their idea.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is to visit Turkey on Wednesday, complementing a visit to Riyadh today by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Mr. Cheney is seeking Saudi Arabia's help in choking the Iraqi economy a as well as permission to use Saudi airfields in the event that Washington resorts to military intervention.
Washington's deputy ambassador to Iraq, Joseph C. Wilson, was summoned today by President Saddam Hussein in the first known contact between the Iraqi leader and an American official since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday. A senior Administration official said that Mr. Hussein showed ''no inclination'' to back down or to pull out of Kuwait soon.
President Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who was in Washington for consultations, called for strict enforcement of the United Nations boycott and said they were discussing a number of plans to make it work.
With Mrs. Thatcher and the NATO Secretary General, Manfred Worner, at his side, President Bush said at the White House: ''We need to discuss full and total implementation of these sanctions, ruling out nothing at all. These sanctions must be enforced. I think the will of the nations around the world -not just the NATO countries, not just the E.C., not just one area or another -the will of the nations around the world will be to enforce these sanctions.''
 
'Encouraging Others'
Mr. Bush added: ''We'll leave the details of how we implement it to the future, but we'll begin working on that immediately. That's how we go about encouraging others to do that and what we ourselves should be doing.''
Asked about the possibility of a naval blockade to reinforce the United Nations sanctions, Mrs. Thatcher said the first priority was to insure that the trade sanctions work. But if Britain, the United States and the world community conclude that a blockade is essential for compliance with the sanctions, ''you would have to consider'' such a move, she said.
She pointed out that Britain has one ship stationed in the Persian Gulf and that two more frigates, one from Mombassa, Kenya, and the other from Malaysia, are to arrive in the Gulf by the weekend. France has dispatched a warship to the Arabian Sea.
''Those sanctions must be enforceable,'' Mrs. Thatcher said. ''I cannot remember a time when we had the world so strongly together against an action as now.''
 
Seeking a Broad Coalition
The Administration is seeking to assemble as broad a coalition as possible against Iraq, both to isolate Baghdad and to insure that efforts to restore Kuwait's independence will not turn into a symbolic duel between the United States and Mr. Hussein. Such a confrontation might prompt many Arab countries to lean toward the Iraqi President.
All of the diplomatic and military moves by the Administration are aimed at punishing Iraq and at sending a signal to the frightened Arab states that they will not be alone if they stand up to Baghdad, officials said.
Without the support of Arab countries, it would be hard to sustain any meaningful economic sanctions or to pose a credible military deterrent.
''What we are trying to do now,'' one senior Administration official said, ''is maintain a strong international consensus, while we position ourselves to deal militarily with a possible overt threat by Iraq to the Saudis.
''We have to make sure everyone stays in line to maximize the pressure on Saddam,'' he said.
Mr. Bush received a telephone call on Sunday from King Hussein of Jordan, shortly after the President castigated Arab leaders who have refused to condemn the Iraqi invasion. Among those leaders is King Hussein.
 
Disillusioned by Jordan
United States officials described the President as deeply disillusioned with the King, whom Mr. Bush once counted among his close friends. The President reminded King Hussein that Jordan had asked for time to work out an ''Arab solution'' to the Iraqi crisis, but that all that this time had produced was waffling by certain Arab states, the officials said.
Mr. Baker is to travel to Turkey on Wednesday in a bid to win Ankara's approval for cutting off the Iraqi pipeline running through its territory and to seek Turkish cooperation in any military action to enforce a blockade or deter further Iraqi aggression.
Officials said Mr. Baker would assure Ankara that the West would not let Turkey suffer economically from participating in the boycott of Iraq. Mr. Bush today asked Mr. Worner, the NATO Secretary General, to urgethat all of the NATO allies notify Turkey of their willingness to stand behind the country if it is attacked by Iraq.
An Administration official said the message to Mr. Worner was that ''very few things'' could pose a greater threat to NATO than the the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait or a potential Iraqi push into Saudi territory.
''NATO has to be prepared to play a military role either collectively or through individual states,'' the official said.
Mr. Baker spoke this morning for a half-hour by telephone with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Administration officials said Mr. Baker was seeking assurances that the Soviets would support the Security Council resolution to impose a total economic boycott on Baghdad.
Mr. Shevardnadze told Mr. Baker that Moscow would support the resolution, officials said, and the two men discussed the safety of their citizens in Kuwait and Iraq.
 
Soviet Frigate in Gulf
The Soviet Union also has a frigate in the gulf region, press reports from the area indicate. United States officials said they had not decided whether they would be prepared to go as far as engaging in a joint military initiative with Moscow to enforce sanctions against Iraq.
Administration officials said that Vice President Dan Quayle was rearranging his schedule so he could spend time pressing Argentina and Brazil to join the Soviet, Chinese and Western arms embargo of Baghdad.
Mr. Quayle is planning to ask Venezuela, an OPEC member, to increase its oil output to help overcome any shortages that might result from losses of Kuwaiti and Iraqi production.
Because of his trip to Turkey, Mr. Baker postponed a meeting he had scheduled for later this week with Foreign Minister David Levy of Israel. Although the postponement was a matter of scheduling, Administration officials said they were not particularly eager to see the Israeli Foreign Minister in Washington at a time when the United States is trying to line up support in the Arab world.

HEADLINE: The Iraqi Invasion;
Oil Prices Increase Sharply Again; World Financial Markets Tumble

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Oil prices rose sharply again yesterday and financial markets around the world plummeted as the international embargo against oil from Iraq and Kuwait appeared to be taking hold.
From Tokyo to Frankfurt to New York, investors drove the prices of stocks and bonds down abruptly on fears that with oil even more costly than expected a few days ago and supplies cut back, higher inflation and lower economic growth are more likely worldwide.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell by 93.31 points, or 3.3 percent, to 2,716.34, its biggest one-day decline since Oct. 13, 1989. Most other industrial nations import a larger share of their oil than the United States, and the market declines were even more dramatic elsewhere.
 
Drops in Japan and Europe
The Tokyo market fell 3.5 percent yesterday and plunged 4.6 percent in the morning session today. But the Japanese stocks rebounded somewhat in the afternoon and were off 2.15 an hour before the market closed. Frankfurt was down 5.4 percent yesterday and Paris dropped 5.1 percent. 
Interest rates worldwide rose yesterday because higher energy prices would increase inflation. That sent bond prices falling.
Governments and central banks throughout the world are beginning to weigh the implications for economic policy of the recent oil price increases. In Washington, for example, it now seems uncertain whether the Bush Administration and Congress will push for a sizable reduction in the budget deficit this year. With the economy already weak and higher energy prices likely to slow growth even more, any large cutbacks in Federal spending would almost insure a recession, economists say.
The impact of the embargo by the United States and its allies became apparent yesterday when Iraq sharply cut the flow of oil through pipelines across Turkey to the Mediterranean, after tankers that had been waiting to be loaded left empty, complying with the sanctions against Baghdad.
With the embargo starting to pinch, oil traders bid up the price of available supplies. In London, Brent crude reached $26.80 for September delivery, up $3 since Friday, and in New York, West Texas Intermediate reached $28.05, up $3.56 from Friday. Those two crudes set the price for hundreds of transactions involving oil all over the world, and both figures are up 75 percent since mid-June.
''People are scrambling like hell to get crude,'' said George Babikian, president of the ARCO Products Company.
Most companies had larger-than-usual inventories of crude oil before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait because of overproduction by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, but in the face of rising prices, many buyers were apparently deciding that it was better to buy now, at high prices, than later, when prices might be even higher or oil might not be available.
''The move is to make sure you've got enough crude to keep your system wet,'' Mr. Babikian said.
Nauman Barakat, first vice president of futures at Shearson Lehman, said: ''This is amazing. The market is up by $2 or $3 every day.''
 
Energy Agency to Meet
While oil companies scrambled, the International Energy Agency, which is based in Paris, announced that its members would meet there on Thursday to discuss whether to begin sharing oil supplies. The 21 member nations have an agreement to share supplies when an expected supply disruption threatens to cause a 7 percent shortfall to any of the countries. But a spokesman, Lionel Walsh, said yesterday that ''we do not expect it to be triggered at the moment.''
Motorists, meanwhile, continue to see the price of gasoline they buy rise. An American Automobile Association survey of 1,400 gasoline stations found that the price of unleaded regular had risen to $1.18 a gallon as of Sunday, from $1.07 on Wednesday.
Reacting to concerns about rising gas prices, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, urged oil companies to forgo ''anticipatory'' rises for gas and other products. ''It is not clear that all of the increases that have been reported at the consumer level are necessary,'' he said.
 
'Runaway War Profiteering'
Representative Frank Annunzio, an Illinois Democrat who heads a House subcommittee on financial institutions, said that oil companies were engaged in ''runaway war profiteering,'' and Senator Richard Bryan, a Nevada Democrat, said ''the big oil companies have gone on a feeding frenzy. Even though America has ample oil supplies on hand, these giants have decided to take us to the cleaners.''
The Governor of Michigan, James L. Blanchard, called on the United States Attorney General to investigate the ''dramatic and highly questionable increases in gasoline prices.''
The Attorney General of Massachusetts, writing on behalf of his counterparts in Maine, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont, sent a letter to the antitrust division of the Justice Department in Washington asking for an investigation to determine ''whether American consumers are being unnecessarily harmed by anticompetitive conduct.''
James F. Rill, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the antitrust division, said the Justice Department would ''look closely for any indication that these increases may be the result of anti-competitive activity.''
For their part, the oil companies said they were setting prices in accord with the levels established on the commodity exchanges. But more increases seemed certain, as the wholesale price of unleaded fuel rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange by 9.34 cents a gallon, or 12.9 percent, closing at 81.52 cents. Pump prices include state and Federal taxes and a retail markup.
 
Speculation on Saudi Curb
With Iraq's oil exports through Turkey almost stopped, oil analysts speculated that the flow through Saudi Arabia might be the next to be interrupted. The line across Saudi Arabia runs from Iraq's Rumaila oilfield, just north of Kuwait, to Yanbu, the Saudi port on the Red Sea. The pipeline was originally built to assure that the Iran-Iraq war would not interrupt Iraqi exports through the Persian Gulf.
Another impediment to Iraqi exports was the wariness of tanker owners to load Iraqi crude, for fear of turning their ships into a kind of unwanted ''garbage barge.''
''There is certainly the possibility that you'd have nowhere to put it, you'd have to keep the oil until somebody would accept it,'' said an executive of an American company that operates tankers between the United States and the Persian Gulf. He insisted that his company not be identified.
Even if the oil were loaded now for a destination country that today would accept the oil, the situation might change by the time the oil got there, experts said.
 
Other Constraints Cited
In Washington, Philip K. Verleger Jr., a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics and a commodity expert, cited other constraints. Before oil is loaded on a tanker, he said, the buyer must generally obtain a letter of credit from a bank, promising the producing country the value of the cargo, which can be $50 million. ''No bank in any of the countries embargoing Iraq or Kuwait will give a letter of credit; that's the whole Western world,'' he added. ''A Brazilian bank might do it, but then you can't clear the letter through New York.''
The price run-up comes as crude supplies are substantially larger than usual for this time of year. ''The psychology may be more alarming than the actual structure of the market,'' said Robin West, the president of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington-based consulting firm, who was one of several experts to point out that oil inventories are still quite high.
''If the market structure is recognized for what it really is, you may see prices begin to moderate,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Iraqi Invasion;
Iraqis Shut Pipeline to Turkey After Ships Sail Away Empty

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Apparently already feeling the effects of an American-orchestrated boycott, Iraq sharply reduced the flow of oil today through twin pipelines that cross southern Turkey and normally transport more than half its oil exports.
Oil officials in Baghdad, citing ''marketing difficulties'' in a message to their Turkish counterparts, entirely shut down one of the side-by-side pipelinesand reduced by nearly a third the flow through the other.
The effect was to cut Iraq's overall daily export of 2.7 million barrels by at least 40 percent.
 
Tankers Sail Away Empty
The twin pipelines stretch about 820 miles from the Kirkuk oilfields in northern Iraq to offshore terminals near Yumurtalik, a Turkish port in the northeastern Mediterranean. The pipelines can pump as much as 1.8 million barrels a day, but they are said to have been operating at less than capacity. 
According to Turkish officials and Western diplomats, several foreign-flagged tankers that were supposed to take on oil in the last few days sailed away empty after the United States, the European Community and Japan imposed an embargo on Iraq. There was no elaboration on the identity of the tankers.
Storage tank capacity at Yumurtalik is limited, and Turkish officials said Iraq had ordered the pipeline flow to be cut when it learned that there was no room to store more oil.
''If you haven't any place to sell the oil, you might as well shut the pipeline,'' Joseph Story, an oil specialist who heads Gulf Consulting Services outside Washington, said in a telephone interview.
There were diplomatic reports, which could not be independently confirmed, that trucks that usually deliver oil into Turkey from northern Iraq did not cross the border today.
Besides using the pipelines across Turkey, Iraq also sends oil, the mainstay of its economy, through a pipeline across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea. There was no word if that facility would be affected as well.
 
Turkey Caught in the Middle
The Iraqi action came on a fast-paced day in the Persian Gulf crisis in which Turkey's potentially central role as both an Iraqi and a Western ally came into clearer focus.
Underscoring that point was an announcement in Washington that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d would visit Ankara on Thursday for consultations with the Turkish leaders.
As part of the United States campaign for a full economic boycott of Iraq, which includes a possible shutdown of its oil pipelines across foreign territory, President Bush has telephoned President Turgut Ozal of Turkey three times since Friday.
The decision to send Mr. Baker here portended a new dimension to the American strategy, but it was not clear whether it meant new political or possibly even military components.
 
A Military Staging Area
If the United States is indeed laying the groundwork for military action against Iraq, its bases in Turkey, which is a member of NATO, would be logical staging areas for aircraft and troops.
But Turkish officials make clear that it would not be easy to persuade them to join a military operation against Iraq.
As it is, they have proceeded with extreme caution in deciding whether to join the West in economic sanctions out of concern about upsetting their unpredictable and dangerous neighbor, which supplies about half of Turkey's oil imports.
Some Turkish commentators have expressed irritation with the United States and the countries of Western Europe, which they accuse of repeatedly ignoring and slighting Turkey except when its help is needed.
''Our Western allies have basically always wanted the same thing from us - to protect their welfare, not ours,'' Gunes, a conservative daily, said in a commentary over the weekend.
 
'A Modern Adolf Hitler'
Turkey has joined the global condemnations of the invasion of Kuwait ordered by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and insists on a complete troop withdrawal. ''Obviously, we are faced with a modern Adolf Hitler,'' said a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''He's a madman, and we hope he will not be around after this episode.''
But the Turks were waiting for the United Nations Security Council to order sanctions before taking any measures of their own.
''You will not find us in the forefront,'' the senior official acknowledged, adding, as did others, that even if Turkey agreed on joining an economic blockade it would insist on assurances of help from to replace the Iraqi oil that is stands to lose.
So to some degree, Iraq's announcement that it was cutting the flow of oil across Turkey came as a relief to officials here. It eased pressure they were feeling from Washington to shut the facilities themselves, and it still left enough oil flowing for now to avoid an immediate economic crisis.
On Sunday, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan, said during a visit here that he thought Turkey would remain neutral in the crisis. But Turks insisted today that their caution did not imply neutrality, and they again denounced the invasion.
Mr. Ramadan, who went to a meeting with Mr. Ozal dressed in a fatigue uniform with a pistol on his hip, cautioned later that a Turkish decision to close the pipelines ''would create mistrust'' between the countries.

HEADLINE: Bhutto Is Dismissed in Pakistan After 20 Months

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The Government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was dismissed today by the President of Pakistan, who accused her administration of corruption, nepotism and other acts ''in contravention of the Constitution and the law.''
A caretaker Government led by Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, a former member of Ms. Bhutto's party who had gone over to the parliamentary opposition, was sworn into office.
Hours later President Ghulam Ishaq Khan declared a state of emergency, citing a ''threat to the security of Pakistan by external aggression and internal disturbances.'' The emergency declaration gives him the power to make laws and to suspend civilian courts and individual rights.
Earlier, in a somber news conference in the room in the Presidential Palace where Ms. Bhutto took the oath of office as Prime Minister in a glittering ceremony 20 months ago, President Ishaq Khan said that the National Assembly, Pakistan's Parliament, ''had lost the confidence of the people.'' 
He said new elections would be held on Oct. 24. The Pakistani Constitution empowers the President to name and dismiss governments at his sole discretion if in his judgment the Government is unable to carry out its duties.
But Ms. Bhutto, the first woman to head a modern Islamic state, called the action ''illegal and unconstitutional.'' At a news conference tonight, she asserted that her opponents were trying to keep her from winning the next election, but that she believed she had the popular support to return to power.
She said her Pakistan Peoples Party may challenge the President in court, although the grounds for such a challenge were not specified.
''I don't feel betrayed by the President,'' she said. ''I believe there were other elements that wanted me out.''
Pakistan's top military officers were present at the swearing-in of the caretaker Government. Pakistanis assume that the ouster of Ms. Bhutto could not have taken place without the army's support, if not instigation. But Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, the army commander, said before the ceremony that the military had not been involved in politics recently and would remain out of government in the future.
Before Mrs. Bhutto won an election in 1988, Pakistan had been ruled by military governments for 25 of the 41 years since it became independent in 1947.
Among the uncertainties resulting from the surprise announcement today was the possibility of an eruption in Sind Province, Ms. Bhutto's home territory. Whether Sindhis loyal to her family will accept her ouster seems to hinge on how willing they are to give another government the opportunity to deal with the violence that has racked the province in recent years.
 
Questions on Policies
Mr. Jatoi, the new Prime Minister, is also a Sindhi, but he lost his seat in the province in the 1988 election. He later picked up a seat in neighboring Punjab province and took his place in the National Assembly under the banner of his small National Peoples Party, which he formed after breaking with Ms. Bhutto in 1986.
The dismissal of the Bhutto Government also raises a host of questions about Pakistan's policies on the civil strife in neighboring Afghanistan and in Kashmir, on which talks with India were due to be resumed this week. The President's action also means that Pakistan can avoid or at least postpone a divisive and potentially violent debate on the Islamization of the country's legal, educational and broadcasting systems. A bill supported by Muslim conservatives was scheduled to be introduced in Parliament this week.
Asked this evening after his swearing-in what his first priorities would be, Prime Minister Jatoi said only, ''Safeguarding the national interests.''
 
Focus on a Father-in-Law
In leveling corruption charges, the President alluded to numerous officials in Ms. Bhutto's circle, and especially to her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, and his father, Hakim Ali Zardari. Reports in the Pakistani press have said he has made a fortune on property deals while holding a high Government position.
A leading political commentator, Ghani Eirabie, said in an interview tonight that her father-in-law had long been regarded as a ''crook,'' and that Mrs. Bhutto's gravest mistake may have been agreeing to an arranged marriage with the wrong family.
Other accusations leveled by the President involve Ms. Bhutto's management of the national Government. The President said she had been involved in the paying of illegal ''inducements'' to buy parliamentary or other political support. He said she had ridiculed the national judiciary and the Senate and had ''wilfully undermined and impaired'' the workings of provincial governments.
 
Violence Cited
Mr. Ishaq Khan also held Mrs. Bhutto responsible for failing to protect Pakistanis from ''rural and urban violence'' and for allowing Sind province to sink into near civil war between families that trace their roots in the province for many generations, and those who arrived as, or are descended from, Muslims who immigrated to Pakistan with the partition of British India in 1947.
Unlike the practice in other democracies, Ms. Bhutto was dismissed without the benefit of an impartial inquiry or the right to fight a no-confidence motion in the national Parliament.
Ms. Bhutto, whose Pakistan Peoples Party took office in December 1988, enjoyed huge popular support and sympathy at the beginning. But she disappointed many of her early supporters.
Her rise to power at the age of 35 had been swift. The elections that swept her to office took place three months after the death in a plane crash of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who had led a military Government in Pakistan for eight years and who dominated a non-partisan but elected Parliament for the last two years of his life.
 
A Personal Crusade
The election of November 1988 was a personal crusade for Ms. Bhutto. General Zia had overthrown her father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in 1977 after political violence against Mr. Bhutto's autocratic populist regime paralyzed the country. Two years later, President Zia refused to pardon Mr. Bhutto after he was convicted of complicity in a political murder.
Ms. Bhutto's father was hanged in 1979, despite pleas for clemency from world leaders. Years of house arrest, then exile, followed for her and her mother, Nusrat Bhutto.
One of Mrs. Bhutto's brothers, Mir Murtaza, fled to Kabul, where he formed a guerrilla organization to avenge his father's death, and was involved in a number of violent acts in Pakistan. He remains under criminal indictment here and has not been able to return to Pakistan, even since his sister became Prime Minister.
Ms. Bhutto, whom General Zia allowed to return to Pakistan in 1986, quickly took charge of the opposition to military rule, but alienated several older leaders of her father's party.
Her critics repeatedly note that she never held a job or political office before becoming Prime Minister of South Asia's second-largest nation. They say her lack of experience was a handicap not only in her political dealings but in making policy decisions involving the war in neighboring Afghanistan and the grave economic problems at home.
Ms. Bhutto, who had promised an era of improved civil and human rights after 11 years of military-dominated government, was unable to organize an efficient government or manage her party in Parliament. No major legislative programs were introduced.
Islamic ordinances demeaning to women were not repealed, nor were laws against child labor. Ms. Bhutto began to lose liberal support, but even critics argued to the end that almost any alternative to her would be worse.
Ms. Bhutto also squandered much of her initial energy in attempting to burnish her father's image despite many Pakistanis' qualms about his record, rather than building on her own substantial following and making a name for herself outside his shadow. She also spent a great deal of time in her early months attempting to dislodge an opposition-led Government in Pakistan's most prosperous and populous province, Punjab, led by Chief Minister Nawaz Sharif, who became her most outspoken rival.
 
U.S. Reaction to Ouster
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 (AP) - The State Department said today it regards Prime Minister Bhutto's dismissal from office as an internal matter, but Democrats in Congress called for sanctions against Pakistan.
''A constitutional change in government is an internal matter for the people in Pakistan to decide,'' said a State Department spokeswoman, Nancy Beck.
Two of the Democrats issuing statements, Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, and Representative Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, urged the suspension of all economic and military aid to Pakistan under the law applying to the ouster of any democratically elected government by military coup or decree.

HEADLINE: Plan to Burn Dioxin Stirs Fear in Arkansas

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Ark.

 BODY:
Unless a small, determined band of residents have their way, this city of 29,000 people is about to become the site of the nation's largest incineration of dioxin.
Starting in mid-August, a state contractor plans to burn 28,500 barrels of toxic waste at an abandoned pesticide plant in the middle of a residential neighborhood where subdivisions run to the edge of the chain-link fence. The burning will go on 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for 7 to 10 months, until all the barrels are gone.
 
Health Effects in Dispute
Most of the barrels are full of chemicals like DDT, aldrin and dieldrin, wastes from more than three decades' production of pesticides and herbicides. About 2,800 contain dioxin, whose effects on human health are debated but whose toxicity is widely acknowledged: The town of Times Beach, Mo., was evacuated and abandoned after it was discovered that dioxin in waste oil had been sprayed on the streets. 
Opponents, saying Jacksonville's pesticide industry is responsible for a rash of cancers, stillbirths and miscarriages among residents, fear that the burning could release deadly chemicals and sow still more illness. But state and Federal health officials say they have found no evidence of illness that could be linked to the toxic waste. And the Environmental Protection Agency says the incinerator will reach such high temperatures - 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit - that it will destroy all but infinitesimal traces of the chemicals.
Nevertheless, what happens here will have an effect on how hundreds of other cities and towns deal with their highly toxic waste sites. ''There is a rush to burn all over the country now,'' said Hugh B. Kaufman, assistant to the director of the Hazardous Site Control Division at the United States Environmental Protection Agency. ''If the Jacksonville burn occurs, it's going to give more impetus to burning toxic waste on sites in populated areas, which is going to save the responsible parties a lot of money.''
 
'Go Get 'Em'
The last pesticide manufacturer in Jacksonville, the Vertac Chemical Corporation, stopped production in the early 1980's and closed for good in 1987. But on humid days here, the smell of pesticide still lingers in the air. The opponents of the incinerator, a few dozen fiercely committed residents who have the backing of Greenpeace and other national environmental groups, say the cancers, stillbirths and other health problems that have ravaged their families can be traced directly to the toxins produced and stored by Vertac and its predecessors, including the defoliant Agent Orange.
''Just before my mother died at 55 with a rare liver cancer, she said to me, 'How come everybody around this town dies early?' '' said Patty Frase, who herself had four miscarriages before moving away. ''She told me, 'Go get 'em.' And I am.''
Although incineration of toxic waste still stirs considerable scientific debate, the temporary incinerator in Jacksonville is one of the first in a wave of such projects. In the last two years alone, the Government has authorized the use of 60 temporary incinerators at toxic waste sites, said Paul Nadeau, acting director of E.P.A.'s Hazardous Site Control Division. These temporary incinerators, like the one in Jacksonville, are designed to be removed after the waste has been burned. Only a few of the 60 incinerators have been built so far.
The agency permits the use of these incinerators at the nation's 1,219 worst hazardous waste sites catalogued on the Superfund National Priorities List. About 400 municipalities are on the list; Jacksonville alone has three Superfund sites - the chemical plant and two city-owned landfills.
Aside from the temporary incinerators, waste disposal companies have proposed building permanent toxic waste incinerators in 25 cities, including Kansas City, Mo.; Memphis; Houston; Las Vegas, Nev.; Linden, N.J., and Model City, north of Niagara Falls, N.Y. These commercial incinerators would burn 750,000 tons of toxic waste a year, about double the capacity of existing commercial incinerators that burn toxic waste.
But Mr. Kaufman of the E.P.A.'s Hazardous Site Control Division, a frequent internal critic of the agency, said that if the Jacksonville plan was stopped, it would send a signal to the rest of the country ''that this is an unacceptable way of handling the problem.''
Opponents of the Jacksonville incinerator say the drums of waste should be stored in concrete bunkers while new disposal technologies are developed. They plan to file lawsuits to stop the incinerator as soon as it starts burning toxic waste. They demand an environmental impact study of the incinerator's effect on the community, buy-outs of several hundred homes that border the plant and other toxic waste sites in Jacksonville, and a comprehensive health survey of people living near the sites.
 
E.P.A. Insists It's Safe
The E.P.A. replies that incineration is safe and is the only legal way of disposing of dioxin. ''We are satisfied we have the technology to do the job,'' said Carl E. Edlund, chief of agency's Superfund Program for the Southern region. ''The E.P.A. has had ongoing investigations into incineration technology since the 70's. We have a high degree of confidence in it.''
But Mr. Kaufman said the agency's public pronouncements on incineration did not reflect the its internal concerns. Citing an April 1985 report by an E.P.A. scientific advisory board that was highly critical of incinerator safety regulations, Mr. Kaufman said there was no technology available, then or now, to keep constant track of the emissions from an incinerator's stack. Instead, incinerator performance is projected, based on initial test burns and the incinerator's general operating conditions.
As a result, incinerators may be just converting one hazardous substance into another, the panel said. ''By E.P.A.'s own admission,'' Mr. Kaufman said, ''its regulations on incinerators are lacking and don't do the job of protecting the environment and public health.''
Dioxin has been burned at two other sites in the United States, Gulfport, Miss., and Denny Farms, Mo., without apparent incident. But the quantities were small, and opponents say they give no indication of the scale of the incineration planned for Jacksonville.
 
The Dioxin Puzzle
The chemical is itself a mystery. In laboratory animals it causes cancer, birth defects and developmental defects, and it reduces immunity to a variety of diseases.
But there has been no documentation of these effects on people, even though dioxin has long been a focus of scientific and environmental inquiry - at the center, for example, of the long-running dispute over the possible effects of Agent Orange, the defoliant used in Vietnam. The only ailment dioxin is known to cause in humans is chloracne, a skin disease. The largest dioxin release in history, in an accident at a chemical plant in Seveso, Italy, in 1976, resulted in no deaths or permanent injuries.
Dr. Vernon N. Houk, an assistant surgeon general and director of the Center for Environmental Health and Injury Control at the Federal Centers for Disease Control, says a growing body of information indicates that people are not as susceptible to dioxin as animals.
 
Outrage Over an Article
Jacksonville is a highly transient community, dominated by the Little Rock Air Force Base, which contributes a third of the city's 29,000 population and most of the economic base.
In April, when Family Circle magazine named Jacksonville as one of 17 cities and towns that might be ''at risk from contamination,'' local leaders were outraged. ''The editors of Family Circle have been in the kitchen too long,'' Garrick Feldman, editor of The Sunday Leader, wrote in a front-page column, and the City Council passed a resolution of censure. The magazine responded in August with an article that focused on Jacksonville, titled ''Toxic Nightmare on Main Street.''
Officials here still support the incineration plan. ''People all over the state want a health study every time they find a dump or chemical plant in their neighborhood,'' said Dr. Thomas C. McChesney, a Jacksonville veterinarian who is the state's chief epidemiologist. He said none of public health statistics for Jacksonville were unusual. ''You can do the study for political reasons, but not for scientific reasons.''
Mayor Tommy Swaim said, ''I haven't asked for a health study, but I would not oppose one.''
But the opponents say their own medical histories are reason enough for a health study. ''I've been to too many hospitals, I've been to too many funerals and I've seen too much to think there isn't mass murder going on here,'' said Mozelle Bergschneider of People Against a Chemically Contaminated Environment, the local anti-incinerator group.
The opponents say they have a hard time getting officials to take any of their concerns seriously. Ms. Frase, the former Jacksonville resident who is a co-founder of the Environmental Congress of Arkansas, said she had ''begged and pleaded with the city to put up fences and warning signs'' at contaminated sites in public areas of Jacksonville; the signs she puts up, she added, are routinely removed. For example, dioxin has been found in the fish and sediment of Lake Dupree, a pond next to a baseball diamond in the city's Dupree Park. A sign near the lake says, ''Unauthorized persons keep out,'' and another has a no-fishing symbol.
Asked why the city does not put up fences or use more descriptive warnings, Mayor Swaim replied: ''If you put fences up, people would just climb over them. But if it makes people happy, I would put up a no-swimming sign.''

HEADLINE: The Iraqi Invasion;
U.S. ACTS TO RAISE MIDEAST STRENGTH

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The United States moved today to increase its naval forces in the Middle East for a possible blockade to enforce the United Nations trade sanctions against Iraq, and other Western officials indicated that they were prepared to join in such an action if it was necessary.
An American aircraft carrier battle group is scheduled to sail on Tuesday to join two others already in the region. The group's carrier, the Saratoga, will be accompanied by 2,100 Marines and the battleship Wisconsin, which is armed with cruise missiles.
Western European nations, meanwhile, have moved to increase their naval presence in the region. 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said after meeting with President Bush today that Britain would consider taking part in a blockade if it was needed to enforce the U.N. sanctions.
Mrs. Thatcher said that Britain has one ship in the Persian Gulf and that two additional vessels would reach the gulf by Sunday. The two additional British frigates are steaming to the Gulf from South Africa and Malaysia.
 
France Increases Role
France is also increasing its naval presence in the gulf by sending a destroyer to join two frigates in the region. The French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, has said that Paris is ready to join in a blockade if it becomes necessary.
The United States already has eight ships in the Persian Gulf, not counting the three aircraft carrier battle groups being sent to the area.
The carrier Independence and six accompanying vessels are taking up position in the northern Arabian Sea, within striking range of Iraq. The carrier Eisenhower and six additional vessels are already deployed in the Eastern Mediterranean.
The Saratoga battle group is scheduled to leave Florida on Tuesday and will reach the Mediterranean in about 10 days. The Saratoga, the Wisconsin, and an accompanying force of Marines has been previously scheduled to leave this week to relieve the Eisenhower group. But with the crisis in the Gulf, those forces are unlikely to be withdrawn on schedule.
Pentagon officials said a group of F-111 fighter bombers, normally based in England, were in Turkey today participating in a previously scheduled NATO exercise. Although the aircraft, which were once used to bomb targets in Libya, were within striking distance of Iraq and Kuwait, Pentagon officials insisted their presence was coincidental and that they were not planned for use in any Middle East operation.
Naval analysts said that the blockade could be established in waters around three ports that ship Iraqi or Kuwaiti oil: Kuwait; Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, a Red Sea port, and Yumurtalik, near Ceyhan, Turkey, in the Eastern Mediterranean.
 
Checkpoints Established
Shipping companies, made aware of the sanctions, would be cleared through checkpoints established at the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf; in the Red Sea and at the Suez Canal and outside Turkish waters.
Oil tankers bound for terminal points of the Iraqi pipelines would be turned away. Other ships would be allowed to pass. Reconnaissance aircraft would insure that tankers traveled to their stated destination.
Shipping officials said that with the backing of the United States Navy, oil tanker owners would have little choice but to respect a United Nations-sanctioned blockade.
Some analysts believed it might never be necessary to brandish American military might. Ship owners and insurers would not risk coverage for ships that carried Iraqi or Kuwaiti oil, out of fear of having their assets seized, analysts said.
American intelligence reports suggest that Iraq may have acquired French-made Exocet anti-ship missiles from Kuwaiti arsenals. Exocet missiles were used by Argentina against British ships during the Falklands war.
But military analysts discounted the risk of Iraqi retaliation. The Iraqi Navy is puny, and would pose virtually no threat to the sizable American carrier groups.
Turkey and the Red Sea are ''not within the range'' of the more formidable Iraqi Air Force, according to Thomas McNaugher, a military specialist at the Brookings Institution here. ''The biggest need would be air screen in the Persian Gulf.''

HEADLINE: The Iraqi Invasion: Reporter's Notebook;
The Guns of August Make a Dervish Bush Whirl Even Faster

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Maybe George Bush really believed that the world was becoming kinder and gentler.
Maybe, with his faith in personal diplomacy, he thought that his friendship with King Hussein of Jordan and his Administration's defense of President Saddam Hussein when Congress wanted to apply economic sanctions against the Iraqi Government in June, would be returned with some measure of loyalty. Or perhaps he forgot that August in Washington has a way of starting out in coma and ending up in crisis.
Whatever the reason, the President is facing his first post-cold war crisis in a mood that White House officials describe variously as mad, testy, peevish and, to use a favorite bit of Bush-speak, spleen-venting.
''This is one more piece of bad luck, bad timing,'' a senior White House official said. ''Things go your way for a while and then they start to go against you.'' With a sigh, he added, ''At least Congress is out of town.'' 
Just when Bush Administration officials were feeling so cocky that they thought they might just go for 100 percent in the public approval polls, the center could not hold.
The budget talks collapsed. The economy slowed. Because he had spent so much time courting Democrats and because he dropped his no-new-taxes pledge, the President has been hamstrung stumping for Republicans on the campaign trail. Even Millie, the First Dog, got sick after walking in some paint solvent outside the White House and then licking her paws.
And now, on top of all that, comes a melee in the Middle East, the diplomatic Bermuda Triangle for American Presidents. Suddenly, on the eve of his three-and-a-half week Kennebunkport vacation, the Administration is plunged into worries about military options, rising gas prices, dropping oil supplies and tricky Middle Eastern tribal politics.
Mr. Bush, who is usually circumspect and full of ambiguous diplomatic euphemisms, was visibly furious when he got off his helicopter on the White House lawn on Sunday afternoon, calling the Iraqis liars and snapping at reporters that they should ''watch and learn'' if they wanted to know his plans.
When Mr. Bush is annoyed, he does not sit and stew. He does not stay alone in the White House residence and listen to records and sip cocktails, as Richard M. Nixon liked to do, and he does not simply snooze through the chaos, as President Ronald Reagan did in August 1981, when he slept peacefully as Libyan MIG's and American F-14's clashed over the Mediterranean.
Mr. Bush, by contrast, becomes even more of a dervish.
He has dialed a dozen world leaders, had cascading meetings with his tight circle of foreign affairs advisers, and kept a revolving door going for the allies and other officials that the Administration is trying to enlist in the effort to isolate Iraq.
The President met this afternoon with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, his second talk with her in four days. In the middle of that meeting, Manfred Worner, the Secretary General of NATO, turned up breathless and joined their brief news conference. After more meetings and phone calls, the President dashed off to dinner at the White House with his confidant, Brian Mulroney, the Canadian Prime Minister.
 
On the Road With Bush
In the nooks and crannies of the crisis today, Mr. Bush sandwiched in an awards ceremony for the National Civic League's Cities Award Presentation, sat for a half-hour interview with a Sports Illustrated reporter, conferred with Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, about a coup in Pakistan and put the finishing touches on a rescue mission by the Marines in Liberia. He also made a spur-of-the-moment visit to the hospital bedside of Lee Atwater, the ailing Republican Party chairman.
To cap the day, Mr. Bush's office released the President's headlong travel schedule for September: 13 events in 9 days on the road, including 10 fund-raisers in 6 cities from Tallahassee to San Francisco, a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, a U.N. children's event, and a dedication ceremony at Ellis Island in New York Harbor.
''Iraq is dominating the agenda but it's not replacing everything else,'' said one fatigued Presidential aide. ''This President is capable of doing eight things at a time.'' Under the circumstances, eight seemed a bit of an understatement.
 
The Law of Gravity
Official Washington's vacation schedules operate by Copernican rules: Everything revolves around the Boss.
So for months, everyone had been planning their vacations according to when President Bush was going to be out of town. Because Mr. Bush planned to spend most of August in Maine, his top advisers also planned holidays for the same time. And the aides to the top advisers to the President did the same, and the secretaries to the aides to the top advisers to the President followed suit.
So when war broke out in the Middle East, all the President's satellites were drawn to Washington by the gravity of the crisis.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was supposed to leave on vacation this Friday, as were his top aides, Margaret Tutwiler and Dennis Ross. Now all three are planning to leave for Ankara, Turkey, on Wednesday, where Mr. Baker will try to persuade the Turkish President to cut off the Iraqi oil pipeline that runs through his country.
Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had to postpone his holiday to stay at the Pentagon. Paul Wolfowitz, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, also switched his travel plans to head for Saudi Arabia to try to persuade the Saudis to cut off their pipeline from Iraq.
Reporters and officials in Washington, disappointed about their canceled vacations, used gallows humor to get through the day, asking each other ''How's your vacation going,'' and trading the capital's latest joke: What's the hottest movie in Kuwait this summer? Iraqnaphobia.
 
Scowcroft to the Fore
As national security adviser, Mr. Scowcroft has been both closer to the President and less dominant than many of his predecessors. He has often said that he deliberately takes a back seat to Mr. Baker, but this time it seemed that Mr. Scowcroft was calling the shots.
The retiring and retired Air Force general, who never seems to go home, was at home when the invasion began Wednesday night. Like other senior officials, he was caught by surprise. It is still not clear whether the problem was faulty intelligence or wishful thinking. He quickly returned to the White House, where he took up position in the situation room as the crisis developed and awakened the President at 5 A.M. Thursday, so that Mr. Bush could sign executive orders on sanctions against Iraq and freezing of Kuwaiti assets.
He has continued to take an uncommonly high profile role, setting up the President's schedules, staying at Mr. Bush's side as he met with allies, receiving foreign officials himself at the White House, writing inserts on the Middle East crisis for the President's speeches, helping set up talking points for phone calls to world leaders. Mr. Baker, meanwhile, has been less visible than usual, partly because he's been traveling.
Each international crisis also puts the spotlight on a different member of the scrupulously faceless staff members of the National Security Council. This time it is Richard N. Haass, the council's director for Near East and South Asian Affairs, who was the aide who rushed out onto the White House lawn on Sunday afternoon and thrust a secret memo into Mr. Bush's hand that seemed to spark the President's irritation at his news conference.
Mr. Haass, 39, is running the interagency group of ''grunt workers,'' as they call themselves, from the Departments of State, Justice, Defense, Treasury and the Central Intelligence Agency who toil below the top level of advisers.
''He seems pretty happy about it,'' an Administration official said of Mr. Haass's Andy Warhol moments of fame. ''After all, he's getting a lot of face time on national television.''
It is superior to Mr. Haass's last star turn, when he had second billing at a Washington book party for his tome ''Conflicts Unending,'' along with the authors of ''Command, Control, and the Common Defense,'' ''The National Security Constitution,'' and ''Allies in Crisis.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 23, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of editing errors, an article yesterday about plans for satellites to measure climatic change misstated the conclusion of a report to the White House and carried an erroneous byline. A panel said that smaller, simpler satellites could begin monitoring the climate sooner, rather than later, and that they should take budgetary priority over the elaborate Earth Observing System. The writer was William K. Stevens.

HEADLINE: The Iraqi Invasion;
Hundreds of Westerners Rounded Up in Kuwait

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Iraqi soldiers rounded up hundreds of Westerners, including at least 28 American citizens, from hotels in Kuwait. It was not known what Iraq planned to do with them.
A defiant Iraq, meanwhile, staged air raid evacuation drills in Baghdad and other cities today and distributed tens of thousands of rifles to loyalists of the governing Baath Party in a display of readiness to resist any American military attack.
Iraqi occupation troops in Kuwait went through the luxury hotels that cater to foreign business people, rounding up American, British, German and other citizens of Western nations. Reports indicated that they were to be taken to Baghdad, but it was not clear for what purpose. The Iraqis had already moved 34 British soldiers, who had been training the Kuwaiti Army, to a hotel in Baghdad. 
 
Foreigners Outnumber Nationals
Flights from Kuwait have been suspended since the Iraqi invasion last week, and the Baghdad airport is also closed.
There are more than a million foreigners, including about 3,800 Americans, in Kuwait. These foreign residents make up roughly 60 percent of the population of Kuwait and hold most of the jobs in Kuwait. But many may have been away at the time of the invasion because August is traditionally a vacation period.
Americans, other Westerners and Japanese, work mostly in the oil industry and technical fields, Palestinians and Egyptians in the Government, in medicine and in schools, and Pakistanis, Sri Lankans and others from the Indian subcontinent in service and menial jobs. [A spokesman for American Telephone and Telegraph, Walter G. Murphy, said today that the company had been advised that one of its American employees had been taken into custody by Iraqi troops at a Kuwait hotel, but that about two dozen other A.T.&T. employees at another location had not been detained. Mr. Murphy declined to identify the employee who was detained.] 'This Is Unacceptable'
Kuwait's new provisional government, which is said to consist of Iraqi Army officers, threatened yesterday that it might respond to economic sanctions or military action by taking foreigners in Kuwait hostage or nationalizing foreign interests, saying it could not be expected ''to act honorably at a time when they are conspiring against us and other brothers in Iraq in an aggressive way.''
''If this is the threat it appears to be, then this is unacceptable,'' said a spokesman for the British Foreign Office, which called in the Iraqi ambassador in London to protest the roundup.
The Foreign Office spokesman said it knew of some 366 people who had been seized, most of them passengers on a British Airways flight that was caught at the Kuwait airport when Iraqi troops poured into the country on Thursday. The West German Foreign Ministry said its citizens were also being rounded up from hotels.
The British Foreign Office spokesman said, ''They are basically being taken by bus, we assume up to Iraq and Baghdad.''
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq summoned the senior American diplomat in Baghdad, Joseph Wilson, for a meeting in Baghdad that lasted several hours, the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said. She added that the United States ''viewed it as a very serious meeting.'' It was the first diplomatic contact between an American official and Mr. Hussein since the invasion.
 
Cheney in Saudi Arabia
The Iraqi moves came as the American Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, arrived in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, in an attempt to persuade the Saudis to confront Mr. Hussein, whose abrupt annexation of Iraq's tiny, oil-rich neighbor has left the Arab world stunned and in disarray.
The United States wants the Saudis to help in imposing economic sanctions on Iraq by closing the pipeline through the desert kingdom that carries much of Iraq's 2.7 million barrels a day in oil exports. Washington would also like permission to use Saudi territory as a staging area for military operations.
But so loath are the Saudis to annoy the Iraqis that tonight they issued an emphatic denial of reports that they had moved troops and tanks up to their own border with occupied Kuwait.
''All these reports are categorically untrue and if the kingdom had taken any such measure it would have announced it,'' an unnamed spokesman told the official Saudi Press Agency.
 
Silence From the Saudis
Saudi Arabia has been notably silent on the occupation of its neighbor Kuwait. Saudi Arabia and four other oil shiekdoms had a mutual-defense pact under the Gulf Cooperation Council under which an attack on one was supposed to be an attack on all.
The first public Saudi statement came on Sunday when it was announced that an emergency cabinet meeting had been called to discuss what were termed ''regrettable'' events.
The Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat, was shuttling between Arab capitals on a private Iraqi jet tonight with a plan, apparently acceptable to Baghdad, that might conceivably provide a face-saving resolution.
Mr. Arafat flew into Alexandria this evening, for discussions with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Mr. Arafat then left for Saudi Arabia and was to go to Baghdad later, according to the official Egyptian press agency, which also reported that a Saudi Arabian envoy had arrived in Egypt for talks with Mr. Mubarak.
Arabic press reports say the Palestinian plan, which is backed by Libya, calls for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops in return for ''supporting the Iraqi economy,'' which appears to mean a large payoff or a share of the Kuwaiti oilfields. Under the plan, free elections would be held in Kuwait to choose a new government. According to some reports, Iraq would continue to hold Bubiyan Island, a strategic mud flat long coveted by Iraq that controls access to the Shatt al Arab waterway and Iraq's two main ports at Basra and Umm Qasr.
Mr. Arafat was uncharacteristically taciturn, refusing to answer reporters' questions as he left Alexandria, saying only: ''It is better to be prudent when you want things done.''
 
Iraq Forces on Alert
President Mubarak's key political adviser, Osama al-Baz, said that ''the purpose of these contacts is to explore the available options in order to find a way out of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti crisis.''
In Baghdad, Iraq put its military forces on full alert, began drills lasting for hours in preparation for evacuating 4 million people from Baghdad and lesser numbers from other cities.
''Our great people, who were tested for their unlimited preparedness for sacrifice, are now fully prepared to deter those who dare to commit aggression against Iraq or Kuwait,'' the Ba'ath party newspaper al-Thawra said.
In Saudi Arabia and the gulf region there was a mood of deep foreboding today, and the leaders of the tiny desert countries grown fabulously rich on oil tried to keep a low profile. In Bahrain, the authorities expelled dozens of foreign journalists who had flown there to cover the crisis.
In Dubai, the largest of the United Arab Emirates, ceremonies to mark the anniversary of Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan al-Nahayan's accession to power were canceled. in deference to what were offically described as ''events in the region,'' and foreign laborers worked through the night to take down three million colored lights strung through the streets for the celebration.

HEADLINE: The Iraqi Invasion;
Cutting Budget Gap Now Discounted

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
With the American economy seemingly headed for recession and the exploding cost of imported oil about to push it over the edge, analysts widely agree that cutting the budget deficit this year no longer makes sense. But by the same token, they argue, the case for making a credible deal now on future deficit reduction is more compelling than ever.
The resulting psychological lift would make it far easier for the Federal Reserve to fight the economic downturn without touching off a self-fulfilling inflationary panic.
Under the threat of automatic budget cuts, White House and Congressional negotiators have been tugging delicately at the Gordian knot of deficit reduction since President Bush abandoned his no-tax stance. And in recent weeks negotiators seemed to be edging toward agreement on a combination of excise taxes on energy and income levies on the affluent. 
But from the beginning of the talks the prospect that higher taxes or lower spending would weaken an already anemic economy has tempered enthusiasm for deficit reduction. Last week's report of an unexpected surge in unemployment further increased fears of a recession in the making. And for many erstwhile deficit fighters, the run-up in oil prices since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was the last straw.
 
Heavy Tax From Hussein
An extra penny extracted at the pump costs consumers about $2.5 billion annually. And with imports supplying half of American consumption, a $10-a-barrel increase would reduce domestic purchasing power by about $30 billion annually. President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has thus already imposed a heavy tax on Americans, the argument goes; why tax them twice?
Why indeed, argues David Hale, an economist at Kemper Financial Services. What he calls a ''cyclical cul-de-sac'' has probably already deteriorated into an old-fashioned recession. And even a modest move toward fiscal constraint, magnified by consumer caution, could push it into deep decline.
Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, offers another reason for increased pessimism. The only bright spot in the economy in recent months, he notes, has been the growth in exports to the booming economies of West Germany and Japan. Higher prices for economies that remain heavily dependent on imported oil could easily divert foreign enthusiasm for buying American.
 
A Concern About Growth
Robert Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, is not quite ready to join the doom-and-gloom school. But he does acknowledge that ''a sustained oil price increase'' could bring growth to a halt. And he agrees with Mr. Hale that ''the case for changing the structural deficit is stronger than ever.''
It is not hard to see why. The immediate prospects for the American economy, most analysts say, turn on the monetary stance of the Federal Reserve Board and its chairman, Alan Greenspan. With production running well below capacity, the Fed might be expected to ease credit, encouraging businesses to invest and consumers to buy houses and cars. But in spite of encouragement from the Bush Administration, the Fed has been reluctant to loosen the money spigot. Inflation, Mr. Greenspan publicly argued, remained a greater threat to the economy than recession.
Last week's depressing unemployment statistics, coupled with the reduction in purchasing power associated with higher oil prices, might be expected to tilt the Fed toward easier money. But the higher energy prices also mean more inflation. Fed officials worry that accommodation of the oil shock - injecting cash into the financial system to replace the purchasing power lost to imports -would lead business and labor to conclude that the higher inflation would be tolerated indefinitely.
 
Double-Digit Inflation Recalled
Just such a change in expectations after the 1974-75 oil shock led to double-digit inflation. A decade of stable prices has probably reduced the public's inclination to make a snap decision that the inflation battle had been lost. And greater competition from imports has made it more problematic for unions and employers to pass higher wages and profit margins through to consumers.
But as Mr. Bergsten notes, the Fed's fear that the public could rapidly lose confidence in price stability may not be entirely unfounded. Never, after all, has the American economy ended a long period of prosperity with a $200 billion-plus budget deficit and its banking system in disarray.
That is why economists argue that a credible deal of future deficit reduction is so important. With such a deal, the Fed could assert with equal credibility that it was adjusting monetary policy to match the new fiscal discipline rather than merely accommodating oil-led inflation.
 
Stronger Dollar Expected
Richard Cooper, an economist at Harvard, points to a related benefit that would help smooth the Fed's way toward easier credit. A firm commitment to balance the budget in the future, he argues, would make the dollar a more attractive currency in which to hold wealth. And the resulting demand for dollars would offset the tendency of investors to shift into other currencies as American interest rates fell in response to monetary ease.
The unanswered question is whether any deal about future deficit reduction can be politically credible if it does not include a down payment this year. Mr. Bergsten is skeptical -so skeptical that he would even risk a small tax increase this year. At the very least, he suggests, the nuts and bolts of future deficit reduction must be spelled out in detail. That means agreement on which taxes are to be raised, which spending programs are to be cut, and by how much.
Paradoxically then, the threat of recession could add to the burdens of the budget negotiators rather than taking them off the political hook.

HEADLINE: Midland Journal;
No Champagne Gushers In Texas Over Oil Prices

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIDLAND, Tex., Aug. 6

 BODY:
Tripp Wommack, who has been buying and operating oil fields here for 10 years, scanned the buffet room at the Petroleum Club.
''See, no champagne corks popping,'' he said, digging into his blood-rare roast beef. ''Anyone who's out celebrating is a fool.''
Those who make their living directly or indirectly from oil in Midland - and that's almost everybody in this West Texas city - take pains to say that they are not nearly as happy about Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as they assume the rest of the country assumes they are. 
They are pleased, certainly, that after years of depression and modest recovery, the price of their primary product has nearly doubled in the past month, closing at $28.05 a barrel today. And they do not deny that it has been more fun to go to work since last Thursday than it has been in years. And they are not above a kind word for the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein. ''He may be a despot, but he's our despot,'' said Joe O'Neill, an independent oil operator.
But mostly, they are cautious. ''People here are snake-bit,'' Mr. Wommack said. ''They're superstitious. They know if they get too excited, they'll just feel stupid when it drops back down. And they're tired of feeling stupid.''
A decade ago, an invasion of Kuwait and the resulting increase in the price of oil would probably have brought unabashed celebration in Midland. Those were the giddy days of the oil boom, when each barrel sold for nearly $40 and there were more millionaires per capita in Midland than anywhere else in the country.
The price began to fall in the early 1980's, and by 1986 oil was selling for $8 or $9 a barrel. Banks failed, businesses closed, foreclosures soared. Midland learned it was not forever blessed. The initiation fee at the Petroleum Club was $7,500 five summers ago; now it is $2,500. Despite the discount, membership dropped by nearly one quarter.
The lesson learned by the city of about 90,000 people goes like this: rambunctious outsiders flocked here to take advantage of the boom, then left when their house of cards fell.
''A lot of people lost big,'' said Dennis Grub, whose drilling company was disbanded in 1986. ''They were doctors and lawyers and shoe salesmen who came from back East and didn't know what they were doing.''
The cautious old-timers say they are seeking stability rather than spectacular profits.
''You can't do business when prices are this unstable,'' said Henry Musselman, president of Musselman, Owen and King, oil and gas producers.
In effect, oil producers say, they want much the same outcome in the Persian Gulf as the rest of the country does. ''We're not out there rooting for Iraq,'' Mr. Musselman said. ''I would like to see Iraq retreat back to its own borders and leave the Kuwaitis alone.''
Midland, a land of cowboy boots and pickup trucks, the place where George Bush founded his oil company, prides itself on its patriotism. For that reason, too, these oilmen are insulted at the suggestion that they are secretly pulling for Iraq.
''A drastic increase would harm the nation,'' said Jack Blake, who has been in the oil business for 41 years and is now an independent producer. ''I love my country first and foremost. I'd hate to see it go into a recession because of a dictator.''
Not only do they fear for the country, they say, but they also fear for their carefully mended reputation. During the boom, they say, they were portrayed across the country as crass and cruel, spending their wealth with abandon and mocking those who were suffering the recession that was taking place elsewhere.
There is a lot of happiness in Midland, but it is carefully and deliberatly muted. It is reflected in the greetings Mr. Wommack received at lunch at the Petroleum Club this afternoon. ''How are you liking the oil business?'' he was asked by an acquaintance on the way into the dining room.
''It's been a long time since anyone asked me that,'' he said.
And it can be felt in the jokes between friends. Every Friday night, Mr. Grub meets the same group of geologists and oil engineers at the same bar for the same hour of unwinding. Last Friday, talk turned to the drilling company where Mr. Grub has been employed for four years and which is to be sold in 30 days.
The confidence of the old Midland comes through as Mr. Grub relates the toast made by a friend: ''If this keeps up, you can buy your own company.''
Then the caution of the new Midland steps in as Mr. Grub quickly adds: ''He was joking, really. Everyone laughed. We really don't expect this to keep up.''

HEADLINE: Congress Hails Its Bills on Housing As a Reversal of a Decade of Neglect

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
After a decade in which Federal housing programs stagnated or starved, Congress has passed bills that pledge significant amounts of new housing money, both to strengthen current programs and to create new ones.
Members of both parties and advocates for low-income housing are hailing the bills as a reversal of policy and an important step toward easing the nation's housing shortage.
They ''represent a significant break with the past that put housing on the back burner,'' said Representative Marge Roukema, the New Jersey Republican who is the ranking minority member of the House Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development.
Senator Alan Cranston, the California Democrat who is the chief author of the Senate bill, said, ''There is a recognition that after a decade of Federal abdication of responsibility in the housing realm, that we have to get back into the field.''
 
Increase Over Reagan Years
The House bill would provide 41 percent more money than the last budget of the Reagan Adminstration, according to an estimate by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Senate bill would provide about 36 percent more. 
Although the Bush Administration has threatened to veto the House bill as it now exists, saying some programs are too generous, House and Senate negotiators have expressed confidence that they can reach a compromise that President Bush would sign.
Both bills propose new approaches to long-standing housing problems, emphasizing home ownership for the poor, offering increased money to nonprofit organizations and making it easier to link social services to housing.
The one-year $28.7 billion bill passed by the House would provide $5 billion more than the Administration requested; the Senate's $27.9 billion bill would provide $3.8 billion more than the Administration requested. Those amounts are limits, rather than sums actually approved for spending, which are almost certain to be less because of the budget deficit ''We don't have the money to do all that must be done,'' Mr. Cranston said. #220,000 More Households At full funding levels, both pieces of legislation are estimated to add 220,000 additional households to the 4.4 million now being assisted by the housing department. Some of the money in the House bill would be used to build housing. The Senate version discourages using the money for construction, instead it emphasizes assistance to rent existing homes.
Despite the spirit of congratulation that has accompanied the two bills' passage, they have significant differences, which promise a contentious meeting next month when a House-Senate conference committee will try to resolve the measures.
Both bills support Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere, or HOPE, the proposal that is the centerpiece of the Administration's policy. The program would provide grants for low-income residents seeking to buy homes.
And both bills provide almost $1 billion more for three Federal programs: to modernize public housing, to provide grants to state and local governments for housing and economic development, and to supply low-income people with certificates that allow them to buy housing.
 
Different Approaches
But beyond that, the House and Senate take significantly different approaches toward creating new programs. The Senate has placed the bulk of its new program money into a $2 billion fund that would provide state and local governments with block grants to use largely as they see fit.
The House, by contrast, has divided about $1.1 billion in among three new major programs. One would subsidize mortgages for new homebuyers, another would subsidize developers building new rental housing, and a third would provide housing money to nonprofit corporations. In addition, the House has voted to spend $500 million to build 6,800 units of new public housing.
The bills also take strikingly different approaches to two other major housing issues. One is restructuring of a financially troubled Federal Housing Administration mortgage fund. The other is the prepayment of mortgages on government-subsidized buildings by developers who want to convert them to higher-rent properties. In the next decade, more than 300,000 units of low-income housing may become eligible for such conversions.
 
Administration Credited
In explaining the new housing emphasis, both Democrats and Republicans credit the Bush Administration with making it a higher priority than the Reagan one did. In addition, they say a climate for change was created by the suffering of many Americans, not only the homeless but also those of modest income who are paying more and more for housing.
While virtually all housing experts see the bills' passage as a turning point in policy, they disagree on which features are most significant. The Administration has emphasized the HOPE program, for which the Senate has allocated $240 million and the House $310 million.
Three different segments of the program would offer grants to low-income people seeking to buy public housing, foreclosed multifamily apartments, and federally owned single-family homes. The grants would be used to encourage residents of public housing to form their own coporations to manage, and later buy, public housing. The grants could be used to acquire, rehabilitate and learn how to manage the housing. The program would also provide grants to encourage business development in low-income areas.
Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp has spoken of the program in evangelical terms, calling it ''the most dramatic, far-reaching, incentive-oriented approach to fighting poverty in the last 25 years.'' He has argued that turning renters into homeowners will give poor people a greater stake in their neighborhoods and help reduce crime and welfare-dependency.
 
Shortage Exists
Some others see the HOPE proposals as a useful component of housing policy, but they say that concentrating on the transfer of ownership of existing housing will not increase the supply of low-income units.
''That's not bad stuff,'' said Barry Zigas, director of the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, but ''it doesn't do anything for the long-term supply.''
While other plans for new programs take very different forms in the House and Senate, they do articulate some common principles. Both, for instance, emphasize the role of nonprofit corporations in providing housing.
''This is a really significant step,'' said Cushing Dolbeare, director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. In the past, she said, Federal money has typically gone to entities based outside neighborhoods, like public housing authorities or private developers. But under these proposals ''the housing will be integrated into neighborhoods,'' she said.
A second principle in both bills is the recognition that some low-income residents have special needs that require social services. The bills provide housing preferences or special services for people with AIDS, the frail elderly, the homeless and children in danger of being put in foster care because of substandard housing.
High on the list of disagreements is the method of changing the Federal Housing Administration's single-family insurance fund, which is thought to be financially unsound.
The Senate has adopted the Administration's proposals to limit the amount of closing costs that buyers may finance and to charge higher premiums for those with low down-payments. The House version, backed by the mortgage-banking industry, rejected those proposals, saying they would exclude too many borrowers. Mr. Kemp has said the House version does not protect the fund and has recommended a veto.
The bills also differ significantly on the issue of developers buying out subsidized mortgages and converting projects into higher-priced housing. The Senate preserves a moratorium on the buyouts, now scheduled to expire in September, while the House offers financial incentives to developers to preserve the projects. The Administration has criticized several House programs because they include families who earn up to 115 percent of the area's median income, saying they are not the most needy. By contrast, 90 percent of the Senate block grants would go to households earning less than 50 percent of the median income, which is still above the poverty line.
''Two things have happened,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn. ''One, people agree that government has to become more involved in the housing area, but, two, that no one has a monopoly on truth as to how to do it.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday on Federal housing legislation misstated the difference in spending between the Senate proposal and the Bush Administration plan. According to estimates by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the $27.9 billion Senate version would provide $4.2 billion more than the White House version.

HEADLINE: A U.S. Strategy for the Gulf Crisis;
Coping with the Economic Consequences

 BODY:
President Bush has rallied the U.N. Security Council to vote a trade embargo against Iraq and Kuwait. This is the right response to Baghdad's heinous invasion, but it raises two troubling questions for the U.S.: Will the embargo block Iraqi oil exports? And will it throw the U.S. into a devastating recession?
There is cause for muted optimism on both scores. Iraq relies upon a single export, oil, whose shipment is easily monitored. The oil importing nations, if they cooperate, can make sure they buy only from non-Iraqi sources. 
The more successful the embargo, the worse the danger for the U.S. economy. The loss of oil from Iraq and Kuwait would drive up oil prices and throw a limp U.S. economy into recession. But Mr. Bush can mitigate this danger by marshaling Saudi support and releasing oil from large U.S. stockpiles. That way the embargo can cripple Iraq without crippling the U.S. too.
Iraqi oil is shipped through pipelines across Turkey and Saudi Arabia and in tankers through the Persian Gulf. The limited number of outlets makes the oil easy to track, and check. The proof may already be in hand. Even before the U.N. vote, the industrialized countries had announced an embargo. Iraq then suspended most of its oil shipments through Turkey apparently because it would be unable to find buyers.
Iraq and Kuwait sold between four and five billion barrels a day before the invasion. If that entire output is lost, the price of oil could, at worst, double. But even that scenario would be far less damaging to the U.S. economy than the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973-74 or their tripling in 1979. Inflation would rise by several percentage points; the unemployment rate might approach 8 percent from its present 5.5 percent. These are very serious but manageable consequences - especially when compared with the possible costs of inaction.
Mr. Bush has ways to lessen the economic harm. By providing military guarantees against Iraqi reprisal, he might be able to persuade Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to step up production. If Venezuela also raises output, most of the shortfall could be offset.
And there is a powerful antidote within Mr. Bush's control: the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a 600-million-barrel stockpile created in the aftermath of the 1970's oil crises. Japan and Western Europe created similar stockpiles.
These reserves were established to smooth over a temporary crisis just like the one triggered by Iraq's invasion. The Western stockpiles are large enough to offset a sizable portion of the shortfall even if the crisis lasts as long as a year.
The loss of U.S. oil imports during the 1970's never exceeded 5 percent. The reason that such a modest supply shock caused havoc was that consumers panicked, and hoarded available oil. By immediately releasing oil from stockpiles, the West can calm jittery markets.
Western economies are less vulnerable to OPEC now than in the 70's. Energy use - compared with the size of Western economies - is lower and there are more supplies of natural gas and other non-oil energy sources. For these reasons, and because the price shock will be much smaller, the U.S. and its allies can withstand the embargo.
Only panic can turn this very difficult situation into a catastrophe. By addressing the nation now, explaining the price of inaction and the costs of his proposed actions, Mr. Bush has it in his power to prevent that and reassure the American people.

HEADLINE: Ill-Equipped for the Crises of the 90's

BYLINE: By Gary Hart; Gary Hart, former Senator from Colorado, was a founder of the Military Reform Caucus.

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
Nothing marked the euphoric and triumphant march of the Reagan Administration into Washington in 1981 more than two policies - a ''free market'' in oil (in lieu of energy independence) and a massive strategic weapons buildup. Last week, nine years and $1 trillion later, we found ourselves threatened by our dependence on Middle East oil and unable to mount a quick and effective military response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
We are now almost at the level of dependence on foreign oil imports -roughly 50 percent - that we were when OPEC embargoed our oil in 1973 and more than quadrupled its price by 1977. And by putting so many of our military eggs in the strategic nuclear basket in the 1980's, we are now virtually muscle-bound in dealing with regional conflicts of the sort we now face in Kuwait. 
One simple step, more than any other, could have assured our national energy security and the integrity of our foreign policy. That was a tax on imported oil, which a hardy few of us have advocated vigorously and insistently for more than a decade. Instead, the Reagan Administration chose to resume consumption and foreign dependence, and the U.S. is now hostage to the whims of Middle East politics.
Our dependence on imported oil casts doubt on our motives in defending the Persian Gulf. In the new international political order, which places more emphasis on democratic ideals than on superpower military strength, we are particularly vulnerable to such criticism. When the crisis has passed, people throughout the world will ask themselves, Was the U.S. truly interested in restoring order, re-establishing a lawful government or punishing outlaw behavior? Or was that excuse just a cynical cover for a desperate superpower addicted to someone else's oil?
Moreover, if we were determined to increase our dependence on foreign oil, then we should have prepared our military accordingly. Yet, like modern-day Bourbons, we learned nothing from the 1970's. Remember the Rapid Deployment Force (neither rapid, deployable nor a force) designed, after the fall of the Shah of Iran, to rescue ''our'' oil. From whom, the Russians?
Even if we can make a convincing case that the U.S. has a moral duty to police the Persian Gulf, we aren't prepared to do so. Not because we haven't spent the money - we certainly have done that in the past 10 years - but because we have spent the money wrongly.
Kuwait is a classic case of the limits of strategic weapons. No B-1 or Stealth bomber, no MX missile, no Trident submarine and missile, no cruise millsile can help us there. Not even Nimitz-class nuclear aircraft carriers. As the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William Crowe, has said, carrier-based air strikes will avail us little if we do not have land-based airstrips with which to supplement them.
Here the vaunted military buildup of the 1980's fails us. We are prepared for nuclear war with a disintegrating Soviet Union and unprepared for military action in Kuwait. We didn't use the period, as a few of us had argued that we should, to reform military structures, doctrines and weapons to anticipate the true threats of the 1990's and beyond: regional conflict, insurgency and terrorism.
Had we undertraken these reforms a decade ago, today we would have troops specifically trained in the flexible tactics necessary for localized conflict. They would be equipped with light, highly mobile weapons, transported by aircraft adopted to short runways and to ''roll-on, roll-off'' ships. Military leaders would be pursuing a doctrine of maneuver rather than firepower and attrition. All this would enable them to fight more effectively in a situation like Kuwait, if that becomes our policy.
Right now, for example, Iraqi military units are dispersing throughout the thin Kuwaiti population. If we tried traditional military approaches - air strikes and sea-based artillery fire - we would kill many Kuwaitis.
Given our present military capabilities, there are only two ways to force the Iraqis out of Kuwait. We can bring massive military force to bear against military targets in Iraq. That used to be called declaring war.
Or we can insert our own military forces into Kuwait and drive the Iraqis out. It would take weeks to assemble these forces, stage and equip them, and deliver them ashore. Loss of lives, including American lives, would be substantial.
Even given Saddam Hussein's fait accompli, there is no need and no justification for the U.S. to go it alone in the Middle East. If Iraq represents a threat to world peace or regional stability, then the international community is obliged to participate. The French, British, Italians and others can and should be involved in military blockades, sea and air interdiction and other political, economic and military sanctions.
The day is simply over for this nation to carry the Western burden. The true test of Presidential leadership in the 1990's is not willingness to send in the Marines but ability to mobilize and energize democratic unity.
The military and energy policies of the 1980's have been tested and found wanting. The long-view issue today is not what we will do with Saddam Hussein but what we will do to change these policies in anticipation of a new century.

Now or Later?

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Panicky officials at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are racing around to bank regulators to find Iraqi funds; unless they can seize and use offsetting assets, $2 billion in commodity credit guarantees will come out of taxpayers' pockets to pay for Mr. Bush's past appeasement of Saddam Hussein.
Of course, Kuwaitis lost much more. What a refreshingly simple motive for aggression: money.
Saddam did not snatch Kuwait to settle Sunni-Shiite scores, or to counter Zionism, or to provide his nation a place in the sun, or to advance some ideology. None of the usual reasons for recent wars - of religious or racial or ethnic hatreds, or geopolitics, or pro-anythingism - apply. 
This was a stickup. His reason for taking Kuwait was the same as Slick Willie Sutton's for hitting a bank: that's where the money was. Broke from his last war, with a million-man army to pay, Saddam grabbed the gold and oil, wiping out much of his debt by wiping out his creditor.
Who was to stop him? The Saudi King is spineless, and Syria and Egypt are unprepared for war; the Soviets might join an arms embargo for Western opinion's sake but they have as great a stake as Iraq in higher oil prices; and the Israelis have no dog in this fight. Turkey, if provoked, would be trouble.
Would the industrial powers act in unprecedented concert? A cutoff of arms sales means nothing, because Saddam has no money to buy more arms anyway; France, his biggest unpaid supplier, stopped shipments months ago. A boycott of Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil? That would only send the price up, and oil is fungible; in time, greed will find a way.
That leaves the superpower, the U.S. When Saddam poison-gassed 8,000 Kurds, Mr. Bush said nothing; when Saddam abused the U.S. banking system in the Lavoro affair, the Bush Attorney General dithered; when Saddam corruptly skimmed our grain credit to help pay for his Condor missile, the Bush Agriculture Secretary hastened to guarantee more grain loans, now in jeopardy.
Saddam probably figured the U.S. would (a) huff and puff about Kuwait, but limit response to economic boycott, and (b) re-declare a vital interest in oil and get the Saudis graciously to permit us to guarantee their sovereignty.
If that were our reaction, he would slip into a moderate phase. He would send out his lickspittle envoys, the King of Jordan and the boss of the P.L.O., to benumb his Arab brethren; he would pledge no further territorial demands, Hitler-style; he might even use his new leverage to spring the long-held hostages in Lebanon, and let out thousands of new Western hostages in Kuwait.
Mr. Bush's reaction, however -perhaps to compensate for the failure of appeasement - has been more severe. Although his first reaction was ''we're not discussing intervention,'' he soon stiffened: while preparing to base Air Force units in Saudi Arabia, he has announced that the conquest of Kuwait ''will not stand.''
That phrase, prepared for delivery and repeated, defines the U.S. insistence on a rollback, what diplomats like to call the status quo ante. Is the President serious? He must know that Saddam, having made his move, is not likely to humiliate himself by pulling out in the face of boycotts or long-distance threats.
If Mr. Bush is blustering during an international crisis, he will be the one who ''will not stand.'' If he is serious about not letting the conquest stand, as I believe he is, something internal or external will have to knock it over.
He hopes it can be induced short of war. U.N. sanctions, followed by a cutoff of the pipelines in Turkey and Saudi Arabia (perhaps covertly, to provide a fig leaf to those Governments) might lead to strangulation, economic collapse and a hoped-for coup in Baghdad.
If that won't work quickly, we have to ask ourselves why the stickup -what the hero of Halabja wants the big money for.
Poison gas is his local threat. Of direct concern to us: He is only four years away from production of nuclear bombs. His missiles now have sophisticated French guidance systems, and with time and money he will surely build intercontinental missiles.
Put yourself in the Oval Office in 1994. Saddam moves on Saudi Arabia. The U.S. warns him that means war. Saddam says fine, the first city he will take out is New York. You know he has the means and the will.
Bloodshed now is a terrible thing to contemplate. Nuclear war at a time of Saddam's choosing, against a sociopath already to blame for a million deaths, is worse.

HEADLINE: U.S. Rural Assistance Is Criticized in Study

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
After a yearlong study, a nonprofit advocacy group has concluded that many rural Americans suffer needlessly from poverty and pollution because Federal programs to help them are poorly financed and poorly run.
The group, the Center for Community Change, said the people who run the Farmers Home Administration of the Agriculture Department lack the needed skills, and it criticized the Reagan Administration for cutting the agency's budget for rural development by nearly 70 percent. 
The report said that rural unemployment was one-third higher than in the cities; that a third more rural residents than urban residents were below the poverty line; that almost two million rural residents lived in substandard housing, usually lacking adequate plumbing, and that rural rates of maternal and infant mortality were higher than in urban areas and were rising faster.
Joe O'Neill, a spokesman for the Farmers Home Administration, said agency officials had not studied the report, but added, ''We're always pleased to get these kinds of studies.''
The report also criticized the Environmental Protection Agency, saying it had failed to provide rural areas enough help to meet water standards. Ninety-seven percent of the rural population relies on well water for drinking, the study said, even though a Federal survey has said two-thirds of wells are contaminated.

HEADLINE: For More Drugs, First Test Is Abroad

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
PATIENT trials of new treatments, long a crown jewel of American medical science, are increasingly being conducted overseas, a number of prominent researchers say.
The researchers blame the fragmented American health care system, red tape, overzealous ethical concerns and financial constraints for making it increasingly cumbersome and costly to do studies in the United States and for driving the work abroad. At the same time, a flowering of clinical research in Europe has taken up the slack.
As trials shift overseas, experts worry that access to the newest therapies will be delayed for Americans, and they point to several drugs and devices widely used in Europe that are unavailable in the United States.
''Our trials are still very good, but these days there are less of them being done here and more in Europe,'' said Dr. Gerald P. Murphy, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. 
Dr. Thomas Chalmers, an expert on controlled clinical trials, said, ''Clinical trials that are large enough to give answers to important medical questions have certainly switched to Europe.
''The question to me is not how often Europeans are used as guinea pigs for Americans,'' he said, ''but how often Europeans are the lucky ones who get access to new and exciting medicines way before us. We ought to get the feeling that we are being deprived of the best opportunities.''
For a belief so widely proclaimed, the emigration of research is difficult to prove, since even the National Institutes of Health does not tally the numbers of clinical trials. And a few scientists even question its existence. But in interviews dispirited medical researchers said they and their colleagues now often travel to test their theories or collaborate with foreign researchers in studies in Europe, South America or Japan. As doctors, they increasingly look to European trials to decide how to treat patients.
Experts point to the rising foreign presence in the country's medical journals and at conferences to corroborate this view. And they all have a story to tell.
At the American College of Cardiology meeting last year, American doctors sat in rapt silence as Europeans described their studies involving drugs designed to break up clots in the coronary arteries to abort heart attacks in progress. American cardiologists had largely abandoned work on these thrombolytic medicines because they could not keep pace with the Europeans, said Dr. Anthony DeMaria, past president of the American College of Cardiology.
Two years ago, Dr. William O'Neill, chief of cardiology at the William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., traveled to Germany to test a device to clean out clogged coronary arteries to avoid the delays and expense of trials in the United States.
''Most of the evidence is qualitative, but I think on the basis of my observation that the hunch that research is leaving the country is on target,'' said Renee Fox, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania who has been a student of the field since shortly after World War II. ''I don't want to get into hand wringing, but I think we should be worried about why it's happening.''
In more than a dozen interviews, Americans who had done research in Europe often denied consciously bypassing the constraints in this country. But all were conspicuously quick to take advantage of an open door.
''When there's a collaboration, the research tends to be done overseas,'' said Dr. Robert D. Rosenberg, a professor at both Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who said that a growing portion of his work was done with foreign doctors. He recently published a study in which Dutch volunteers were injected with a protein implicated in clotting abnormalities and is involved in research in England on predicting heart attacks.
Drug companies, too, are taking a growing number of trials out of the country. Foreign pharmaceutical trials got a shot in the arm in the mid-1980's when the Food and Drug Administration decided to accept some foreign data in support of new drug applications, although the agency still requires at least one United States study for final approval. Reasons to Leave Researchers Cite Rigorous Rules Researchers cite several factors for the trend:
* The vigorous regulation of research by the Government and universities, so that preparing a study involves reams of paperwork and rounds of committee meetings, which are time-consuming and costly.
* An outspoken and, some say, overzealous national attitude about patient rights, which many experts feel has led patients to regard trials with unneccesary suspicion and made it difficult to recruit volunteers.
* A fragmented private health care system, which provides no incentive for doctors to refer patients to clinical trials and has poor mechanisms for financing them.
''There are so many obstacles that a number of people either give up or just throw up their hands and go elsewhere,'' said Dr. Charles Lieber, a psychiatrist at the Bronx Veterans Affairs Hospital who recently published a study on alcohol metabolism in women in Italy. ''I've been doing clinical research for 32 years and its gotten harder and harder. It still can be done but at a cost in frustrations and dollars.'' Dr. Lieber says he took his project abroad because the Veterans Affairs Hospital had few female patients and one of the Italian collaborators had been a student in his laboratory.
Although experts generally acknowledge the relative difficulty of doing research in the United States, some defend the obstacles as legitimate. ''We may be a little ahead in the amount of bureaucracy,'' said Dr. Curtis Meinert of Johns Hopkins University, an expert on clinical trials. ''But a lot of those procedures are there for good ethical and scientific and legal reasons.''
But all seem to agree that the departing research is, in general, not morally suspect. ''Just because it's cheaper or easier to do something in another country doesn't mean that a big moral issue is being compromised,'' said Mike Shaffer, a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration. Researchers point out that the majority of the lost work has gone to nations that have their own mechanisms for protecting patients.
In the world of research, where hard data reign, the magnitude of the migration - even its existence - has been difficult to gauge. ''I agree there's such a perception but I'm not sure that it's true or even where to find data to prove it,'' said Dr. Meinert, who nonetheless said he believed there was a ''building crisis'' in clinical research.
In fact, the financing of clinical trials by the National Institutes of Health has gone up about 40 percent in constant dollars in the last decade, to $495 million in 1989. But researchers say the cost of doing clinical trials in the United States has far outpaced inflation and that in some of the institutes constant dollar spending is down.
Earlier this year in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Thomas Stossel tried to get a handle on the situation indirectly by tracking foreign publications in several prestigious medical journals over the previous decade. He discovered that the number of foreign papers increased two- to threefold and the number from the United States decreased in tandem.
Such findings have evoked the usual debates about the power and significance of data. There have been some skeptics: Dr. Vincent DeVita, former chief of the National Cancer Institute, called the widespread impression that research is emigrating ''an illusion created by Europe's new strength.''
Dr. Bert Spilker, a research executive at the Burroughs Wellcome Company, said, ''Yes, we're doing more abroad, but I don't think the data mean that the U.S. is falling down but that Europe is catching up.'' But many American researchers clearly feel that they are slipping. Overzealous Ethics Regulations Add Time to Studies These researchers protest that intense regulation, makes it cumbersome to conduct their work in the United States and expedient to take it elsewhere. In order to undertake a study of a new drug, for example, a researcher must often submit extensive proposals to the government, his university, and the F.D.A. before enrolling patients. The process can take months or years. ''By the mid-80's I had all this animal data, and I was convinced we could proceed with testing in patients,'' said Dr. O'Neill, explaining why he took his device for reaming heart arteries overseas. ''That was impossible here. The preclinical evaluation it had to go through was unbelievably elaborate and expensive.'' In West Germany, he said, he simply needed permission from the hospital, which was quickly obtained. The F.D.A. subsequently approved the device for use in the United States.
Officials at the Food and Drug Administration are accustomed to the complaints. ''In this country there is an overriding concern for the safety of the patient, and some feel it's excessive,'' Mr. Shaffer said. But, now that the F.D.A. accepts foreign data, he says there is sometimes a new outlet for the frustration. He said the agency's decision to accept such data was controversial and compared it to a court deciding how to regard evidence that was compelling but illegally collected.
Scientists also feel that overzealous ethical review boards and, in particular, informed consent rules have driven science away.
In the mid-80's, Dr. Richard Peto, a well-known epidemiologist at Oxford University, approached American cardiologists to enlist patients for a study of the drug streptokinase as a treatment for heart attacks. Although the Americans were enthusiastic, in the time that British doctors referred 6,000 patients, only 400 entered from the other side of the Atlantic. He holds consent procedures largely to blame.
''The American documents were three pages of legalistic junk,'' Dr. Peto said, who had written a single page consent form for British use. ''That's not the sort of thing you want to push under someone's nose as he's having a heart attack, terrified, with chest pain, on morphine. You want to tell him about the trial, but you want to be humane.'' Although countries in Europe require that researchers discuss a study with potential subjects, the requirement is far less formalized.
Equally important, experts say the fragmented system of health care in the United States is poorly suited to organizing large patient trials. When Dr. Tord Naessen wanted to study the effect of hormone replacement on postmenopausal women in Sweden, he had easy access to the health records of all 23,246 women in the Uppsala health district who had been prescribed the medications. In the United States, that information would have been locked away in thousands of individual offices.
Many cardiologists blame fragmentation for the relatively poor showing of American scientists in heart research. In this country, only about 10 percent of heart attack victims are treated at academic hospitals where studies take place. In Europe that number is probably over 60 percent, Dr. DeMaria said.
The American method of financing health care creates further disincentives since insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid, often do not pay for services rendered as part of a trial even if they prove beneficial.
If, for example, a study requires a patient to stay in the hospital an extra day for a liver biopsy to monitor a new treatment, most insurance will not pay for the hospital bed, the operating room time or the doctors' fees; private hospitals and doctors usually write off the costs.
Clinical researchers say the National Institutes of Health has got to address the financing dilemmas peculiar to patient trials in the United States. Many Consequences Trend Could Affect Jobs and Patients In the face of the migration, experts fear for the health of the clinical research community. ''The Europeans are developing a large coterie of scientists who are good at clinical research, while our skills are going to atrophy,'' Dr. Rosenberg said. The experts say that the repercussions will be felt by patients and businesses as well.
Already, new drugs and devices are often used in Europe long before they can be in the United States. A promising new class of drugs to treat prostate cancer, called antiandrogens, is widely available in clinical trials in Europe, but not in the United States, said Dr. Murphy. Cardiac stents, tiny tubes that hold open coronary arteries on the verge of closing, were tested in Europe beginning in 1985 and are widely used now, said Dr. DeMaria. They are scheduled for trials here this fall.
Researchers predict that if clinical research becomes too cumbersome in the United States, biomedical firms may be tempted to take their manufacturing elsewhere so that early testing may be done speedily and without heavy regulatory constraints. Dr. O'Neill said his work in Germany was delayed by a year while he waited for an F.D.A. license to export the device, which was manufactured in the United States.
In some other countries, things can move very fast. It took 12 months to do preliminary human testing of a chemical to enhance ultrasound exams in the United States, said Mr. David Pritchard of Molecular Biosystems of San Diego. ''Our Japanese collaborator completed the same testing in less than a day,'' he said. ''He commandered a medical center and lined up volunteers, one after another, and said to each one, 'Congratulations, you are going to be in my clinical trial.' ''

HEADLINE: Banks Are Prodded to Offer Better Service in Poor Areas

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Responding to pressure from Congress and community groups, Federal regulators have withheld approval for some bank mergers in recent months until the companies agreed to improve service to poor neighborhoods.
The tougher regulatory stance has caused many banks to increase their lending programs for the poor, while forcing others to drop acquisitions that they thought would not be approved because of their record of serving poor neighborhoods.
When it agreed to bail out the savings industry last year, Congress insisted that banks start complying with a 1977 law that requires Federally insured financial institutions to serve their entire communities, including poor neighborhoods. It passed an amendment strengthening the law to give banks a greater incentive to comply.
And community groups have kept up pressure on banks, seeking more low-interest loans for housing rehabilitation, low-cost checking and other services. 
The delays in the approval of acquisitions can be extremely costly to banks because growth through mergers is an important competitive tool. American banks are under siege from foreign competition, notably the huge Japanese banks that have entered the United States.
As a result, many banks have increased their lending programs for the poor. The Center for Community Change, a Washington research institute, estimates that from 1977 to 1988, financial institutions pledged more than $5 billion to programs for low-income people. There has been a spate of new pledges to such programs in the last two years.
Last week, after nine months, the Federal Reserve Board approved the Citizens and Southern Corporation's acquisition of Sovran Financial, which it had held up because of Sovran's community service record. The merger, which will create the nation's 14th-largest bank with assets of about $48.7 billion, was approved partly because Sovran agreed to lend $25 million over five years to businesses owned by members of minority groups in the Washington area and to lend $10 million to low- and middle-income housing.
The purchase of Florida National Bank by the First Union Corporation in North Carolina was also approved after delays caused by First Union's record in its poor communities. It was finally approved after First Union expanded its programs to these communities and joined a consortium of three banks that committed $100 million in loans to businesses owned by members of minority groups. It has also announced a home mortgage program with low interest rates for low-income people.
The Federal Reserve has warned the Security Pacific Bank in Los Angeles that its proposed acquisition of 20 percent of Mitsui Manufacturing Bank will not be approved until Mitsui's community investment record is reviewed and found to be satisfactory.
A few deals, including the Harris Trust and Savings Bank's acquisition of Frankfort Bancshares Inc. in the Chicago area, were scrapped when the banks decided they could not gain approval. The Harris deal was curtailed, in part, because of its record of investing in poor neighborhoods.
Providing low-cost services for poor neighborhoods is not the most efficient way for banks to use their capital. But their profitability should not be adversely affected because little money is involved relative to a bank's size and because default rates on these types of loans are generally lower than the national averages for consumer loans. But small banks in particular say they do not have the resources to comply with the law. ''One of our major concerns is the increased burden that this is placing on the banks,'' said Virginia Stafford, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association.
 
A Recent Success
Sister Barbara Busch, a Roman Catholic nun in Cincinnati, says she has tried over the last eight years to get local banks to lend money for the rehabilitation of decaying housing in the city. She said she has had success only recently, and credits both an amendment to the 1977 law that opens the traditionally secretive bank review process to public scrutiny and a new city ordinance that forces banks to provide data showing where they make retail and commercial loans in Cincinnati.
''It wasn't until we started working with the city ordinance that they responded,'' she said.
Since Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, bank regulators including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Comptroller of the Currency have conducted ''C.R.A. reviews'' as part of their routine bank examinations to make sure Federally insured financial institutions are adequately serving their communities.
 
Reluctant Examiners
But until recently, these reviews have been cursory and examiners have been reluctant to give banks a failing grade.
''Up to now most of the institutions - over 95 percent - were not complying with the C.R.A. laws,'' said Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs.
But several factors have made examiners tougher on banks. Community groups in recent years have regularly filed protest letters with regulatory agencies urging them to take action against institutions that seemed to be avoiding poor neighborhoods.
There have also been rumblings in Washington over the last two years for more vigorous enforcement of the act. In the wake of the savings crisis and public outcry for stricter banking regulation, Congress passed an amendment to strengthen the law last year. Tacked onto the savings and loan bailout legislation, the amendment requires banks to make their community investment records and examination files available to the public for all reviews conducted after the beginning of last month.
 
Threat of Publicity
Because of the threat of a negative publicity campaign waged by a community group armed with bank records, regulators are expected to be less tempted to give every bank a passing grade, and acquisition-minded banks may be more inclined to increase their involvement in poor neighborhoods.
In an attempt to prove to Congress that a harsh new rule was unnecessary, regulators had begun sending signals to banks that they would be more disciplined in their reviews and tougher on violators of the 1977 law even before the amendment passed.
In response, banks began to form groups to make investments in low-income communities, low-interest mortgages available to low-income people and to help finance the construction and rehabilitation of lower-priced housing.
''There are a lot of banks taking this seriously right now that really did not take it very seriously before,'' said Donald A. Mullane, an executive vice president of the BankAmerica Corporation and head of the California Bankers Association.
 
A Fundamental Problem
But some community groups worry that the banks will not follow through on their commitments. ''The process of getting these organizations capitalized and running has taken longer than it should have,'' said Willie Jones, director of the Community Investment Coalition in Boston. ''The fundamental problem is that the banks don't know how to do business in these neighborhoods.''
The coalition is working with a group of 14 Boston banks that last year pledged $500 million in credit to disadvantaged neighborhoods in Massachusetts.
Community groups also emphasize that banks agreed to many of the pledges only after they had filed complaints with regulators protesting the institutions' lending practices.
In many instances, community groups say, banks have been unwilling to make loans at rates low-income people can afford or to adjust their underwriting standards so they can qualify. Some bankers are unwilling to accept things like applicants' reliable history of paying utility bills in lieu of more standard credit records to make low-interest loans in poor neighborhoods.
''There is something like $5 billion or $6 billion in pledges outstanding, but 80 percent aren't available because the rates or the terms or the structure is not sufficiently flexible,'' said Reed Morgan, director of the Community Reinvestment Institute in San Francisco, a research organization that assists community groups.
Despite their criticism, community groups nationwide see the amendment to the 1977 Act as a new arrow in their quiver.
''This is the most significant development for freeing up money for low-income housing and small businesses since the passage of the original legislation,'' said Jane Uebelhoer, legislative director of Acorn, a grassroots group that focuses on low-income housing and other problems of poor communities.

HEADLINE: OIL SURGE: CONSUMERS ALREADY TAKING A BEATING;
Air Fares Climbing as Fuel Costs Rise

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
The economic fallout from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has quickly filtered to the airline passenger, with higher oil prices already translating into higher air fares. Two airlines will add surcharges or raise fares on Thursday to offset their higher fuel costs, and several others are considering a similar move.
A least one consumer group has objected to the increases, calling them premature. But the airlines, which consume 41 million gallons of jet fuel a day, insist that the extra charges are needed to stem the sudden cash drain. But even with the fare increases, some anlysts said, the airlines may not be able to recoup all the added expense, as some passengers may balk at paying higher fares. 
Meanwhile, airline stocks tumbled yesterday, as concern grew about the higher fuel costs and a possible recession. After labor, fuel is an airline's largest expense, accounting for 15 to 20 percent of a carrier's operating budget.
To recover the billions of dollars in added fuel costs, the airlines will have to raise fares as much as 12 percent, said George James, chairman of Airline Economics, a consulting firm based in Washington. ''It's either higher fares or significant losses over the next year,'' he said.
The rising fuel prices deal another blow to an industry that is already reeling from a summer with more empty seats than airline executives had anticipated. The industry is more vulnerable than most to even the slightest economic downturn.
 
Northwest Plans Surcharge
Northwest Airlines said last week that it would add an $8 fuel surcharge on all its domestic flights beginning Thursday, and yesterday Pan American World Airways said it would increase fares 10 percent on its domestic flights starting Thursday and on its international flights starting Aug. 15.
The move, which is Pan Am's largest fuel-related fare increase since the Arab oil embargo of 1973, is the result of costs that are up significantly in the last few days, said Jeff Kriendler, a Pan Am spokesman. The airline, which has been struggling for years, is forced to buy much of its fuel overseas because of its many international flights. Prices are generally higher abroad than in the United States.
''We are as much victims of what is going on in the Middle East as the consumer at the gas pump,'' said Robert Gibbons, a spokesman for Northwest. In the two days after the Iraqi invasion, the airline's fuel costs rose 8 cents a gallon, he said.
Spokesmen for Continental, American, Delta and USAir said the airlines had not yet decided on whether to add a surcharge or raise fares. A spokeswoman for United Airlines had no comment.
 
Consumers Critical
One consumer group said any fare rises or fuel surcharges was premature. ''It seems awfully early to talk about a 10 percent increase,'' said Richard Livingston, chairman of the Airline Passengers Association of North America, a consumer group based in Washington. ''Why not wait to see where the price levels out?''
Some airlines said it was too early to make a decision. ''We're waiting until a clear picture emerges,'' said Susan Young, a spokeswoman for USAir, in statement echoed by many airlines. ''The market is too volatile.'' she said.
The price of crude oil rose to $28.05 a barrel yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. A few weeks ago, crude was trading at about $16 a barrel. Most airlines have 30-day contracts with fuel suppliers that afford the carriers only limited protection against price fluctuations.
The industry's appetite for fuel is enormous. It consumes 15 billion gallons of fuel each year. For every $1 increase in crude oil prices, jet fuel increases 3 cents a gallon and the industry has to swallow $450 million in added annual fuel costs. A $5 increase in crude means another $2.25 billion in costs for the industry.
Jet fuel sold for an average of 57.8 cents in June, down sharply from January when a heating oil shortage forced the price up to an average of 78.3 cents a gallon. Some airlines set fuel surcharges at the time but dropped them once the price fell again.
Nearly every airline stock fell yesterday. AMR, parent company of American Airlines, fell $4.375, to $50.375, on the New York Stock Exchange. UAL stock, already battered by a union-led takeover attempt that is losing investor confidence, fell $12.50, to $110. Pan Am, the only airline to announce an across-the-board fare increase yesterday, was also the only carrier to gain ground - rising 12 1/2 cents, to $2.125.
