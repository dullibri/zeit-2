HEADLINE: In the Orchid Room . . . Big Macs

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The seen-it-all habitues of the downtown Manhattan art scene had never seen this. Gathering to fete an avant-garde artist, they were ushered into the restaurant's Orchid Room by a white-gloved doorman. As a tuxedoed gentleman played a grand piano, the guests sipped cappuccino amid Italian marble tabletops and dark wood paneling. The Big Macs were swell, too.
"An elegant McDonald's," said Kim Heirston, the director of the Stux Gallery, which organized the reception for Cary Leibowitz. "We liked the contradiction." 
 Welcome to a grown-up Golden Arches, not quite rated NC-17. McDonald's is adding restaurants like this one near Wall Street at 160 Broadway because it needs more steady adult customers. Facing flattening sales growth and a falling stock price, the world's largest restaurant chain is experimenting with radical changes in location, decor, food and service, trying to find the right adult-oriented combinations.
McDonald's and its competitors are acting because the population is becoming older and youngsters scarcer, making adults the customers of choice in the hotly competitive fast-food industry.
Hoping that grown-ups can be persuaded to visit its more than 8,400 United States outlets more often and spend more money when they do, McDonald's is also test-marketing pizza, pasta, seafood and other dishes that might attract the entire family to the slow dinnertime hours. The Wall Street McDonald's, for instance, has espresso as well as cappuccino on the menu all the time.
But will adults flock to restaurants best known for playgrounds out front and whose corporate symbol is the clown Ronald McDonald? Some analysts doubt it and note that other adult restaurants, like General Mills' Red Lobster and Pepsico's Olive Garden, are better at being the kinds of places where adults drag their kids, instead of the other way around.
McDonald's big attractions are convenience and consistency, said Nancy Kruse, a principal with Technomic, a restaurant consultanting company in Chicago. "It's nice when they build a lot of trappings around that. But it would be a mistake to think that people come in for the trappings."
 
Annual Sales Flat
 But McDonald's may have little choice other than to try to get more adults. Annual sales per restaurant are about $1.6 million a year, flat since 1988 -- a decline when inflation is taken into account. Last week, McDonald's reported a third-quarter earnings increase of 11 percent, to $242.2 million, but analysts noted that much of the growth came from restaurants overseas.
All year long, investors, noticing the worrisome trend in domestic operations, have pounded McDonald's stock. Since Jan. 2, the company's shares have dropped more than 25 percent, closing yesterday at $25.625 a share.
McDonald's has learned lessons in the restaurant-as-theater from its more than 3,000 outlets overseas, where many of the restaurants have showcase formats that help increase customer traffic. One of its Paris restaurants looks like a wood-paneled library.
 
Expensive Touches
 While the lower Manhattan McDonald's has been open for nearly two years, the Orchid Room opened just last month for the reception and party business. And despite expensive touches like fresh flowers, the restaurant is profitable, executives say, because of repeat customers and higher traffic over all.
The company has only a few adult-oriented restaurants in the United States. The company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., will not say how many, and analysts guess there are fewer than 40. Other McDonald's showcase experiments include a 1950's-style diner in Tennessee, and a soon-to-be restored 1860's Colonial house on Long Island.
Some analysts say McDonald's adult-oriented restaurants are doomed to failure because the company has too many competitors, too limited a menu and, most of all, too few of the urban sites needed to situate appealing restaurants. Other analysts see more promise in the idea but only as a small niche, like the restaurants McDonald's has long had in hospitals and on military bases.
 
Moves to Attract Adults
 As the Baby Boom generation becomes forty-something, other fast-food restaurants have been searching for more ways to appeal to adult taste. Burger King and Wendy's have added grilled chicken and baked potatoes that are popular with working mothers and people watching their diets.
Their common goal is to gain more adults as repeat customers, the mainstay of all fast-food restaurants, and sell them items priced higher than standard fast food. More than 70 percent of customer traffic in the industry comes from people who visit a fast-food restaurant 17 or more times a month, according to a study by Taco Bell, a Pepsico unit.
Unlike its smaller rivals, McDonald's, with 1989 revenue of more than $6 billion, can also afford to experiment with the restaurant itself. Moreover, an attractive enough restaurant, like the Wall Street McDonald's with its virtual absence of plastic, could entice customers to continue to pay McDonald's prices, which are relatively high for the fast-food industry, at $3 to $4 a meal in many regions, compared with under $3 for fast-food meals generally. As a recession looms, analysts say, the industry may be tempted into intensive price competition to keep market share and thus hurt profit margins.
 
Successful Items Kept on Menu
 McDonald's has tried for some time to appeal to adults by experimenting with its menu and has retained successful items like Egg McMuffin, decaffeinated coffee, low-calorie salads and yogurt. Taking on its main fast-food competitors, McDonald's has even tested fried chicken and some Mexican dishes. In its usual way of prolonged test-marketing, McDonald's has not decided yet whether to introduce these dishes nationwide.
The standard McDonald's menu has 33 items, up 25 percent from the 1980 menu, but it can never be all things to all people. It can never offer as many Mexican entrees as a Mexican restaurant or pizza offerings as a pizza restaurant, to name two restaurant concepts that have triple and double the sales growth, respectively, of hamburgers.
In any case, neither new food nor fancy decor can overcome the fact that there are too many restaurants chasing too few mouths. Hamburger, pizza, fried chicken, seafood and steak concerns all compete for the same customers. The chain restaurant industry, which includes restaurants like Red Lobster as well as McDonald's, will have sales this year of $81.9 billion, according to the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. The top 100 restaurant chains are expected to have about 111,000 units in the United States this year.
That works out to one chain restaurant for every 2,250 Americans. Average sales per restaurant are expected to be about $738,000 annually, up only 3 percent from the year earlier. But factoring in inflation, that is a sales drop.
 
Aiming to Do One Thing Well
 Among the top 10 restaurant chains, ranked by annual sales per restaurant, McDonald's is a comfortable No. 4. But the power to do one thing well is evident from the restaurants that outrank McDonald's. General Mills' Red Lobster, a seafood restaurant, is No. 1 in per-restaurant sales, with $3.2 million; Pepsico's Olive Garden, an Italian restaurant, is No. 2, at $2.8 million, and S&A Restaurant's Bennigan's, a "casual dining" restaurant, is No. 3, at $2.1 million. Still, with fewer than 1,000 restaurants combined, they are a tenth the size of McDonald's.
These restaurants' menus and decor have advantages over those of McDonald's. They offer table service, and most serve alcohol, two features that have strong attraction for adults and that are unlikely ever to be added to a standard-format McDonald's, however adult-oriented it might be. Table service slows the quick-service features of McDonald's, and beer and wine detract from its family image.
Michael G. Mueller, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said he doubted whether the increased cost of adult-oriented decor justifies McDonald's investment.
 
 
High in Sodium and Fat
 "People still are not going to eat dinner there," Mr. Mueller said. "It's the kind of food that people are eating less and less of -- high in fat, high in sodium, lots of red meat."
But McDonald's executives say the showcase restaurants' added revenue clearly justifies the extra expenditures. "I wouldn't be doing this if I wasn't making money," said Frank Madalone, the owner of the Wall Street-area McDonald's.
Jack M. Greenberg, McDonald's chief financial officer, agreed. "They make sense as a business proposition," he said
But there may not be enough urban locations for these adult restaurants, whose cost can exceed $2 million (compared with $1.5 million for a traditional McDonald's).
"I doubt there are more than 50-or-so sites for this kind of restaurant," said Rebecca A. Barfield, an analyst with First Boston. "But it could be quite a profitable niche if handled well."
 
Golden Arch Cafe
 Another possibility for McDonald's is showcase restaurants placed outside big cities. The company's Golden Arch Cafe in Hartsville, Tenn., is designed for towns of fewer than 3,000 people, too small for the high volume needed to sustain a typical McDonald's.
Resembling a 1950's style diner, the Golden Arch Cafe -- there is only one, so far -- offers table service and dishes like fried catfish, Salisbury steak and mashed potatoes. With a full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu, the cafe is designed to build repeat business.
For McDonald's 12,000th restaurant worldwide, scheduled to open next spring, the company plans to restore an 1860's white Colonial house in New Hyde Park, L.I. The interior will have a 1920's look and a regular McDonald's menu.

HEADLINE: For the Multinationals, A Crackdown on Taxes

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Besides raising taxes for smoking, drinking and driving, the new deficit-reduction bill cracks down on multinational companies suspected of not paying proper amounts of Federal income taxes.
Internal Revenue Service officials have said in the past that billions of dollars could be at stake. 
 Though the new provisions are aimed at foreign-owned corporations, they will hit many United States companies with overseas operations.
The bill, which President Bush intends to sign, authorizes stiff new penalties for understating income from transactions between foreign and domestic units of the same company. In a global economy, such transactions are common: companies with headquarters in the United States have operations overseas, and vice versa.
Congressional sponsors of the deficit-reduction bill said it made no change in regular corporate tax rates. But William B. Modahl, director of tax affairs at the Digital Equipment Corporation in Maynard, Mass., said today that the penalties would be "a hidden surtax on international operations."
 
How Penalties Are Applied
 The basic penalty, 20 percent of the tax deficiency, applies whenever the Internal Revenue Service finds that a company understated income from dealings with a foreign affiliate by more than $10 million. If income is understated by $20 million, the penalty could be doubled.
When the I.R.S. audits a big company, it may assign a dozen accountants and economists to the case and often concludes that the company's taxable income must be adjusted upward.
Mr. Modahl, who has worked at several big companies in different industries, said: "There is almost always an adjustment, and it almost always exceeds $10 million. There is no exact price for a transaction between a U.S. company and its foreign affiliate, and reasonable men can differ. The penalty will apply, regardless of culpability."
Catherine Tift Porter, a lobbyist for a coalition of foreign-owned businesses, said: "A lot of big multinational companies will be subject to this penalty. Ten million dollars is a very low threshold for large multinationals." Ms. Porter, a lawyer at Miller & Chevalier in Washington, represents the Organization for Fair Treatment of International Investment, formed in 1985 to oppose additional taxes on companies owned by foreigners.
Charles S. Triplett, deputy associate chief counsel of the I.R.S., said the new bill gave his agency a broad array of new weapons, including increased access to the books and records of foreign banks with branches in the United States. Mr. Triplett was reached today in Tokyo, where he was attending a conference on tax developments affecting Japanese companies in the United States.
 
Strict Rules on Records
 The bill passed Saturday imposes strict new record-keeping requirements on foreign companies "engaged in a trade or business within the United States," so that the I.R.S. can independently compute their tax liability by verifying their deductions and income.
Tax experts say the Government will probably require foreign-owned companies to keep records in the United States to document their deductions. Alternatively, such companies would have to promise to make the information available promptly to the tax agency on request.
Under the bill passed Saturday, the record-keeping requirements would apply retroactively to financial records for previous years still subject to audit by the I.R.S., if the records were in existence on March 20, 1990. On that day, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, introduced a bill to "enhance I.R.S. investigative and enforcement powers," and he expressed concern that some foreign-owned companies might not be accurately reporting their tax liability.
Support for such legislation grew when I.R.S. agents testified at a Congressional hearing in July that many foreign businesses appeared to be underpaying taxes.
 
Stiffer Taxes Are Foreseen
 Stanley G. Sherwood, international tax partner at Coopers & Lybrand, said today that as a result of the new legislation, "it's very likely that American subsidiaries of foreign companies and American branches of foreign banks will end up paying more taxes."
"American subsidiaries of foreign companies will have to devote more attention to justifying the prices they pay to their foreign parents for imported products or for use of the foreign parents' patents and trade names," Mr. Sherwood said. "Foreign banks will have to produce more documents to justify their major deductions, like interest expenses."
Michael F. Patton, an international tax lawyer at Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, said I.R.S. penalties were doubly painful because they stigmatize a company and are not deductible as a business expense.
Under the new bill, a company might avoid penalties if it acted in good faith and had "a reasonable cause" for understating the tax owed on its dealings with a foreign affiliate.

Amid Crisis on Budget, Other Money Concerns

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
In the waning hours of the 101st Congress,not every lawmaker was consumed with passing the budget or pushing through bills to benefit their constituents. With little more than a week to go until Election Day, many were thinking about themselves.
Slipping off the floor to find privacy, senators and representatives worked the phones, calling lobbyists and political supporters and imploring them for money. 
 While humiliating down-to-the-wire solicitations are nothing new, what is different this year, by most accounts, is that the calls were more frequent, more desperate.
The incessant dialing for dollars is the most concrete evidence that even incumbents with the fattest war chests, with the weakest rivals, are running scared of what has come to be called the "anti-incumbent mood."
One who has been working the phones is Representative Gerry E. Studds, who represents Southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod. Mr. Studds has had mostly token opposition since his election in 1972, in part because of his championing of the fishing industry, important to the local economy. This year, he has raised about $400,000, more than double the amount taken in by his Republican opponent, Jon L. Bryan, a little-known college professor. But last week, he was scraping for more cash.
"You'd be nuts not to be nervous," Mr. Studds said over coffee in the members' dining room on the final day of the session. "The public mood in our state is angrier."
While Mr. Studds was making calls, his campaign mailed out thousands of solicitations. "Welcome now to the 1990's," he declares in one letter, "in which the conventional wisdom is: Beat your opponent's brains out."
Representative Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, said, "Incumbents who before would not have worried about it have suddenly become more worried."
He continued: "It's almost a rule of politics that your candidate could win if only you had a few more dollars. So, naturally, everyone gets on the phone and tries to get the last few dollars that gets him on TV."
Even Representative William H. Gray 3d of Philadelphia, the Democratic whip who was responsible for rounding up votes on the budget, spent precious hours on the phone trolling for dollars.
Mr. Gray is hardly in trouble, but Jerome Mondesire, Mr. Gray's chief of staff, said his boss decided to intensify his fund-raising last week so he can dispense money to local Pennsylvania candidates who need help.
"Bill Gray is a big fish here -- people respond when Bill Gray calls," said Mr. Mondesire. "He raised $30,000 in 10 hours last week."
As frustrating as it is for lobbyists to be hit up again and again for money, enough always seem to respond.
Many incumbents might have good reason to be nervous. But it is not clear why they need to amass more money. House incumbents this year have already collected 12 times as much as their challengers have secured.
And although incumbents were stuck in the Capitol until the week before the election, some would argue that it hardly mattered for their campaign operations. They still exploited the advantages of incumbency, from mailing Government-subsidized newsletters to their constituents to doing political favors for voters.
Mild measures to tighten the campaign finance system were approved by both chambers this year, but, not surprisingly, the bills died in the final days of Congress. Lawmakers showed little interest in passing bills that could make it easier for challengers to defeat them.
Thomas S. Foley, the Washington Democrat who is House Speaker, said campaign finance was the most important legislation that did not pass this session.
So the soliciting goes on. While Mr. Studds says making the calls "is obscene, is demeaning," Mr. Gray apparently is less put off by the process.
"Fund-raising is one of his best talents," said Mr. Mondesire. "After all, he's a preacher."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mostly Higher; Dealers Say Trading Is Dull

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher on world currency markets yeterday, but traders said dealings were dull.
Gold prices advanced after falling overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $373.70 a troy ounce, up $2.80 from Friday's close. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $373.65, up $2.65 an ounce. 
 Traders said that despite the advance, the dollar remained within its current trading range. With no fresh news to direct trading, "there was no reason to sell and no reason to buy," said Robert Ryan, a senior trader at the Bank of New York.
At midday, the Federal Reserve bought $1 billion in Treasury bills while the Federal funds rate, the interest rate charged on overnight loans, was at 7 3/4 percent. The move signaled to the financial markets that the Fed had eased by a quarter of a point.
Although lower interest rates usually are bearish for the dollar because they diminish the value of dollar-denominated securities, traders had already discounted the Fed's action. The Fed had made an easing of its credit policy contingent on the passage of a budget measure.
"The market had been anticipating an easing, and the dollar had been falling on that," said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 127.35 Japanese yen from 128.50 yen at Friday's close. Later in London, it was quoted higher at 127.80 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 128.65 yen, up from 128.25 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.9525 from $1.9555 late Friday. In New York, one pound cost $1.9490, less expensive than Friday's $1.9565.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose to 1.5220 marks, from 1.5130 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates included: 1.2920 Swiss francs, up from 1.2810; 5.0930 French francs, up from 5.0670; 1,140.50 Italian lire, up from 1,134.00, and 1.1635 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1644.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $372.75 an ounce from $373.75 late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to $372.50 an ounce from $373.40. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.80 an ounce to close at $371.16.
Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.127 an ounce, up from $4.050 on Friday. But in London the metal slipped to a late bid of $4.10 an ounce, from $4.14.

HEADLINE: Talking Business with Spiro of Carleton Woolen Mills;
Going It Alone In Textile Industry

BYLINE: By Isadore Barmash

 BODY:
Amid a flurry of takeovers in the textile industry, Carleton Woolen Mills, of Winthrop, Me., has stood out as a hardy independent. The company, with annual sales of about $45 million, is owned by Arthur M. Spiro, its chief executive, who grew up in New York City's garment business and has spent more than 45 of his 65 years designing, selling and producing textiles.
Q. How have you managed to stay independent in the face of many mergers in the textile industry, including the takeover of J. P. Stevens and West Point Pepperell?
A. We have employed tight financial controls and a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio to keep us afloat in a business climate that is plagued with excessive interest payments due to over-leveraging "junk bonds" -- of which we have none. We are not subject to hostile takeovers since we are a private company with closely held shares. We view our size and independence as a strong asset in being able to quickly and flexibly respond to market needs without coping with the large, corporate superstructure that often inhibits such timely action.
Q. So how can the independent textile producer compete?
A. Simply by being flexible and creative. We have to quickly respond to market needs and make sure that we are providing the highest standards of quality control, service and efficiency. But there's no substitute to creativity, which I think is more attainable in an independent company.
Q. How has the rising cost of oil affected your energy-intensive business?
A. The impact is quite serious because fuel prices have more than doubled since July, with similar increases in propane gas and electricity. If this continues, we will soon see substantial price increases in man-made-fiber raw materials and in processing petrochemical-based products. These increases will be difficult to pass along to our customers in a recessionary climate, which has created low confidence and a slower rate of retail buying.
Q. Have the mergers and divestitures in retailing affected your business or those of your manufacturing customers?
A. We've been much affected by it, as have our traditional producer-customers who sell to troubled retailers. Before 1989, we could get relatively clear readings of directions and requirements from our customers. Now we and they are selling to moving retail targets that change continually. The ripple effect of the retailing debacle has also hurt healthy retailers whose business has been competitively affected in local markets. The net result is more confusion for textile mills and garment makers who need to plan effectively for the use of their facilities.
Q. What direction will the United States textile industry take in the next few years in view of the recent trade negotiations?
A. The U.S. textile industry will continue to shrink, giving way to imported garments as its customer base continues to erode down to the few remaining, very cost-effective, commodity-type producers and a small group of niche-market, creative manufacturers of specialty designed fabrics. If and when the focus of U.S. textile trade negotiations shifts from the current battle between alleged protectionism and alleged giveaway, we may see some needed efforts by Government and industry to realistically develop a level playing field. This will encourage efficient and creative U.S. textiles manufacturers to competitively sell their fabrics in world markets now closed to us by protectionism.
Q. Where are the overseas opportunities for textiles?
A. The opportunities are in the Far East and Eastern Europe where rapid social and economic changes are occurring and huge consumer markets will develop. All of these people want to emulate American life styles. They will want to learn fashion, technology and distribution from us. With needed new U.S. Government support to encourage this effort, we should be able to attractively sell our fabrics and know-how abroad.
Q. Specifically, what new U.S. Government support are you seeking?
A. I am looking for the continuation of reasonable tariffs and quotas comparable to those of all of our other trading partners, nothing more and nothing less. I am also looking for complete elimination of all non-tariff barriers abroad plus quick, effective and strong countermeasures against all violators of such agreements.

HEADLINE: Critics Say Cars Got Break on Clean Air

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
Residents of the nation's smoggiest cities will have to contend with dirty air well into the next century because the automobile industry got big breaks in the new Clean Air Act, government and private environmentalists say.
In large part, they say, the industry's success in fending off pollution standards that would have been tougher and quicker to take effect than those ultimately agreed to stems primarily from the efforts of one man: Representative John D. Dingell, the powerful Democrat from Detroit who is the automobile manufacturers' leading advocate in Washington. 
 Mr. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, supported passage of a new clean air bill after many years of blocking such efforts. But in the course of the yearlong legislative process, which began with a detailed proposal from President Bush, he exacted concessions for the auto makers, who had asserted that the costs of some requirements would exceed the benefits and that some changes were not technologically feasible.
Settling years of regional political disputes, House and Senate negotiators reached final agreement Oct. 22 on the changes in clean air legislation, the first in 13 years, that are intended to strengthen and broaden the Government's authority to reduce air pollution.
Among the concessions the Michigan Democrat negotiated were the elimination of an automatic second round of emissions reductions in the next decade. Rules mandating use of alternative fuels for regular cars and taxi, van and truck fleets were sharply watered down, notwithstanding the fact such fuels were a keystone of the President's plan.
 
Diesel Standared Delayed
 Also, tougher standards for diesel buses -- potent air polluters in cities like New York with big public transit fleets -- were delayed several years. Deadlines were extended for other auto antipollution steps, calling into question whether some cities will be able to attain Federal clean air standards in the allotted time.
"In many areas, we took a big hit," said S. William Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators, an association of local officials. "John Dingell showed his prowess and displayed why he is the maverick politician he is. He was very successful in protecting his constituency to the extent he did."
Mr. Dingell, through a spokesman, said he is proud of his efforts to defend the automobile industry, as well as the outlines of the final Clean Air bill. "The auto industry, like every other industry is going to have to make a substanial contribution to cleaning up the air," he said. "This bill, when implemented, will remove between 98 percent and 99 percent of pollution from the tailpipes of an automobile. That's the fact."
Representative Henry A. Waxman, a Democrat from smoggy Los Angeles who fought Mr. Dingell over stronger clean air standards for 10 years, acknowledged that some concessions had been made but defended the overall motor vehicle provisions. He called the law "the most aggressive program to develop cleaner cars anywhere in the world," including California.
 
Hard Times for Industry
 Harvey Heinbach, first vice president with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets who follows the automobile industry, said it is no secret why Mr. Dingell defended the automobile business.
"These guys are really stretched," he said. The industry, which is facing a recession, is already spending heavily to remain competitive with the Japanese, paying for installation of air bags, and may have to spend more to improve fuel economy in coming years, Mr. Heinbach said.
But environmentalists who have followed the debate see considerable room for improvement.
"The automobile program in the Clean Air bill is an ambitious program, but it should be implemented half a decade sooner," said Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club in Washington. "The auto industry is capable of greater reductions sooner than what this bill would require."
 
Cleaner, but Not Enough
 In big cities, automobiles are the biggest contributors to smog. As a result, city residents had the most to lose from auto pollution controls that are not as strong as they could have been, the environmentalists argue. Also, the fewer smog-producing substances that are eliminated from automobile emissions, the more that habe to be cut from sources like industry if Federal health standards are to be met, they say.
"These requirements will certainly give us cleaner urban air, but they don't seem strong enough to give us healthful air under Federal standards," said Richard E. Ayres, who headed the environmental coalition backing passage of a tougher Clean Air Act.
A provision requiring installation of canisters on cars to capture gasoline vapors during refueling will not be completely phased in until 1998. Many cities violating clean air standards will have already reached the new deadlines for compliance by the time the canisters are in all cars on the road, Mr. Becker said.
The oil industry also got a break. Use of reformulated gasoline to reduce smog-forming substances in the nine most polluted cities was to be phased in starting in 1992, but the start has been pushed back until 1995. Obstacles were also added that will make it harder for other cities to participate in the program.
Among environmentalists, reformulated gasoline is seen having "more bang for the buck" because it can immediately address pollution from all vehicles on the road, rather than waiting for new cars with stricter tailpipe standards to come onto the road.
 
Keeping Score
 Under the new Clean Air Act, New York State continues to have the right to adopt California tailpipe emissions standards. California, which has the nation's worst smog problem, recently decided to require tailpipe standards in the second half of the 1990's that are tougher than those in the new law, a course New York will eventually follow, said Thomas C. Jorling, the Stae Environmental Conservation Commissioner. About 23 percent of all cars in the nation are registered in the two states.
But New York State action's alone will not solve the metropolitan area's air quality problems if states like Pennsylvania and Maryland fail to follow California, say New York environmental officials. Areas south of New York contribute as much as half of its smog through prevailing wind patterns, they say.
Albert F. Appleton, New York City's environmental protection commissioner, said he was glad that Congress preserved a state's right to adopt California's strict emission standards, and that reformulated gasoline will eventually be made available. But over all, he said, the motor vehicle provisions disappointed him: "Automobiles, one; Clean Air, nothing."
The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association lashed out at Mr. Appleton's evaluation. "He probably hasn't spent much time studying the bill," said Timothy C. MacCarthy, the group's director of Federal liaison in Washington. Mr. MacCarthy said debate over further cuts in automobile emissions had been about "the last increment of cleanup," and he asserted that pollution has been reduced 96 percent from pre-controlled cars.

HEADLINE: China Puzzle: Why a Panel Doesn't Meet

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 29

 BODY:
In a famous Sherlock Holmes case, the key clue was a dog that did not bark. These days, sleuths who follow China are focusing on a similar indication that something is amiss: the clue this time is the Central Committee that does not meet.
The evidence is mostly circumstantial, but it points to significant disputes among China's top leaders. The jostling seems to be about power, succession and the political and economic directions the nation will take in the 1990's. 
 The hardest of the hard-liners in the Government seem to have gained influence in the last few months, but are unable to win a consensus for the changes they want in personnel and policies, Chinese officials and foreign diplomats say.
Thus the stalemate continues at the pinnacle of the leadership, and the Communist Party Central Committee is unable to meet and ratify the changes or the five-year plan that is to begin in January.
The Central Committee meeting was expected to convene in September or October, but a Politburo member recently told a Japanese visitor that it would not meet even in November. Prime Minister Li Peng said today that the committee would meet before the end of the year, so December seems to be the current target.
 
'Fighting Among Themselves'
 "During the Asian Games, the leaders concentrated on the games and there was some cooperation and unity," said a Chinese with close ties to senior officials. The Asian Games, a miniature Olympics, ended on Oct. 7.
"But now they're fighting among themselves to get their way on a whole range of issues, and until they reach some agreement, the Central Committee can't meet."
A Western diplomat was blunter, saying, "We think it's a battle."
The traditionalists have been able to score some gains because the pivot of the political system, Deng Xiaoping, appears to have withdrawn from daily involvement in political affairs. Mr. Deng appears to be staying at home and enjoying an apolitical life as patriarch of a family of 16 living together in one courtyard.
Mr. Deng, who is 86 years old, has not been seen in public since July -- a gap that normally results in rumors that he is seriously ill. But these days, Mr. Deng is said to be in satisfactory condition, and his youngest son, Deng Zhifang, is planning a trip to the United States, which also suggests that his father is getting along.
The octogenarian hard-liners -- whose patriarch is Chen Yun, an 85-year-old who has not been seen in public in more than a year -- are said to be pushing for a major promotion for Deng Liqun, 75, a retired head of the Communist Party Propaganda Department.
 
Guidance to Journalists
 Some party elders are also ignoring their lack of formal positions and are quietly issuing hard-line instructions on whatever catches their attention. Deng Liqun, for example, is believed to be meeting with newspaper editors and advising them on what to write.
Former President Li Xiannian, 81, was recently outraged to read in a news summary that the city of Shenyang in northeastern China was planning to sell stakes in several dozen companies to foreigners. A Chinese with high-level associations said Mr. Li scrawled "reckless" on the report and issued instructions that the sale be halted.
The octogenarians have also curbed the influence of Li Ruihuan, who is a protege of Deng Xiaoping. Mr. Li appeared in July to win a turf battle with the traditionalists over control of the Culture Ministry.
Mr. Li's victory immediately rippled throughout the Government: At the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, hard-liners became much more friendly to the scholars, whom they were subjecting to grueling Communist Party study sessions.
But in August, the group of octogenarians began to complain that Mr. Li was making statements that went beyond the party line. Deng Xiaoping did not come to his defense, and Mr. Li's influence has diminished.
 
Centralized Planning Continues
 Another sign of hard-liner dominance is the five-year plan, drafts of which have circulated among senior officials. Economists and others who have seen it say that it includes general calls for further reform, but that as it stands, it is primarily a document of central planning.
But if the reformists are lying low these days, they have not given up the battle. At the end of last month, the leaders of China's provinces were summoned to Beijing to study and approve an outline of the five-year plan. Instead, the governors rebelled, a major embarrassment to Prime Minister Li, and refused to approve the plan.
According to accounts by knowledgeable Chinese, the governors complained that the draft transferred too much power and wealth from the provinces to the central Government. Some governors, including Ye Xuanping of Guangdong province, dared to interrupt Prime Minister Li, and the meeting reportedly ended in tumult. Now the draft is being re-examined and is expected to be modified after negotiations with the governors.
The one item on the Central Committee's agenda that has already been agreed upon, Chinese officials and diplomats say, is the fate of the ousted Communist Party leader, Zhao Ziyang. Mr. Zhao was formally dismissed from all his posts in June 1989 and has been under investigation since. But the leadership is now believed to have agreed to end the investigation and allowed him to remain in the party.

HEADLINE: Wishing Pollution Were Unmade in Taiwan

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
Two plastic bottles and an aluminum can hang out to dry on her porch, and a tall stack of waste papers are piled neatly on a desk, as Mary M. L. Chen does battle against one of Taiwan's most daunting challenges in its entry to the industrialized world: pollution.
For the last two decades, all the energy of this island's people was devoted to economic progress, and now that Taipei is among the most prosperous cities in Asia, people are beginning to realize that for all their wealth they still cannot buy a decent sunset.People like Miss Chen, director of the Homemakers' Union, are trying to preach a cleaner way of living, but she admits that often her words cannot make it through the jungle of sounds that also makes Taipei one of the noisiest cities in Asia. 
 The strains of Taiwan's economic miracle have already begun to chase away investment, and nowhere are the pains more apparent than in the island's cloudy air, dirty water and sludgy soil. Like many countries intent on economic development, Taiwan was slow to tackle its environmental problems early in its economic boom. The problems are shared in many otherrapidly growing Asian economies.
"Not even money can buy good air and clean water if it's not there," said Sam Lin, an industrial chemical specialist who is head of Taiwan's Greenpeace Group.
Taiwan's large petrochemical industry has been the source of a great deal of toxic waste, critics say.
 
The Rivers Are Dead
 "Nearly every river has been polluted to the extent that the water is pronounced dead -- it is dead water," said Chang Kow-lung, a physics professor at National Taiwan University.
With 20 million people, Taiwan has apopulation density 21 times that of the United States, and the number of factories per unit of area is 2.6 times that in Japan, according to official statistics.
Moreover, this island has more than 11 million motor vehicles, and each month 10,000 newly purchased cars are added to the streets of Taipei alone. Parking spaces are so scarce that buying one can cost more than $100,000.
Environmental consciousness is rising, and Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration, formed in 1987, is gaining influence within the Government, although some worry that Taiwan's current economic slowdown will stall new controls. Since July, new cars have faced stricter pollution-control standards, and regulations for motorcycles are planned for next year.
"Everything that happened in the U.S. in the 60's is happening in Taiwannow," said Eugene Chien, the director of the agency.
Near Kaohiung, a southern city where industries like petrochemicals and scrap metal are big, residents protested the construction of a plant to make ethylene used in plastics.
After years of stalemate, and after the company agreed to spend several hundred million dollars on pollution-control equipment, the project is going ahead. But the struggle left a deep impression on the whole island.
"It changed a lot of things, changed the attitude of the Government, and made them realize they can't just turn their heads," said Anthony C. Ku, vice president at the Industrial Technology Research Institute, which is working on an anti-pollution program. "It made everyone realize how we are damaging our land and our soil."

HEADLINE: Tourism and Whales' Protectors Collide Over a Hawaii Law

BYLINE: By RICHARD HALLORAN

DATELINE: KANEOHE, Hawaii

 BODY:
MANY boat operators, sea plane pilots, jet skiers and beach lifeguards have lined up to oppose rules proposed to protected marine life, notably the humpback whales that winter here.
A law passed by the State Legislature in July required motorboats and other so-called thrill craft to stay away from waters frequented by the whales from Dec. 15 to May 15. In the apparently unending struggle between economics and the environment, opponents say the rules were drafted without proper environmental impact studies and are so strict they unfairly jeopardize tourism; supporters say they are necessary to avoid disrupting the whales. 
 In hearings just completed on refinements of the rules to go into effect later this year, the same themes recurred. At one hearing here early this month in a junior high school cafeteria, Robert Dall, a boat operator known here as Captain Bob, got applause when he emphasized the economic benefits of thrill craft, including powerful cigarette boats like the one piloted by President Bush in Maine.
"Eventually," Mr. Dall asserted, "as the visitor is cut off from more and more areas, he is going to consider that a slap in the face and Hawaii is going to suffer as a whole."
The whales summer in Northern Pacific feeding grounds, then swim 2,500 miles to the warm waters of Hawaii to give birth, nurture their calves and mate again. They are seen all around Hawaii, especially in the shallow waters partly enclosed by the islands of Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe. In waters close to shore, whales compete for space with high-speed motorboats, often towing water-skiers or para-sailors, as well as jet water-skiiers, snorklers, scuba divers, sailboats and sea planes.
 
The Watchers and the Watched
 The whales themselves have generated a growing business, whale watching, especially in the resort town of Lahaina on Maui. Problems with whale watching have come up in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. However, a 1989 article in Oceanus Magazine, published by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, said whales off New England and California seemed more tolerant of watchers than those around Hawaii.
"North Pacific humpbacks encounter very little vessel traffic either in their Alaska feeding areas, or to and from the Hawaiian breeding grounds," the article said. "In addition, the natural movement of individual whales through the breeding grounds minimizes their exposure to the intense coastal traffic near certain islands."
Around Hawaii, environmentalists and boaters agree that the whales do not seem to mind being watched so long as boats keep their distance, move slowly beside or behind them, do not suddenly change speed or direction and do not cross their paths. But if they are disturbed, the whales may stop nursing or breeding, thus further threatening an endangered mammal that is slowly recovering.
After pleas from environmentalists, the Legislature voted to prohibit any person or vessel from going within 100 yards of a humpback whale. They must stay at least 300 yards from a whale within areas known to be frequented by cows and calves. Aircraft are banned within 1,000 feet.
 
Irritated Whales Swish Tails
 The new law forbids any action that disrupts the normal behavior of a whale, as indicated by signs like tail swishing, sudden diving and evasive swimming or "the abandonment of a previously frequented area."
In waters not frequented by whales, a compromise permits thrill craft to operate during the week, allowing tourists to ride them, but not on weekends, when most Hawaiians would be likely to use them.
At the hearing here, Joe Pickard, who runs a boating business with four employees, asserted that no studies had shown that thrill craft harmed the environment. John Q. Adams, who runs a private lifeguard company, said that thrill craft made rescue attempts easier. He also asserted, "You're not going to be able to enforce these rules and regulations because you're so understaffed."
In early December, Gov. John Waihee is to approve the final rules, as determined by a board of the Department of Transportation, and penalties for those caught violating them.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Help the Passengers

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
The Soviet ship sinks rapidly now.
The world knows that the Soviet Union is in deep trouble but the depth of the disaster approaching has not taken hold. Nor has any thought been given to what might be done, if anything, to help save the passengers trapped aboard. 
 One crisis at a time -- that is what most of us seem able to handle. The Iraqi threat has moved the Soviet Union from the prime time and front page of the world's consciousness.
That is only one reason the full extent of the Soviet collapse has not quite penetrated our minds. Mikhail Gorbachev is another. He appears so often and so prominently in foreign capitals that it is hard to understand that whenever he lands at home he must wonder whether he still has a job, and if so how long it will have any meaning.
And, of course, from the time of the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 right through last year, we were told by academics, economists, journalists, diplomats, Soviet experts of one kind or another that the Communist ship was unsinkable. Oh, maybe there were creaks here and there, but on two critical aspects of Soviet life, the economy and handling of its nationalities, it was sailing right along. Sometimes we were even told that we would be lucky to do as well.
In 1984, John Kenneth Galbraith wrote that the Soviet economy had made "great material progress" and went on:
"Partly, the Russian system succeeds because in contrast to Western industrial economies, it makes full use of its manpower."
It is not fair to single out Mr. Galbraith, since many of his colleagues wrote much the same kind of thing. But Commentary magazine nailed him on that in its August 1990 issue and I just couldn't get it out of my head.
For decades, we were also fed the story that the Soviet Union had pulled off the great task of melding the enormous variety of nationalities into one functioning system, with opportunity and equality for all.
So two Soviet worlds existed. One was created by the leaders of the Communist system. It was real and had power. The other was by (not all, not all) Western intellectuals, journalists, politicians and diplomats. It was not real but it had power -- in the minds of millions of Westerners who believed in its existence.
Now both worlds have fallen apart. Of the 15 Soviet "republics," 13 have declared their "sovereignty." Inside those 13, scores of other minorities, regions and ethnic groups have announced their own legal separateness. Moscow's writ extends only where local groups decide to accept it, time to time and law by law.
Civil uprising breaks out from one end of the country to another. More and more, Moscow will rely on force to rule. But thousands of draftees refuse to serve and thousands of serving soldiers, in Germany, sell their uniforms and rifles for marks.
We hear of consumer "shortages." But what has not really sunk in is that the food situation may become a matter of hunger, not shortage, because of the breakdown of harvesting and distribution. Before long, the world may have to deal with a wave of economic refugees from the Soviet Union.
A delegation of the Russian Republic's parliament toured this country recently, crying S.O.S. But it did not know the ways of American press and politics; its message reached few Americans.
All the talk of all the summit conferences about how the West would help the Soviet economy was a charade, as is Mr. Gorbachev's agreement-signing in Madrid and Paris. The Soviet system cannot be saved -- nor should it be.
A new system will succeed Communism, whether separate nations or a community of them, whether in peace or civil war, freedom or repression, is unknowable.
Prepare food lifts, Soviet visitors plead. But, as the Russians said, food shipped through the remnants of the collapsing central system will be lost in the corruption of the apparatus or may go to feed the military.
For decades, the West refused to talk about the imprisonment of the Soviet nationalities for fear of angering Moscow or causing trouble within the empire. Even last year, the U.S. broke its half-century-old promise to support Baltic independence.
Now it is clearly in our interest, political and moral, to search out peoples and organizations, in Russia, the Ukraine, the Baltics, Georgia, Armenia, and make judgments about which are working for a democratic future. We cannot do much now but at least we can channel aid to the passengers, not the failed captain and his frightened officers.

HEADLINE: China Is Increasing Forced-Labor Exports

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "China Has No Forced-Labor Exports" (letter, Oct. 5), Chen Defu, the press counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, states that China's labor reform departments, which enforce penalties imposed on criminals, "are not allowed to engage in foreign economic and trade activities, and China has never granted any labor-reform department a permit to engage in foreign trade." He adds, "No products made in prison are exported."
The counselor would do well to consult his home country's own published statements. According to the Law Year Book of China (1989), published last March by Beijing's Law Publishing House, the value of products for export of labor-reform enterprises increased 21 percent in 1988 over 1987, and the foreign exchange earned increased 42 percent. The Law Year Book's editorial committee attests to the authoritative nature of the publication, as it consists of several high Chinese officials including, among others, the deputy minister of justice, the vice president of the Supreme People's Court and the deputy minister of public security.
China very clearly produces goods for export by using forced labor and seems very glad to earn foreign exchange from this source. To deny that this is the practice flies in the face of the facts even as they are presented by the Chinese authorities themselves.

HEADLINE: New Rochelle Development Plan Threatens Long Island Sound

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Bridging Blight in New Rochelle" (editorial, Oct. 16), which asserts that my objections to the colossal condominium development on Davids Island are "misguided," reflects incredible lack of knowledge about New York State's coastal development policies and this project in particular.
For four years, the developer has been informed that the state would encourage the development of Davids Island in New Rochelle Harbor, but not at the expense of long-term adverse environmental and economic impacts, and surely not in a manner inconsistent with the New York State Coastal Program.
It is important for New Rochelle -- and surrounding communities -- that development be responsible and balanced, and that the long-term future of Long Island Sound and its coast not be sacrificed.
For you to contend that the infrastructures and public services in the western end of Long Island Sound are adequate to allow the cramming of four high-rise condos, a half-mile bridge, a sewage treatment plant and a new breakwater with helipad on a small island in an already ecologically stressed body of water takes disingenuousness to new depths. The proposal's massive scale would overwhelm the very coastal resources intended to house it.
The developer and his promoters can stop pointing their fingers at Albany. Davids Island can become the boon New Rochelle seeks, but only when the developer stops underestimating the state's resolve and overestimating his influence. If he is so confident of his project's conformity, I suggest he resubmit it to obtain our decision and then let the courts decide the validity of the state's policy interpretations.

HEADLINE: Latin American Economies Given Brighter Assessments

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York
Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Latin America's economic prospects have brightened because governments in the region are relying more on market forces and world competition while reducing the state's role, according to new assessments by the Inter-American Development Bank and Washington policy makers.
 The policy changes mean that after a decade of stagnation caused by crushing debt burdens, the groundwork is being laid for freer hemispheric trade, the development bank said in a report released on Sunday. 
The more optimistic assessment by the bank and other leading organizations and businesses with extensive foreign dealings helped lead to a recent series of Latin American trade initiatives by the White House. It also promises to be a theme of President Bush's visit to Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela, scheduled for Dec. 2 to 8.
 
'Quiet Revolution' Reported
 In its 1990 report on Economic and Social Progress in Latin America, the bank said the reordering of economic priorities, which "will contribute to making this decade one of renewed growth for the region," stems from a "quiet revolution" against the inward-looking populism of the 1930's.
 The old approach had stressed import substitution, nationalization of foreign enterprises, price controls and subsidies to solve a wide range of economic and social problems.
 "New winds are blowing," said the development bank's president, Enrique V. Yglesias, a former Foreign Minister of Uruguay. He noted in an interview that "a new consensus has emerged in which the private sector is given the protagonist role in the region's economic development."
 The Inter-American Development Bank, based in Washington and owned by 44 governments, lends $3 billion a year to Latin America. Its report cited several factors behind the sea change in thinking:
 *The debt crisis, which focused attention on raising exports to acquire badly needed foreign currency, eliminating unrealistically high exchange rates and lowering trade barriers.
 *A new intellectual climate, which led to the discrediting of central government planning and market intervention and laid the ground for loosening rules and encouraging more privately owned companies.
 *The examples of Taiwan, South Korea and other fast-growing countries of Asia, which have succeeded in economic transformation through market- and export-oriented policies.
 The bank's views about brighter regional prospects are shared by Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, who sees a "decisive and genuine takeoff" in the region's growth, provided the new mix of policies is maintained.
 
Growth Projected by I.M.F.
 The I.M.F. predicts annual average economic growth for the region of 5.5 percent for the years 1992-95, after 3.6 percent projected for 1991, which is the highest for any group of developing countries. Annual average growth in the 1980's stagnated at 1 percent.
 Some of the governments' retrenching has been striking. Mexico Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela are among countries with ambitious programs to sell state enterprises.
 These changes have been accompanied by reforms aimed at simplifying the tax system while broadening its base and improving the efficiency of tax collection.
 The lowering of trade barriers has also been a big part of the new thinking. In 1986, Central American countries reduced their trade tariffs to a mean of 26 percent, from 53 percent.
 
Talks Planned With Mexico
 Mexico, signaling its new outward reach, joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1986. Washington already has plans for negotiations with Mexico to eliminate nearly all trade barriers, similar to the one that started last year with Canada.
 Is a parallel to the powerful trade bloc of the European Community beginning to stir in the Western Hemisphere? Mr. Yglesias, the Inter-American Development Bank's president, said: "A megamarket can be conceived, but it will be a long process and will come only if it is very carefully designed. We must guard against excessive expectations. Remember, the European Community began back in the 1950's."

HEADLINE: Leningrad Mayor, in U.S., Seeks Economic Tie

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The Mayor of Leningrad met today with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d; the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and the Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell, seeking "new forms of economic relations" between the United States and the Soviet Union.
He also had a chance to exchange a handshake and brief greeting with President Bush. 
 Anatoly A. Sobchak, a law professor turned politician, said in an interview that with his country in danger as itlurches from Communism to capitalism, he hopes to persuade the United States to guarantee the investments of American companies that hesitate to enter the roiling Soviet economy.
"All the people I spoke with asked what they could do to improve the economic situation in the Soviet Union," said Mr. Sobchak, who has been trying to push his part of the Soviet system toward market economics. "The most important type of assistance they could give is in support of American businessmen and companies that want to do business with us."
In this visit, Mr. Sobchak's third to the United States, politicians, lawyersand businessmen sought to hear his reports, while Mr. Sobchak sought to strengthen ties that might produce investments and aid for his city.
He shuttled back and forth on a schedule including dinner parties at Georgetown University, a lunch at the American Enterprise Institute and a quick trip to suburban Alexandria, Va., for a tour of the K-Mart store.
There, hands behind him like a general reviewing the troops, Mr. Sobchak strode past housewares and lingerie, turned right at the Spiderman pajamas and left at the linens, and threaded his way to the electronics section, where he compared the price of K-Mart's television sets ($290 for the ones he was looking at) to the price of black-market foreign models in the Soviet Union (3,000 to 4,000 rubles, which is around the annual wage of the average Soviet worker.)
 
In Old St. Petersburg
 "Once upon a time," he mused wistfully, "the things that were made in Petersburg were sold all over the world." Leningrad was known as St. Petersburg or Petersburg until World War I, and Mr. Sobchak is part of a movement to restore the old name.
Mr. Sobchak is visiting the country as a guest of St. Petersburg Junior College in St. Petersburg, Fla. One of his main goals is to solicit contributions for his new fund to renovate Leningrad, and to repair the decades of neglect that have slowly defaced the Czaristcapital built by Peter the Great and made magical by the Italian architects of Catherine the Great.
A spokesman for St. Petersburg Junior College said that the school had organized a varied slice of corporate America to help underwrite the visit.
But Mr. Sobchak's economic wish list, the official said, was a matter for study, not action, for the moment.
"The prospects are limited," said the official, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used. "There were a number of legal and other hurdles set up given the cold war status of the world 15 years ago. And there's the question of sound economic policy. It's not to say no one wants to help them. What helps them helps us. But it has to be done on a sound economic basis. That's why we're waiting for the International Monetary Fund report." The fund is working on a report on the Soviet economy. The report, due out by the end of the year, is expected to be a blueprint for aid to the Soviet Union.
One Federal agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, is aiding the Polish and Hungarian economies with investment guarantees like those Mr. Sobchak wants. But legal restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union bar similar guarantees for American companies there.
A trade agreement reached during the Washington summit in May would have normalized trade relations between the two countries, opening the way for guarantees and credits from the Export-Import Bank. But the Bush Administration has not submitted the agreement to Congress because required changes in Soviet immigration law have not yet been made.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Fuel for Saudi Debate: Opening Society Without Causing Strife

BYLINE: By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia

 BODY:
An adviser to the King of Saudi Arabia refers to it as "pre-crisis" and "post-crisis" in the way a historian might define the moment that broke a continuum and forced an opening toward a new era.
He was speaking of the shift in thinking here since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, a jolt that has spurred the small political and social elite of this insular Islamic monarchy into a debate in which one word is repeated time and again: change. 
 Behind closed doors, the debate is now unrelenting.
At an animated lunch recently in Riyadh, the capital, attended by several multimillionaires, one of the country's more powerful businessmen said: "The invasion changes everything. We've got to do a full review. We've got to start thinking five years ahead and even more."
As the guests chose from endless platters of fish, lamb, dumplings, salads, breads and fruit, the talk surged over sensitive topics.
"I am glad that my wife does not drive and I won't apologize about it," a Government minister nearly shouted.
"You're an old fool -- your daughters will be driving before you're dead," answered a friend.
"Say we want more democracy -- but don't use my name," said a Saudi businessman in the coastal city of Jidda, a statement heard repeatedly here.
 
 A Monarchy Resilient And Conservative
 The debate among the political and economic elite of the country boils down to a discussion about how to seek a more open system in which criticism, information and new ideas can flow without spurring social chaos or violence.
"We have built a universe of concrete complexes and machinery, but we have not yet created a modern nation," said a Saudi official in Riyadh who speaks with King Fahd. "We now have to invest in a human infrastructure, training our people and then letting them have a say in running their country."
Such talk has been heard before. Influential Saudis say debate on change purposely has been used by the monarchy at times to raise a cloud of words to soften passions and fog the fact that significant innovation does not occur.
Several Saudi officials and diplomats point out that the ruling Saud family has, with American support, proved able to weather radical demands over several decades.
They argue that the Saudi monarchy is one of the most resilient and conservative governing institutions in the modern world, choosing the pace to permit innovation by pragmatically wielding the oil wealth needed to buy fealty at home and acceptance abroad.
Among the luxuries that almost unimaginable oil wealth and geographic isolation have permitted this Arab kingdom, perhaps the most striking has been the effort to resist unwanted social innovation.
Now there is a troubled realization that the present crisis may have ended a surrealistic period in which one of the world's suddenly richest and most theocratic nations has tried to balance a binge of oil-financed capitalist consumption, travel, education and 21st-century technology with an almost medieval vision of Islamic culture and monarchy.
 
 Role of the Army And of Saudi Women
 "You cannot imagine the shock to us of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait," a Government administrator said. "We were suddenly forced to wake up and look at ourselves and the neighborhood we live in."
"We thought we could remain apart from the world," he said. "Or at least that we had another decade to prepare ourselves for change. Now we know some things have to be done sooner."
Among the most argued topics are the creation of a larger, professional army, an expanded role for women, more democracy, press freedom and an international security pact to protect gulf oilfields. Each of those is a major step that Saudi officials say would have far-reaching consequences.
To build a professional army is a risky move for a monarchy that knows armies have toppled kings throughout the Middle East in recent decades.
Saudi officials and diplomats say the Saudi military today is, with the exception of the elite air force, purposely kept weak, internally divided and led only by those personally loyal to the king. The choice is either to improve it, or be dependent on foreign protection.
"Iraq invaded and we all asked, 'Where is the army?' " said a royal adviser in the capital. "We realized then that we don't really have one."
 
 Freedom to Work And to Publish
 There also is strong private discussion on forming a national council or elected assembly to advise the King, a topic much debated in the late 1970's and early 80's.
The question was shelved by the monarchy.
The argument over an increased role for women is perhaps the most likely to bring a degree of change relatively soon, many Saudis say.
Because women here are largely prohibited from working with men, about half of the population is effectively kept economically idle. As a result, the country must rely on millions of foreign workers, most of them from India, Pakistan and the Philippines.
Severe controls on foreign workers and on Saudi women have so far neutralized the working class and women's movements, but it is easy to find women who are tired of being kept at home and their voices are increasingly being heard.
Another issue being discussed is increased press freedom and the formation of political and economic advisory groups. There is not a single center of independent thought in this country, profoundly limiting its ability to debate and choose among competing futures.
 
 A Pace of Change That Shocks the Saudis
There may be easier acceptance of a multinational security pact to safeguard the oilfields that provide energy to most of the world, but even that discussion has prompted unease in a country that has sought to maximize its independence.
All of those steps are jarring for a rapidly developing but still very conservative Muslim monarchy that did not abolish slavery until 1962. Most of the population was semi-nomadic 25 years ago. It is not hard to meet urbane professionals whose fathers and mothers were illiterate.
From that perspective, the pace of change here already is shocking to many Saudis, some of whom have gone from camels to Mercedeses in their lifetimes.
The increasing debate about change mainly involves the small, urban, very affluent and modernizing circle of interrelated business, professional and royal families who form a class apart in Saudi society.
Their contradictorily Westernized lives are distant from the broad mass of still very traditional Saudis whose existence is guided by strong fealty to the royal family and a profoundly conservative faith that fills the mosques at prayer times.
The main business of King Fahd appears to be to try to balance those two often conflicting social forces, one revering tradition, the other urging innovation.
The King is referred to as the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. It is a recognition of Saudi control of the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina, a delicate task that the royal family takes with utter seriousness -- deepening the conservatism of the Saudi interpretation of Islam.
This is a nation where Kentucky Fried Chicken shops, Baskin-Robbins ice cream parlors and Pizza Huts are liable to periodic patrol by Islamic vice squads, known as Muttawa, who zealously enforce closing for prayer hours, restrictions on mingling between the sexes and dress codes to cover women's bodies.
But even as it permits such Islamic zeal, the monarchy at the same time has promoted striking change, including mass industrial and urban development, free education that includes graduate studies abroad, and education for women.
A notable aspect of the current debate is that no one suggests doing away with the monarchy and no one will openly criticize the royal family, despite reports of corruption and occasional anger with indigent princes who do little except occupy palaces covering entire city blocks. Even the most outspoken modernizers say the Saud ruling family is needed to hold the country together.
It does so in part by maintaining a de facto traditionalist dictatorship with broad limits on freedom. Yet there is tolerance for choices that do not directly threaten Islam or the royal family. Much is permitted in private that would be punished if done in public.
Opposition political parties are illegal. Amnesty International has protested the treatment of more than 100 political prisoners, listing reported beatings and long imprisonment without trial. The police are not omnipresent, but can be harsh.
 
 'I'm Living A Kafka Novel'
 The monarchy censors the press, blacking out or ripping pages of foreign publications it considers offensive. Nudes by Botticelli and Titian recently suffered the censor's pen. Time magazine was recently banned because of an article on the King's reported enjoyment in his youth of some decidedly non-Islamic pleasures.
But the appearance of near-absolute power is constrained in practice by tradition and the demand that the King consult before acting.
He does so in constant private meetings and via weekly public royal audiences, known as majlis, where discussion flows between the people and ruling princes in each province in a near tribal manner.
Many would-be Saudi modernizers deeply resent strict religious laws and political limits. Others, noting the wreckage of the modern Middle East, take a longer view.
"What we have learned from our own experience and watching our neighbors is that evolution is better than revolution," said a prominent Saudi businessman, who then admitted that balancing old and new periodically made him feel "like I'm living a Kafka novel -- sometimes life here seems absurd."
Much of the country's elite has been educated abroad, travels regularly and spends vacations at their villas in England, Spain and the United States.
 
 Growing Temptations And Western Ideas
 There they say they wear shorts, go to the movies and perhaps enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. Saudi girls and boys may go on a date. Saudi women drive cars, study and sometimes find a job.
Then they return to Saudi Arabia. The women are not allowed to drive or work with men, mixing between unmarried men and women is strongly discouraged and in most cases illegal, alcohol is prohibited, there are no movie theaters. Exposing your legs beneath a pair of Bermuda shorts can result in a fine or social censure.
Today, as this Islamic monarchy faces Iraq and hosts a growing foreign presence on its soil, it appears more than ever before to be grappling with demands and temptations that spring ultimately from Western liberal ideas and capitalism.
"We lived happily, separate from the rest of the world for 1,000 years," a Saudi prince said. "Now we have joined the world, but we still need time to find our way in it."
In that meeting between monarchy and movement, the future appears to rest on how the King and his court respond to the debate that is stirring their kingdom -- at a moment when survival depends on foreign states whose armies have brought temporary security, but whose values will likely bring further disquiet in the years to come.

HEADLINE: West Distorts Food Need, Sudan Says

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Two senior members of the Islamic fundamentalist Government accused Western donors today of exaggerating the food shortages in the Sudan and said there was no reason to make a public appeal for international help.
The United States, traditionally the biggest giver of food aid to the Sudan, has said that the country faces a famine next year unless plans are made to deliver large amounts of grain. 
 The director of the United States Agency for International Development here, Dr. Frederick Machmer, said the agency was working on the assumption that the Sudan, Africa's largest country, could have a shortage of as much as a million tons of grain, caused by drought and civil war. The fighting in the south has hampered farming and the distribution of fertilizer.
Eight to nine million people would be at risk of hunger if the shortage was one million tons, Dr. Machmer said. The Sudan's total population is estimated at 25 million. But he said that the Sudanese Government's refusal to admit that the country faces a severe food shortage next year will make it difficult to get food here on time.
 
The Optimistic View
 Col. Salah al-Din Karar, the chairman of the economic committee of the ruling Revolutionary Command Council, told a group of reporters invited here by the Government that "a gap might arise" after the November harvest, but that it would not exceed 500,000 tons. This, he said, would not be "a big problem" and would be made up next April by local grain harvested from irrigated areas.
Western and Sudanese agricultural experts said they did not know how the main irrigated area, south of Khartoum, would produce such quantities.
Another member of the junta, Brig. Pio Ukwan, said that if international organizations fed what he estimated to be the three million foreign refugees in the Sudan, the Government would be able to look after its own people.
The office here of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that there are 800,000 foreign refugees in the Sudan, most of them Ethiopian, of whom about 300,000 receive food aid from Western donors.
 
Denials of Need
 For weeks now, the Khartoum Government has been publicly denying that the country faces acute food shortages, and has been lashing out at relief organizations based here.
The military Government, which came to power 16 months ago, has made its distaste for the country's traditional Western donors increasingly evident. The two Government newspapers recently carried a headline "Death to America Should Be the Motto for Every Muslim" over an article about the Persian Gulf crisis. The Sudan has not denounced the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Today's dispatch by the official Sudan News Agency carried a statement by Colonel Karar saying the nation would not accept food aid even if it declared a famine.
The food situation is a particularly sensitive matter for the Government, which declared self-sufficiency in food as one of its goals when it came to power. But even as the senior officials publicly say they do not want or need Western aid, they have quietly asked the United States for $150 million worth of grain for next year. Washington dismissed the request, made in September, saying the Khartoum Government was obstructing the effort to help the three million people displaced by the civil war.
Early this month, the United States diverted a ship with 45,000 tons of wheat that had been bound for the Sudan, citing the bombing of southern towns, the cancellation of relief flights and the confiscation of food shipments as the reasons. Ten days ago, the United States resumed delivery of the grain.

Platinum futures prices posted their strongest gains in 10 months yesterday, rebounding from depressed levels after a Government report indicated that the United States economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter. 
 That was a stronger result than most economists had expected, although some say they still believe the economy may be on the verge of a recession.
The metals market reacted optimistically to the results, however, and platinum futures settled $18.40 to $18.70 higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for delivery in January up $18.70 at $437 an ounce. It was platinum's strongest day since Jan. 4, when the near-term contract surged $18.90 an ounce.
Gold and silver futures turned in their best performances in more than a month.
Gold futures settled $5.60 to $6 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange with the November contract at $379.70 an ounce; silver was 8.8 cents to 9.3 cents higher with the December contract at $4.245 an ounce.
Yesterday's rally marked a significant recovery for platinum, which traded at a four-and-a-half-year low of $387.50 on Oct. 16 amid fears that the economy was sliding into a recession. Those fears were eased at least temporarily by yesterday's Commerce Department report.
The platinum market is sensitive to economic signals because the metal has many industrial uses. Thirty-seven percent of the platinum consumed last year went into automobile pollution-control systems and another 17 percent was used in petroleum, glass, electrical and chemical manufacturing.
The market also tends to be volatile because platinum is more thinly traded than the other precious metals.
Analysts said all the precious metals were oversold and due for a correction after at least four straight weeks of declines. They said the initial surge prompted by the report on the gross national product led to waves of buying by players who had sold precious metals earlier in the belief that prices were headed lower still.
Bette Raptopolous, senior metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities, said more economic data due out later in the week might determine whether the gains would hold.
Commerce Department reports on factory orders and personal income are scheduled for release Wednesday followed by the monthly employment statistics on Friday.
"If those support the thesis that we've bottomed out, you could see platinum recover quite well and silver also, because they were declining on this recession picture," she said.

HEADLINE: Dow Climbs 17.82 Points, To 2,448.02

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Wall Street took heart yesterday from the strong reception that investors gave the Treasury's $12 billion auction of two-year notes and pushed blue-chip stocks higher.
But while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 17.82 points, to 2,448.02, the broader market did not keep pace. 
 Trading volume, at 153.5 million shares, was up from 134 million on Monday; 817 stocks declined and only 685 advanced. Three issues rose to new highs, while 205 fell to new lows.
 
 'Very High Ratio'
 What helped give the blue chips a lift, said Kenneth Spence, director of technical analysis for Salomon Brothers, was that the Treasury got 3.5 times more bids than it sought, or $42 billion worth for $12 billion at auction -- "a very high ratio."
"With all the problems going on, in banking, for instance," he said, "this indicates that people have a lot of confidence."
To a lesser degree, traders and investors also responded favorably to third-quarter figures on the gross national product. The Government report suggested the economy was stronger than had been expected while inflation was lower than most people had thought, both good signs for the stock market. Some economists remain concerned, however, that the report masked an underlying weakness that already existed or that could lead to a recession.
Mr. Spence noted that the market dropped early in the day and successfully revived after testing the Dow at 2,400, a move he saw as positive on a near-term basis, with some buyers moving in at that level.
Nevertheless, he said, "When you have very poor breadth, accompanied by greater upside volume than downside volume, as you did today, it indicates short covering and futures-related index arbitrage," that is, program trading.
Birinyi Associates, which monitors such trading, said heavy program buying added nearly 39 points to the Dow throughout the day.
 
 Steady Afternoon Climb
 Except for a brief rally marked by bargain hunters and traders buying back their short positions early in the day, the Dow drifted downward to the 2,400 level until around 12:45. From then on, it moved steadily upward.
Traders attributed most of the weakness to new concerns over the Middle East after Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the United States "will not rule out a possible use of force" and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said he would put his generals on alert.
Even so, the futures price of crude oil rose only 14 cents, to $34.54, suggesting traders did not seem alarmed.
 
 Neiman Marcus Up $3.375
 In the best gain of the day, Neiman Marcus, the store chain, jumped 3 3/8, to 14 5/8, after General Cinema, which owns 16.3 million of its 32.7 million shares, said it had reached an agreement to buy the rest in a tender offer for $14.40 apiece. General Cinema rose 1/4, to 19 3/8.
Other retail stocks were mixed. Dillard rose 1 1/2, to 72 3/4, and the Gap 1 3/8, to 24. Dayton Hudson fell 1 3/8, to 47.
While the New York Stock Exchange financial index fell slightly, Chase Manhattan continued under pressure, falling to a new low of 10, ending at 10 1/4, down 1/2. It was the Big Board's most-active stock, with nearly 3 million shares changing hands.
Also making the active list, Citicorp rose 1/8, to 11 1/4, on 1.9 million shares, while Security Pacific rose 1/2, to 18 1/4, on 1.7 million shares.
 
 Ford Down to $27.625
 Ford fell 2, to 27 5/8, hitting a new low of 27 3/8 after reporting a 78.7 percent drop in profits.
Boeing fell 1 5/8, to 44 1/2, after several analysts downgraded it, including George D. Shapiro of Salomon Brothers.

HEADLINE: With Gains by Khmer Rouge, Congress Looks to Hun Sen

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
In response to Khmer Rouge advances on the battlefield, Congress has passed legislation intended to press the Administration to broaden ties with the Vietnamese-backed Government of Cambodia.
Ever since Vietnam invaded Cambodia to topple the Khmer Rouge from power and installed a sympathetic Government in 1979, Washington has shunned that leadership in Phnom Penh and instead supported a guerrilla coalition. 
 The Bush Administration shifted policy in July by dropping its diplomatic support for the guerrilla coalition and opening contacts with Cambodia and Vietnam to increase the chances of a negotiated settlement. But it has continued to grant noncombat assistance to two non-Communist rebel groups loosely aligned with the Khmer Rouge, which was responsible for the deaths of at least a million Cambodians during its four years in power.
Congressional critics charge that Administration policy risks helping the Khmer Rouge retake power if the negotiations between the guerrillas and the Phnom Penh Government now headed by Prime Minister Hun Sen break down. In recent months, the Khmer Rouge has made military gains and has constructed an effective political organization in preparation for elections that are being pushed by the United States and the Soviet Union.
 
Recognition Not Imminent
 Congress has acted to bolster the position of the Hun Sen Government, even though the Administration said it will not consider recognizing it soon. The Government is suffering from a drop in Soviet and Vietnamese aid, as well as from infighting.
The 1991 foreign aid bill passed Saturday includes a $20 million Cambodia aid amendment, and an additional $5 million for Cambodian children. This was the first time that Congress mandated that aid be allocated to areas ruled by the Hun Sen Government. Previously, nearly all humanitarian aid had been directed only to refugee camps controlled by anti-Government forces along the Thai-Cambodian border.
The foreign aid legislation obliges the Agency for International Development to send a team to Phnom Penh within four months to write a "needs assessment report" to be used as a guide for allocating millions of dollars in aid this fiscal year. Since the agency is expected to consult with Phnom Penh officials, some backers of the legislation hope that such contacts will help push a normalization of relations.
Potentially the most significant language in the Cambodia amendment is a provision that calls on Congress and the Administration to "consult" to lift the United States trade embargo on Cambodia within 30 days of an international peace conference, which is expected to be held in Paris in the next few months.
 
No Help for Khmer Rouge
 "The real contest in Cambodia is between the Khmer Rouge and the Government," said Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, in a speech Oct. 12 on the Senate floor promoting the legislation.
He said the Congressional action was "designed to rescue the people of this God-forsaken country and to turn our policy away from our assistance, albeit indirect assistance, for the most bloodthirsty political organization since Nazi Germany, and that is the Khmer Rouge."
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d lobbied vigorously against the Cambodia amendment offered by Mr. Danforth and Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, arguing that Congress was attempting to manage policy, a senior Administration official said.

HEADLINE: Proposals to Cut School Taxes Drastically Are on Ballots in Several States

SERIES: The 1990 Issues - Third article of a series: Education

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
The national movement to improve education is in trouble, say education experts and state leaders, basing their grim assessment on major initiatives on the ballot in several states in Tuesday's election.
Antitax measures, if approved, would hobble efforts to improve schools in the states, these experts say. For example, voters in Nebraska will consider a major rollback in a new tax law to increase school financing while those in Massachusetts will vote on a major tax cut that would drastically reduce money for schools. 
 "This will be a watershed year for education," said Chris Pipho, director of state relations for the Education Commission of the States, a Denver-based education policy and research organization.
Several gubernatorial campaigns also carry consequences for education, in particular the Arkansas race in which Gov. Bill Clinton is facing attacks on his education legislation. And in Oregon, voters will consider a proposal for a school-choice plan that would grant tax credits to parents who send their children to private schools or educate them at home.
Much of the sour voter sentiment around the country stems from higher taxes in general. But the ballot initiatives, policy experts say, also reflect growing impatience among taxpayers over financing education programs that have not produced any results.
Here are several of the most significant education issues before the voters:
NEBRASKA. A voter-initiated referendum would repeal the state's seven-month-old school financing law that imposes higher state sales and income taxes. The financing law was aimed at raising $178.8 million in the first year and an additional $238.8 million the second year.
The formula is meant to close the spending gap between schools in property-rich districts and those in poorer districts by instituting spending limits and rollbacks on property taxes. Opponents of the school financing law say the Legislature approved a tax bill, not an education bill.
"It turned out to be the largest single tax increase in any given year," said Donald D. Adams, the campaign director for Nebraskans Against Higher Taxes, a citizens' group behind the initiative.
State education officials counter that the group is mistaken in characterizing the financing plan as a tax increase. They say it is a shift in taxes because it would roll back property taxes in districts that would receive increases in state aid.
A variety of education groups support the financing plan because they say it closes significant gaps in education spending between wealthy and poor school systems. But the measure to repeal it is given a good chance of passing, Nebraska political al scientists say.
MASSACHUSETTS. Voters will consider a voter-initiated referendum that is one of the most far-reaching antitax measures on any state ballot. Although it does not specify education spending cuts, the measure would force the State Legislature to reduce by $1.3 billion state spending in the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and an additional $2.4 billion in the next fiscal year.
Under the initiative, the current 5.95 percent income tax rate would be reduced to 4.25 percent on Jan. 1. In the next two years, the tax rate would increase to 4.625 percent and 5 percent.
Under current law the income tax rate will increase to 6.25 percent on Jan. 1.
"The electorate is furious in Massachusetts," said Mark Landey, a professor at Boston College who follows state elections. "If the initiative passes, the fallout will be enormous."
Typically, 40 percent of a school district's budget comes from state aid.
Education leaders in the state say the initiative could exacerbate an already difficult situtation for public schools and colleges. Education spending has fallen sharply in recent years because of the state recession, forcing public universities to sharply increase tuition rates and public schools to levy fees on extracurricular activities that were once free.
"It's absolutely critical that we not further reduce our resources," said Harold Raynolds Jr., the State Commissioner of Education.
OREGON. In a vote with national implications, Oregon voters will consider a measure that would grant $2,500 in tax credits to families who choose to send their children to private schools or educate them at home.
The initiative is considered a litmus test for the school-choice movement, which proposes a free-market approach to public education. Supporters say the initiative would give parents unprecedented freedom to shop for the best educational opportunities for their children, as they could send them to any school in the state, public or private. The tax credit would help defray the cost.
But opponents contend the tax credit would undermine the fiscal health of the state's public education system by immediately siphoning off $95 million for students already attending schools other than public ones. That is the amount the state would lose in taxes based on the number of children now in private schools, state officials said.
Some groups opposed to the initiative argue that it is nothing more than a school-choice bill for the wealthy because it fails to address the issue of transportation. Less affluent families would be hard-pressed to take advantage of the right to choose and would be left with under-financed public schools, opponents say.
And state education officials say that some families may abuse the in-home education privilege by taking the tax credit and not providing their children with an adequte education.
ARIZONA. In the only clearly pro-education measure on any state ballot, a referendum in Arizona proposes to increase education spending every year for a decade by $100 for each student.
The Legislature would have to find a new revenue source, however, because the proposal would bar the the use of funds now intended for other state programs.
The Arizona Citizens for Education, a coalition of state business and education leaders, maintains that spending per student has to be increased to improve the quality of education. Last year, the state spent $3,800 per student, 39th among the 50 states.
But opponents argue that the initiative is poorly conceived because it would allow schools that do not show improvement to continue receiving the additional money. The citizens' group dismisses such criticisms.
"When you withdraw funds from schools, all you've done is make it more difficult," said JoAnne Hilde, the group's campaign manager. She said state provisions allow for failing schools to receive guidance and support from state education agencies.
ARKANSAS. In a cantankerous gubernatorial campaign, Governor Clinton, a Democrat, and his Republican challenger, Sheffield Nelson, have traded verbal punches over the Governor's seven-year-old plan to improve public education.
The 1983 legislation ordered state public schools to improve curriculums, reduce class sizes, hire more counselors and increase teacher salaries, all supported by higher state taxes.
Mr. Nelson, a businessman and lawyer, asserts that teachers' salaries remain low and that other changes under the plan have been unsuccessful and in some cases too rigorous. For example, he cited the requirements for smaller classes that have forced some cash-pinched schools to build extra classrooms.
Mr. Nelson, who calls school improvement a noble effort, says he would support revisions in the legislation if elected.
Mr. Clinton maintains that Mr. Nelson "wants to turn the clock back" on education.
Mr. Clinton's staff concedes teacher pay remains low despite tax increases, but they point to studies by education experts that say the state's school systems have shown overall gains.
In the 1988-89 school year, teacher salaries averaged $21,955, making Arkansas 49th in terms of teachers' pay among the states.

HEADLINE: G.N.P. Up By 1.8% in 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The Government today reported an increase in the gross national product that was hailed by the Bush Administration but labeled by some economists as misleading or even masking an economy in recession.
The Commerce Department said the economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate during the July-September quarter, somewhat faster than most analysts had expected and well above the expansion rate of four-tenths of 1 percent posted during the spring. 
 With mid-term elections a week away, the report was seized on by the Administration as evidence that the economy has not tipped into a recession.
 
 The Impact of Oil Prices
 But private economists widely believe that third-quarter strength was concentrated in the first few weeks and that sharply higher oil prices have been a major drag on business activity since early August. Among other things, today's report showed a decline in disposable income and a full-point drop, to 4 percent, in the personal savings rate.
"The forces pushing the economy down are stronger than those keeping it up," said Richard B. Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers. He called the third-quarter gain in gross national product "the last hurrah for the consumer and the economy," predicting at least two negative quarters in the incipient downturn -- the current one and the first three months of 1991.
The traditional rule of thumb for a recession is two consecutive quarters of economic decline in G.N.P., but recessions can also occur in a single quarter and are best evaluated by their severity and scope as well as their duration.
Against a backdrop of these concerns, Michael J. Boskin, the top economic adviser to President Bush, put in a rare appearance in the White House briefing room today to contend that the economy continues to forge ahead.
 
 Personal Spending Advances
 "It's clear they were too pessimistic," he said of those who believe a recession began during the summer. "The acceleration of the third quarter clearly shows the economy has not been in recession, as some have claimed."
Mr. Boskin noted that personal spending advanced at a sizable 3.6 percent annual rate during the quarter and that business investment in plant and equipment climbed at a 7.4 percent pace, the fastest since the first quarter of 1989.
He acknowledged concern over oil prices, however, and said the Administration's best guess was that "the next quarter or two will probably be somewhat weaker" than the one that ended in September.
And a second Government report today showed continuing weakness in the housing industry, with sales of new homes dropping in September to their lowest level since the recession eight years ago.
Some private economists said they considered the third-quarter G.N.P. result as not just masking a downtrend but as overstating overall growth.
"It's misleadingly strong," said Gary Ciminero, chief economist for the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in Providence, R.I. He said he was puzzled, for example, at why business inventories during a time of slow sales were reported to have risen at a rate of only $7.8 billion compared with $9.5 billion in the second quarter.
He also said the inflation figures associated with the G.N.P. report appeared to be underestimated. The fixed-weight index, which measures prices of an unvarying basket of goods, edged up only to 4.1 percent from 3.9 percent in the second quarter despite the surge in oil prices.
Robert P. Parker, Associate Director for National Economics Accounts at the Commerce Department, explained that today's report was the natural result of a methodology in which the value of imported goods is adjusted to calculate the American gross national product.
If a barrel of oil, for example, is imported at $40 and sold for $45, the addition to G.N.P. would be only $5. It would not matter for purposes of the American price index that oil had been imported at $20 in the quarter before, since it is the margin, not the price, that governs changes.
The so-called implicit price deflator for the G.N.P., a gauge that captures both prices and the changing composition of demand, actually fell during the third quarter, to an annual rate of 3.4 percent from 4.7 percent.
 
 'Phony Strength'
 One analyst, H. Erich Heinemann of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, held that the methodology produces "illogical" results at times of big price gyration and said "the phony strength" in the third quarter -- one in which a half million jobs were lost -- implied additional weakness in the current one.
Another price index, one that covers what people and businesses in this country pay for both domestic and imported goods, rose at a 5 percent rate in the third quarter, compared with 2.9 percent in the second. Most of the acceleration, the Commerce Department said, represented petroleum products.
Real personal consumption climbed at a rate of $23.9 billion during the quarter, up from $1.5 billion in the second, with service expenditures accounting for more than 70 percent of the total.
Nonresidential fixed investment rose $9.2 billion, net exports fell $7.9 billion and Federal Government purchases eased $300 million, the report also showed.
Real final sales -- the sum of these expenditure components -- rose at a 2 percent rate after falling seven-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter.
Real disposable personal income fell six-tenths of 1 percent, in contrast to an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent in the spring.
G.N.P. expressed in current dollars rose 5.3 percent during the quarter, to a rate of $5.51 trillion. The 1.8 percent rise in G.N.P. in 1982 dollars was to $4.17 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate and represented the biggest gain since the 3.6 percent rate of increase in the first quarter of 1989. The third quarter of 1989 and first quarter of 1990 both posted gains of 1.7 percent.

HEADLINE: San Mateo Journal;
A Crusade to Save Unwanted Lives

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN MATEO, Calif., Oct. 29

 BODY:
The dog in her arms was shaking, its rheumy eyes wide with fear.
"Just relax, sweetheart, it's O.K.," crooned Chris Powell, the manager of the Peninsula Humane Society animal shelter, where 10,000 unwanted pets are put to death each year. 
 The dog settled into Ms. Powell's embrace, making it easier for a veterinarian to inject a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital.
In seconds, the dog was dead, carried to a refrigerated room and dumped in a trash can, atop a mound of puppies and kittens, all awaiting pickup by a rendering company that would turn the animals into fertilizer.
"There's not a day when you don't think about walking away from this misery," Ms. Powell said.
Tired of carrying out the daily killings, officials at the Humane Society here have proposed a novel solution to the pet overpopulation problem: a moratorium on breeding cats and dogs that will be considered by the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors at its Nov. 13 meeting.
The ordinance, thought to be the first of its kind in the nation and opposed by professional breeders, would fine animal owners who allow their pets to reproduce and prohibit transporting cats and dogs outside the county for that purpose. The requirements would be enforced by the same animal control officers who respond to complaints about unleashed or unlicensed dogs.
The law would be phased in over a three-year period. It would remain in effect until the county achieved "zero pet overpopulation" and the shelter was not killing any healthy animals.
The ordinance is sponsored by Supervisor Tom Nolan, who said he worried at first that he might be ridiculed. "You know," Mr. Nolan said, "the guy who did the have-sex-and-go-to-jail law."
Mr. Nolan said he had stood up for other animal protection measures, including a ban on fireworks that was motivated, in part, by the fact that his cat, Peggy, and many other pets went crazy each Independence Day. "The press dubbed that one the Peggy Nolan Relief Act," he said.
The Peninsula Humane Society has long been at the forefront of efforts to control the number of unwanted pets. In 1970, it opened one of the nation's first low-cost spaying and neutering clinics. In 1985, it led the fight for passage of a state law requiring that all animals adopted from shelters be spayed or neutered.
For a while, the number of unwanted pets seemed to be shrinking, but now "statistics are flat," said Kim Sturla, the director of the shelter. In each of the last 10 years, the shelter has taken in about 16,000 animals. Of those, 3,000 have been reunited with their owners, another 3,000 placed in adoptive homes and 10,000 put to death.
The killings are the "most abhorrent duty of our job," Ms. Sturla said.
The people who bring in unwanted animals are often ignorant of what goes on inside, Ms. Sturla said. But her employees, all of them animal lovers, cannot turn their heads.
For some, the most unpleasant job is picking the cats and dogs to be killed. For others, it is holding the animal and feeling the life ebb from its body. Administering the injection is not so bad, Ms. Sturla said, because "you concentrate on technique."
Until now, Ms. Sturla has built her anti-breeding education campaigns around dry statistics. She has told audiences that a single fertile cat's offspring can produce 420,715 kittens in just seven years. She has told them that 10 million domestic animals are destroyed each year in the United States.
But numbers did not do the trick, Ms. Sturla said, so now she is trying shock tactics.
Last week, the shelter bought advertising inserts in three local newspapers, and 178,000 families on the peninsula south of San Francisco looked at pictures of trash barrels full of dead cats along with their morning coffee.
Then, reporters and television crews were invited to witness what one newspaper called a "public execution" of four kittens, a cat and three dogs. One reporter cried, another began adoption proceedings and a third left the room because the dog being killed resembled one he once owned.
The shelter has received many "How dare you!" telephone calls, but Ms. Sturla said she was unrepentant.
"You have to see it to experience the immorality of it," she said. "We tried to tell the public with numbers, but it didn't work. It's time to take a 2-by-4 and hit them over the head."

HEADLINE: DISMAL FORECAST ISSUED BY CUOMO ON GAP IN BUDGET

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Providing further evidence of New York's economic slide, a report released by the Cuomo administration tonight shows the state spending $824 million more than it expects to take in for the current fiscal year.
The report, which offers the gloomiest assessment to date of the state's fiscal deterioriation, portends a new round of agonizing spending decisions for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the State Legislature, who have been grappling with near-chronic budget problems for more than two years. 
 It attributes the continuing erosion of the state's finances to a national recession, which, it says, "has already started" and "will continue through the middle of next year."
 
Grim Times Ahead
 Before today, the latest estimate of the state's budget gap was $246 million. That estimate referred only to the first six months of the fiscal year. Today's report represents an extension of the earlier estimate; it predicts how the state will fare through the entire fiscal year.
The report signals grim times ahead for New York City, which is struggling to close a widening budget gap of its own. The city relies heavily on state aid to pay for services ranging from foster care to education, and any cuts in state spending are likely to be keenly felt.
In releasing the report, the Governor's Budget Director announced that he was imposing an across-the-board freeze on state hiring and the letting of contracts. The freeze, the Budget Director, Dall W. Forsythe, said, should reduce the budget gap by $250 million.
 
Cuts in Spending
 This is the third year in a row that unanticipated fiscal problems have forced the Cuomo administration to impose spending cuts in the middle of the fiscal year, which starts in April.
Mr. Cuomo, who is up for re-election next week, presented no immediate plan for closing the remaining $574 million of the gap in the state's $50 billion budget. But he directed all state agencies to submit by next Friday plans for cuts totaling 3, 5 and 7 percent of their total budgets.
Such substantial cuts would require legislative approval. The Legislature is expected to return to Albany for a special session in December, but Cuomo administration officials suggested tonight that the state's budget problems were so severe that the Governor might call legislators back earlier.
Faced with midyear budget gaps in the past, Mr. Cuomo has frequently resorted to borrowing and to using one-time revenues, like reserve funds, to pay the state's bills. This evening, however, administration officials, who were stung last year when the state's credit rating dropped to its lowest level ever in response to such actions, vowed to avoid such fiscally risky moves.
 
'Goal Is No New Taxes'
 They also said the Governor planned to close the budget gap without new taxes. Mr. Cuomo approved a $1.4 billion tax increase just six months ago.
"The goal is no new taxes, no deficit notes," a spokesman for the Governor, Gary G. Fryer, said. "We're going to do this through cuts. It's not going to be painless."
But it remains to be seen whether the Legislature, which often rushes to protect agencies the Governor threatens to cut, will acquiesce to more than $500 million in spending cuts for the remaining five months of the fiscal year. Mr. Cuomo did not release his report until after 7 o'clock this evening, giving budget analysts in both houses of the Legislature no time to respond to it.
 
A Deadline Is Met
 The Governor was legally required to release today's report, the midyear financial update, by Oct. 30, but for several years he has failed to meet that deadline. Today, administration officials made much of the fact that the Governor had met the deadline, even though he was in the midst of a re-election campaign.
"We didn't wait until after the election, like everybody said we would," Mr. Fryer said.
Far from shrinking from the state's fiscal problems, Mr. Cuomo has practically made them a theme of his campaign in recent weeks, repeatedly pointing out that the state was in for tough times. Mr. Cuomo is even using a television commercial in which he tells voters that the state is facing serious fiscal problems, which, he adds, will require his leadership.
 
Unconventional Strategy
 The strategy is an unconventional one that suggests, many Albany officials say, that the state's fiscal problems are truly dire. According to most polls, the Governor is running far ahead of his challengers.
Estimates made in the spring had projected that the economy would pick up in the second half of the current fiscal year. But now it appears that the economy is moving in the opposite direction and that state tax collections, depressed by a sagging economy, will continue to fall in the months ahead.
Much of the projected gap is the result of declining personal income tax collections, which the Cuomo adminstration predicts will, by the end of the fiscal year, fall $460 million below last spring's estimates. User fees are expected to be $170 million less than anticipated, and sales taxes collections are expected to fall by $133 million. Other assorted taxes are also expected to fall short.
 
Criticism From Regan
 The sketchy plan outlined tonight by the Governor to close the projected gap was immediately attacked by some officials as reminiscent of other plans that have failed in the past.
The State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, a Republican who is in a tough re-election campaign, offered sharp criticism of the plan, saying the across-the-board cuts suggested by the Democratic Governor "have been tried before."
"They are temporary," he said, "do not achieve permanent spending restraint and undoubtedly penalize some agencies that shouldn't be cut."
Today's report suggests that the state's fiscal condition is likely to remain grave well into the next fiscal year. Mr. Cuomo has already hinted that layoffs next year are probable, and Mr. Regan has predicted a budget gap for next year of more than $2 billion.
"We can be sure," said Mr. Forsythe, the Budget Director, "that the recession will make a difficult situation worse."

HEADLINE: As City Shifted, News Lost Its Punch

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
It was punchy, it was sensational, it was the largest mass-market newspaper ever to hit the streets of an American city. And, say newspaper analysts, it might have been doomed. The rise of television and the rush to suburbia took away much of the working-class audience The Daily News had built with big, black headlines and daring photos that almost made reading the splashy tell-all stories unnecessary.
And that is why, decades later, rocks are shattering delivery-truck windows, reporters are anguishing over whether to cross picket lines and the paper's owners are enduring the excruciating tension of their big gamble. 
 The newspaper's slide from the good old days happened far sooner than most readers -- or newspaper executives -- realized. And it happened amid unprecedented prosperity -- the high-growth years after World War II. For the story of The Daily News since World War II has been a story of smaller and smaller numbers.
 
From No. 1 to No. 3
 The paper's Sunday circulation peaked in 1947 at 4.7 million copies, and a changing city left it with nowhere to go but down. The News, founded just after World War I and famed for a daily diet of sin, sex and sensationalism, declined through the postwar boom of the 1950's, and kept on sliding.
In 1976, The News printed one of the most memorable front-page headlines in municipal history -- "Ford to City: Drop Dead" -- but by then some analysts considered the paper's own future shakier than the city's. The 88-day newspaper strike in 1978 doubled its daily circulation losses, said John Morton, a newspaper analyst, and tripled the Sunday losses. After the strike, The News's circulation was nearly 350,000 below the pre-strike figure.
In 1990, The News could no longer claim the nation's largest weekday circulation. Preliminary figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulation showed that among metropolitan papers, The News fell to No. 2 for the six-month period ending in March. As the year went on, it fell to No. 3, trailing The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times in the six months ending Sept. 30. The News, which sold as many as two million copies a day as recently as 1974, dropped to 1,097,693 on weekdays after losing more than 96,000 readers.
 
Victim of Demograpic Changes
 Total newspaper readership has been declining, analysts say, but some maintain that the dent in The News was deeper than at other papers. "The Daily News fell victim to some fairly profound demographic changes that happened in every city in America," said Mr. Morton, of Lynch, Jones & Ryan, "but they affected the Daily News more than most."
Levittown, L.I., which pioneered the way for suburban homes that soldiers could call their own, opened in 1947, the year The News peaked. Soon farms were replaced by tract houses and the exodus began. Mr. Morton maintains that it was bad for The News. Large numbers of its readers left the city, he said, and switched to suburban newspapers like Newsday on Long Island.
"The Daily News didn't have the security of the top 20 to 25 percent of a market that reads the big metropolitan paper no matter where they live," Mr. Morton said, "because in New York, The New York Times had them. So The News suffered because they weren't able, even though they tried, to follow their readers out to the suburbs."
Other analysts said the paper's sheer size made it vulnerable.
"Because The News was by such a wide margin the biggest of the papers, it's been the biggest loser," said Dick Netzer, a professor of economics and public administration at the Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service at New York University. "It had a working-class kind of audience. It's not just The Post's sensationalism and scandal-mongering that chipped away at that. The audience below is not a newspaper audience anymore."
 
A Folksy Kind of Paper
 The Daily News was born in 1919 and soon ranked eighth in circulation among 18 newspapers in New York City, Mr. Isaacs said. In its second year, it rose to No. 2 behind William Randolph Hearst's Evening Journal. By 1925, The News was selling a million copies a day.
Mr. Isaacs said The News succeededbecause it tried to reach women who worked in shops and department stores. It ran serialized novels, horoscopes, even dress patterns. Four years after The News's debut, Hearst introduced The Daily Mirror, a tabloid. But to millions of readers The News was a quintessentially New York newspaper that was beyond imitation.
"In the 30's and 40's, it was the voice of New York because it was so clearly written, opinionated, controversial," said James Shenton, a professor of history at Columbia. "It kind of spoke with the language of the everyday folk and the constituency of immigration. In some ways the genius of the newspaper was it understood something: that these people could read declarative English."
Mr. Isaacs said he sees an irony in the tense drama that has been unfolding in recent years. He noted that Newsday, which has been battling The News and The New York Post for readers, was started by the daughter of the man who founded The Daily News.
 
In Search of a Market
 "So the legacy of the daughter of Joe Patterson is going to take over the ruins of what he begat because Newsday's going to inherit the earth, in my opinion, when both The Post and The Daily News are dead," Mr. Isaacs said. "The reason The Daily News will be dead is it doesn't know what its market is and hasn't for some years."
Some analysts say The News in the 70's had an only-in-New-York kind of split personality. Parts of the paper clung to old formulas, glorifying the police against robbers and hanging on to features like an etiquette column called "The Correct Thing." Other parts modernized their appearance and the way they viewed the city.
But by the 1980's, The News was losing money. The paper's owner, The Tribune Company of Chicago, tried to sell The News in 1982. After failing, there were several rounds of layoffs, but relations with the paper's unions remained cordial, at least on the surface. The decision to take a tougher, more confrontational tack with the unions did not come until later. It came from Charles T. Brumback, who took over as chief executive of the Tribune Company a year ago. He had won concessions in Chicago and felt that he could do the same in New York, the last tough union town for newspapers.

HEADLINE: Enterprise Zone For Louisville: Past the Limit?

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky.

 BODY:
To its boosters, this city's sprawling, 45-square-mile enterprise zone is a model for local economic development, attracting more than $1.2 billion in new business investment and creating 11,476 new jobs in seven years.
"It has given us opportunities not only in terms of creating jobs in our community, but also retaining jobs in our community," said Mayor Jerry E. Abramson of Louisville. 
 But to its critics, Louisville's zone is an example of a policy gone awry. They say that city officials, in the absence of Federal incentives, deviated from the intent of the program -- to revitalize decaying inner city neighborhoods -- by extending the zone to a wide area outside of Louisville that was too affluent to qualify on its own.
The concept of enterprise zones came into prominence in the Reagan Administration, which proposed as a means of spurring economic activity there that tax breaks be provided to businesses that open in distressed inner-city areas. But Congress never approved the necessary Federal tax incentives.
 
Federal Tax Plan Rejected
 This year a plan to provide $1 billion in tax incentives for an experimental national enterprise zone program was part of the budget agreement reached by White House and Congressional negotiators on Sept. 30. But Congress rejected that agreement, and the tax breaks for enterprise zones were deleted from the budget package the lawmakers eventually approved.
Nonetheless, without any financial incentives from Washington, 37 states have initiated their own programs, providing relief from certain state taxes as a lure for development.
Such was the case in 1983, when the Kentucky General Assembly established the Louisville Urban Enterprise Zone in a blighted 3.8-square-mile area west and south of the downtown business district.
In the beginning the program closely mirrored the concept envisioned in Federal legislation and succeeded, local officials say, in creating 1,757 new jobs and nearly $46 million in new investment by 1986.
In 1987 the zone was extended more than 13 miles into suburban Jefferson County in an effort to help a foundering county-owned industrial port complex on the Ohio River. Since the expansion, most of the new businesses and jobs in the enterprise zone have been outside the Louisville city limits.
Officials here assert that all low-income and unemployed residents in the city and the county, including those living in the original enterprise zone, benefit from the increased economic activity brought about by the tax breaks. Having lost 37,000 manufacturing jobs since 1974, city officials say the large enterprise zone is needed in the keen competition between cities for businesses and jobs.
But the officials can provide no independent evidence that the tax breaks have induced companies to make investments they would not have made anyway, or that the new jobs and the capital investment they boast of is little more than a function of the sheer size of the zone.
Moreover, of the jobs created by companies that received tax breaks, only about 1,300, or roughly 14 percent, have been filled by people who were unemployed or on welfare at the end of last year. The tax incentives were contingent on giving 25 percent of new jobs to those who were jobless, on welfare or living in the zone.
"This appears to be a subversion of the original idea behind enterprise zones, which is to physically revitalize distressed areas and help poor people," said Bret C. Birdsong, a former research associate at the Urban Institute, a public policy research center in Washington.
 
A Lack of Available Land
 Louisville officials say their program meets state guidelines and was intended to meet local needs, not some theoretician's idea of how an enterprise zone should be constructed. They also say the available land on which companies could build new plants was outside the original zone.
"We have to play the game that's available to us," sayd Ed Mallett, a planner for the Louisville-Jefferson County Office for Economic Development, who drew the boundaries for the expanded zone. "I'm not going to say we're going to play pretty, but if we don't do something to protect our economic base we are in danger of very serious decline."
Even promoters of the idea of enterprise zones say examples like Louisville's underscore the need for a national program to draw states back to their original goals.
Most state efforts have remained true to the original concept, and a number of recent studies have found that, when properly run, enterprise zones can contribute to the revitilization of decaying urban areas.
But some states, including Louisiana, Illinois and Kentucky, have strayed from the original notion.
Louisville's original zone qualified for the designation with an unemployment rate 1.5 times the national average and a decline in population.
Businesses moving into the zone were exempt from paying Kentucky's sales tax -- then 5 percent -- on the purchase of equipment and machinery if they agreed to give 25 percent of their jobs to people on welfare or unemployed for at least 90 days, or to residents of the zone.
 
Port and Industrial Complex
 Businesses already in the zone could also get the tax benefits if they increased capital investment on land, machinery, buildings or equipment by 20 percent or increased their work force by 20 percent.
At the same time, Jefferson County officials were trying without much success to attract companies to a planned 1,600-acre industrial and port complex called Riverport. "We had Riverport for a good many years, with little or no activity at all," said Edward L. Holloway, a former State Representative from Jefferson County.
County officials first considered having the state declare the area around Riverport another enterprise zone. When it was determined that the area was too affluent to meet the state's criteria, local planners came up with a gerrymandered zone whose boundaries were drawn to insure that the average rate of poverty and unemployment met the state requirements.
So far, the port and industrial park have produced 670 new jobs, but officials cannot say whether this was because of the designation as an enterprise zone.
Louisville officials agreed to the extension because city and county officials had arranged six months earlier to share a 2.2 percent occupational tax from new jobs created anywhere in Jefferson County. The agreement, known as the Louisville-Jefferson County Compact, was struck to forestall further efforts by the city to annex unincorporated areas of the county.
'I'm as interested in new businesses creating jobs in the county as I am with businesses creating jobs in the city," said Mr. Abramson, the Louisville Mayor. But none of the city's portion of the $2.5 million in occupational tax generated from the enterprise zone is specifically set aside for programs in the original zone.

HEADLINE: Here's a Twist: Gains Tax Is Rising

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Despite two years of struggle by President Bush and his top aides to cut the capital gains tax rate, the budget legislation passed by Congress on Saturday actually raises capital gains taxes for the country's wealthiest individuals.
Treasury Department officials acknowledge that some wealthy taxpayers will now have to pay a slightly higher capital gains tax, but said it was something that the Bush Administration had to accept to get an agreement on cutting the nation's budget deficit by $492 billion over the next five years. 
 "It's clear the President would not have chosen this method to address the budget situation," said Roger Bolton, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Public Affairs. "This was a compromise. And the President has appealed for more Republican Congressmen who will vote his way, so that he won't be forced to make such compromises and choices."
 
 30 Percent or Higher
 According to tax experts, many taxpayers with $200,000 or more in taxable income will find their capital gains tax rate rising from 28 percent now to 30 percent or higher -- even though the budget measure called for a cap on the capital gains rate of 28 percent. Tax advisers say those taxpayers affected should review their options and consider new strategies before the year's end. [Page D3.]
Two last-minute elements of the budget compromise will result in raising the capital gains rate on the wealthiest by as much as 10 percent, tax experts in Congress said. They are the limitation on deductions that taxpayers with adjusted gross income above $100,000 can take, and the phaseout of personal exemptions for single filers with income above $100,000 and joint filers with income greater than $150,000.
Essentially, the two provisions have the effect of disallowing otherwise valid deductions from taxable income, thereby giving the taxpayer a disguised higher marginal rate. And to the extent that the two provisions raise marginal tax rates, they also raise capital gains rates.
"Things were done in those last days that people simply had not carefully studied," said one top tax expert in Congress, who spoke on the basis of not being identified.
For the Bush Administration, a higher capital gains tax rate on the very wealthy -- a class of taxpayers the Administration had hoped to protect from increases -- represents an odd twist to the marathon budget negotiations between Congressional leaders and the White House that began more than five months ago.
President Bush had pledged during his election campaign that he would seek lower capital gains taxes, and until the last few weeks, the White House had continued to press for such tax cuts, asserting that they would stimulate the economy. While the impact of the change cannot yet be measured, there is little expectation that it will have any significant impact on the nation's economic growth.
Though the increase in the capital gains rate will affect a relatively small number of taxpayers, the impact on tax revenues is significant. In 1988, for example, taxpayers with incomes above $200,000 accounted for 62 percent of the total capital gains income reported to the Internal Revenue Service. Many experts said that, based on very rough estimates, they expected this high-income group to pay as much as an additional $3 billion over the next five years.
But whatever the impact on the Treasury, the changes in tax law represent a philosophical change in the treatment of capital gains. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 ended the distinction between capital gains and other income.
 
 A Different Treatment
 The new measure once again accords capital gains a different treatment from other income, albeit at a far narrower difference in rates than in the past.
The debate on capital gains tax rates was one of the few battles that clearly demonstrated the ideological divide between the Bush negotiators and the Democrats. As public and private rhetoric often became bitter, Democrats complained that the White House was trying to protect the rich. Republicans bristled and on several occasions negotiations almost came to a halt.
In the end, however, the Bush Administration swallowed a bitter pill, concluding that it was the most palatable available. By its adamant rejection of a 33 percent top tax rate and its insistence that the top marginal tax rate not be raised above 31 percent, the Administration made necessary the reduction in itemized deductions and the phasing out of exemptions. No other avenue was available to raise taxes on the wealthy.
"At least we resisted having the capital gains rate rise to 31 percent," said Assistant Treasury Secretary Bolton.
Some taxpayers, the Administration notes, will find that their capital gains rate is actually cut by the legislation. These are individuals in the "tax bubble," who now pay a 33 percent top rate on a portion of their income -- a couple filing jointly, for instance that has taxable income of roughly $78,400 to $185,670. They have also been paying about a 33 percent rate on capital gains and are likely to see those rates cut to 28 to 31 percent. To some extent, that cut could offset some of the higher capital gains taxes the wealthiest will be paying.
While the Bush Administration has said that it at least kept the capital gains tax rate lower than income tax rates, some say that the resulting hidden increase in rates might have come at too high a political price.
 
 Called a Pyrrhic Victory
 "Politically, in some respects it was a Pyrrhic victory," said Byrle M. Abbin, managing director of Arthur Andersen & Company's office of Federal tax service in Washington.
As to the economic impact of realigning the capital gains tax rates, Treasury officials are unsure as yet. "We're not prepared to say what the economic effects will be based on the amount of thought we've given to it," said Assistant Secretary Bolton. "At this point we just don't know."
He added that tax experts at the Treasury saw one "positive thing to offset the negative." He noted that for those taxpayers whose capital gains rate will be above 28 percent, a differential still exists between their top tax rate and their lower gains rate, and that could make capital gains more attractive than dividend income.
"This may encourage some people to take more risk with their money," Mr. Bolton said. "Instead of investing in a blue-chip stock that pays a large dividend, they may go for a more entrepreneurial company that could yield a big capital gain."
 
Capital Gains Taxes
 
Capital gains tax rates under deficit reduction legislation, for families of four. While a top tax rate of 28 percent is set for capital gains, other provision in the measure will raise that rate for many high-income taxpayers.

HEADLINE: G.M. Sets Plan to Idle 16 Plants

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Faced with wary buyers and an uncertain economy, the General Motors Corporation said today that it would cut production in the next two months, idling 16 car and truck assembly plants for up to four weeks. The move will result in the temporary layoffs of 43,500 hourly workers.
The nation's largest auto maker will cut 81,000 cars, or about 10 percent of what it had planned for the fourth quarter, and 73,000 light trucks and vans, equal to about 13 percent of its planned truck production, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter. 
 Industry analysts said G.M. was trying to control rapidly mounting inventories of its cars and trucks at dealerships, which are experiencing a drop in showroom visits.
 
 Hopes to Avoid Fire Sales
 By cutting output, analysts suggested, G.M. hopes to avoid a huge and costly selloff that would duplicate the fire sales held in late December and January, when inventories rose to unseasonably high levels.
But G.M.'s decision to cut production will lower revenues in the last three months of the year, leading some analysts to suggest that profits will suffer.
The 16 plants being idled are in North Tarrytown, N.Y.; Bowling Green, Ky.; Kansas City, Kan.; Van Nuys, Calif.; Oklahoma City; Ipsilanti, Mich.; Wentzville, Mo.; Wilmington, Del.; Lordstown, Ohio; two plants in Flint and one in Pontiac, Mich.; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Ste. Therese, Quebec, and Oshawa and Scarborough, Ontario.
 
 Ford and Chrysler Plans
 So far, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation appear to be sticking to their production plans, which were more conservative than G.M.'s. But analysts did not rule out the possibility of large cuts in output at Ford or Chrysler if the vehicle market deteriorates further.
"The private market for cars is significantly weaker than the sales numbers indicate," said Maryann N. Keller, an automotive analyst for Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney Inc. "Dealers have simply stopped ordering vehicles. They don't have the financial flexibility to carry 100 days' supply of cars like they used to."
Economists said the move would send a ripple through the automotive supply industry. Roughly three workers who make parts used in the G.M. factories will be laid off for every G.M. assembly worker, based on employment ratios used for Government estimates.
G.M. workers are covered by unemployment benefits that can provide up to 95 percent of an hourly worker's take-home pay, but coverage at suppliers is often far lower.
 
 No Comment From Union
 Officials of the United Automobile Workers could not be reached to comment on the layoffs.
Seven of the G.M. plants affected build pickup trucks, four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicles or vans. Sales of all three have fallen off sharply since August. Analysts say the lower gasoline mileage of light trucks and vans has made them vulnerable to higher gas prices. Indeed, unsold trucks have piled up faster than cars at G.M. dealerships.
"We expected the truck plant to shut down," said Sean McAlinden, a researcher in the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. "But we did not expect the car plants to go down."
 
 Unused Capacity Estimated
 Several of the plants are regarded by analysts as candidates for permanent closure. Some industry observers say G.M. can produce a million vehicles more than it can sell in the current market.
Analysts are speculating that G.M. will announce a large write-off Wednesday when it releases third-quarter earnings. The charge against earnings may range from $750 million to as much as $3 billion, analysts speculate, depending on how far G.M. decides to go in closing plants it cannot keep running at capacity.
Separately, G.M.'s three nonautomotive subsidiaries all reported improved financial results for the third quarter. General Motors Acceptance said its net profit rose 24.7 percent, while the increases at Electronic Data Systems and GM Hughes Electronics were somewhat smaller.
 
 GM Hughes Report
 The GM Hughes Corporation reported today that its third-quarter profit, including purchase accounting adjustments, had increased 7 percent, to $158.1 million, compared with profit of $147.8 million in the comparable period of last year. Revenues rose 13.6 percent, to $2.93 billion, from $2.58 billion. Profit attributable to G.M. Class H stock, which represents a right to share in the dividend of the G.M. unit, rose to 40 cents a share from 37.
GM Hughes said it had increased sales of weapons systems during the quarter, leading to higher production of torpedoes, missiles and night vision systems made for the Pentagon. A Hughes spokesman said increased weapons sales in the third quarter were not tied directly to the mobilization of United States military forces in the Persian Gulf.
Electronic Data Systems earned $128.4 million for the period ended Sept. 30, a gain of 15.8 percent, compared with profit of $110.9 million in the same quarter last year. Revenues rose 11.7 percent, to $1.53 billion from $1.37 billion. Profit attributable to G.M. Class E stock, which represents a right to share the dividends of the G.M. subsidiary, rose to 54 cents a share from 46.
 
 Profits at G.M.A.C.
 The General Motors Acceptance Corporation, G.M.'s finance subsidiary, reported that profits rose to $293 million, from $235 million in the period last year.
G.M.A.C. attributed the increase to lower borrowing costs in the United States and to higher income from international loans. But loans to buyers of new cars and trucks fell during the third quarter, compared with a year earlier. G.M.A.C. said it financed or leased 561,000 new cars and trucks in the United States during the three months ending Sept. 30, compared with 676,000 in the period last year.
"We finance the purchase of G.M. cars, and G.M. sales are down," a G.M.A.C. spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Among Striking Reporters, Doubts as a Dilemma Grows

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
On the fifth day of the strike against The Daily News, Michael Katz, a sportswriter who covers boxing, stood with the men and women picketing behind police barricades yesterday, but his mind kept wandering to the other side of the fence.
"I think the guild made a mistake," he said of his unit's decision to join eight other striking unions. He followed the Newspaper Guild out of loyalty, he said, but he brought his ambivalence with him. "Do I really believe that management will return to the negotiating table?" he said wearily. "Deep down, I don't." 
 Doubts and fears like those were what drew nearly 80 striking reporters to a playground near the paper's mid-Manhattan office yesterday to debate the strike decision and to vent some of the tensions within their 750-member unit. It was their second such soul-searching effort since the strike began on Thursday night.
Though the group decided to stay the course a little longer, other colleagues did not. A few hours earlier, more than a dozen Daily News photographers crossed the picket line and returned to work after hearing that management had brought in several permanent replacements.
 
Ambivalence and Gloom
 Mr. Katz did not speak for all his fellow guild members, most of whom have honored the strike order. But his ambivalence was widely shared, and it reflected a pessimism that has spread to even the pickets. Many of them spoke dolefully of their chances against management's intransigence, and of their chances of finding new jobs in an economically shaky city. Union leaders talk of victory, but most union members spoke of choosing between evils.
"If I go back, management owns me; if I stay out, I become another unemployment statistic in the city," said Hulric Messam, who began working at The Daily News 16 years ago as a receptionist and is now a librarian. As he stood on the picket line, Mr. Messam said he had little faith in guild leadership and doubted it could obtain concessions from the Chicago-based Tribune Company, which owns The Daily News. He said he thought The News would probably "fold" because of the strike and likened his situation to suicide. "I'm on the chair, with the rope around my neck," he said, "trying to decide whether or not to jump."
The Newspaper Guild, which also represents employees at The New York Times and The New York Post as well as at newspapers and print shops across the country, is not made up only of reporters and editors; clerical workers, advertising sales people and other white-collar employees are also members. Those who are striking The News, many of whom come from union families, expressed fewer qualms than reporters about the leadership's decision to call a strike, but some shared the reporters' sense of helplessness.
 
'I Believe in Loyalty'
 "I have very dim thoughts about this," said Aileen Dell, who until she joined the picket line had been a telephone room operator at The News for 17 years. "I was more optimistic in the 1978 strike," she added, referring to a three-month walkout by the guild and other unions. "I do believe the paper can go under this time, but I can't cross the picket line. I believe in loyalty, even if it means the demise of the paper."
Her gloominess contrasted with the brisk optimism of Richard Brendow, an executive vice president of the guild who has worked at the newspaper for 33 years. "For the last 70 years we've had strikes, and management had always allowed people to come back to work with dignity," Mr. Brendow said as he marched on the picket line. "Past practices should continue. There shouldn't be any difference -- if this is the same New York City."
Joel Siegel, the paper's transportation reporter, was adamant that times, and labor's clout, had changed. "We've all passed Eastern Airline strikers; they're all still there," he said. "I think we're caught in a larger force. Maybe we could prevail if this was 1970, but it's 1990."
Joel Benenson, the newspaper's Albany bureau chief, spoke of defending principles without much prospect for reward. "You have to measure victory differently," he said, "and for me, I've decided I don't want to be a party to union-bashing."
Andrew Kirtzman, a reporter who had covered City Hall, said he felt caught "between a rock and a hard place."
"If we stay out, it could be the death of The Daily News -- or unemployment," Mr. Kirtzman said.
 
Classic Dilemma
 Elizabeth Jensen, who covered the television industry for The News until the strike, said, "It's the classic definition of a dilemma -- choosing between two options, neither of which really seems right."
Many of the 80 reporters and writers who had gathered for the meeting, at Robert Moses Park, had hoped that the group would decide to return to work en masse. But what began, as one member put it, as a "soul searching" effort led to a group decision to stay on strike a little longer. "It turned into a unity rally," Stuart Ain, a reporter in the newspaper's Queens bureau, said with a trace of disappointment. "I'd like to go back to work, but I'm not going to go back unless it's with the group."
The meeting itself underlined certain strains within the guild. Reporters have repeatedly met among themselves to debate the strike decision, but the guild members who are not journalists have had no such meetings, and few have publicly questioned the guild's leadership. Rita Waterman, who has worked in advertising sales for 23 years, was one of the few non-journalist guild members to attend the conference, and she indignantly took the floor, chastizing the others.
"Reporters think they are an elite within our union, but they are not," she said later. "We're all tormented. I may not have a byline, but I'm still a person." She felt there was only one choice for guild members -- to strike.
For at least several who did return to work, the decision was painful. Bill Turnbull, a staff photographer who has worked at The News for 24 years, called his desk at 9 A.M. to report for work after receiving a call from a friend warning him that the newspaper had already hired replacement photographers. "If the paper shuts down, I'm out of work," he said. "If I stay out on the street, I'm out of work. This was my least undesirable option."
Mr. Turnbull said he was relieved at having at last come to a decision, but added that he had one regret. "I wish," he said, "that I could go to bed, wake up, and find out that the past few days were all a terrible joke, a bad dream."

HEADLINE: POOR FAMILIES GAIN UNDER TAX ACCORD

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The budget agreement produced after months of bitter dispute did not exactly rob from the rich, but it did give to the poor, through both tax cuts and program expansions. In fact, it made the poor the only income class in America predicted to have more money and services with the deficit-reduction package than they would have had without it.
But the plan does not treat all poor people alike. The biggest winners are working poor families with children, who will benefit from substantial increases in the cash rebates provided by various tax credits. 
 Beyond tax policy, the plan provides money for new child care programs and a major expansion of Medicaid, both of which will benefit the working poor the most. In addition, the plan provides some new health benefits to the elderly poor. And other pieces of recent legislation, like the expansion of the Head Start program, provide good news for all poor families with children.
The plan also increases taxes on alcohol, tobacco and gasoline, but the rebates to working poor families with children will usually more than compensate them for those increases. Other types of poor people, including welfare recipients who do not work, individuals without children, and the elderly, are likely to lose ground under the budget agreement, through higher excise taxes.
 
Political Perspective
 How significant is the package in terms of antipoverty policy? The answer varies widely with one's political perspective.
"Conservatives on the Hill think that this is the initiation of major new spending programs for the poor, whereas liberals see them as only modest gains in programs that are still underfunded," said Doug Besharov, an analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. "Personally, I think when the dust settles people will agree: This was a very good year for poor people."
Most analysts agree that the budget plan will do little to shorten the gap between rich and poor that grew increasingly large throughout the 1980's. That gap was largely the result of changes in pretax income in which the rich saw their income soar while the poor saw their's stagnate or drop.
But the new budget plan does partly reverse the tax policies that, by cutting taxes on the rich while increasing them on the poor, had further increased the gap. "At least the government is no longer a co-conspirator in producing greater inequality," said Isabel Sawhill, an economist at the Urban Institute.
 
Significant Contributions
 One of the most significant questions about the budget agreement is the extent to which it advances what has become a bipartisan goal: to make work a more rewarding option for poor people.
The early consensus is that the plan makes significant contributions in this area, in two ways. Expanded tax credits place more cash in the hands of the working poor, providing, in effect, an increased wage subsidy. And expanded child care and Medicaid programs will help reduce the additional expenses that poor people often incur when leaving welfare for the world of work.
The budget agreement will gradually expand Medicaid so that it will cover all children who fall below the poverty line. Current law provides the health insurance mostly to families on welfare, creating a incentive for many not to work.
 
Big Gain for Working Poor
 While for many working poor families, the changes will still not be enough to lift them above the poverty line, most analysts agree they are a major move in that direction. "The working poor were made better off by this agreement than by any other piece of legislation passed in the 1980's," said an economist with the House Ways and Means Committee.
The earned income tax credit, which now provides a 14-cent a dollar rebate on the first $6,810, will be expanded next year to 16.7 cents for families with one child and 17.3 cents for families with two or more children.
The rebate stays steady for families who earn from $6,810 to $10,730 and begins to decline after that, phasing out for families that earn more than $20,262. Those brackets are adjusted each year for inflation.
In other words, the maximum rebate, which is now $953, will rise to $1,137 for families with one child and $1,178 for families with two or more. By 1994, the rate will rise to 23 cents and 25 cents respectively, or an increase to $1,566 and $1,702.
In addition, the budget agreement provides two other tax credits, a 6-cent-a-dollar credit for the first $6,810 earned for families that buy health insurance and a 5-cent credit on the same amount for those with infants less than a year old. Taken together, these tax credits could provide an additional $749 a year.
All together, by 1994, the maximum tax credit provided to a family of working poor would rise to $2,451 from $953, an increase of 250 percent. But only a small proportion would receive the maximum. Most families receive their rebates when they file their tax returns.
 
Some Gains to Be Lost
 But some of this gain will be lost as the poor, like everyone else, pay more in taxes on alcohol, gasoline and tobacco.
"For some working families, the combined changes are significant," said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group. He said the changes reflect the "growing understanding that there is a large working poor population in America and we need to do more for them."
Under the budget plan, however, other poor families will not fare as well. The budget office estimates that the poorest one-fifth of American families, on the average, pay $60 a year more in taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline. For working families with children, that increase will be more than offset by an average gain of $171 in tax credits, but for them only.
Others will lose slightly. Families in the poorest one-fifth headed by an elderly person, for instance, are expected to wind up with $36 a year less in net income, according to the budget office.

HEADLINE: Congress Changes Spending Rules On Secret Programs for Pentagon

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
When Congress passed the 1991 military spending bill last week, it imposed little-noticed but significant new restrictions on the President's power to spend billions of dollars on classified programs.
While public attention focused on spending for "Star Wars" and the B-2 bomber, legislators and Administration officials were struggling over a section of the bill requiring the Administration to use money earmarked for secret programs precisely as Congress prescribes. 
 At stake is control over a "black budget" of more than $35 billion hidden in the miliary spending bill for numerous secret weapons programs and intelligence activities.
 
Under Vague Headings
 To provide money for such programs while keeping the amounts secret, Congress every year buries the funds in the military budget, under vague headings like "Special Programs" and "Production Charges." Outsiders who have scrutinized the Air Force budget, for example, say more than $3 billion is hidden away for the National Reconnaissance Office, which is responsible for developing, launching and controlling spy satellites.
In the past, Congress has attached classified reports to military appropriations saying how this secret money should be spent. But the Administration has treated the instructions in these classified "annexes" as mere expressions of Congressional wishes rather than actual law.
But now, after a year marked by several disputes over the Administration's refusal to comply with secret directives from Congressional committees, Congress has given the classified annexes the force of law.
This year, lawmakers say, the Defense Department refused to spend millions of dollars appropriated by Congress for strategic communications and reconnaissance programs, and flouted Congressional instructions on the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. The Central Intelligence Agency challenged Congressional restrictions on spending for certain covert foreign operations.
Mr. Bush, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and at least one Air Force general told Congress they were not required to comply with such directives because the restrictions were not in the statute itself and therefore did not have the force of law.
Last week, just before it adjourned, Congress adopted restrictions on use of Federal money for clandestine military and intelligence programs, and it said the restrictions "shall have the force and effect of law." When the bill is signed by President Bush, the restrictions will be legally binding on Federal employees, and Congress can monitor compliance through committees that oversee the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies.
 
Pentagon Is Not Pleased
 The Pentagon is not happy with this new arrangement. In a letter on Oct. 18, Terrence O'Donnell, general counsel of the Defense Department, complained that Congress was enacting "secret law without debate, comment and consultation." On Oct. 12 the Administration said it could not comment on the substance of the classified annex because it was not allowed to see it.
Senator Robert C. Byrd, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said the restrictions were incorporated into the spending bill this year, for the first time, to insure that the will of Congress would be obeyed when the Administration spent "tens of billions of dollars" for foreign intelligence and military programs.
The Administration "ignored or challenged" such restrictions when they were in reports, said Mr. Byrd, a zealous defender of Congressional prerogatives. Lawmakers say that when the Administration disregards Congress's wishes, it typically postpones decisions on how to spend the money, then redirects spending to other secret programs.
 
'Blank Check' for 'Black Budget'
 A new book on the Government's secret spending, "Blank Check: The Pentagon's Black Budget," by Tim Weiner (Warner Books), says the classified budget for weapons and foreign intelligence came to $36 billion in 1989. That is more than the current budget of the Department of Transportation, Education, Labor or Veterans Affairs.
Senator Daniel K. Inouye, the Hawaii Democrat who is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee responsible for the Pentagon budget, said the decision to incorporate the classified annex into a law was very important because it would now be binding on military and intelligence agencies.
Moreover, he said, "it is a significant departure from the way we have in the past conveyed Congressional direction with respect to classified intelligence programs and the so-called black or special-access procurement programs."
Senator Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat, said "fundamental constitutional and institutional questions" were at stake: "In particular, will the checks and balances as they now are in place between the two branches have equal relevance and force in relation to the highly classified agencies, budgets and programs that have grown in the last several decades?"
The new statutory restrictions are another chapter in the annals of secret law, which date to 1811, when President James Madison covertly signed two bills giving him money and authority to seize Florida from Spain. The laws were not published until 1818.
 
The Battle Over Secret Law
 When Mr. Bush signed the 1990 military appropriations bill on Nov. 21, 1989, he expressed concern about restrictions that Congress tried to impose through a classified report on the bill. "Congress cannot create legal obligations through report language,"he insisted.
Lawmakers defended their decision to write secret law, saying it was less dangerous than allowing the executive branch to disregard directions from Congress on the spending of billions of dollars.
 
An 'Abdication of Authority'
 Senator Byrd compared the situation to the long-running feud between Congress and the executive branch over the line-item veto, the authority to reject a single item in a bill. Under the Constitution, the President has no such power; he must accept or reject the entire bill, which may regulate spending in hundreds of diverse accounts.
To let the President disregard classified annexes, Mr. Byrd said, would be to give him "a de facto line-item veto" over "the entirety of the intelligence programs and special-access programs in the United States."
"This would constitute a sweeping abdication of authority of the Congress in areas which are central and critical to the national security," the Senator added.

HEADLINE: 20 Die in India as Hindus Storm Disputed Mosque

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AYODHYA, India, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Thousands of police officers and paramilitary troops armed with tear gas, riot sticks and guns fought off determined bands of Hindu militants today who stormed this holy city and tried to take over a disputed mosque after raising a saffron-colored flag.
Early reports said at least 20 people were killed nationwide, 11 of them in Ayodhya, a town 300 miles southeast of New Delhi. 
 The militants in Ayodhya want to build a Hindu temple on the site of the mosque, where they say one of their gods, Rama, was born. This morning, specifically 9:44 to 11:48 A.M., was deemed an astrologically auspicious time to begin work.
At the end of the day, the 16th-century mosque was damaged but intact and in Government hands. But reports of the violent confrontation provoked angry protests across Uttar Pradesh, where Ayodhya is situated, and in other Indian states.
The dispute over the site has posed serious problems for the Government of Prime Minister V. P. Singh, which has been threatened recently by a series of crises including the loss of its parliamentary majority in connection with the temple dispute. The Prime Minister has said he will stop the campaign to build the temple.
Muslims make up around 12 percent of India's 840 million people. Hindus represent about 82 percent of the population in India, which is constitutionally a secular nation.
Six of those killed today died in the area of the mosque when troops fired on them, and scores have been wounded. Tens of thousands have been arrested in connection with the Ayodhya temple incident, including many today. Buses were ferrying many militants out of the area as soon as they were captured in Ayodhya. But as fast as young men were rounded up -- all of the protesting militants were men -- new faces swathed in water-soaked scarves to ward off the tear gas surged into the narrow streets of this ancient town on by the Sarayan River on the Gangetic plain.
Paramilitary troops were unable to stop protesters, many with political grievances, from entering Ayodhya, although all the roads are blocked.
"The human wave you have seen coming in, isn't that expression enough of our determination?" asked Chandran Bhushan Upadhyay, a retired army officer. "This issue will not die down."
 
Many Sympathetic Policemen
 Mr. Upadhyay said that many of the policemen and paramilitary troops on duty were sympathetic to the Hindu militants, an assertion repeated by many others. He also said that if the army was called out, there would be troops who would refuse to shoot fellow Hindus over this issue. The volatile situation is considered extremely dangerous in at least four Indian states: Bihar, Rajasthan and Gujarat, as well as Uttar Pradesh, whose capital, Lucknow, 70 miles from here, has been placed under curfew.
Today, the Hindus set fire to half a dozen police jeeps and a Government bus in the holy city. They also stoned cars and smashed the windows of many vehicles, leaving a trail of glass for miles around Ayodhya.
Prime Minister Singh and the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, are staking their political lives on what they see as a defense of secular India in the face of Hindu militants' claims that religious minorities get too many privileges.
"This is the biggest challenge we have faced since the independence of the country." the Prime Minister said on Government television tonight.
 
Confidence Vote on Nov. 7
 In a letter to the leadership of his Janata Dal Party today, Mr. Singh offered to resign if the party felt "that change of leadership will serve larger goals." Mr. Singh, who has offered to resign before, faces a vote of confidence on Nov. 7. The Hindu-based Bharatiya Janata Party, whose leaders have been at the forefront of the temple campaign, withdrew its support from the Singh Government last week, leaving him without a majority in Parliament.
Mr. Yadav said Monday evening: "My Government cannot allow the extinction of the Indian Constitution on the banks of the river Sarayan."
Critics of Mr. Singh and Mr. Yadav, who were thick on the ground in Ayodhya today, accused the Prime Minister of pandering to the Muslim vote.
Reporters in the middle of a Hindu crowd found an odd mixture of attitudes among the militants who raised the flag of saffron, a color with religious significance for Hindus. Some members of the crowd are pious devotees, including thousands of holy men called sadhus, who see this as a religious crusade. Middle-class lay people seem to find a sense of unity and self-identity in the Hindu cause.
 
Anger at Authority
 Others are young men from this and other densely overpopulated parts of India who seem to be venting their pent-up anger at authority in general.
Rama Shankar Singh, an ex-student from Bombay, was in an unruly mob of people who stopped and surrounded a reporter's car on a desolate stretch of the road from Lucknow to Ayodhya this morning. Discovering that they had cornered a journalist, Mr. Singh asked only for time to list his problems: unemployment was first.
Then he mentioned that he had not eaten for three days, as he and his fellow militants had been evading police to get to Ayodhya. He was led away by the police soon after, vowing to come back to "break the mosque."
The economy of Uttar Pradesh has been badly affected by the turmoil, which began a week ago with the introduction of curfews and the blockading of roads to prevent a large crowd from building up in Ayodhya. Uttar Pradesh, with 120 million people, is India's most populous state. It is also one of the most disadvantaged, with a large majority of its people illiterate and very poor.
People in Lucknow, Ayodhya and villages along the way, where businesses are shuttered, said that some shops had been closed for five or six days and food was running out. The poorest suffer most, because daily wage-earners cannot buy supplies for long periods.

HEADLINE: Bush Trying A New Topic;
Is Talk of War Driven By Policy or Politics?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
With the Republican Party's candidates thrown on the defensive by talk of recession and taxes, the Bush Administration moved this week to put a different subject on the top of the agenda by talking about war in the Persian Gulf.
 On the campaign trail, President Bush continued today to denounce Democrats for their stranglehold on Congress and what he depicted as their love affair with taxes. But at the White House, the talk was of the mistreatment of the American hostages in Kuwait and Iraq and the rising concern that force would be needed in the Persian Gulf. 
 While the campaign statements were obviously political, it was the Iraq statements that had the larger political ramifications. That was shown by the television news programs tonight, which focused far more on news of the gulf than on the attacks on Democrats.
Not everyone was buying the White House line that national security, rather than domestic politics, was the reason for President Bush's tough tone in a meeting today with members of Congress and Secretary of State James A Baker 3d's saber-rattling speech from California on Monday.
Many Republicans said the President's effort to shift the blame for the budget debacle to Democrats was not believable to most voters. But there was general agreement that Republicans could benefit if the practical effect of the Administration's talk of war was to shift attention from the budget and taxes, which have proven disastrous terrain for Mr. Bush, to foreign policy, the favored political turf of most Presidents, including this one.
 
'Dip in Attention'
 "I think America should be focused on what's going on in the gulf," Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said this morning in a kind of non-denial to questions about whether his boss was manipulating the agenda of the campaign. "In many ways it's too bad we had that dip in attention during those two or three weeks."
Those two or three weeks were the period when the Congress and the White House were caught in a political death struggle over the budget -- a period when President Bush's popularity ratings plunged and Republicans watched their hopes evaporate for gains in this midterm election.
That was the most dramatic period in what politicians describe as one of the most volatile midterm election cycles in memory -- a year in which the poltical agenda began with talk of abortion as an overwhelming issue, drifted toward economic concerns, then was frozen by the Iraq confrontation before turning sharply in the last month toward fear of recession and disgust with lawmakers' handling of the budget.
 
The Undecided Vote
 Political consultants say an unusually large number of voters for this late in the campaign remain undecided in many races around the country and form a large enough group to swing the outcome either way. So, a last-minute effort to shift public attention could have some impact.
The Administration was not without substantive policy explanations for its effort to turn discussion back to the gulf. Officials argued that declining attention will weaken support at home for the gulf commitment -- indeed, polls show it has already weakened it -- and encourage Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, to believe he can hold out against the world alliance.
"There is a lot of political hype in this," Richard A. Viguerie, a conservative critic of Mr. Bush, said of the war talk from the Administration. "It serves a useful political purpose to change the subject and have the country and the press talking about something other than his flips and his drops in the polls."
It is clear that when the American public was focused on the gulf confrontation Mr. Bush's ratings went up in the polls. When that focus shifted back to the economy and the struggle over the budget, his ratings went down, and he took other Republicans down with him.
"At best, there's an extraordinary coincidence that they are turning to this just as things go bad in the Congressional elections," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic poll taker.
Whether intended politically, the stepped-up oratory on Iraq coincides with a flat-out effort by the President and the Republican Party to save several Republican incumbents, including Senator Jesse Helms in North Carolina and Governor Bob Martinez in Florida, and to try to make the best of an electoral situation that has turned sour.
 
Attacks on Democrats Continue
 Mr. Bush tried to rally Republican Party workers here in Washington today with a Democrat-bashing speech. "More Republicans in Congress means more men and women fighting against raising taxes and against big spenders," Mr. Bush said.
Charles Black, the White House political adviser who organized Mr. Bush's rally, said he would be happy to have the news media focus from now to Election Day on Mr. Bush's domestic attacks on Democrats.
But Mr. Black conceded, "I'm not saying it's negative to have the Persian Gulf in the news."
Comments from both Democrats and conservatives within the Republican Party about Mr. Bush's motives dripped with sarcasm.
"It would be the height of callousness to suggest the Bush Administration would go to war to save a handful of Congressional seats," said Brent Bozell, a conservative political organizer. "However, I don't think it is callous to say he is doing anything he can to shift attention away from the debacle in Washington. Bush and his advisers welcome the opportunity to talk about something besides the mess in Washington that they've created."

New Bid for Neiman Marcus Stock

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: CHESTNUT HILL, Mass., Oct. 30

 BODY:
The General Cinema Corporation, one of the nation's largest operators of movie theaters, offered today to buy the shares of the prestigious retailer Neiman Marcus that it does not already own for $240 million in cash.
General Cinema, which is based in Chestnut Hill, now owns about 60 percent of Neiman Marcus Group Inc., but controls only 44 percent of the voting stock. It said it would buy the rest of the publicly held shares in a tender offer for $14.40 a share. 
 Several industry analysts described the offer as fair, in light of the retailer's lackluster earnings and the industry's sluggishness, but investors pushed shares of Neiman Marcus up $3.375 today, beyond the offer price, to $14.625 each, in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock rise shows "people think it's a low bid," one arbitrager said. "They're buying it dirt cheap," said Louis Ehrenkrantz, research coordinator at Ladenburg Thalmann & Company.
The New York investor Mario Gabelli owns about 12 percent of the shares of Neiman Marcus. He was not immediately available for comment.
General Cinema operates about 1,490 movie screens in the United States. It plans to use cash from recent asset sales to pay for the acquisition of the rest of Neiman Marcus.
The specialty retailer operates 24 stores in eight states under the Neiman Marcus name and 241 Contempo Casual woman's clothing stores in 31 states. It also owns the prestigious Bergdorf Goodman stores in New York. Its popular Christmas catalogue is known for its unusual and extravagant gifts.
While the retail sector has been sluggish, Neiman Marcus is expected to prove somewhat resistant to the economic slowdown because it caters to wealthy clients.
The theater operator sold its soft drink bottling business in March 1989 to Pepsico Inc. for about $1.7 billion and earlier this month sold an interest in Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C. for $500 million. It will finance the Neiman Marcus purchase from cash on hand, which totals about $1.5 billion.
General Cinema said the tender offer and merger to follow would be worth about $240 million. General Cinema's stock rose 25 cents today, to $19.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
General Cinema acquired its current stake in Neiman Marcus in 1987, when the specialty retailer was spun off from Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.

HEADLINE: THE CREDIT MARKETS;
2-Year Treasury Notes Sell Well

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A successful auction of new two-year Treasury notes helped to reverse a modest early slide in the credit markets yesterday, enabling prices of most Treasury securities to post slight gains. Trading was generally sluggish.
Demand for the new notes, which were sold at an average yield of 7.84 percent, was large. More than $42.8 billion worth of bids were submitted for the $12 billion worth of securities that were sold. At the last two-year Treasury-note auction, on Sept. 25, the securities were sold at an average yield of 8.18 percent. 
 Traders said a number of factors contributed to the strong demand. They cited, in particular, a conviction among market participants that the Federal Reserve Board would follow its move Monday to lower interest rates with another easing before the end of the year.
Moreover, dealers noted that a backup in yields on two-year securities before the auction guaranteed that the new issue would sell at a yield that would be attractively higher than the new target of 7 3/4 percent for overnight loans between banks established by the Fed on Monday.

 Demand for the securities remained strong after the auction, and by late yesterday the notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.79 percent, well below their auction level.
The auction results helped to reverse what had been an early price slide partly caused by a report on third-quarter economic growth that was stronger than anticipated.
According to a preliminary estimate from the Commerce Department, the economy expanded at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 1.8 percent in the third quarter. Most economists had expected the number to be closer to 1 percent.
"The number was a surprise for the market, but if you look at these data over a longer period of time than merely comparing them to the second quarter, the numbers are pretty weak," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm.
 
 Analysis of Figures
 Based on the new third-quarter figures, Mr. Stone said that over the last 12 months, three quarters of the economy's growth was due to expansion in medical services and state and local government activity.
"In the long run, you can't base an economy on schools and hospitals," he said. "I think the Fed has been remiss in not easing policy enough."
For the most part, however, traders regarded the report as old news.
"The employment number this Friday is a lot more current than the G.N.P. report," one government-bond trader said.
As Mr. Stone suggested, the Fed's decision to lower its target for the overnight rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market by a slim quarter of a percentage point is not likely to provide much stimulus for the economy. In large measure, that is because the cut was not large enough to prompt a slide in other borrowing rates, like the prime lending rate charged by commercial banks or rates on fixed-rate mortgages.
 
 Pressure on Banks
 Banks have been under severe financial pressure for much of the year and are unlikely to pare the spread between their lending rates and what it costs them to borrow money until the Federal funds rate falls further, analysts said. As long as the prime rate remains at its current 10 percent level, rates that are based on the prime, like home equity loans, are also unlikely to change much.
Since most fixed-rate mortgages carry maturities of 15 or 30 years, movements in those interest rates are more sensitive to what happens to bond yields than to incremental changes in Fed policy.
Even though the economy is clearly slowing and may be falling into recession, bond yields are not likely to fall much from current levels, analysts said.
"Even as the economy slips into recession, the bond market will have difficulty maintaining momentum toward lower levels of interest rates," said Alan Levenson, director of United States financial services at WEFA Inc., an economic consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
 
Inflation Fears
 Mr. Levenson said that inflation fears and a deluge of new long-term Treasury issues are likely to prevent rates from falling by much.
"At the depth of what we see as a mild recession, I don't see bond yields falling below 8.25 percent," he said.
Bond yields dipped yesterday, but not by much. In late trading, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 99 10/32, up 1/8 of a point, to yield 8.81 percent. Late Monday, the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.83 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 15/32, up 2/32, to yield 8.67 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 30/32, up 1/32, to yield 8.25 percent.
Short-term Treasury bills were little changed. By late yesterday, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.11 percent, down one basis point, or hundreth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged, at a late offered rate of 7.12 percent.
 
 Georgia Offers Bonds
 In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the state of Georgia offered $96 million worth of bonds at competitive bid. A bid from a investor group led by Dean Witter Reynolds won the issue, which consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1991 to 2010.
Yields on the securities range from 5.70 percent in 1991 to 7.05 percent in 2010. The securities are rated AAA by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and AA+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt securities, dealers said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by 1/8 of a point to 1/4 of a point.
Traders in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues were unchanged in light trading.

Ford Reports 78.7% Decline In Earnings

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 30

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company turned in its worst quarterly performance since the 1982 recession, it said yesterday, a 78.7 percent drop in third-quarter profit caused by weak automotive business and by a $44.6 million loss at First Nationwide, its savings and loan subsidiary.
Ford's worldwide automotive business was hit by a variety of problems: costly incentives in the United States, production losses in Europe and anti-inflation measures in South America. 
 "It's one thing after another," said David McCammon, vice president of finance and treasurer. He said the economic outlook would mean "we probably will face difficult conditions for some time."
Harold A. (Red) Poling, Ford's chairman, said, "Our worldwide automotive results reflected the economic weakness in many of Ford's key markets and the costs to develop new products in an extremely competitive environment." He added that the company's financial services group, which includes First Nationwide, "continued to be reasonably profitable."
Ford's results disappointed Wall Street, which had been expecting a decline, but not such a steep one. Ford's share price fell $2 today, to $27.625. The No. 2 auto maker earned $101.7 million, or 22 cents a share, compared with $477.1 million, or $1.03 a share, in the period last year. Revenues rose 13.6 percent, to $22.99 billion, from $20.24 billion.
"I can't find the bright spot anywhere," said Charles Brady of Oppenheimer & Company. "Ford got hit a little bit from every direction."
Ford's United States automotive operations earned $50 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $37 million in the period last year, but the latest results included a $67 million gain from an accounting change because of the extension of the useful life of some machines. Although North American factory sales were slightly higher than a year ago, Ford was obliged to spend about $1,000 a vehicle in customer incentives to maintain retail sales, compared with $800 last year.
Ford's worldwide automotive business lost $89 million, compared with a $324 million profit a year ago. Measures by governments in Brazil and Argentina for fighting inflation, including wage and price freezes, depressed profits in those countries. Moreover, Ford experienced high costs and labor unrest during the introduction of its new Escort model in Britain. Overseas car and truck production was off 4.4 percent, to 470,747.
Mr. McCammon said that he was not sure when conditions would improve in South America, but that "Europe will get better next year."
 
 First Nationwide Problems
 The problems at First Nationwide had been expected, after days of speculation by analysts about what Federal regulators had found while examining its books. Mr. McCammon called the examination routine but acknowledged that it was the first time the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, whose standards are stricter than those of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, had scrutinized the company.
Ford bought First Nationwide in late 1985 for $493 million as part of its diversification strategy. Despite the problems, "the strategy is sound," Mr. McCammon said.
First Nationwide said it added $115 million to loan-loss reserves, which lowered its net profit by $69 million, resulting in a net loss of $44.6 million, compared with a profit of $36.4 million in the period last year. It cited increasing delinquencies in residential and commercial loans, mainly in metropolitan New York, but also in the Southeast and in California.
 
 Two Unresolved Issues
 A statement from First Nationwide said two "issues that could adversely affect the bank's earnings and regulatory capital" remained unresolved as a result of the regulators' examination: the valuation of the company's mortgage securities and "contractually related intangibles resulting from F.S.L.I.C.-assisted acquisitions in 1986-87." A spokesman from First Nationwide was not immediately available for comment.
Meanwhile, the savings and loan unit disclosed that Ford would give it $250 million of capital in November "to strengthen the capital base of First Nationwide Bank."
Overall, Ford's financial services group, which includes Ford Motor Credit vehicle financing and the Associates finance company, earned $140.5 million in the quarter, down from $189.8 million a year ago. Ford Motor Credit earned $159.3 million, a 30.4 percent increase from last year. The unit announced that the higher profit was due to lower credit losses and improved interest margins.
Ford continues to work to keep costs down, Mr. McCammon said, but clearly the tough financial conditions are taking their toll on worker compensation. "I told my wife not to plan on a bonus this year," he said. He also disclosed that profit-sharing payments to hourly workers were unlikely.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Struggles With Fiscal Balancing Act

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
New York City's fiscal troubles have pitted the groups that backed Mayor David N. Dinkins, and whose agendas for change cost money, against the financial establishment that looked askance at him. The troubles have made it both necessary and impossible for the Mayor to choose between the two.
 In one sense, it is a false conflict, for Mr. Dinkins has said many times that fiscal stability was his top priority. He made a series of difficult decisions through the spring and summer -- delaying the hiring of police officers and cutting services -- to keep that pledge. 
 Such opposing claims have tugged at Mr. Dinkins for years, whether expressed by critics too concerned about his race and his liberalism to see that an ostensible outsider was really a consummate insider, or by populist supporters skeptical of both hiscaution and his comfort in the corridors of wealth and power.
But now a stagnant economy has dimmed the lights in those corridors just as Mr. Dinkins arrived as the boss. And the conflicts have been real enough to stymie him, to exaggerate stresses within his own staff and to test severely the effectiveness of the conciliatory style that helped elect him and that he has largely failed to make work since.
"The way the economy is driven in our society allows for an uneven playing field," said Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, Mr. Dinkins's chief political aide. "We need thefinancial community to support the city's revenue needs so we can take care of some of the difficult problems the city faces. This is a difficult balancing act."
Or as First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel put it, "You can't govern if there are groups that feel disadvantaged."
 
Spreading the Pain
 Mr. Dinkins has pledged to spread the pain of fiscal cutbacks as evenly as possible. But the problem, his aides acknowledge, is that those who feel most disadvantaged or disaffected to begin with will probably feel most hurt if the pain is spread evenly.
On the other hand, should Mr. Dinkins ever fail to keep the budget balanced, as required by law in a city that skirted bankruptcy 15 years ago, the State Financial Control Board could step in to exact Draconian cuts over which he would have less control. The Mayor is one member of the board, whose other members are the Governor, the State and City Comptrollers and three representatives of the business world.
So far, the Mayor's biggest problem has been persuading either side, though he has raised doubts and anger in both.
When Mr. Dinkins was running for office last year, his opponents complained that he would give away the store to his supporters in organized labor. He replied calmly that because he had credibility with his friends, they would believe him when he said the cupboard was bare.
 
A Widely Criticized Raise
 Now, after agreeing to a 5.5 percent raise for teachers that was widely criticized as too generous but that he defended as fair and necessary to guide the youth of tomorrow, Mr. Dinkins finds talks with two other powerful city unions at a standstill, mostly because they do not believe him when he warns of growing budget gaps and huge layoffs.
At the same time, he and his aides have angered the head of the teachers union, Sandra Feldman, by hinting that she might wish to renegotiate her union's contract in the name of fiscal probity. And he has seen acknowledged disagreements among his aides over the wisdom of the teacher settlement blown into titanic public battles for his soul.
"That fight at City Hall that goes on for the heart and mind of the Mayor has an impact here," said Barry Feinstein, head of the 12,000-member Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, as his union broke off talks with the city on Monday.
The two aides most often portrayed as in battle, Mr. Lynch and Mr. Steisel, have differed, but they dismiss any notion of war. In fact, both worry long and loud and equally these days about the city's bond ratings and the future of its social fabric, though both seem too exhausted to do more than get through the day.
Meantime, their seconds and second-guessers seek to play up the strife, with allies of Mr. Lynch calling publicly for Mr. Steisel's resignation and supporters of Mr. Steisel warning of the specter of state control of the city's finances if Mr. Lynch's supposed free-spending tendencies are not reined in.
 
The 'Wall Street Crowd'
 "We had an election last year and they lost," said an article in the current newsletter of Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America, referring to what it calls the "Wall Street crowd."
"We are not going to let them run this town again," added the newsletter, which announced a protest rally at City Hall for Nov. 8, the same day Mr. Dinkins must present his plans to the control board for keeping the budget balanced.
 
For Different Reasons

That is precisely the sort of talk that strikes fear in the heart of those uneasy about Mr. Dinkins to begin with.
Through it all, Mr. Dinkins has tried to stay above the fray, resisting any suggestion that he use the sort of invective that his predecessor, Edward I. Koch, seemed to have decided was not only an occasional necessary evil but also a daily, desirable good.
Yet in his own stubborn, soft-spoken and sometimes groping way, Mr. Dinkins has managed to make people as angry as Mr. Koch did, though for different reasons and perhaps with less sense of a clear result.
As a candidate, Mr. Dinkins pledged to bring reason and personal courtesy to political discourse. But he irked Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the State Legislature by proposing taxes that he knew they would not like to finance the hiring of thousands of new police officers, and they swiftly shot him down.
And, a month after he announced the plan, the Mayor has not even begun to talk seriously with the City Council, whose assent is also needed, about what compromises he will offer, or about the growing city budget problems in general.
"Don't they realize they need allies?" one senior Council aide asked.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Drop as Rumors Lose Impact

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices retreated yesterday in a market that was so sluggish traders would not even jump at rumors, as they have for weeks.
Analysts who have witnessed numerous rumor-induced buying and selling binges compared the quiet session on the New York Mercantile Exchange to reaction to "the little boy who cried 'wolf.' " 
 "This war has started so many times on the floor of the Nymex that I think it's getting a little weary of starting there," said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.
Crude for December delivery was up a little more than $1 a barrel early in the day, before closing at $34.54, down 14 cents. Later delivery contracts followed suit, opening higher and closing down.
 
 Light Trading Session
 During the light trading session, people on the exchange said the market refused to budge on rumors that in other recent sessions would likely have sent crude prices surging by a dollar or two. One rumor even had shots being fired in the Persian Gulf.
"As the day wore on, they became increasingly convinced that the general market was not behind them and we were not going to see any knee-jerk reaction," Mr. Beutel said.
"The market is a little tired," said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "It's just tired of reacting to these rumors."
Oil traders say they generally "buy the rumor, sell the fact," but evidence of that strategy has been absent in the last two sessions.
 
 Futures Fluctuate Aimlessly
 Futures for refined petroleum products also fluctuated aimlessly.
They opened higher, along with crude, and closed mixed.
Wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 1.30 cents, to 93.73 cents a gallon on November delivery contracts. Near-month contracts were also higher, but more distant months closed lower.
Wholesale home heating oil moved in the opposite direction, closing with near months lower and distant months higher. November delivery contracts were down .19 cent, at 91.17 cents a gallon.
Natural gas futures were mixed. December delivery contracts fell 2.6 cents, to $2.408, per 1,000 cubic feet.
After the market closed, the American Petroleum Institute released weekly figures showing the nation's supply of crude oil had fallen below 1989 levels for the first time since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
The United States stockpile of crude dropped to 339.5 million barrels last week, compared with 340.4 million barrels a week earlier and 345.4 million barrels a year earlier. It was the first time this year that the crude stockpile had fallen from the comparable week a year earlier, API said.

HEADLINE: For Investors Who Waited, Few New Benefits

SERIES: The New Tax Law; Third of five articles: A Difference on Capital Gains

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
Having counted on Congress to heed President Bush's call to restore capital gains to favor under the tax code, many investors are likely to feel they were instead dealt a loss in the deficit reduction legislation approved on Saturday. Now, they must decide how to make the best of the situation in year-end tax planning.
"A lot of people put off selling and got killed by the market," said David A. Berenson, national director of tax policy for Ernst & Young in Washington. "They walked into an economic loss because they waited." 
 With their hopes for sizable benefits dashed, he added, "a lot of people will be running for the exits" in doing year-end tax-loss sales. Investors need to decide whether to "act now and avoid the rush," he said. Capital losses on depreciated assets like securities can offset capital gains dollar for dollar, plus ordinary income up to $3,000. If net capital losses exceed $3,000, the excess can be carried forward to future years.
 
 Effect of Deduction Limits
 The new top tax rate on capital gains, 28 percent, is three percentage points below the 31 percent top rate on ordinary income. But the 28 percent is the same rate paid by people in this year's top tax bracket, a flat 28 percent, and the effect of next year's limitation on itemized deductions -- 3 percent of adjusted gross income in excess of $100,000 -- will bring their rate to 28.93 percent rate, said Tim Kochis, who is in charge of executive financial counseling for Deloitte & Touche.
"If they are still working through the exemption phaseout," marginal rates will be raised further, he added. So these people would pay higher taxes on capital gains next year than they do this year.
To the many people whose income is a notch below the top group, the new law gives a capital gains benefit. Because the current 5 percent surcharge now gives them a 33 percent marginal tax rate, they will benefit from the 28 percent rate on gains. But only those whose adjusted gross income is below $100,000 will have a clear five-point advantage by waiting until next year, because many other people in this group will also be affected by the new deduction and exemption rules.
 
 Differentials Called Small
 Five percentage points may persuade some people to delay sales until next year, Mr. Kochis said, but his advice for people who would like to recognize portfolio gains is to "sell now" rather than wait, because decisions about capital gains "need to be market-driven," and the rate differentials are small.
Several tax professionals suggested that those people who wanted to sell now but preferred to move the gain into next year "sell short against the box," a technique that invovles selling borrowed securities that are identical to a portfolio holding, so that the sale will be covered by that holding.
Thomas P. Ochsenschlager, a partner in Grant Thornton's offices of Federal tax services in Washington, said that for appreciated assets like real estate another possibility was to use the installment sales method, spreading the gain over time. That election does not have to be made until the tax return is filed, he added, so by filing for extensions taxpayers could delay the decision until next October.
 
 Half a Point Per Exemption
 As a rule of thumb, he said, the new rules would raise the marginal tax bracket by half a percentage point per exemption for those affected -- couples with adjusted gross income of $150,000 to $272,500 and single filers with adjusted gross income of $100,000 to $222,500.
Thus, a couple with two children and other income of $250,000 who decided to take a $20,000 capital gain in 1991 could be at a 30.93 percent marginal bracket as a result; if they had five children and supported elderly parents, the bracket could rise above 33 percent.
Depending on how much taxable income they have in 1990 -- that is their adjusted gross income, less exemptions and deductions -- they could be in either the 28 percent or 33 percent bracket.
"At least people now know what the rules are," said Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and certified public accountant, who said taxpayers in the 33 percent "bubble," in particular, should assess their situation before the year's end.
 
 Stock for College-Age Child
 Several strategies that can be advantageous will remain unchanged under the next tax law, Mr. Kess noted. For example, a common reason to take a capital gain is to pay college tuition bills. Rather than worry about a difference of a couple of percentage points between this year and next, parents could give the stock to a college-age child, if he of she has little income. Then the child could sell it, be taxed at 15 percent and use the rest for college costs.
Another strategy he suggested is known as a "like-kind" exchange. One piece of real estate, for example, is swapped for another so that there is no sale with a taxable gain. Taxpayers who contemplate doing this would do well to discuss the specific deal with a tax professional before acting.
Say an investor sold shares in July, making a $10,000 gain, and now holds stocks that are worth $13,000 less than was paid for them. If the stock is sold before the end of the year, the investor will not be taxed on the gains taken in July and can use the extra $3,000 in losses to escape income taxes on that much salary or other income.
Lorin D. Luchs, a tax partner in BDO Seidman's national tax office in Washington, said, "Now is not the time to sell stocks if you don't need the cash, now is the time to buy if you can hold them a few years." For people in their 30's, 40's or 50's it could be particularly advantageous to buy shares at today's depressed prices and hold them in tax-deferred retirement accounts, like Keogh or 401(k) plans, or for those who qualify, deductible individual retirement accounts, he said.

HEADLINE: Tarrytown Is Fed Up With Politics, but Not Its Politicians

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN, N.Y.

 BODY:
Like many voters around the nation, people in this Hudson River village say they are approaching Election Day in a fed-up mood. Socked with taxes, scared about crime, angry at the inertia that seems to grip all levels of government, many say it is time to throw the politicians out.
But not, it seems, their politicians."I'm all for this time limit idea," said Lou Jacobson, tie askew, as he stepped off a late-afternoon commuter train at the Tarrytown station. "If you're a Senator, after two terms, you're out," he said, hoisting his thumb in the air like an umpire. "A Congressman, 10 years, you're out." 
 Asked whether he planned to vote against the Congressman who represents the area, Benjamin A. Gilman, a Republican who has been in office since 1973, Mr. Jacobson paused a moment and shook his head no. "You have to look at these races on an individual basis," he said. "I think in his case he's been pretty effective, all in all."
 
'Whole New Slate'
 Claire Polk, who owns a jewelry store on North Broadway, sighed and said she sometimes wished for a "whole new slate of folks" to run the government. Would she, then, be voting against the local State Assemblyman, Richard L. Brodsky?
"Oh no, not Richie," Mrs. Polk said. "He's done a lot with Lyme disease."
With Election Day barely a week away, many voters in Tarrytown -- known both as the sleepy village of Washington Irving lore and as a bedroom town for commuters to New York City and White Plains -- could fairly be described as sullen, but few say they are so angry that they envision actually using their ballots in some kind of mass protest against incumbents.
In many ways, this ambivalent mood seems to be reflected throughout the state. A poll of 1,032 registered voters conducted recently by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion showed that 59.4 percent agreed with the sentiment that things in New York State "are going in the wrong direction," while only 24.7 percent said the opposite. The rest said they were undecided. The poll reports a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.
But the same poll showed that voters were inclined to vote overwhelmingly for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is running for a third term, and voters said they were roughly twice as likely to vote for their incumbent state senator as they were to vote for a challenger.
"You just don't feel like you have a real choice," explained Mrs. Polk's husband, Sam. "Sure I'm dissatisfied, but I'm not going to throw my vote away and just vote against all the people that are in office now. Things could wind up a lot worse with a bunch of unknowns."
No incumbent seems to benefit more from this kind of wariness than Mr. Cuomo, whose Republican challenger, Pierre A. Rinfret, has by all accounts run an erratic campaign and encountered difficulty in getting the state's voters to take his candidacy seriously.
"Can you imagine taking a flier on the guy?" said Bill Chamberlain, a 48-year-old clerk at the Tarrytown Post Office, shaking his head. "I'm tempted, but I just can't see it."
Like many people, Mr. Chamberlain, who said he found the cost of living in Tarrytown so oppressive that he moved to Dutchess County several years ago and now commutes nearly 40 miles each way to work, put taxes at the top of his list of concerns.
 
'Promise Not to Raise Taxes'
 "It's getting ridiculous," he said. "I know the economy is in bad shape. There's talk all over about a wage freeze. I could even see agreeing to something like that, but then I think government should promise not to raise taxes. Would they ever do that? No way." He cited the state's huge prison-construction program as an example: "I'm all for putting criminals away, but from what I've heard some of these places are like country clubs."
But while Mr. Chamberlain said he would probably wind up voting for Mr. Cuomo despite his disgust over taxes, others said they supported Mr. Cuomo because they thought he would be best prepared to handle tough times ahead.
"I guess I don't think anybody could do the job better than he could," said Jean Hatfield, a 64-year-old retired mortgage officer and Tarrytown native who was out doing errands in downtown the other day. "I can't say I believe the economy is all his fault anyway. This problem is a lot bigger than Mario Cuomo."
Tarrytown, with a population of 10,600 that leans Democratic in both registration and in recent gubernatorial and Presidential elections, had its own version of a tax revolt this year.
The Board of Education was forced to impose austerity measures earlier this year after voters twice rejected a school budget. Dozens of teachers, secretaries and administrators were laid off, and little or no money was made available for library books and other school supplies.
Still, local officials said, school taxes will rise almost 10 percent in Tarrytown, because the tax base eroded badly in recent years when local employers like the Consolidated Edison Company and the General Motors Corporation cut their tax payments by challenging their assessments in court.
Even against this backdrop, not everybody lists taxes as their top concern.
"I would have to say it's more important to keep people at work," said Val Castleberry, who rents an apartment in Tarrytown and who said he is constantly concerned that a further downturn could lead to layoffs at the G.M. plant in North Tarrytown, where he works assembling mini-vans. "People can complain about high taxes," added Mr. Castleberry, a 36-year-old father of two daughters. "That's really nothing compared to not having a job."
Concern about the economy manifests itself in myriad ways here. At T.F. Andrew Carpet One, where a huge sign reading "Once in a Lifetime Offer! Carpets at Cost" hangs in the store window, the marketing manager, Maryann B. Hogan, explained that such a sale seemed to be one of the few ways to generate cash.
"With the times the way they are right now," Mrs. Hogan said with a small shrug, "you really have to have something special to get people to replace their carpeting. That's just the way it is."
But while there is widespread clamor for change -- specifically, an upturn in the economy -- Mrs. Hogan was firmly among those who doubted that such a sentiment would pervade the voting booth next week.
"A lot of it seems to be beyond anybody's control," she said. "I really don't feel as a whole that I'm 'anti-incumbent,' or however the news is supposed to be describing us these days. I'm disappointed, but I'm not sure that a clean slate would make any difference."
Tarrytown's Mayor, Eileen Pilla, a Democrat whose office is not on the ballot this fall, said she believed that while there was considerable antipathy toward politicians this year, it was more likely to show up in voters abandoning the polls altogether rather than in their rejecting the people who represent them now.
"I'm not sure a 'throw-the-bums-out' feeling is there," said Mayor Pilla. "People are angry, they're disgusted with the budget process in Washington. But to translate that into an attack on incumbents is a stretch. More likely, I think, they have a perception that most of these races are no contest to begin with, and I think many are just asking themselves, why go to the polls at all?"

Dollar Ends Mostly Lower On Fears of Weak Quarter

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower yesterday on what traders said was concern that the economy would weaken in the fourth quarter and speculation that interest rates could again be pushed lower. 
 The dollar closed at 1.5150 German marks, down from 1.5220 on Monday. And it weakened against the British pound, with the pound closing at $1.9565, up from $1.9490 on Monday.
The dollar was also lower against the Swiss franc and the French franc, but it was unchanged against the Japanese currency, at 128.65 yen.
The general weakness in the dollar came despite news that the economy grew at a stronger-than-expected rate in the third quarter.
The Commerce Department said a surge in new car sales helped the economy grow at a 1.8 percent annual rate.
Economists had expected a 1 percent gain in the initial estimate of third-quarter gross national product, the broadest measure of goods and services output.
But traders said profit-taking overcame the dollar's early gains as concerns grew that the economy would slip into recession in the final quarter of the year.
"The outlook is not very appealing," said Bruce Steinberg at Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc.
Reinforcing the dollar's decline were comments by Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, who said he did not see the G.N.P. data forcing the Federal Reserve to defer further easing of monetary policy.
Lower interest rates tend to depress the United States currency, cutting into the value of dollar-denominated assets.
On Monday, the Fed nudged down interest rates but the move offered little hope to an economy on the verge of recession.
Little Confidence Seen
Analysts say the state of the nation's economy is not stirring confidence in the dollar. "People looked at fundamentals and realized they are not so good," a trader said, referring to the weak outlook for the economy, inflationary pressures and bank problems.
Matthew Robertson of the Westpac Bank said the dollar's long-range outlook was also negative, and traders expect it to move in a narrow range for the short term.
The dollar ended at 1.2825 Swiss francs, down from 1.2925 francs Monday. The dollar also closed at 5.0655 French francs, down from 5.0955 Monday.

'Tax Bubbles,' One More Time

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
CONGRESSIONAL incumbents take heart: those who make it through the November elections are home free. According to the official 30-Day Rule of Political Amnesia, Americans are too bored with politics and too distracted by personal problems to remember a month from now who voted to raise taxes and who did not.
What the public may longer remember, though, is that 1990 was the year of the "tax bubble" -- the year Congress discovered a new inequity in the tax code, then failed to root it out. That perception would be a pity, says Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat who led the fight for the 1986 Tax Reform Act. For while bubbles fit nobody's ideal income tax, they are no invention of the devil. 
 The story begins during the tax debate in 1986. Pressed to show that broadening the tax base was worth the political pain, Washington was eager to lower the maximum rate as much as possible. But according to the computers, a simple 15 percent bracket for struggling wage-earners and a 28 percent bracket for the secure middle class did not raise sufficient revenue.
Rather than add a third bracket, raise the top rate or lower the threshold for income taxed at the maximum, Congress fudged. Families deemed affluent (in 1990, couples making more than $78,400) would gradually lose the benefit of having their first $32,450 in income taxed at the lighter 15 percent rate. This five percentage point surcharge raised the tax on an extra dollar earned to 33 cents.
Once the benefits from the 15 percent bracket have been fully recovered (in 1990 this occurs at a taxable income of $162,770), yet another five percentage point surtax kicks in. This one recovers thebenefits created by the personal exemption, the $2,050 break for individuals (in 1990) that is designed to make taxes more progressive.
This effectively extends the 33 percent marginal tax rate to $185,730 for a family of two, $231,650 for a family of six. Families lucky enough to earn more than the limit in 1990 slip back down to the marginal 28 percent rate. And House Democrats, who discovered that families earning a mere $80,000 paid 33 cents tax on their last dollar of income while their counterparts earning $800,000 paid only 28 cents, thought they were on to something.
The flaw in their thinking is a misunderstanding of the impact of marginal rates on total tax burdens. Marginal rates affect efficiency: The bubble might affect incentives to work and save, because it reduces the take-home on the last dollar earned from 72 cents to 67 cents. But fairness is about relative tax burdens.
The tax bubble on upper-middle-income earners did not make the tax less progressive: the higheryour income in 1990, the higher the percentage of total income you owe Uncle Sam. Nor did it affect "horizontal" equity: two families with the same income pay the same total tax.
What is more, Senator Bradley points out, the surtax bubble hardly represented a stain on an otherwise pure tax system. Those who care to look will find tax bubbles lurking in every nook and cranny of the tax code. Every tax break that is phased out with rising income -- everything from the child care credit, to the savings bond interest exemption for college tuition, to the individual retirement account deduction -- creates a bubble.
But bubblemania has a way of clouding the minds of even the clearest thinkers; righteous House Democrats insisted on replacing the surcharge of five percentage points with a new 31 percent tax bracket started at $80,000 for a couple filing jointly. Just days later, however, tax negotiators reluctantly decided that the bubble concept was too useful a revenue device to renounce.
To meet deficit targets and still hold the maximum bracket at 31 percent, negotiators invented a new bubble -- this one phasing out the personal exemption for couples earning more than $150,000. And this bubble is actually a bit unfair.
Like all bubbles, this one leaves the progressivity of the tax system untouched. But the new bubble does violate the concept of horizontal equity because it phases out personal exemptions at the $275,000 income level, regardless of family size. As a result, a family of six earning $275,000 will pay about $2,500 more tax than a family of two earning the same $275,000.
Someday, perhaps, Washington will create an efficient gimmick-free tax system. But then, someday, the Pentagon will reject a weapons system as redundant and Congress's agriculture committees will discover a commodity unworthy of subsidy. Meanwhile, bubbles will be the least of the tax code's problems.

Dentsu of Japan Acquires 40% Stake in London's C.D.P.

 BODY:
IN the largest advertising investment by the Japanese in Britain, Dentsu, the world's largest agency, has acquired 40 percent of Collett, Dickenson, Pearce & Partners.
The move seems to solidify the notion that the Japanese are seeking to increase their international presence, and is seen as a harbinger for future Japanese shopping sprees. 
 The purchase, for an estimated $40 million, was anticipated all week in London and was confirmed yesterday by analysts. C.D.P., founded in 1960, is one of the most respected agencies in London. Its estimated billings last year totaled about $121 million.
The purchase was chacterized by some analysts as quintessentially Japanese: cautious and considered.
Unlike Americans, who have been aggressively lapping up interests in Europe through existing agencies, the Japanese are keenly aware that the cultural and business differences are vast enough to require some indigenous talent, and that a partial buyout is less risky than setting up an overseas shop.
Because of a problem with international calling yesterday, representatives of Dentsu and C.D.P. could not be reached for comment.
"This is tangible confirmation of the Japanese interests and the signal of a trend," said David Forster, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. "This is hard cash on the table. It's an interesting relationship in that it was agreed upon, they've worked together before, and that it isn't a controlling interest."
One agency executive who has worked closely with Dentsu said the company needed to move fast to gain a worldwide presence in the crucial London market, largely because its American affiliate, HDM, is widely seen as a partnership that never panned out. HDM is a partnership of Dentsu and Eurocom, a French holding company, and Young & Rubicam. A breakup of the relationship is seen by many in the industry as imminent.
"The Japanese agencies are in a position that they have to start following their clients overseas," said Greg M. Ostroff, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York. The decision to open doors overseas through acquisition rather than with a unit of the flagship is seen as culturally savvy, he noted.
"The new agency can't be some functionary of the parent agency," Mr. Ostroff said. "They have to be a group of people from that country who understand the consumer market and consumer psyche of that country."
Given the depressed state of the industry in London, even partial acquisitions may come as a bit of a surprise, but for C.D.P. the move may help build a capital base and a stronger international reputation. "This may be part of their effort to align themselves within an international network," Mr. Ostroff said.
Because 1992, with the arrival of a single European market, is roundly seen as the magic year for the European economy, many international groups are seeking to get established in London, a solid strategic location.
Analysts have predicted that ad spending in Europe will rise by 10 percent annually during the next few years, and Amercian agencies have begun to capitalize by establishing their presence through partnerships, new offices and acquisition.
Earlier this year, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles bought Yellowhammer, a huge London agency, and other American buyers have been seen snooping around in the fog, looking to make the move into Britian.
Hiromi Yoshida, Dentsu's associate manager for overseas affairs, said earlier this week that C.D.P. was the only European network the agency planned to negotiate with right now.

HEADLINE: CENSUS BY CHINA FINDS 1.13 BILLION

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 30

 BODY:
China announced today that the most thorough census in the nation's history had found that the country's population is 1.133 billion.
The official New China News Agency announced a precise figure -- a population of 1,133,682,501 -- as of July 1, "zero hour" for the fourth national census. But in the four months since then, China's population has grown by another 5.5 million or so, based on the reported annual growth rate of 1.47 percent that the press agency disclosed. 
 The figure was about 13 million higher than China's previous estimates, but almost precisely in line with United Nations calculations. It contradicted a series of rumors about Beijing in recent weeks that the census had found a total of nearly 1.4 billion inhabitants.
In fact, the figure reported by the New China News Agency for China's total population was 1.16 billion. But that included areas like Taiwan and Hong Kong that Beijing does not administer even though it claims sovereignty over them. Only in the second paragraph of the dispatch did the agency disclose that the population over the part of mainland China that the Government controls is 1.133 billion.
 
Enforcing One-Child Policy
 The growth rate of 1.47 percent per year is in line with previous estimates. But the census also reported sharp differences in the growth rates of various nationalities, and that might lead the Government to impose tougher family planning measures on ethnic minorities.
For Han Chinese, the ethnic majority accounting for 92 percent of the population, the annual growth rate is 1.08 percent. But the census found that for the ethnic minorities -- including Tibetans, Mongols, and peoples in northwestern China who speak languages related to Turkish -- the growth rate was 3.55 percent per year.
The Government has been far tougher in carrying out its one-child policy in Han areas than in minority regions, partly to avoid antagonizing the minorities. But in the last few years, there have been increasing signs that the leadership would like to curb the rising population in minority areas, and the census results could encourage them to go ahead with such restrictions in Tibet and other regions.

HEADLINE: Sitcoms With Not Much in Common

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30

 BODY:
To the accompaniment of appreciative guffaws, clips from such programs as "Fawlty Towers" and "The Black Adder" were shown. Still, the inescapable conclusion of the seminar sponsored here on Monday night by the British Broadcasting Corporation was that comedy has become an increasingly serious business on both sides of the Atlantic.
Called "Joking Apart: Television Comedy in Britain and America," the conference brought together practitioners of the art at the Directors Guild of America building to examine and compare one another's work methods and product. The American writers and directors on hand proved envious of the creative autonomy given their British counterparts, while two BBC executives expressed admiration for American television's easy access to cash and its informality. 
 "We invented the language, but you guys mess around with it to wonderful comic effect," said James Moir, the head of the Light Entertainment Group at BBC-TV, adopting an exaggerated American accent. In Britain, he added "we get money to make programs," but in the United States, "you make programs to get money."
 
Sitcoms, British Style
 For most of the Americans, Mr. Moir and Gareth Gwenlan, the executive producer of the BBC-TV comedy department, were conducting a tour of a most unfamiliar landscape. Yes, there are situation comedies in Britain, but characters under 16 years of age simply do not appear because of child labor laws, and when the writers of a series grow tired of what they are doing, they often drop it after 6 or 13 episodes and simply move on to something else.
In most cases, the British executives said, all the episodes in a given series represent the efforts, and therefore the creative vision, of one or two writers and a single producer. That stands in sharp contrast to American practice, in which writing teams and directors vary from episode to episode, creating an assembly line effect.
"We're not so nervous or interested in letting so many people have an opinion" during the writing and shooting of a comedy series, Mr. Gwenlan said. The BBC's attitude toward writers, producers and directors, he added, is "let them get on with it."
But the BBC executives also made it clear they do not expect those working conditions, the mere mention of which drew envious sighs and applause from American writers and directors, to remain intact much longer. Rising production costs and increased competition, combined with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's budget and fiscal policies, are forcing the network to become more self-sufficient and market-oriented, they said.
 
Eyes Turn to America
 As a result, Mr. Moir said, "Britain is moving bit by bit toward the American model, and most likely that will accelerate in the 90's." Economics, he added, has forced the BBC to "look to a larger market" as a source of new income and there is "only one market that is profitable," which is the United States.
That news was greeted with dismay by many of the Americans present. Any attempt by the BBC to adopt the production methods and standards of the American network system would be "a coffin nail in world culture," one member of the audience said.
Despite fears that a characterless mid-Atlantic brand of comedy will emerge from the BBC's effort to reach abroad, Britain remains more permissive on questions of taste and language than the United States. That was made clear when the executives showed recent snippets from the show of a popular stand-up comedian, Ben Elton, who has acquired a reputation for pushing the limits of acceptability. And, for early next year, British Satellite Broadcasting, a new commercial service with a limited number of subscribers, has scheduled "Heil Honey, I'm Home," a sitcom about Hitler and Eva Braun. It would be hard to image such a program on American television.
One of Mr. Elton's routines dealt in graphic language with menstruation, while the other addressed a tipsy woman's difficulty in inserting a diaphragm before sex. The Americans seemed surprised when they learned Mr. Elton's program is broadcast at 9:30 P.M., immediately after the BBC's main news program, and not late at night on a restricted cable channel.
 
A Home on PBS
 Traditionally, BBC humor programs such as "Monty Python" and "Yes, Prime Minister" have found a home on public broadcasting channels in the United States, rather than commercial television. Continuing that tradition, Mr. Moir said, 30 PBS stations have recently bought rights to "Alexei Sayle's Stuff," a series starring a bald, rotund and manic comic who earlier appeared on "The Young Ones," a raucous satire seen in the United States on MTV.
But the proliferation of cable channels on American television offers new opportunities for the BBC to "narrowcast in the United States what we broadcast in the U.K.," as Mr. Moir put it. He mentioned Bravo and the Comedy Channel as cable outlets that have already acquired BBC stand-up and situation comedy programs and helped develop a new audience for British humor.
Eventually, the BBC hopes to gain a foothold in American network television. A co-production comedy development agreement was signed with CBS last year, and the first result of that arrangement may appear on American television as early as the summer of 1991, British and American television executives said.
"Watch out, the Brits are coming," Mr. Moir warned. "The deal with CBS is an augur of things to come."

As technology for gathering the sun's rays improves, engineers are focusing on storage, so the energy can be used at night or on cloudy days. A storage medium would also help in transporting the energy from the desert, where it is most efficiently gathered, to cities, where it is most needed.
Some Israeli scientists think that the solution is a pair of chemical reactions using methane and water. The first uses the sun's heat to create a gas from methane and water, a process that absorbs energy. The other consumes the gas and gives the energy back. 
 With oil prices at about $35 a barrel, the process is almost economically competitive in some circumstances, the scientists say. Although their approach is outside the mainstream of solar research, which involves direct production of electricity from photovoltaic cells, the Israelis may be closer to commercial success.
Their technology is not competitive with cheap fossil fuels and thus would seem to have limited usefulness, at least in the short term, for the United States, with its vast reserves of coal and natural gas. But nearly all third world countries are looking for new ways to make electricity, and scientists in the industrial world hope they will choose solar power. If they choose coal, levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will quickly increase, probably leading to worldwide climate change.
 
 Storage Is the Key
 But solar energy will never contribute a large fraction of energy requirements until it can be stored.
Solar energy can be stored through any of several chemical reactions that are reversible, consuming energy in one direction and giving it off in the other. Most attention has been focused on electrolysis, the process of splitting a water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen, a step that absorbs electric energy; the two can be recombined later, giving off electricity, or the hydrogen can simply be burned, using the oxygen or plain air, producing heat.
Electrolysis is a natural complement to the most prominent solar cell technology, photovoltaic cells. They turn sunlight directly into low-voltage direct current, an energy form well suited to electrolysis. The hydrogen could be shipped by pipeline and used to run cars, home furnaces orpower plants.
 
 Making Steam
 But the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel, has concentrated on a simpler form of solar energy: gathering the sun's rays as heat for making steam rather than electricity. Steam can spin a turbine and make power; in fact, that is the way most electricity is made, with the steam coming from burning coal or oil. Some commercial plants in California use Israeli-fabricated solar components to boil water into steam, and then use the steam to make electricity. But steam cannot be stored or shipped long distances.
It can, however, drive a chemical reaction, and researchers at the Weizmann Institute think they have found a chemical that can absorb the steam's energy and give it back later.
It is an unusual choice: methane, better known as natural gas. Methane is usually thought of as a fuel, but a new Israeli system employs it instead as an energy carrier that is never consumed. In short, what had been the candy bar is now the wrapper.
The first step is to use steam to add energy to the methane. The Israelis get the steam from a "power tower," a black-painted container atop a tower in which water is boiled into steam by sunlight focused by 64 computer-driven mirrors.
As the steam heats the methane to more than 900 degrees centigrade, the methane and water vapor combine to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The new molecules contain about 30 percent more energy than the methane had.
But the Israeli system never consumes the methane. The Israelis take the product, which engineers call synthesis gas, and push it through a pipeline to another chemical reactor where the process is reversed.
When the process runs the other way, it produces steam at 700 degrees, and methane gas. The number of calories of heat given off in the second reaction is about the same as the number absorbed in the first reaction. The methane is sent by pipeline back to the solar site for the process to be repeated.
In the Israeli project, the two processes are adjacent, but with a pipeline the solar power could be used hundreds of miles away, said Dr. Israel Dostrovsky, a former president of Weizmann who is a researcher there.
 
 An Old Practice
 Making synthesis gas is not an original practice; almost any hydrocarbon fuel, from coal to natural gas, can be broken down by intense steam into carbon monoxide and free hydrogen.
Refineries have been making synthesis gas for years. It is an early step in the manufacture of methanol, which can be a vehicle fuel.
Texaco Inc. has been making synthesis gas at a plant in Coolwater, Calif. Its raw material is not natural gas, however, but coal. It then filters the pollutants out of the gas and uses the cleaned-up remainder as fuel for a gas turbine -- essentially a land-bound jet engine -- to make electricity.
Texaco gets its heat by burning the coal. But the Israelis have virtually no coal or natural gas; what they have is sunlight.
The Israelis say they have made substantial progress in one tricky area: making the chemical reactor run smoothly even though the sun's heat may vary.
 
 Hard to Compete
 The United States pursued similar research until budget cuts a few years ago, said Dr. Craig E. Tyner, supervisor of the Solar Thermal Collector Technology Division at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico. "The real stumbling block is just the economics," he said, citing the cost of the solar collector, the reactor, the pipeline and the reactor at the other end. "With oil at $20 a barrel, it certainly wasn't economical for us," he said. "But at $40 a barrel, it becomes not too far away."
Even with high oil prices, Dr. Tyner said, synthesis gas would find it hard to compete because North America has natural gas to burn for power generation. But for the Israelis, and for many third world countries in sunny areas, the system is attractive because they have very little natural gas.
It is attractive for another reason: There are no carbon dioxide emissions, so use of the system would not add to the greenhouse effect. And the gas could be stored, quite literally, for a rainy day.
There are skeptics. At the Florida Solar Energy Center in Cape Canaveral, Dr. Ali T-Raissi, a solar researcher, said that evaluating the process required a careful measure of the losses at each step, from gathering the sun's heat, to making the synthetic gas, to pushing it through a pipeline, to running the reverse reactor, to pushing the methane back to the solar site. "It will be hard to beat a photovoltaic system, which directly converts solar energy to electricity," he said. Electrolysis, Dr. T-Raissi pointed out, is 100 years old and well understood.
But Scott Sklar, director of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group in Washington, said the technology might prove a winner. "It ain't cheap," he said. "But in countries like Israel that don't have access to energy when they want it, it might pay for itself."
 
Saving Solar Energy for a Rainy Day
 
1. Sunlight, focused by mirrors onto a "power tower," heats water and methane gas, breaking them down to carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The reaction absorbs heat. The new gas mixture is called synthesis gas.
 
2. Synthesis gas can be stored for long periods until it is needed. A pipeline carries the low-temperature gas to cities hundreds of miles away.
 
3. The gas is placed in a methanator, which separates it into methane and steam. The reaction gives off heat. The methane is sent back to the solar site; the steam is used in industry, or to power a turbine to create electricity.

HEADLINE: Jackson Could Start Over an Ailing Cheeks

BYLINE: By CLIFTON BROWN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PURCHASE, N.Y., Oct. 30

 BODY:
Maurice Cheeks's sore back may put Mark Jackson back in the Knicks' starting lineup on opening night.
Cheeks, the incumbent starter at point guard, missed the final two exhibition games and was unable to practice again today. As the Knicks prepare for Friday's opener against the Hornets at Charlotte, N.C., Cheeks's health, coupled with Jackson's strong pre-season play, have increased Jackson's chance of regaining his starting position, at least temporarily. 
 When asked if he would start Cheeks on Friday if he is able to practice on Thursday, Stu Jackson, the Knicks' coach, said, "No comment." But Jackson did say he was concerned that Cheeks's injury was not healing as quickly as anticipated.
"The fact of the matter is that Maurice has been out for six days now," Jackson said. "Going into Charlotte, my first concern is the performance of the team. If I feel that by starting Maurice, our performance is going to be hurt because he's been out for so long, then we'll go with Mark, and with full confidence. I will probably not announce our starting lineup until right before the game on Friday."
 
Cureton Is Dropped
 The Knicks waived Earl Cureton today, reducing their roster to 14 players. Cureton, who was battling Stuart Gray for a backup center position, had better numbers than Gray during the preseason. Cureton averaged 5.2 points, 4.4 rebounds and shot 57.1 percent from the field. Gray averaged 3.1 pts. 3.5 rebounds and 53.4 percent from the field.
But Gray has a guaranteed contract. If the Knicks decided to release Gray, they would still have to pay him, and they would not be able to subtract his full salary from the salary cap. Therefore Cureton, who did not have a guaranteed contract, was the easier and more economical player to waive. Other factors working against Cureton were his age (he's 33 years old while Gray is 27) and his small size for a center (6 feet 9 inches, 215 pounds compared with Gray's 7 feet and 240 pounds).
"Earl was only going to be the 11th or 12th man anyway," said Al Bianchi, the Knicks' general manager. "Now if he was a great player who was going to help us win 10 or 12 more games, that would be a different issue."
Stu Jackson informed Cureton that he had been waived this morning.
"Earl worked very, very hard in camp and I thought he played pretty well," Jackson said. "But from a business-decision standpoint, we had to let him go.
"Is it frustrating? It's a little frustrating to me. But I think Earl, being the professional that he is, understood the situation maybe greater than I did. It's frustating, but it's part of the rules that coaches have to play by. I'll accept that. The team will accept that. And I think Earl accepted that. Now we'll move on."
 
Walker Still Ailing
 The Knicks must still reduce their roster to the 12-man limit by Thursday. Kenny Walker (sprained knee) will probably be placed on the injured list Wednesday or Thursday, meaning that the Knicks would have to cut only one more player by Thursday. Walker, a backup small forward, has not played or practiced since suffering the injury Oct. 13.
John Starks and Greg Grant are fighting for a final roster spot as backup guards. But Starks suffered a knee injury during practice today when he collided with Patrick Ewing and was to be examined by doctors after practice. Trent Tucker, the backup shooting guard, also missed today's practice with a bruised heel.

HEADLINE: Getting a Tale of 80's Avarice on Screen

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
The camera is rolling at No. 7 World Trade Center, and Larry the Liquidator is strolling purposefully through the lobby of the sleek, high-tech office building, across the pink-and-gray stone floor and past the long, wraparound security desk and the walls bedecked with modern art.
But despite the character's name, this is not yet-another mob hitman gunning for his victim in the newest Mafia-family extravaganza, or half-man, half-robot assassin seeking to destroy the world in the latest Arnold Schwarzenegger high-body-count, blood-and-guts epic. 
 Larry the Liquidator is an antihero of another stripe: he is Lawrence Garfinkle, a high-powered, fabulously wealthy and totally ruthless specialist in the corporate takeovers that were the rage of the 1980's. Garfinkle is portrayed by Danny DeVito, whose films include "The War of the Roses," "Throw Momma From the Train" and "Twins," in which he played Mr. Schwarzenegger's womb-mate. And the subject of this movie, appropriately enough for the New York setting hard by Wall Street, is money. Or, to be more precise, "Other People's Money."
 
A Man and His Credits
 The film version of Jerry Sterner's hit Off Broadway play, still running at the Minetta Lane Theater more than a year and a half after it opened, is being directed by Norman Jewison. Mr. Jewison's credits include "In the Heat of the Night," "Fiddler on the Roof," "A Soldier's Story," "Moonstruck" and "In Country"; his films have earned 45 Academy Award nominations and a dozen Oscars.
Penelope Ann Miller, who received a Tony nomination last year for her portrayal of Emily Gibbs in "Our Town" on Broadway, co-stars as a lawyer named Kate Sullivan. It is Kate Sullivan who battles Garfinkle in his attempt to take over New England Wire and Cable and annihilate it, without regard for the economic futures of its longtime loyal employees.
Between takes, Mr. DeVito, looking very businesslike in black fedora, black topcoat, matching slacks, white-on-white shirt and fuchsia tie, is talking with Mr. Jewison about the scene. It is a simple one, in which Garfinkle ascends an escalator and heads for the elevator that will convey him swiftly to his office, to, as Mr. Jewison calls it, his "securely guarded temple of power."
"How many floors does Garfinkle investments have in this building?" Mr. Jewison asks.
Mr. DeVito pauses for a second. "Three," he says.
The director continues: "Is its trading floor here?" he asks.
"Yes," Mr. DeVito replies. "And its executive offices too."
 
A Journal of 'the Pig Years'
 For Mr. Jewison, "Other People's Money" is a quintessential tale of greed, lust and selfishness in 1980's America. "I wanted to make a film about the pig years of the 1980's," the director says, relaxing in his trailer between scenes. "I'm not saying I see it as a morality play, but I do think it's something that affects all of us, that affects America and the social conditions under which we live."
"In the 80's, the deregulation of big business, of airlines, of the family, with almost everyone looking out only for themselves, the Michael Milkens, the Ivan Boeskys, the corporate takeovers, affected the way people behaved, the way they thought," he says. "The traditional values seemed to be swept aside in this story. That's what pulled me toward the project."
Mr. DeVito says he admires his character, who was created onstage in New York by Kevin Conway and whom he sees as funny and honest as well as ruthless. "I see him as a guy who does things the right way," says the actor. "He is interested in making money for his stockholders. He sets a goal for himself each day, which is to do better than the day before, and he goes after that goal."
 
Money's How He Keeps Score
 And what about the question of greed? "Let's try to put it in perspective," he says. "He's a man who has a passion for making money. He enjoys it. It's kind of a game that everybody plays. To talk about greed is like saying that Joe Montana is a very greedy quarterback because he throws a lot of touchdown passes or Willie Mays was a very greedy centerfielder because he caught a lot of fly balls."
Ms. Miller says that the role of Kate Sullivan, originated Off Broadway by Mercedes Ruehl, is for her a welcome change. "It's a departure from anything I've ever played," says the actress, who was recently seen as Marlon Brando's daughter in "The Freshman." "I always play the sweet, vulnerable innocent one, and I think it's good for people to see me as an older character, in a part that is tougher and sexy and powerful."
"Kate is very ambitious, very career-oriented," she says. "She has to compete in a man's world and she's developed a real strong character to get where she is. No one is going to get in her way. She has horse's blinders on. She is seduced by power and money and prestige. She's going straight for the top, and there's no stopping her. She loves challenge and competition, and I think that's what draws her to Garfinkle. They challenge each other, and she likes the challenge of beating him."
 
A Factory for the Factory
 After finishing filming in New York this week, the company takes a two-week hiatus and resumes in mid-November in Connecticut, where, Mr. Jewison says, he has found an 1830's factory that will be transformed into New England Wire and Cable. Mr. Jewison and Ric Kidney are producing the film for their Yorktown Productions. It is to be released by Warner Brothers.
Mr. Jewison has emphasized that the story is very much one of the 80's. This, of course, is the 90's. The economy is in a downturn and things are very different on Wall Street from what they were a few years ago, when "Other People's Money" was written. The director says that he and his screen writer, Alvin Sargent (an Oscar winner for "Julia" and "Ordinary People") are very aware of that fact are "working hard to bridge the gap."
"The story is based on greed and selfishness, and so in that sense it's timeless," Mr. Jewison says. "People have been greedy since the Bible. And the story is also a comment on what has happened in the country in the last 10 years, so it's relevant as a way of looking back. And it also says that what's happening now is the result of what happened then."
 
A Race Against Time
 "But it's a very treacherous area," he says. "Things change so rapidly in America that by the time you bring a film to the screen you may no longer be current."
He and Mr. Sargent are trying to incorporate into the film more recent events, like Donald J. Trump's financial problems and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert. They are also planning a surprise ending that the director says "will bring it into the 90's in a very forceful way."
"And I'm hoping to get the film out next year," Mr. Jewison adds. "Before everything changes again."

HEADLINE: A Battle Won in the Poverty War

 BODY:
Youngsters born into poverty aren't truly born equal, but America is now on the way to reducing that tragic inequality. Legislation just enacted by the 101st Congress will give poor children, and their parents, a better, healthier life. As much as the members of this Congress were abused as morons, clowns and incompetents, they leave behind a monumental triumph in the enduring war on poverty.
Take Congress's thoughtful approach to medical care, for instance. By 2003, all poor children through the age of 18 will be covered by Federal Medicaid health insurance. The age limit, now 6, will rise by one year annually. The gain to children is obvious, but there's a gain for their mothers and for society. It is an inducement to poor women who have been discouraged from getting a job and off welfare because heretofore that meant losing Medicaid benefits. 
 It's going to be easier for the working poor to buy health insurance for the children, too. Congress established a tax credit for the costs of premiums on private health insurance that covers children in low-income families. And the Childhood Immunization Program received a sizable increase over 1990's $156 million.
In separate, equally dramatic legislation, Congress improved Head Start. This program, now in its 26th year, offers a remarkable testament to the effectiveness of early childhood education. But it has been able to admit only about 25 percent of the eligible children. Not anymore. Congress approved a 26 percent expansion in funding, making it possible to enroll 40 percent of eligible children. More dramatic still, the legislation authorizes funds that will make it possible to enroll every eligible child in America by 1994.
Above all, Congress has now enacted child care legislation that is a boon not only for the working poor but a long-overdue response to the new realities of American life. The measure, for which several members of Congress and Senator Christopher Dodd in particular labored for four hard years, sets up two grant programs to subsidize state child care programs.
The Child Care and Development Block Grant, which spends $2.5 billion over three years, gives states discretion to subsidize child care for working parents regardless of income but with the recommendation that the money go to low-income families. The states are also required to establish minimal health, safety, registration and quality standards. Church-run day care centers will be eligible for the Federal subsidies, through a voucher system.
A smaller program, Entitlement Funding for Child Care Services, enables the states to give money to families that are either on welfare or about to be because they can't buy child care.
All this is complemented by a highly constructive expansion of the earned income tax credit for poor working families with children. The tax credit is refundable, meaning that those whose credits add up to more than the tax they owe will be paid the difference in cash.
This 101st Congress was disputatious. But its work for the neediest Americans was a triumph.

HEADLINE: Help Yugoslavia Look Forward

 BODY:
How many countries will there be in Europe after 1992? Seven, according to the bitter gibe circulating in Croatia: the European Community and the six republics that now make up Yugoslavia. It's no joke. Things could turn out that way if Slobodan Milosevic and his Communist cohorts in Serbia continue to hold back constitutional and economic change and stir up ethnic tension.
Ever since Slovenia and Croatia elected non-Communist governments and moved to free the economy, Mr. Milosevic has accused them of trying to break up Yugoslavia. Slovenia and Croatia deny any separatist intent but want to turn Yugoslavia into a loosened confederation of sovereign republics. That would weaken the power of the Serbs, who dominate Yugoslavia's bureaucracy and army. 
 Behind the constitutional crisis lurks a threat of civil war. The U.S. and its European allies could best use their influence by telling Serbia that any attempt to settle the constitutional question by force will lead to a cutoff of aid and contact, and bar Yugoslavia's way into Europe.
Looking backward, Yugoslavs see plenty of reasons for renewed national strife. Croatia's Serbian minority, about 11 percent of its 4.7 million inhabitants, recall that in World War II, the last time Croatia was an independent state, Serbs by the thousands were slaughtered. As many as 350,000 lost their lives at the hands of the Ustashi, Croatia's home-grown Fascists. In 1945 the Partisans took their revenge, massacring 100,000 Croats, not all of them Ustashi sympathizers.
Serbian extremists in Croatia successfully play on these historic fears. They have declared their autonomy from Croatia and threatened to form paramilitary groups to defend Serbs if the Government in Belgrade does not. When Croatia moved to confiscate their arms, Serbs blocked roads and rail lines. Croatian officials fear their attempts to restore order could serve as a pretext for the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army to intervene.
Only pluralism and prosperity can contain Yugoslavia's national differences. But Serbia has yet to hold democratic elections. It shows contempt for other nationalities by cracking down on Kosovo Province. And it shies away from freer markets that could shake the economy out of its lassitude.
Yugoslavia's best hope lies in moving forward into Europe. But if Belgrade resorts to force, the door to Europe will slam shut. That's a firm message for the European Community to send now.
Washington can underscore that warning with one of its own: Any more violence means no more aid. But it would be rash to cut off U.S. aid now, as Senator Alfonse D'Amato has proposed. That would exacerbate Yugoslavia's economic distress -- and national passions. Voting down Mr. D'Amato's measure still leaves Yugoslavia on notice that aid is in jeopardy unless democratic change is allowed to proceed in peace.

HEADLINE: FOOD NOTES

BYLINE: By Florence Fabricant

Pasta Party
Tavern on the Green in Central Park has already begun its carbo-loading in preparation for the New York City Marathon on Sunday. The executive chef, Marc Poidevin, and his crew have begun preparing 5,000 pounds of pasta to feed an estimated 14,000 runners who are expected for dinner on Saturday.
All those who enter the marathon are invited to the annual party, which starts at 4 P.M. and continues until 11 P.M. in a tent and in the Crystal Room of the restaurant. Ronzoni, part of Hershey Foods , contributed the pasta, as it has for five years. The pasta will be prepared in a casserole with mushrooms and cream, in a salad with basil and yogurt and in a spicy tomato sauce. There is no charge for registered runners.
Entrants in the marathon who keep kosher will also be treated to a pasta party at the Second Avenue Deli, 156 Second Avenue (10th Street), on Saturday from 8 to 10 P.M. On the menu will be kasha varnishkes, made with buckwheat and bow-tie pasta. Runners must present their credentials at the door and can bring a guest.
 
A Change in Teachers
Beginning in February, the cooking school at the Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., will be run by La Varenne, Anne Willan's school in France. Eight one-week sessions will be held from Feb. 24 through May 3. For the past 13 years the school had been run by Julie Dannenbaum, a cooking instructor from Philadelphia.
The cost, $1,300 a week, includes accommodations. Call Martha Holmberg at (800) 624-6070.
 
 High-School Cook-Off
With recipes that included spaghetti pie and volaille et legumes grilles au thym frais, 15 high school students from New York City, Westchester and Rockland Counties and Long Island participated two weeks ago in a cook-off sponsored by Waldbaum's. Steven Gertner, a 17-year-old senior at Sachem High School North in Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., won with his poached salmon in champagne sauce. He takes cooking classes at Boces II, a continuing-education program in Islip, L.I.
Each of the participants won a $500 scholarship; their schools will receive equipment for their home-economics classes. Mr. Gertner's class will also be treated to an outing to restaurants and food shops in Manhattan.
The cook-off was at the Culinary Art Center of the New York Institute of Technology in Central Islip.
 
The Shop Next Door
For several years, restaurants have been opening shops into adjoining spaces and selling prepared foods. The newest in the trend is Corrado, 1373 Avenue of the Americas (55th Street), which has opened Corrado Kitchen next door.
Some of the colorful salads include tricolor pasta sparked with tangy sun-dried tomatoes that contrast with mellow chunks of mozzarella ($11 a pound), white beans in a herbaceous dressing with nuggets of raw vegetables ($7.80 a pound) and a mixture of tender seafood in a slightly underseasoned vinaigrette ($19 a pound).
The cold sauteed chicken breast cloaked in a creamy mustard sauce ($14 a pound) is better than the rather dry grilled chicken paillard, which is available with a salad ($10.95 a portion) or in a sandwich ($5.95). Desserts are banal, but the classic nut brownie ($1.50) is an exception.
Delivery is free with orders of $8 or more from 48th to 60th Streets, Broadway to Lexington Avenues. Call (212) 333-7696.
 
Abracadabra In the Kitchen
A HALLOWEEN trick is not quite the same as "truc," French for trick. But a new video, "Trucs of the Trade," demonstrates such tricks of the kitchen as putting wine corks into a stew to tenderize meat.
In 72 minutes, the tape shows chefs giving dozens of useful tips. For example, Lidia Bastianich, owner of the restaurant Felidia in Manhattan, explains the difference between male and female eggplants (the female has more seeds and less flavor). Antoine Bouterin, chef at Le Perigord, shows how to save a salty sauce by running a sugar cube through it.
The tape, produced by Arlene Feltman, who runs the De Gustibus Cooking School in New York, includes some commercial plugs for its sponsor, the Kobrand Corporation, a wine and spirits importer and distributor. Some of the proceeds from sales are donated to Share Our Strength, a nationwide organization that feeds the hungry.
The tape is $19.95 in video stores or can be ordered by calling (800) 448-2449.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 CAMPAIGN;
Kerry in Nasty Race in Massachusetts

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
In his re-election battle against Jim Rappaport, a Republican upstart, Senator John Kerry sometimes tells voters, "I'm not Rappaport," a playful political appropriation of the title of the Broadway show by that name.
Mr. Rappaport, a wealthy anti-tax conservative with no previous political experience, laughs as hard as anybody. He says Mr. Kerry, a first-term Democrat, is really Michael Dukakis. 
 And that brings no laugh from Senator Kerry.
To many voters here and elsewhere, Mr. Dukakis, the Governor of Massachusetts who was the Democratic Party's much-maligned Presidential candidate in 1988, seems the embodiment of political ineptitude and failed tax-and-spend liberalism. To such voters, Mr. Dukakis is as good an explanation as any for the anti-incumbent tide that is sweeping across Massachusetts and much of the rest of the nation this fall.
So Senator Kerry, a 46-year-old Massachusetts Brahmin who rose to national prominence as a founder of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, finds himself in political trouble, running hard to escape that tide.
 
Depth of Voter Angst
 In the latest polls he is leading Mr. Rappaport, a 34-year-old developer and heir to a real estate fortune. But hardly anyone thinks the contest is over, given the depth of voter angst here and the slashing, personal attacks that both candidates have mounted.
Although Mr. Rappaport is a newcomer to Bay State politics, through aggressive stumping and intensive television advertising he appears to have persuaded large numbers of voters that Senator Kerry, along with Governor Dukakis, is responsible for the economic hard times that have left Massachusetts in bad financial shape.
The Senator, Mr. Rappaport remainds voters, was Mr. Dukakis's Lieutenant Governor before heading to Washington six years ago. There, Mr. Rappaport says, Mr. Kerry has become the Governor's "ambassador."
Lest anyone miss this attempt at guilt by association, Mr. Rappaport is flooding the airwaves with a television advertisement called "Metamorphosis," in which Mr. Dukakis's face slowly evolves into the face of John Kerry. "He's back!" a doom-filled voice says.
Mr. Kerry counters that he is his own political man and is as aware as anyone that Massachusetts voters are angry and frustrated to the point that they have moderated their once unalloyed liberalism, particularly when it comes to taxes and spending. He says Mr. Rappaport is an inexperienced candidate, a political opportunist who has spent much of his life outside Massachusetts and has now returned with more than $3 million of the family fortune to buy his way into the Senate.
And, lest anyone miss his point, one of Senator Kerry's television advertisements, entitled "Hot Heir," features a balloon on which Mr. Rappaport's face has been painted. The balloon bounces around the country until it reaches Washington, where it pops.
"I'm not part of the problem," the Senator tells voters as he travels the state. "People like Jim Rappaport are the problem. I'm part of the solution."
Mr. Kerry says he has not only represented his state in Washington but has also been in the forefront of the war on drugs, winning a seat on the prestigeous Senate Foreign Relations Committee and heading one of its investigations into the narcotics trade in Central America.
Mr. Rappaport counters that Mr. Kerry has been an obedient, tax-and-spend Democrat on Capitol Hill and has become too enamored of political and social Washington at the expense of Massachusetts. "He's more concerned about Central America that central Massachusetts," Mr. Rappaport says.
One reason Senator Kerry seems to be in political trouble is that he got off to a lackadaisical start in countering Mr. Rappaport's attack, and has thus found himself on the defensive throughout most of the campaign.
Mr. Kerry, who is slow to smile and clap a back, also suffers from an image of being cool and distant. In the view of some constituents, he has, as a Senator, failed to establish strong bonds with his constituency.
"Kerry hurt himself by being mostly invisible throughout the early part of the campaign," said John Gorman of Opinion Dynamics, a Massachusets-based organization that does political and market polling. "That made him especially vulnerable since he's never had particulaly high favorability or visibility in the state, though down in Washington he's been much better. But he's beginning to pick up some speed with his television spots and now that more and more reporters have begun to scrutinize Rappaport."
Increasingly, the challenger finds himself fending off questions about his lack of political experience, why he will not release all his tax returns, whether his Vermont farm should be eligible for Federal agriculture subsidies and how he got in on a highly profitable real estate deal in Hawaii.
Quick with a boyish smile, eager to clap the nearest back, Mr. Rappaport tells his critics that being a political novice is an advantage when an anti-incumbent tide is running. As for his finances, he says they are "all in correct order."
 
 Undecideds Make it Close
 The first Kerry-Rappaport polls, conducted more than six weeks ago, showed the Senator with a lead of fewer than five percentage points. By contrast, he was elected to the Senate six years ago with 55 percent of the vote.
The latest polls, conducted about 10 days ago, show that Mr. Kerry has opened his lead over Mr. Rappaport to about 15 points. But they also showed a undecided vote of 10 points or so, and many politicians and pollsters here say that vote could go to the challenger.
"That would keep it a close race," said Brad Bannon, another Massachusetts poll taker. "Incumbents usually have a hard time getting the undecideds. And in a year like this, with so much voter anger, that task is even more difficult."
Many of the undecideds are thought to be political independents. Over the years, Massachusetts has swung from being heavily Republican to heavily Democratic, and has recently become increasingly independent. The latest voter breakdown is estimated to be 44 percent independent, 42 percent Democratic and 14 percent Republican.
But Mr. Rappaport can take little encouragement from one other significant political development undercovered by the latest polls. They showed that the percentage of voters who had a favorable view of him was declining, while the percentage of voters who viewed him unfavorably was increasing. Senator Kerry's favorable-unfavorable ratings changed little from earlier polls.
Such ratings hint, as much as anything, at a candidate's ability to hold supporters and pull them to the polls.
 "Rappaport may have overplayed his hand with his ads and his attacks," said Mr. Gorman, the pollster for oPinion Dynamics. "Then on top of that you can add Kerry's attacks and a lot of media pieces about Rappaport, especially attacks by columnists. It's beginning to cut."

New Lesson in Democracy, by Abraham Lincoln

BYLINE: By Herbert Mitgang

 BODY:

Lincoln on Democracy
Edited and Introduced by Mario M. Cuomo and Harold Holzer
416 pages. A Bessie Book/Harper. $24.95.
Scholars who specialize in mid-19th-century American history like to draw a distinction between Lincoln and the Civil War, even though they are linked in place and time. Biographers believe that the evolution of Lincoln from small-town prairie lawyer and one-term Congressman to wartime President is a theme that can stand apart and alone in American annals. Those who revere every last musket and Minie ball, who flaunt the Confederate flag and refight all the old battles, are not necessarily students of the significance of the 16th President's life.
A flaw in the perspective of this season's justly acclaimed public television series on the Civil War -- corrected in the companion book to the series, "The Civil War" -- is that the programs placed far more emphasis on an even-handed glorification of the generals, North and South, than on the remarkable role played by the Constitutional commander-in-chief in the White House.
Indeed, it's been said that the main legacy of the Civil War to the United States and the world is the character of Abraham Lincoln. This is a provocative and slightly exaggerated metaphor; yet if language is a lanyard to fire inspired thought, Lincoln's words are indeed the war's most enduring heritage. That is why "Lincoln on Democracy," edited by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Harold Holzer, a special counselor to Mr. Cuomo's director of economic administration who has written several books on Lincoln's image in prints, is a valuable addition to the long shelf of Lincolniana. The project was conceived two years ago in Albany when Mr. Cuomo promised a delegation of teachers from the Polish labor organization Solidarity that he would create an edition of Lincoln's writings that could be translated into Polish.
In one volume of 140 speeches, letters and fragments, "Lincoln on Democacy" succeeds in highlighting most of the 16th President's ideas. All the great set pieces are here: the "House Divided" speech; extracts from four of the Lincoln-Douglas debates; the Cooper Union speech in New York that cleared the way to his Presidential nomination; the First and Second Inaugural Addresses; parts of his largely overlooked but highly revealing annual messages to Congress; the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Gettsyburg Address. Informative essays by seven Lincoln and Civil War experts -- Gabor S. Boritt, William E. Gienapp, Charles B. Strozier, Richard Nelson Current, James M. McPherson, Mark E. Neely Jr. and Hans L. Trefousse -- link the sections and provide biographical material.
A highly original addition to "Lincoln on Democracy" is a chronology that charts what was happening in the nation and the world during Lincoln's life. For example, the reader learns that while Lincoln was serving in Congress in 1848, the first women's rights convention was held in Seneca Falls, N. Y., and the New York News Agency (later The Associated Press) was founded; in world affairs, revolution rocked Europe and, in that same year, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published a pamphlet, "Communist Manifesto."
Inevitably, some key Lincoln writings and speeches have been omitted that scholars will miss. Congressman Lincoln's fiery address, on Jan. 12, 1848, against the American invasion of Mexico is included, with its approval of revolution: "Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable, -- a most sacred right -- a right, which we hope and believe, is to liberate the world."
But Lincoln's most stirring antiwar statement has been cut from that same address. In it, he said that "the blood of this war, like the blood of Abel, is crying to Heaven" and that "military glory" is only "an attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood -- that serpent's eye, that charms to destroy." The full texts of Lincoln's key speeches and writings can be found in the invaluable two-volume set edited by Don E. Fehrenbacher for the Library of America (distributed by Viking Press).
"Lincoln on Democracy" wisely includes some of his lighter remarks. Governor Cuomo, a lawyer and law lecturer, undoubtedly enjoyed putting in Lincoln's comment about their profession. In notes for a law lecture in 1850, Lincoln said: "There is a vague popular belief that lawyers are necessarily dishonest. . . . Let no young man, choosing the law for a calling, for a moment yield to this popular belief. Resolve to be honest at all events; and if, in your own judgment, you can not be an honest lawyer, resolve to be honest without being a lawyer. Choose some other occupation, rather than one in the choosing of which you do, in advance, consent to be a knave."
Are the speeches and writings in "Lincoln on Democracy" relevant today? With hundreds of thousands of American military forces in and around the Middle East without Congressional consent, it is useful to come across a letter written by Lincoln from Washington on Feb. 15, 1848, to William H. Herndon, his law partner.
"The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to Congress, was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons," Lincoln wrote. "Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This, our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us."
"Lincoln on Democracy" should be a helpful guide in Poland. It might even be educational for this plain-English edition to be read in Washington, too.
