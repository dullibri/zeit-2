ASIA
 
AFGHANISTAN: IMPROVING U.N. RELATIONS -- The top United Nations official in Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, said the organization now had offices aiding local government and health services and monitoring human rights in four major cities -- Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and Mazaar-I-Sharif. He also said women were again working with relief agencies, after being barred from jobs outside their homes. Barbara Crossette (NYT) 

PHILIPPINES: BOMB ATTACK ON A BUS -- More than two dozen people were killed and many more were wounded when a bomb exploded in a bus aboard a ferry heading across Panguil Bay to Ozamis on the island of Mindanao, the police said. No group claimed responsibility, but similar attacks have in the past been attributed to Muslim separatists. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
INDONESIA: CONCILIATORY WORDS FROM MILITARY -- The chief of the armed forces, Adm. Widodo Adisutjipto, said the military was prepared to give up all 38 of its seats in Parliament within the next four years. The move follows widespread demands for the armed forces to get out of politics after decades of authoritarian rule. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
CHINA: TALKS WITH U.S. AS TAIWAN TENSIONS RISE -- With China raising new threats against Taiwan, the commander of the Pacific Fleet, Adm. Dennis Blair, arrives on Sunday to meet with Chinese military leaders. American diplomats said the four-day visit had been "in the works for quite a while," and was not specifically related to Taiwan. Elisabeth Rosenthal (NYT)
 
INDIA: COALITION TESTED -- In its first test since assuming power four months ago, the ruling Hindu nationalist-led coalition appeared headed for decisive election victories in state elections in Haryana and Orissa. But it appeared to be falling behind in Bihar, India's second-most-populous state. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
 
EUROPE
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: ARMY BASE BOMBING -- A small bomb exploded early yesterday at an army base, the authorities said. No one was injured in the blast, the second in the past three weeks. The Continuity I.R.A., a splinter group that has refused to abide by the cease-fire reached by the province's main nationalist and unionist groups, claimed responsibility. Sarah Lyall (NYT)
 
GERMANY: DRUG CENTERS -- The government adopted a law allowing drug addicts to use special injection centers that provide clean needles and health counseling. Germany, Switzerland and Spain have been experimenting with such programs, but the United Nations said earlier this week that injection centers could be a violation of international law. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
SENEGAL: ELECTION ON SUNDAY -- The eight candidates in Sunday's presidential election wound up their campaigns, as the main opposition candidate, Abdoulaye Wade, warned of violence if the voting was not fair. President Abdou Diouf is running for a fourth consecutive term, but he faces three credible opponents and is not assured of victory. Norimitsu Onishi (NYT)
 
SIERRA LEONE: PEACEKEEPERS EXCHANGE FIRE -- United Nations peacekeepers exchanged fire for the first time this week with Revolutionary United Front rebels, who have repeatedly flouted a shaky peace accord. A United Nations statement said the peacekeepers fired on rebels trying to loot a village on Pepel Island, 70 miles north of the capital, Freetown, on Wednesday. The troops then freed prisoners held by the rebels. The rebels also blocked Indian and Ghanaian United Nations troops trying to enter the diamond mining heartland. (AP)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CUBA: DISSIDENT CONVICTED -- The first major trial of a Cuban dissident in over a year ended after four hours, with the authorities sentencing Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet, 38, to three years in prison -- less than half of what state prosecutors requested -- for protests like hanging the nation's flag upside-down. Despite the international attention focused on the case, the Cuban police detained several dissidents and discouraged others from attending the trial. David Gonzalez (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: SILENCE ON KIDNAPPINGS -- Jorge Rafael Videla, the dictator who ruled Argentina in the 1970's, refused to testify before a federal judge investigating his role in the kidnappings of babies born to political prisoners. Mr. Videla, who has remained under house arrest for more than a year, invoked his constitutional right to remain silent. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: NEW LABOR CODE -- As a threatened national strike fizzled, the lower house of the Congress passed a labor code designed to lengthen probation periods for newly hired workers, weaken the bargaining power of national unions and otherwise cut business costs. The bill now goes to the Senate, where President Fernando de la Rua may have to compromise with the opposition to enact his most important economic initiative. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
MEXICO: ANGER AT U.S. OVER DRUG COMMENTS -- After Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow said Mexico had assumed a leading role in international drug trafficking and compared it to Sicily's position as a world headquarters for the Mafia, the Foreign Ministry called in the American charge d'affaires, James Derham, to express "the surprise of the Mexican government" and to insist that Mexico is cooperating vigorously in the drug war. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL, LEBANON: FIGHTING FLARES AGAIN -- After a lull of close to a week, fighting resumed in south Lebanon. Israeli warplanes fired six rockets, there was an exchange of ground fire near the Israeli border and a mortar shell landed in a field in northern Israel. No one was injured. Deborah Sontag (NYT)

HEADLINE: On Health Care, Gore or Bradley?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "The Bradley Trip" (column, Feb. 24), by Bob Herbert: The implicit message in Al Gore's "step-by-step" approach to health care reform is that the steps will be in the right direction: the Clinton administration's approach since the failure of its comprehensive health plan. 
 Yet since 1993 the number of uninsured in the United States has increased by more than four million people. The number covered by Medicaid has declined by nearly as many. The paradox of a booming economy and dramatic increases in people without health insurance is hardly an argument for political caution. It's a sign of a failing health care system and failed leadership.
Mr. Herbert may be correct that our leaders will be afraid to take up this issue again. But only dramatic steps will lead to improvement.

HEADLINE: THE DIALLO VERDICT: THE REACTION;
Verdict Bares Sharp Feelings On Both Sides

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Strong and deeply polarized emotions -- anger, bitter indignation and stunned disbelief on one side, and expressions of relief and vindication on the other -- rippled across the metropolitan area last night as politicians, community leaders and ordinary New Yorkers reacted swiftly to the acquittal of four white police officers in the killing of an unarmed black immigrant, Amadou Diallo.
In a case that had painfully divided the city along racial and political lines for more than a year, the verdict -- televised and watched in offices, in homes, in stores and shopping centers -- came in the late afternoon as an enormous emotional release for people whose feelings had been building toward a climax during the four-week trial. 
 There were no serious or widespread disturbances, but in Brooklyn and the Bronx, in Queens, Harlem and Midtown Manhattan, at City Hall and in the suburbs, the reaction was spontaneous, vehement and, judging by rough numbers in quick interviews and by the heat of the comments, largely negative.
Crowds chanting "Murderers!" gathered in a cold rain outside the courthouse in Albany, and outside the Bronx building where Mr. Diallo was slain in a hail of 41 bullets. As police officers watched silently, many in the crowds shouted angrily of injustice upon injustice.
Two men held up black wallets outside the vestibule on Wheeler Avenue where the victim died. "It looks like a gun," someone jeered. Mr. Diallo had been pulling out his wallet when the officers, who said they thought it was a gun, shot him.
"I cried when those cops went free," said Cecile E. Bailey, 57, who has lived on Story Avenue, near the scene of the shooting, for 28 years. "You don't shoot a human being 41 times. You don't shoot a dog 41 times."
Much of the reaction was predictable: the black and Hispanic communities in Harlem denouncing the acquittals as a travesty, while a mixed response was more apparent in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and the Riverdale section of the Bronx. "Justice was done, the system worked," said Steve Shek, 32, of Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. "It was a horrible accident, and the cops deserve to go free. They should never have been charged in the first place."
Commuters in Midtown and people on the streets of Harlem, Brooklyn and other sections of the city paused for interviews or to talk among themselves about the outcome. Most said they thought that the verdict was unfair, or that the prosecution had performed inadequately. Many expressed the hope that federal civil rights charges might be brought against the officers.
Some expressed no surprise, saying they had known when the venue was switched to Albany that the officers would be acquitted. Others said they were flabbergasted that the officers had not been found guilty of something, anything.
Jonathan Johnson, a black unemployed Harlem resident, was astonished. "Acquitted on all charges? Not even reckless endangerment?" he said. "I bet if a stray bullet had hit a white person they would have been convicted of something. It goes back to slavery. They think that we are property and they can kill us."
Many said that the issue was not that the officers fired at Mr. Diallo, but that they fired so many times.
Many immigrants, who had watched the trial closely, said the officers should have taken into account that there may have been a language barrier. "At least they should have understood that some people don't speak English well," David Cruz, 22, of the Dominican Republic, said in Spanish.
There were pleas for calm by City Hall, by Mr. Diallo's parents and by the Rev. Al Sharpton, who said: "We do not want to tarnish his name with any violence. Let not one brick be thrown. Let not one bottle be thrown. Do not confuse us with the violent ones, the reckless ones."
And despite the intensity of feelings over the verdict, there were no reports of serious or widespread violence, although a few scuffles broke out, people banged on cars outside the 43rd Precinct station and marchers tried to disrupt traffic on the Bronx River Parkway. At least 15 people were arrested.
Reaction to the verdict was hardly one-sided, and it often crossed racial lines. Some whites said they thought the officers should have been found guilty of something, while there were blacks who said they thought that the officers had received a fair trial and that justice had been done.
"I'm pleased with the outcome," said Mayimuna Pettiford, a black neighbor of one of the acquitted officers, Edward McMellon, in Park Slope, Brooklyn. "I've known him and his family for 10 years. He's not a racist. He's an empathetic soul."
At City Hall, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani expressed sympathy for the Diallo family and called the shooting a tragedy, but he also voiced support for the acquitted police officers and, paraphrasing the judge, said that "the book is closed on this case."
He said the trial, which had been moved to Albany from the Bronx because of pretrial publicity and what he called a "carnival atmosphere," had been fair, and he expressed doubt that a federal review would find any basis for a new trial of the officers on civil rights charges.
The verdict even attracted attention in the presidential campaign. Former Senator Bill Bradley, speaking to reporters in Everett, Wash., said he was stunned by the acquittals. "I think that it shows that when racial profiling seeps so deeply into somebody's mind, a wallet in the hand of a white man looks like a wallet, but a wallet in the hand of a black man looks like a gun."
Vice President Al Gore, flying from Ohio to California, issued a more neutral statement, urging calm and noting that the case would now be reviewed by the Justice Department. "That review should be thorough and fair," Mr. Gore said.
In Albany, the acquitted officers and their families were hustled from the courthouse to waiting vans, but the crowd of protesters saw them and shouted "Guilty!" and "Murderers!" Later, Mr. Diallo's parents spoke briefly. Saikou Diallo said moving the trial to Albany was "the second murder" of his son, while his former wife, Kadiatou Diallo, thanked the family's supporters and asked for "your calm and prayers."
In New York, the reaction of political leaders was mixed.
State Senator David A. Paterson, a Harlem Democrat, said he was disappointed but not surprised by the verdict, calling it part of a pattern of acquittals of officers who had killed black people, including Michael Stewart and Eleanor Bumpurs. "Juries acquit because of the general premise that police officers are always acting in the right," he said.
Former Mayor David N. Dinkins said he was "outraged and very disappointed" by the acquittals, and said the verdict suggested that the Street Crime Unit (whose slogan is "We own the night") "can do pretty much as they wish."
The City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, did not criticize the verdict, but used the occasion to repeat his call for police reforms including residency requirements, and improved training and community relations. City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi and the public advocate, Mark Green, offered similar statements.
But the real passion over the verdict was to be found on the streets of New York and Albany. A scuffle briefly broke out among factions of Diallo supporters outside the courthouse in Albany after the verdict. One faction was shouting in protest, while the other wanted demonstrators to remain quiet. The police quickly moved in.
In the Bronx, two people were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest at 7:45 p.m. as they marched on the Bronx River Parkway toward the 43rd Precinct station on Fteley Avenue. Barricades were set up as a large crowd of protesters gathered, but the demonstration had grown quiet by 8:30 p.m. Later, 13 people were arrested in bottle-throwing and other protests.

HEADLINE: THINK TANK;
Rhode Island and Slavery? How Much to Read Into an Old Name

BYLINE: By Laurence Zuckerman

 BODY:
If the presidential candidates thought they were finished with bitter and parochial historical debates like whether the Confederate flag should fly over South Carolina's state capitol, they were mistaken. Tiny Rhode Island, which will hold its primary on March 7, could offer another uncomfortable controversy.
At a breakfast last month in honor of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the Rev. Virgil Wood, a pastor in Providence and president of the Ministers' Alliance, a group of African-American clergy in the state, announced a campaign to remove the word "plantations" from Rhode Island's official name. Most people probably don't realize that its full name is State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. 
 Resentment over the name has simmered in the state's small black population for years to little effect. But the conflict in South Carolina revived the issue, igniting a new debate over the state's slave-era history.
Within a week of Mr. Wood's remarks, an editorial in the Providence Journal opposed changing the state's name, arguing that the word plantations had little to do with slavery at the time it was attached to the state name. "The slave trade was important to the later Colonial economy of Rhode Island, but slavery itself never was essential to farming here or comparable to its institutionalization in the South," the paper wrote. "To eradicate the word because of later associations in another part of the country makes no sense. It panders to outright ignorance of history."
Critics immediately responded that it was the Journal that was ignorant of history. On the Web site of The American Prospect magazine, Jeremy Derfner wrote that the Journal's reaction was consistent with a long record of denial of the prominence of slavery in New England as described by the historian Joanne Pope Melish in her 1998 book, "Disowning Slavery: Gradual Emancipation and 'Race' in New England, 1780-1860" (Cornell University Press).
Ms. Melish, an associate professor of history at the University of Kentucky, writes that on the eve of the Revolution one of every 14 people in Rhode Island was a slave, the largest proportion in all the New England colonies. She argues that the need to portray a virtuous North battling the slave-holding South during the Civil War resulted in the creation of a "mythology of a free New England" in the antebellum period and that the notion persists to this day.
Apart from the central role that the ports of Bristol, Providence and Newport played in the slave trade, Professor Melish makes the case that slavery was far more important to New England's economy than is commonly recognized by historians.
"What New Englanders like to do is admit the trade and deny the domestic institution of slavery," she said in an interview.
Professor Melish and with other historians acknowledge that plantation is a medieval English word describing farmlands that had no direct connection to slavery when Rhode Island received its royal charter in the 17th century. The state's name refers to settlements on the island where Newport is, which was then known as Rhode Island, and to those on the mainland, which were collectively called Providence Plantations.
That makes little difference to Mr. Wood, who argues that African-Americans are still pained by the word. "It is a requirement of a civil society that it does not insult some of its citizens knowingly," he said. "And there is no longer any room for not knowing."
Leading politicians in the state have not rallied to his call. Lisa Pelosi, spokeswoman for Gov. Lincoln C. Almond, a Republican, said that he "is inclined not to be in favor of changing the name of the state" but added that he could change his mind if the idea became more popular.
The state's full name appears only on official proclamations and some official stationery. "Most people don't refer to the state as Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, but some people have become very vested in the name all of a sudden," said David N. Cicilline, a Democratic state representative. "I'm not exactly sure why."
Mr. Cicilline said the name should be changed because "it carries the vestiges of a hurtful time in American history, and we don't need it." He recently introduced a bill that would convene a constitutional convention, which is required to revise the state's charter.
But Keith Stokes, the executive director of the Newport Chamber of Commerce, a local historian who is an expert on early African-American and Jewish settlement in the area and an African-American, said that changing the name would be "at best historical revisionism and and at worst downright censorship."
Though he is sympathetic to Mr. Wood's cause, he said the point should be to help people understand the complexity of the past, not to erase it. "History is history," he explained. "We can't revise it for the people of today."
Professor Melish, who grew up in Connecticut and lived for many years in Rhode Island, supports changing the name because "its continued use gives the subordination of African-Americans a sort of currency." The name is also objectionable, she said, because it appears to endorse the domination of the rest of the state by the city of Providence.

HEADLINE: Democrats Look to Montana For Break in Republican Sea

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: HELENA, Mont., Feb. 22

 BODY:
The Rocky Mountain West is about as Republican as any region of the country gets these days. All five states -- Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming -- are led by Republican governors, and each state has a Congressional delegation that is overwhelmingly Republican.
Elections this year are not likely to change the lineup in four of the states. But here in Montana, where Republican dominance is relatively new, Democrats believe they have their best chance for a major breakthrough. 
 Gov. Marc Racicot is barred by law from seeking a third term. Representative Rick Hill, a two-term Republican who holds the state's only House seat, is retiring for medical reasons. And Senator Conrad Burns, a Republican who once promised to serve only two terms, has given Democrats an issue by seeking a third.
"The pendulum is swinging back," said Bob Ream, chairman of the Montana Democratic Party, offering a view Republicans ardently dispute. "We think we have strong possibilities in all three races."
Unlike some of its neighbors, Montana has a rich Democratic history. Mike Mansfield served five terms in the House and four in the Senate through 1977. In 1988, Mr. Burns became just the second Montana Republican ever elected to the Senate, winning 36 years after the first, Zales Ecton, left it. Mr. Hill's predecessor was Pat Williams, a Democrat who retired after 18 years.
And three Democrats served as governor over 20 years before Stan Stephens won for the Republicans in 1988 and was followed four years later by Mr. Racicot.
Montanans have shown a streak of independence, as well. While Mr. Racicot just squeaked by in 1992 with 51 percent of the vote, Montanans favored Bill Clinton over President George Bush and gave Ross Perot one of his best showings anywhere with 26 percent of the vote.
Four years later, Mr. Racicot won with a resounding 79 percent of the vote -- his initial Democratic challenger, Chet Blaylock, died three weeks before the election -- but Bob Dole defeated President Clinton by only three percentage points.
"Generally, people in Montana are always open to new possibilities," Mr. Racicot said, reflecting the unpredictable nature of the state electorate. "We are ruggedly individualistic. Particularly in political activities, we have a very personal and high level of involvement."
At the top of the Democrats' wish list this year is Nancy Keenan, their House candidate, who has proved to be one of the most successful vote-getters in state history. A former state lawmaker who has served the last 12 years as superintendent of Montana's Office of Public Instruction, Ms. Keenan won more votes in her last election, 1996, than the state's Democratic senator, Max Baucus, did in winning a fourth term the same year.
Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the party was counting Mr. Hill's seat, one of 22 that Republicans are vacating for retirement or pursuit of higher office, as one of the six seats Democrats need to regain control of the House.
Republicans hold 24 of the 29 House seats from the Rocky Mountain States. Few, if any, incumbents are expected to lose, and the only open seat in the region is Montana's. But among Democratic challengers in the five states, no one has a better chance than Ms. Keenan, said Charles E. Cook Jr., a nonpartisan analyst in Washington who follows federal elections. He rates the race a tossup.
Ms. Keenan's chief advantage derives from her popularity and high name recognition. But she is facing another strong and well-known opponent in Dennis Rehberg, who stepped down as lieutenant governor to run against Mr. Baucus in 1996 and gave him his toughest race in four elections, losing by just five percentage points. Mr. Rehberg also won more of Montana's 56 counties in his race than Ms. Keenan did in hers.
New statewide laws on term limits have led to a traffic jam in the Democratic primary race for governor among three men who are friends and colleagues. Unable to run again, the men, Attorney General Joseph P. Mazurek, State Auditor Mark O'Keefe and Secretary of State Mike Cooney are all campaigning on the same themes -- raising incomes that are among the lowest in the country, expanding the economy and improving education -- but offering slightly different solutions.
The survivor is likely to face Judy Martz, the current lieutenant governor and the first woman to hold that position, who is facing a primary challenge from the right in Rob Natelson, a law professor at the University of Montana.
Mr. O'Keefe is regarded as the favorite among the Democrats although recent polls show that he would lose a close race to Ms. Martz.
The Senate race is probably the most difficult for the Democrats. After a narrow victory in 1988 to upset Senator John Melcher, a three-term Democrat, Mr. Burns had an easier time six years later, brushing aside Jack Mudd, a law professor, by nearly 2 to 1.
This time, Mr. Burns is facing Brian Schweitzer, a farmer who last ran for office in college, winning the presidency of the American Society of Agronomy Students.
Mr. Schweitzer is already in full attack mode, criticizing Mr. Burns as a pawn of special interests who went back on his word to serve only two terms. Matt Raymond, a spokesman for Mr. Burns, said that the senator would have been satisfied to quit after two terms if the Supreme Court had not ruled term limits for federal office unconstitutional and that Mr. Burns would respond to criticism after the primary.
That does not satisfy Mr. Schweitzer, who is substantially behind Mr. Burns in fund-raising. "Our economy is imploding," he said. "We need new leadership. People all over Montana are ready for a change."
As usual.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE PROVING GROUND;
Ohio Like Michigan, With Higher Hurdles

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 25

 BODY:
This state resembles Michigan in its demographics and politics, and on March 7, Senator John McCain hopes to replicate here his stunning victory in the Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday.
To do that, he will have to overcome, as he did in Michigan, the support Gov. George W. Bush is getting from the popular Republican governor and most of the rest of the party's officials in Ohio. 
 He will also have to win, as he did in Michigan, the support of thousands of unionized factory workers who split from the Democratic Party in the 1980's to vote for Ronald Reagan and then returned to the fold to vote for Bill Clinton in the 1990's.
But he will have the advantage of favorable voting rules. As was the case in Michigan, independents and Democrats are free to vote and choose delegates in the Republican primary here. But unlike the situation in Michigan, there will be a Democratic primary that could siphon votes from Mr. McCain.
Today, Mr. McCain began running television commercials statewide, making him the first presidential candidate in either party this year to advertise extensively here. On Saturday, he will campaign in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati, the first time he has set foot in Ohio in the race except for two quick fund-raisers last year. No other candidate this year has spent a full day campaigning across Ohio.
"We're starting off behind, but I really think he has a chance to win," said Senator Mike DeWine, the only politician of any note in Ohio who is supporting Mr. McCain.
Remarking on Mr. McCain's television advertisements and his ambitious schedule on Saturday, Curt Steiner, an experienced Republican organizer here who is working as a volunteer for the Arizona senator, said, "We now have clear evidence that John McCain is going to work to win Ohio."
So far, New York and California, where 263 delegates to the Republican National Convention are at stake in March 7 primaries open only to Republicans, have overshadowed Ohio, which has 69 delegates.
Even the newspapers have offered little coverage.
At a mall in Dublin, on the outskirts of Columbus, it was clear that none of the dozen people interviewed on Thursday night had begun to focus on the campaign.
A telephone company technician said he always voted for the candidate his union backed, but he did not yet know who that was this year. Mary Massey, a stay-at-home mother who hopes to get a real estate license, said she would certainly vote for a Republican but needed to know more about the candidates' views on abortion and education before she decided which one.
But now it looks as if things are about to pop. "The Michigan results were like a mug of hot coffee in terms of waking people up," Mr. Steiner said.
On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore was in Cleveland today speaking at a retirement home about long-term care. Former Senator Bill Bradley's campaign opened storefront offices in seven locations around the state this week and began hiring people to operate telephone banks, the campaign's spokesman, Alan Melamed, said.
The consensus in Democratic circles is that Mr. Gore should win handily. Union members and African-Americans are disproportionately important in Democratic primaries in Ohio, and Mr. Gore seems to have solid support from those groups.
Mr. Bush plans to be in the state early next week, his campaign said. And Gov. Bob Taft, the chairman of the Bush campaign in Ohio, said in an interview in his office on Thursday that he planned to spend an increasing amount of his own time and energy on the primary.
"Bush has got to win in Ohio to become the nominee," Governor Taft said. That may well be the case for Mr. McCain too, and he faces substantial obstacles.
The most serious one is that some of the kinds of Democrats and independents who provided the McCain margin of victory in Michigan, where only the Republicans were holding a primary, will doubtless vote in the Democratic primary in Ohio.
"I fully expect him to win the same proportion of the Republican vote he won in Michigan," Governor Taft said, "and I don't think there will be enough independents and Democrats to make up the difference."
In Michigan, Mr. Bush won two-thirds of the votes from Republicans. But more than half of the voters in the primary were independents or Democrats, and they went heavily for Mr. McCain.
Like Michigan, Ohio is a state with decaying cities and prosperous, sprawling suburbs; with old factories, heavily unionized, and sparkling new high-tech companies; with fertile farmlands and scores of booming small towns. In recent years, Republicans have dominated the governments in both states, but Mr. Clinton carried both states in the last two presidential elections.
Governor Taft said he did not expect to be embarrassed the way Gov. John Engler was in Michigan. Mr. Engler threw all his political weight behind Governor Bush only to see him lose, partly because some Democrats who did not like Mr. Engler voted for Mr. McCain.
Mr. Engler has been governor for nearly a decade. Mr. Taft has been in office for only a year. "I haven't had the time to accumulate as many enemies," Mr. Taft said.
In addition, Ohio does not have a tradition of crossover voting like New Hampshire and Michigan, said John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.
The last public polls in Ohio showed Mr. Bush with a comfortable lead, but they were in early February, before the primaries in South Carolina and Michigan. That makes them irrelevant to the situation today, said Eric Rademacher, a pollster at the University of Cincinnati.
Mr. Bush has at least some organization in each of Ohio's 88 counties. Mr. McCain will have to rely on his commercials and the attention he draws from campaigning personally in the state. He is getting no help from party leaders, who last week abruptly canceled a Republican dinner in Cleveland where the senator was to be the featured speaker.
The two commercials Mr. McCain's campaign began broadcasting today emphasize his determination to take on what the advertisements call "special interests."
The senator has no organization in the state whatsoever and not a single paid staff member.
"To call us loose knit," said Mr. Steiner, "would be an exaggeration."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 1, 2000, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article and a chart on Saturday surveying voter turnout this year referred incorrectly to a record for a Michigan's Republican primary. While more people voted this time than in the 1976 primary, this year's turnout was not a record. Because the voting-age population has grown, the turnout was 17 percent of those eligible, compared with the record of 17.4 in 1976.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Subjecting Greenspan's Theories to Peer Review

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
ECONOMIC theory is wonderfully pliable. Just when the Federal Reserve seemed to be running out of reasons to slow the economy in anticipation of a rising inflation rate that is taking forever to rise, Alan Greenspan has in the last 10 days come up with a new theory that requires the Fed to act, and quickly.
Mr. Greenspan's thesis makes productivity both a blessing and a curse: a blessing, because it raises the supply of goods and services, and a curse, because -- working through the stock market -- it increases the demand. The demand, in fact, outstrips the newly augmented supply. Shortages then raise prices and the inflation rate. 
 That is quite a mouthful of a theory, but one hard to ignore when coming from the Fed's august chairman. The same proposition, offered by an ordinary economist, would end up buried in an economics journal, peppered with challenges from peers.
Listen to peer review from Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate at M.I.T.: "You cannot say that the Greenspan thesis is nonsense or cannot happen. But it is not enough to say that it is happening. You need a lot of numbers work to convince a person that what he says represents a clear and present danger."
Alan S. Blinder of Princeton University, a former Fed vice chairman, makes a similar point. "This is sound economic theorizing," he said, " but does it fit the facts?"
Fitting theory -- and policy -- to the facts has been a great source of angst lately at the Fed. To the Fed, as well as to many mainstream economists, the booming economy must result in too much demand and inflationary shortages. The problem is that shortages and inflation are not in sight. Still, the Fed has started down the path of higher rates to slow the economy and dilute demand.
That puts a lot of pressure on theory to justify a slowdown that will inevitably hurt a lot of Americans. Perhaps that is why Mr. Greenspan felt compelled to put a new layer of explanation on top of the two theories he has long proffered to explain how the nation has sidestepped rising prices this long but cannot do so any longer.
One holds that we have avoided shortages and inflation because the Asian crisis and a weak Europe diverted a lot of goods to America that could not be sold elsewhere. A strong dollar helped to keep the prices of these imports down, and oil was also abundant and cheap. Now, however, these "favorable supply shocks" are disappearing. The second theory says that the pool of available workers was deeper than anticipated, thanks in part to so many immigrants. But the pool is finally running dry and soon wages will rise as employers bid for workers. Companies will then raise prices to cover the higher wage costs.
These are old-line theories shared by many economists and forecasters. The new one puts Mr. Greenspan out alone on a limb. "Like any human being, he has his hunches and his sense of what is going on, and he is looking around for rationalizations," Mr. Solow said.
Mr. Greenspan's new rationale marries two observations. On the one hand, the economy is booming without inflation partly because productivity has risen; workers produce more goods and services per hour, and the revenue from the added output fattens profits and pays for raises, without higher prices. On the other hand, the voracious consumption that makes the economy so robust comes largely from rising stock prices; people feel wealthier, and this wealth effect prompts them to spend more than their incomes, borrowing to do so.
The new Greenspan link is this: The pickup in productivity has raised expectations that productivity will continue to rise, or at least level off at a higher rate than in the recent past. The prospect of better productivity ahead has raised expectations of higher corporate profits, and share prices have risen in anticipation, increasing the wealth effect and the spending. The rub, as Mr. Greenspan put it last week, is that the stock market is "creating additional purchasing power for which no additional goods or services have yet been produced." So excess demand will create inflationary shortages, unless the Fed's higher rates reduce the steam.
That is a neat theory. The stock market may have gone way up for quite rational reasons, not irrational speculation. But does this theory square with the facts?
Mr. Solow, for his part, is not convinced that the wealth effect is really the source of so much spending and investment. And Mr. Blinder wonders whether most of the improvement in productivity is behind us, in which case Mr. Greenspan's "thesis might be a better explanation of the last several years than the present."
Mr. Greenspan's theory, in fact, may be one more explanation that fails to justify the Fed's decision to raise interest rates. For now, anyway.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
How to Beat Mr. Greenspan's Stock Market

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
WHEN Alan Greenspan frets openly that stock prices have been rising faster than household incomes, it's a good idea to assume that this is highly practical information, something other than his frequently opaque comments.
With wealth from stock gains an increasingly large factor in propelling the economy, Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, fears that the additional spending this generates will revive inflation. 
 Taking him at his word implies that he would like for stocks to rise a little faster than the roughly 5 percent that incomes grew last year. Such an exercise is more art than science, of course, and Mr. Greenspan last week called this relationship a "diagnostic tool," not a target of policy.
Of course, not many people are likely to be satisfied with returns of 5 percent. But if that is what the overall market is returning, it is fair to assume that investors should be content to receive, say, double that amount.
And given last week's 357-point drop in the Dow Jones industrials, maybe even 10 percent is optimistic.
But how to hit that bogey? There are a number of strategies that are likely to provide a 10 percent return over the next year or so, and to do so without a sleep-depriving level of risk.
(One caveat: Trying to lock in a 10 percent return can mean relying on high dividends, which are taxed as ordinary income. So it may make sense for investors to use these strategies in an Individual Retirement Account or a 401(k) plan.)
A UTILITY STOCK The Dow Jones utilities index is yielding well over 4 percent, which gets an investor nearly halfway to that 10 percent goal right off the bat. But picking the right stock can mean a higher yield and better-than-average growth prospects. Consolidated Edison, which provides New York City and Westchester County with electricity and natural gas, is selling for little more than half its May 1999 high and now offers investors an 8.3 percent yield. The company is also buying back shares.
With Energy Nuclear of Jackson, Miss., reaffiriming interest in the Con Edison-owned Unit 2 of the Indian Point nuclear plant, despite a recent leak of radioactive steam, Con Ed stock is likely to rebound, said Barry Abramson, a PaineWebber analyst. Con Ed now trades at $26.1875.
"The stock is very cheap," he said, noting that Con Ed is acquiring Northeast Utilities, the biggest utility in New England. "The upside could be better than 10 percent, back into the 30's" by year-end. And Jeanne Mockard, manager of the Putnam Utilities Growth and Income fund, called it "one of the plainest vanilla" utilities, adding that it had very solid management.
A REAL ESTATE PLAY Real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, have lost about a fifth of their value over the last three years, so many investors presume that a lot of the risk has been rung out of the industry. But the highest-yielding REIT's may have trouble making their payouts; they have the poorest prospects for capital appreciation. So stick with quality.
One conservative candidate is AvalonBay Communities, which owns and runs apartment-house communities and yields 6.12 percent -- considerably less than many other REIT's. The company, based in Alexandria, Va., operates in expensive markets where space is tight and barriers to entry are high, mainly on the West Coast and in the Northeast.
That prompts Martin Cohen of Cohen & Steers Capital Management to suggest that AvalonBay, selling at less than 10 times projected funds from operations for 2000, could post a double-digit 12-month return from market appreciation alone. "Landlords have pricing power," he said.
A MUTUAL FUND OPTION Almost 71 percent of all diversified stock funds returned more than 10 percent in 1999. But the vast majority held big and risky technology stakes. That is one reason that Russel Kinnel, director of fund analysis at Morningstar Inc., suggested Lexington Corporate Leaders, an unusual $385 million no-load fund dating from 1935. It had just 4.3 percent of its assets in technology stocks last year. With a portfolio of 25 large-capitalization stocks that almost never changes, except for occasional spinoffs like Lucent Technologies from AT & T, the fund operates at very low cost and minimizes tax liability for shareholders. Such costs matter far more to investors when returns are relatively low.
The fund holds roughly the same number of shares in each of its companies and is always fully invested. It has lost money in only one calendar year since 1990, and yielded 3.36 percent as of Jan. 31.
"We have a lot of investors who see it as a core holding for domestic equities," said Richard Lavery, senior vice president of Lexington Management.
A BOND THAT CAN SIZZLE Convertible bonds -- and there are $400 billion of them worldwide -- can offer some of a stock's upside, but with limited risk. Clear Channel Communications, a San Antonio broadcasting and outdoor advertising company, has issued several of these hybrid securities, one of which John P. Calamos of Calamos Asset Management called an ideal candidate for producing a comfortable 10 percent total return.
While the company's 1 1/2 percent convertible debentures of 2002 pay very modest interest, he figures they could appreciate as much as 22 percent if the volatile common stock for which they can be exchanged goes up, adding that the company is a market leader in a consolidating industry. If the stock tumbles, the risk is at most a 7 percent loss, Mr. Calamos said.
"We have a nice risk-reward," he said. And barring insolvency, any loss can be avoided by holding these investment-grade securities until maturity in December 2002, less than three years away.
This Clear Channel issue closed at $97.23 on Friday, yields 2.55 percent and is convertible into 9.45 shares of common stock.
A BET ON EUROPE With the euro down 16.4 percent since its introduction at the beginning of last year, many strategists think a rebound is due. That would make a 10 percent return that much easier for Americans.
Although its dividend is less than 1 percent and the stock has more than doubled since last March, Royal Philips Electronics is as good a candidate as any in Europe to return 10 percent at minimal risk this year, said Thomas Murtha, a portfolio manager for Rowe Price-Fleming International.
Philips, the Dutch giant that suffered some setbacks in the 1990's, "is a great restructuring story -- starting to hit on all cylinders," said Mr. Murtha, who expects earnings to climb to 8 euros this year, from 5.22 euros. That should help drive the stock as high as 250 euros within 12 months, he said; it now trades at 198.80 euros.
Philips is gaining market share in consumer and other businesses, including semiconductors, Mr. Murtha said, but economic and market prospects in Europe, where spending on information technology has much room for growth, seem brighter than in the United States. "Their order book looks very, very good," Mr. Murtha said.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

DATELINE: NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.

 BODY:
IN the $14.7 trillion bond market, Bill Gross, who manages $90 billion directly for the Pacific Investment Management Company, is the big name -- and he has a track record for being right.
So it is not surprising that he is getting credit for realizing the impact that the Treasury's plan to buy back long-term government debt would have on the bond market. He seized the opportunity in late January and early February, and his voracious buying of long-term Treasuries for 21 trading days sent tremors through the bond market and earned Pimco's clients money. 
 But a closer look shows -- and Mr. Gross acknowledges -- that he did not do nearly as well as he should have.
He did not begin to buy his $8 billion of long-term Treasury bonds, bond futures and zero coupon bonds until Jan. 20. That was a full week after the Treasury said it would buy back up to $30 billion in long-term debt this year. And it was six months after it became clear the government would have to make such purchases, as the federal budget surplus allowed it to pay off billions of dollars of the publicly held government debt.
"I should have been shifting to that strategy long before January," Mr. Gross said last week in an interview in the partners' retreat at Pimco's headquarters here. He acknowledged that he had even recommended buying Treasuries in a newspaper article back in August, but failed to take his own advice. "Why it took so long for me, or us, I have no idea," he said.
To make matters worse, Mr. Gross passed up adding to his Treasury bond cache at the Treasury auction on Feb. 10, because he thought the bonds were too expensive, compared with the 10-year note at the time. "We should not have passed," he says now.
And in early January, Mr. Gross adjusted a derivative-based options bet on long-term interest rates, expecting them to remain over 6.30 percent. But the sudden rally in 30-year bonds turned that into a mistake. "I would love to tell you that Pimco made a coup, that we had made millions of bucks and put that in a headline," he said. But that is not the case. Instead, he said: "We haven't had a great offensive year but we played a pretty good defense. It could have been a Pimco disaster, but it wasn't."
Even after all this, his flagship mutual fund, the $30 billion Total Return fund, is not positioned the way he wants, because he still has too few long-term Treasury securities -- the current winners -- and too many mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds -- the current losers. This just shows how hard it is to change a strategy quickly when a fund is so big. And it underscores the premium on acting as early as possible.
"The changes seem minuscule, and they are," he said, speaking in the context of managing a fund that has grown more than thirtyfold in the last decade. "We wish we were able to do more."
But he added that it was especially hard to figure what to do right now. "At this point," he said, "we are one with the rest of the bond market, wondering what is going to happen from here."
This is not an easy time for a man of Mr. Gross's reputation, a man who craves the Wall Street limelight from 2,780 miles away. "I'm not famous in the Hollywood sense, but I have had my minutes, and I must confess that fame is something I've always wanted, more than money or power," he wrote in his book, "Bill Gross on Investing."
Mr. Gross, 54, is far more driven then his mild manner implies. And while he appeared weary -- his mother, Shirley, had just died -- he was pleased by new strategies he had recently put in effect. But his most recent brush with fame is worrying him. The pending purchase of Pimco's parent, Pimco Advisors, by Allianz, the German insurance giant, will make him the best-paid executive on Wall Street, with a $40 million guarantee for each of the next five years. And he gets a salary to boot.
"The only real feeling is apprehension, is living up to the reputation," he said.
Still, Mr. Gross is not one to whine. He finished the last five miles of a five-day, 125-mile run -- on a challenge from the woman he loved at the time -- with a ruptured kidney. The breath in which he acknowledges an investment mistake is followed in the next with a new market strategy. And even if late and too little, his new stash of long-term Treasuries has earned $40 million for the Total Return fund and $300 million for the entire Pimco fixed-income complex.
It is this combination of endurance, fresh thinking and quick recoveries that has made him the most successful fixed-income fund manager over the last decade. While he has not been No. 1 in performance in any quarter, he is the No. 1 performer for the last 10 years among mutual funds followed by Lipper Inc. So far this year, the Total Return fund is 89th among 288 funds followed by Lipper, with a return of 0.95 percent.
It is the needs of his investors that drive him to to strive for consistency, rather than, as he puts it, "shooting the lights out" from quarter to quarter. "To be a survivor and a dominant force in the market, you have to be consistent," he said. "And that's the way you have to be with bond investors. They are conservative. You don't want to disappoint a bond investor for long."
That is just what he would have done if he kept to what was the consensus strategy for the fixed-income market as this year began. He expected Treasury yields to remain in a range of 6 percent to 6.5 percent. Because there would be little to be gained in such a range-bound Treasury market, his Total Return fund was 50 percent mortgage-backed securities, 20 percent investment-grade corporate bonds, 6 percent emerging-markets bonds and 3 percent high-yield, or junk, bonds, all of which were offering higher yields than Treasuries. The rest was in Treasuries. The maturities in the fund were clustered in the intermediate range, making their prices less sensitive to the small rise in interest rates he expected.
He hoped to enhance this return by using a derivative-based strategy known as a strangle. Mr. Gross sold options giving the buyer the right to sell bond futures to Pimco at a fixed price if interest rates rose beyond a set point. A second set of options required Pimco to sell bond futures to the buyers if interest rates fell below a set level. Together, the positions amounted to a bet that 30-year Treasury bond yields would stay between 6 percent and 6.70 percent. If they did, the options would not be exercised and his Total Return fund could pocket the $70 million premium for selling the options. If interest rates were above or below the range on the day the options expired, Feb. 18, he could lose the premium -- or more.
In early January, when the yield on the 30-year bond briefly hit 6.75 percent, Mr. Gross adjusted the option position to raise the yield at the bottom of the range to 6.30 percent. With yields so high, he did not think there was much chance they could drop that far by Feb. 18. "I figured it was easy money," Mr. Gross said.
He did not realize how wrong-footed his portfolio was until after the Treasury announced its $30 billion buyback of long-term debt on Jan. 13, setting off a rally that has sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down almost two-thirds of a percentage point, to 6.14 percent on Friday.
While he was doing his aerobic yoga at the gym near his office on Jan. 15, Mr. Gross said, "the light bulb went on." The rush to buy 30-year bonds, he thought, would help bring long-term interest rates sharply below shorter-term rates, inverting the yield curve. This meant that long-term bonds were the place to be, because the price would rise as the yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. And sticking with mortgages and corporates would be a loser. His option bet could also be in trouble.
So Mr. Gross and the seven others on Pimco's investment committee moved quickly. Pimco sold intermediate mortgages and intermediate Treasury securities and rushed to buy bonds, jolting bond traders, who sometimes refer to Pimco as the Beach, and helping set off panic buying and selling on Feb. 3 and Feb. 4, when the price on the long bond soared, then plunged.
All of the new long-term Treasuries, however, were not for the new strategy. About half, $3.7 billion, were needed to limit losses on the options bet if it turned sour.
And it did -- on Friday, Feb. 18, when the options were exercised as the yield on the 30-year bond futures dropped to 6.30 percent while the price rose to 94. Pimco had to give up $3.7 billion in 30-year bond futures at a price resulting in a loss, Mr. Gross said, of $50 million. It was the first loss he had ever had on a strangle, a strategy that had made about $200 million for the Total Return fund in 1999 alone.
While he moved late, Mr. Gross said figuring out what had to be done before many others "deserves a pat on the back."
"It felt like we were earning our paychecks," he said.
And he is working on new strategies. He is now betting that the growing federal budget surplus will lead to the shrinkage of supply of all maturities of Treasury securities. So he is buying them across the board. He said this strategy had made $100 million so far. "Nobody was focusing on the disappearance of Treasuries as an entire sector of the bond market," he said.
And he is not worried at all about the possible disappearance of the 30-year Treasury bond, the source of much of his grief this year. Mr. Gross has been in the fixed-income business since 1971, so he was around before the government began regularly issuing 30-year bonds in 1977. "The bond market will go on because it will find other benchmarks," he said. "I won't mourn its passing."
At least not as much as he regrets not buying 30-year bonds long before January.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
China's Own Witch Hunt

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
"WHO LOST TAIWAN?"
Imagine that the year is 2010 and that this headline is screeching from the People's Daily. China's Communist Party newspaper is pillorying the gang of traitors who allowed the nation's hallowed patrimony to be severed.
The scenario could go something like this: Hu Jintao, now President, Communist Party chief and chairman of the Central Military Commission, is the main scapegoat. He is in secret detention and the newspaper is calling for him to be tried for treason, along with several top generals and diplomats. 
 By 2010, the People's Liberation Army was supposed to have been able to take Taiwan by force, if it had come to that. But then the Taiwanese, fed up with years of threats from Beijing and encouraged by the ever deeper military ties mandated by the American Congress, finally voted to become independent.
And when the moment of truth came, after losing an initial battle in offshore islands to dazzling American technology, ashen-faced Chinese generals concluded that the opposing forces were simply too overwhelming to continue.
So: Who Lost Taiwan?
The question isn't being asked yet, of course, but imagining a day when it might be must be horrifying for China's leaders. For in China's history-laden politics, almost nothing matters more than the idea that Taiwan will eventually return to the motherland, especially now that Hong Kong and Macau are back in its bosom. And this emotional truth may help outsiders interpret the White Paper the Chinese leaders issued last week, warning more explicitly than before that Taiwan's foot-dragging in negotiations, let alone any declaration of independence, could force China to take "drastic measures."
"There is a growing sense of urgency in Beijing that Taiwan independence will not be the result of a dramatic declaration, but of a gradual drift towards that goal as the island plays for time," said Steven M. Goldstein, a political scientist at Smith College.
"Thus, in a collective leadership it has become imperative not only not to be the leader who lost Taiwan, but not to be the leader who allows this slow drift to continue," Mr. Goldstein said.
The White Paper was obviously intended to influence Taiwan's March 18 presidential elections. Americans have noted how ill-timed it was in other ways -- appearing just as Congress is taking up China's trade status, and a bill to strengthen military ties with Taiwan -- but it responded to some perfectly rational political imperatives in Beijing. And despite its belligerence, the report also contains terms for talks that by China's lights must seem so generous that they could be rejected only by an evil schemer -- like the current Taiwanese President, Lee Teng-hui, who has outraged the Chinese with his brinkmanship and his assertion of Taiwan's right to deal with China in a "state to state relationship," implying equal status.
Who knows whether President Jiang Zemin and other leaders really believe it when they say that most "compatriots" in Taiwan yearn for reunification, or when they say they are willing to risk a dreadful war? But they certainly don't want to be forced into a conflict that could destroy all they have built on the mainland.
At the same time, with hard-line military officers hovering and their own rhetoric pumping up the people, they cannot watch idly as Taiwan escapes. So the most important thing is to keep the dream alive. As long as it survives, so can their careers.
Mao once said that China would wait 100 years to recover Taiwan if it had to, Mr. Whiting noted. President Jiang has never set a deadline, in public at least. Nor does the report, with its warning against "indefinite" delays in negotiations. The day that China feels compelled to box itself in with a concrete deadline may be the day for really serious worry.
Notably, the new report does not even mention Taiwan's elections or the prospective new presidents. Rather, it demonizes the outgoing Mr. Lee. By presenting him as the chief culprit, the Chinese are making room for a fresh start -- but also putting the would-be successors on notice that they would repeat Mr. Lee's performance at Taiwan's peril.
Taiwan's own domestic politics may not allow much slippage from the brinkman's position staked out by Mr. Lee. But it is already clear, in the election campaign now under way, that all three candidates are searching for modest areas of common interest. FINESSING language about "one China" and "sovereignty" will be trickier, especially for the opposition candidate Chen Shui-bian, whose supporters lean more to independence.
daAny question can be discussed under the "one China" principle," the new report says, repeating the offer of better terms than Hong Kong got. Not only could Taiwan keep its capitalist economy, but "the central government will not send troops or administrative personnel to be stationed in Taiwan."
To Chinese who take reunification for granted, this seems like an incredibly good offer. But the Taiwanese, reveling in democracy and a prosperous economy, are acutely aware of the implicit assumptions. "We are electing a president here, not a governor," one official said.
Any negotiations will be plagued by agonizing wordplay and status issues, but Taiwan needs to find creative ways to keep the Chinese talking, it seems clear from last week's report. So long as they are talking, they will not be shooting. And nobody in Beijing will be asking who lost Taiwan.

HEADLINE: EDITORIAL OBSERVER;
The Precarious Nature of Latin Democracies

BYLINE: By TINA ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
In August 1962, the National Observer newspaper carried a report from South America with the headline "Democracy Dies in Peru, but Few Seem to Mourn Its Passing." The story described the indifference of Peruvians to a military coup that had just installed a junta in power. The young reporter was Hunter Thompson, who later became famous for a different style of journalism. As for Peru, much the same article could be published today.
Democracy swells and recedes in Latin America. In recent decades, the trend was favorable -- military rulers fell, leaving Cuba as the only outright dictatorship. But as in the 1960's and early 1970's, democratic rule is now being nibbled away in several countries, among them Peru. 
 The threat today is not from classic military dictatorship, but more subtle forms of autocracy -- often endorsed by a public angry at the corruption and ineptitude of its democratic political system. In Peru, President Alberto Fujimori will stand for a third term in April. He could do so only after sacking judges who ruled that a third term was unconstitutional, and he has rigged the campaign in his favor. In Ecuador last month, soldiers claiming to represent ordinary citizens against the political elite toppled the president and installed the vice president. In Venezuela, voters have granted sweeping powers to President Hugo Chavez, an army colonel who in 1992 attempted a military coup.
The history of democracy in Latin America is one of advances and setbacks. In 1960, for example, virtually every nation in South America had an elected civilian leader. By 1976, all but a few countries in Central and South America were dictatorships.
The climate for democracy in Latin America today is in many ways the best it has ever been, largely due to the end of the cold war. Washington is no longer helping to overthrow elected left-wing governments. The end of the cold war has also led to the abandonment of armed struggle by Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador, Guatemala and other nations. Peace is good for democracy. In those two countries, it has allowed civilians to assert greater control over the military, and peace agreements have helped make shallow democracies deeper and more inclusive.
Latin American nations are under political and economic pressure -- including from one another -- to keep the dictators out. In Chile, for example, when the nation's civilian leaders have attempted to prosecute military officers for Pinochet-era offenses, soldiers have responded with shows of insubordination. But this has not led Chile's upper class, the military's traditional backer, to call for a coup, in part because Chile's wealthy fear a reaction from the country's trading partners.
But the world is not as willing to focus critical attention on political systems that fall short of outright dictatorship. More important, voters will grant their leaders autocratic powers when they do not believe democracy has helped them. Democratic governments are currently unable to contain a crime wave in several nations that is persuading some Latin Americans to support undemocratic measures or strongman rule. As has often been the case, people in Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru have turned against the traditional party system because they see it as protecting the privileged. Globalization has increased inequality in much of Latin America and made the poor feel more neglected.
Dictatorship is no solution. Alongside their brutality, the continent's strongmen have brought even more theft and mismanagement -- which is usually why they have fallen. Although Gen. Augusto Pinochet gained worldwide praise for his economic reforms in Chile, he is an exception among Latin dictators.
Once in office, autocratic presidents can use their powers to grab far more than the usual advantages of incumbency. Peru used to have relatively clean elections, but few believe that Mr. Fujimori's electoral test in April will be a fair one. He has shut down virtually all critical television news and effectively controls the agencies that will oversee the election. Opposition politicians have been harassed, their campaign events are often sabotaged, and their paid commercials have been rejected by Lima's television networks.
Elected autocrats like Mr. Fujimori deserve scrutiny, just as outright dictators do. While the Clinton administration has been a consistent critic of rights violations in Peru, it must speak out more forcefully on flaws in the upcoming election. The most important lesson from the past, however, is for Latin America's democrats. If they cannot control corruption and make government work for the poor, they risk not only their hold on power but democracy itself.

HEADLINE: Indispensable Oil

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You report that the conventional wisdom has been that oil no longer matters in the age of the Internet (front page, Feb. 21). I guess that means that the Internet has freed us from the need to grow food, heat our homes, drive to work, fight wars, or manufacture and transport anything, since all of these activities depend heavily on oil. 
 And what about the soaring energy costs of producing and running our computers and the Internet, which consume more than 13 percent of the country's electricity? The brunt of this electric energy demand is borne by coal, but the mining and shipping of coal requires a lot of oil. When it comes to oil, the Internet's free lunch isn't very nourishing.

Dow Wow, Dow Ow

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Early in his forthcoming book, "Irrational Exuberance," Robert Shiller -- who has done more than any other economist of his generation to document the less rational aspects of financial markets -- describes the full-page advertisement that Merrill Lynch ran a year ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average passed 10,000. "Even those with a disciplined long-term approach like ours have to sit back and say 'wow,' " the ad declared. And the accompanying stock market chart bore the caption "HUMAN ACHIEVEMENT."
In the year to date, however, blue-chip investors, battered by interest rate fears, have experienced more ow than wow. On Friday the Dow zipped through 10,000 again, this time heading the other way. Will we soon see another chart, with the caption "HUMAN FAILURE"? 
 O.K., O.K., the Dow is still more than 50 percent higher than it was in December 1996, when Alan Greenspan tried unsuccessfully to dampen our exuberance. And other stock indices have not felt the Dow's pain: the broader S.&P. 500 index is still well above its level of a year ago, while the Nasdaq -- whose heavy weighting of tech stocks has made it the unofficial bellwether of the "new economy" -- keeps setting new records.
But that divergence of fortunes is very much to the point: although the chatter is all about Mr. Greenspan's next move, the question this market really poses is, Who will own the future?
The very fame of the Dow tends to make us forget that this is even a question. In Steve Bodow's hilarious 1997 Slate article "Dow te ching," one of the koans reads: "The Dow does not exist, yet all things exist within it / O.K., only 30 stocks exist within it / But it seems like a much bigger deal." It is common practice to speak loosely of "the Dow" when we really mean "stock prices in general" -- I've done it myself -- and many people compound that looseness by talking as if the Dow stocks represented a claim on the future earnings of corporate America. But they don't: if you buy the Dow, you only buy a claim on the future earnings of the companies currently in the index.
That's not a trivial distinction: to be bullish on the Dow you must believe not just that American capitalism will prosper, but that today's corporate giants will share proportionately in that prosperity -- not just for the next couple of years, but far into the future. And I mean far. To take an extreme example, the calculation that underlies last year's best seller "Dow 36,000" assumes that the earnings of today's Dow companies will grow as fast as overall corporate profits forever; and half of what the authors believe to be fair value comes from projected earnings after the year 2070. (Actually, even then you don't get 36K -- more like 20 -- but never mind.)
So do you believe that 70 years from now the Dow companies -- not the companies that will be in the Dow then, but the companies that are in it right now -- will capture the same share of corporate profits that they do today? The investors bidding up the Nasdaq, not to mention those buying into I.P.O.'s, clearly don't. They believe that whatsit.com has a good chance of being tomorrow's Microsoft, and correspondingly that today's General Electric -- or even today's Microsoft -- may be tomorrow's Sears, Roebuck. To be a serious Dow bull, you must believe that the new economy will belong to old companies; to justify the price of tech stocks, you must believe that the future belongs to the upstarts. Both beliefs can't be right.
Both could, on the other hand, be wrong. Mr. Shiller believes that the whole stock market, not just the Dow, is inflated by a speculative bubble. I'm sympathetic but not entirely convinced. The social and psychological hallmarks of a bubble -- like the fact that the TV in my local greasy pizza place is now tuned to CNBC, not ESPN -- are plain to see, but so is the spectacular pace of technological progress. I'm not sure that the current value of the Nasdaq is justified, but I'm not sure that it isn't.
In any case, the fall in the Dow is not a verdict on the economy as a whole. As long as we have full employment and low inflation, I say let the blue chips fall where they may.

If Only Stocks Were Votes . . .

BYLINE: By JULIE DUNN

 BODY:
Gary Bauer may be out of the race for the White House, but victory is still apparently his. Last year, according to his disclosure forms, he held some of the market's best performers, including Qualcomm (a $15,000-to-$50,000 stake as the year began, according to the forms) and i2 Technologies ($50,000 to $100,000). For the year, Qualcomm gained 2,683 percent, and i2, 542 percent (with a Friday sell-off still leaving it above last year's close). The value of his entire portfolio gained 183 percent, he says.
How could he campaign for president and still triumph in the market? "Maybe that was the secret of my success: I've been so busy I didn't have any time to sell last year," Mr. Bauer said in a telephone interview from Washington. There, he is chairman of the Campaign for Working Families, a political action group he started four years ago that supports conservative candidates. 
"I had a pretty good year," he added. "Obviously, I'm strongly in favor of abolishing the capital gains tax."
But Mr. Bauer does not favor just technology stocks. He mentioned Fannie Mae and cyclicals like General Motors as among those he feels are undervalued. "There are many buys in the Old Economy stocks being ignored right now that are at bargain prices," he said. "A year down the road a lot of people might be kicking themselves." JULIE DUNN

HEADLINE: A Wrong Label For a Longtime Hotel

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "New Life, New Trouble for a Hotel" (Feb. 6), I find your reference to the Martha Washington hotel totally inaccurate. 
 I have lived in the hotel for more than 20 years. In the approximately five years before the present ownership, a handful of unemployed individuals might have been granted dwelling, based on their ability to pay rent. Other than that, I take offense to your referring to this as "a former welfare hotel."

HEADLINE: With Africa Watching, Senegal Casts Votes That Count

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The presidential election on Sunday in Senegal has one critical difference that sets it apart from past votes and that offers a snapshot of the evolution of democracy in sub-Saharan Africa: no one knows who will win.
The race offers Senegalese the choice among four credible candidates. President Abdou Diouf, who is seeking a fourth consecutive term, could become what was once the rarity of rarities in Africa: a sitting leader who loses power, not in a coup, but through the ballot box. 
 He would not be the first. But because he is the head of the party that has governed Senegal since independence from France in 1960, his loss would be significant on a continent that has become increasingly impatient with democracies that offer no real choices.
"The outcome of the election in Senegal is extremely important for all of Africa," said Chris Fomunyoh, who follows Africa for the National Democratic Institute, an American organization that promotes democracy and monitors elections. "Given the political history of Africa, events in one country have had contagious effects elsewhere. After Ghana gained independence, everyone else wanted it. Then military coups came into fashion in the 1970's, the single party state in the 1980's, and the beginning of democratization in the 1990's."
"So a lot of people are watching the elections in Senegal, which are the first competitive elections in Africa in the year 2000, to see what trends might emerge," Mr. Fomunyoh added.
If the election runs relatively smoothly, it would also lengthen the list of African countries that have recently undergone change, more or less peacefully and fairly, through elections -- positive developments in Africa that have been overshadowed by the chaos swirling around the war in Congo and the December coup in the Ivory Coast.
In the last year, sub-Saharan Africa's two giants, Nigeria and South Africa, held elections, and their new presidents have been pressing for more democracy in their regions.
In recent months, Namibia and Mozambique in southern Africa held elections that international observers judged free and fair. In West Africa, Niger and Guinea Bissau -- two countries whose former leaders had been removed by force -- successfully chose new presidents in elections that included runoffs.
And two weeks ago, the power of the ballot box asserted itself unexpectedly in Zimbabwe. Voters there rejected a proposal by President Robert Mugabe, whose government has been ruining the economy while plundering the Congo, to seize lands without compensation and place still more power in his hands.
A decade after the end of the cold war brought multiparty systems across Africa, 32 out of its current 54 heads of states have been chosen in elections against rivals. A quarter of a century ago, the figure was only 3. What is more, the pressure toward democratization has grown inside and outside the continent.
What once left people with mouths agape -- a leader voluntarily giving up power -- is no longer so surprising. Mali's president, Alpha Oumar Konare, has said he would not follow the urging of some of his backers to change the Constitution to allow for a third term, instead pledging to retire in two years.
This December, Ghana is scheduled to have a presidential election without President Jerry J. Rawlings. A former flight lieutenant who seized power in 1981, Mr. Rawlings said he would also respect the Constitution, which limits presidents to two terms, and step down.
In French-speaking Africa, recent events are being interpreted to mean that France will no longer unconditionally support loyal but corrupt leaders in its former colonies and that it may be shifting toward demanding more accountability.
Foremost, France did not intervene to save Ivory Coast's president, Henri Konan Bedie, whose party cheated in the 1995 presidential elections and who in recent years arbitrarily changed the Constitution to thwart his main rival.
After mutinous soldiers cast Mr. Bedie out of power in December, the only thing the French government offered him was exile in Paris. The new ruler, Gen. Robert Guei, has pledged to hold elections, though he has yet to announce a date.
If the French did not intervene in the Ivory Coast, their most important economic partner in Africa, Africa experts say it is unlikely that they would do so to support President Omar Bongo of Gabon or President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo.
Both men have succeeded in remaining in power for three decades with French support but are increasingly regarded as embarrassments. Under pressure, Mr. Eyadema, who has led the tiny country of Togo for 33 years and is Africa's longest-ruling leader, has agreed to hold legislative elections this year and has announced that he will not run for re-election in 2003.
These events have intensified the campaign here in Senegal. This country of nine million, which has never experienced military rule, has long been considered one of the more politically open in Africa, especially since its first president, the politician and poet Leopold Senghor, introduced multiparty politics in 1976 and resigned voluntarily in 1980.
Elections here, which international observers say have become fairer over the years, have often been followed by violence. The risks that that would happen again have grown as the opposition warned that it would automatically consider a first-round victory by Mr. Diouf as proof that the voting was rigged. In recent days, violence has increased at campaign stops, as well as in Casamance, the southern region that harbors a separatist movement.
In an interview, Mr. Diouf, 65, who had served for 11 years as Mr. Senghor's prime minister, said that he wanted to continue democratizing Senegal by decentralizing power. Should he be re-elected, he said he would create a constitutional commission to re-examine the country's balance of powers.
"I believe that democracy is adequately rooted in this country," Mr. Diouf said.
But Mr. Diouf's critics say that his Socialist Party has cynically curtailed freedoms inside the party and the country. Like Mr. Bedie in the Ivory Coast, the Socialist Party has amended the Constitution to suit its needs, the critics say.
They point out that in the last year, the National Assembly, which is controlled by the Socialist Party, changed the Constitution to eliminate term limits for the presidency. Mr. Diouf has defended the change and pledged not to run again in 2007 if he wins this time.
"What is democracy?" Mr. Diouf said. "It's the choice of the people.
"The National Assembly in a majority judged that it was not natural, if the country has a good president and wants to keep him, that it should be prevented from keeping him. It is democracy if the people have the possibility to express an opinion."
One of the president's main rivals in this election, Djibo Ka, disagreed. He said he favored a limit of two five-year terms for the presidency.
"In a country with a fully functioning democracy, where there is a culture of democracy and credible institutions, there is no problem with having no term limits," Mr. Ka said. "But in a poor country like this one, where the same party has been in power for 40 years and where power has corrupted its members, it's not a bad idea to have term limits."
Mr. Ka, 52, a former foreign minister, left the Socialist Party two years ago arguing for greater democracy. Another candidate, Moustapha Niasse, 61, also a former heavyweight in the Socialist Party, defected for similar reasons. The third, and perhaps strongest rival to Mr. Diouf, is the longtime opposition figure, Abdoulaye Wade, 74.
It is the first time that Mr. Diouf is facing such formidable competition. Because of Mr. Niasse and Mr. Ka, political analysts here say that it is unlikely that Mr. Diouf can garner the 50 percent of the votes necessary to win in the first round. His party has been losing support with each election, most recently in the 1998 legislative election in which Mr. Diou's party won just over 50 percent of the seats. If the opposition can unite after the first round, Mr. Diouf might lose in the runoff.
Although the choice of four credible candidates represents progress, political analysts here say the candidates are simply interested in acquiring power. None, they say, have focused on issues during the campaign or presented a particular vision for Senegal's future.
"The opposition talks of the need to alternate power," said Abdourahmane Camara, director of publication of Walfadjri, an independent newspaper that is often critical of President Diouf. "But the opposition has not presented a political alternative in terms of ideas or ideology. We're hoping that as our democracy deepens, we will have real political alternatives in the next election."

HEADLINE: More Rainfall Adds to Woes In Wide Swath Of Africa

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Several weeks of torrential rains and floods, made worse when a deadly storm lashed the heel of Africa this week, have killed more than 150 people and swept away the homes and livelihoods of more than one million in four countries, relief agencies and government officials say.
The latest storm, which hit the region beginning Tuesday, has so far killed more than 60 people and left thousands homeless as fierce winds downed power lines and swollen rivers swallowed roads, houses and bridges in South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. 
 In many places, the rain was still falling today as rescue helicopters tried to deliver food, tents and blankets and pluck stranded people from rooftops, trees and farms that had become tiny snake-infested islands.
This week's storm was particularly destructive because it followed several weeks of rains that had had already battered the three countries and Botswana. Doctors and government officials fear the situation will only further deteriorate in coming days with increasing outbreaks of cholera, malaria and typhoid.
"The situation is going from bad to worse," said Kenny Mathiva, a spokesman for the local government in the Northern Province, which borders Mozambique, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and is the South African province most severely affected by the storm.
"Thirty-three people were dead by midday yesterday, and it's still raining," said Mr. Mathiva, who flew in a military helicopter today to assess the damage. "The housing is collapsing. The main routes are flooded.
"The people affected are some of the poorest of the poor," he added.
On Friday, the United States Defense Department announced that it would send emergency supplies to South Africa and Mozambique. The supplies, which will begin arriving on Monday, will include 140 tents, 6,900 blankets, 6,000 water cans and 160 rolls of plastic sheeting for emergency shelter.
The United Nations World Food Program is delivering food to more than 100,000 people in Mozambique, which has borne the brunt of this month's flooding. An estimated 300,000 Mozambicans have lost their homes, farms and cattle to the floods. And earlier this week, the United Nations and the Mozambican government issued an urgent appeal for $65 million for relief work in the storm-ravaged country.
"There are immediate needs for food, shelter and medicine," Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations' special adviser for Southern Africa, said of Mozambique in a radio interview that was broadcast today. "But at the same time, the international community has to pay attention to the tremendous damage to infrastructure."
Mozambique, which turned its back on decades of war to build one of the world's fastest-growing economies, has nearly 200,000 acres of farmland flooded, 141 schools destroyed and already short-staffed hospitals and clinics struggling to cope with demand.
"Health services in the affected areas are overwhelmed by the number of patients and are working beyond capacity," the United Nations said in its appeal for emergency assistance. "Drug stocks are running out, and there is a serious shortage of health workers." Rescue efforts in the region have been hampered by power outages and flooded roads, which have made it difficult for government officials and relief workers to reach stricken areas.
In South Africa, Mr. Mathiva said the towns of Messina, Louis Trichardt and Thohoyandou were accessible only by helicopter. And the bad weather forced two copters, one carrying corn meal, blankets and tents, to turn back without delivering the desperately needed supplies.
In Zimbabwe, government officials told the United Nations that many people had been marooned by flood waters. Earlier this week, a bus was swept off a bridge into the Mudzi River, killing all its passengers. The storm, has killed at least 29 people in Zimbabwe and exacerbated its fuel shortage as rough seas have kept an oil tanker from docking in Mozambique's port city, Beira.

HEADLINE: BACKTALK;
A Voiceless Fan Longs for the Return of Messier

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
I want Mark Messier and I want him now. Don't tell me about salary caps, dunce caps, capped teeth. Just go buy Mark Messier and stuff him back in a Ranger uniform and push him out on the prime line with Adam Graves. Do it before baseball melts the ice.
Who listens to a fan? We scamper along the sides of the eternal triangle -- athlete, agent, owner -- and sometimes get hung on the points. Who cares about us? The week began with news that Mariano Rivera had lost his arbitration case and would get only $7.25 million to pitch this season instead of the $9.25 million he asked for. Mariano kept smiling. A good sport. Maybe the Yankees could use the spared $2 million to hire a team of psychiatrists to work with their minor leaguers; too late for poor Darryl Strawberry, but then it was the Mets who brought him up too soon and with too little counseling. 
 Meanwhile, Marvin Miller's biographer is beating a drum to have rules so interpreted that the retired labor leader can be inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame. C'mon. A co-op in Cooperstown for one of the guys who made sure you can't afford to go to games? And they are keeping Pete Rose out? At least Pete gave me pleasure. I say, Marvin and Pete go in together or leave 'em both on the curb.
Who listens to a fan? Am I scandalized that Erick Barkley's life was improved by switching cars? St. John's gave him a platinum athletic scholarship so he could get them television gigs. I don't watch the Red Storm to see Erick read or drive. People have been giving Erick stuff ever since he picked up a basketball. It looks as though Riverside Church, where he once played, helped him with his prep school tuition. God helps those who have game.
So why is the National Collegiate Athletic Association so picky? Does it feel it's losing ground? The Amateur Athletic Union, once the power in American sports, but moribund the past few decades, is making a comeback with sneaker company money, running teams often coached by street agents, who, truth be told, probably do more for more young athletes than college coaches do.
Should I, Fan, care?
Ask Dennis Perrin, who is my new role model as a funny, smart and mean-spirited fan. His new book, "American Fan: Sports Mania and the Culture That Feeds It" (Spike/Avon), is hilariously vicious at the expense of Spike Lee, George Will, sportswriters, Michael Jordan, Nike and Jack Tatum. ("Were Tatum really great he would have crippled some fans as well.") Every fan should read it for moral support, then send it to Erick. If he can pass a test on it, he should get a brand new car.
Ask Jay Weiner, who is my new role model as a thoughtful, precise and idealistic fan. (I inadvertently maligned Weiner, a Minneapolis journalist, here several weeks ago when I had him jailed in the Patty Hearst case for harboring fugitives; he was jailed for refusing to testify against his friends.) Weiner's new book, "Stadium Games: Fifty Years of Big League Greed and Bush League Boondoggle" (University of Minnesota), is a lesson in politics and economics by a writer who believes that a city may well need a major league team to be major league. But Weiner goes on with pragmatic suggestions on how fans can make this all work in their own best interests.
Ask me.
If I were writing a book for fans, I'd call it "SkyBoxer: In the Arena but Above the Fray." That should be our goal, to watch all games over television, while eating and drinking in bed, with company, in a luxury box. This is the future of fandom. Who wants to get close to those brutes? If Reggie Miller isn't talking dirty, you might get hurt the next time a Marty McSorley forgets that the violence he gets paid for has certain boundaries.
But to be suspended for the rest of the season just for concussing a guy he has been fighting for years? I think McSorley should be replaced by Tonya Harding, the prototype skating goon, arrested last week for whacking her boyfriend with a hubcap.
What would bring me downstairs?
Mark Messier. I want Captain Dad back in town. I want to reclaim my inner puck, to see again that scream of a face floating over the Garden ice. Wiser heads say I'm wrong, that Messier is 39 and his $6 million contract (not even as much as the marked down Rivera!) and his powerful personality will upset the Rangers. I want them upset! I am a fan! The Rangers stink!
And Cablevision can afford Messier; it was ready to buy the Jets. Actually, if Marvin Miller wants my vote for the Hall of Fame, he should explain how Cablevision can be allowed to own the venue (Madison Square Garden), the teams (Knicks, Rangers) and the television channels, and still not satisfy my needs.
And while we're at it, I want Coach Mike Keenan and I want him now.

HEADLINE: Albert Cleage Is Dead at 88; Led Black Nationalist Church

 BODY:
Bishop Albert B. Cleage, who after the urban riots of the 1960's built his Detroit church, the Shrine of the Black Madonna, into an important center for black theology and political power, died on Feb. 20 in Calhoun Falls, S.C. He was 88.
Bishop Cleage died while visiting Beulah Land, his church's new farm, where he planned to raise food for the needy and give city youths peaceful summer vacations. 
 The bishop, who changed his name in the early 1970's to Jaramogi Abebe Agyeman, presided for more than three decades at the Shrine of the Black Madonna, originally a Congregational church. The change came in the late 1960's.
There were other black secessionist churches, but Bishop Cleage's became one of the biggest and most influential, emphasizing black interpretations but retaining some traditional Protestant teachings.
Bishop Cleage was also drawn to politics. In 1973, Black Slate Inc., his political organization, helped Coleman A. Young become the first black mayor of Detroit, and the bishop was important in the careers of United States Representative Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, Democrat of Michigan; former United States Representative Barbara-Rose Collins; and blacks who ran for smaller offices.
"He taught me the importance of organizing," Ms. Kilpatrick said, "and he created networks of political activists that continue to have a profound impact on Detroit's political landscape."
Bishop Cleage became a focus of national attention during the 1967 Detroit riot, when 43 people were killed, and in the turbulent years afterward. Splitting with both the white power structure and more moderate black leaders, he emphasized black separatism in economics, politics and religion.
"The basic problem facing black people is their powerlessness," he said. "You can't integrate power and powerlessness."
Trying to counter what he saw as white domination of religion, Mr. Cleage espoused a gospel of black nationalism. He installed a larger-than-life painting of a black Madonna holding a black baby Jesus, radical for its time, and preached that Jesus was a black revolutionary whose identity as such had been obscured by whites.
"That was the beginning of a whole new religious iconography," said Menelik Kimathi, chief executive officer of the Shrine of the Black Madonna. Mr. Kimathi, who joined a shrine youth group 30 years ago, added, "I think his legacy will be that he founded black liberation theology, the idea that the church could be more relevant to the day-to-day concerns of the community."
The Rev. Jim Holley, pastor of Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit, said: "He brought a black consciousness to the church community like it never had been brought before. And it translated into politics."
In 1968, Life magazine called Bishop Cleage one of "the men who are speaking to black America," along with Jesse Jackson, Julian Bond, Eldridge Cleaver and Dick Gregory.
The bishop was national chairman of the Black Christian Nationalist Church, an umbrella organization for similar churches, and he wrote "The Black Messiah" (1969) and "Black Christian Nationalism" (1972).
Albert Cleage was born in Indianapolis on June 13, 1911. His physician father moved the family to Detroit, and in 1937 the son received a sociology degree from Wayne State University. He received a divinity degree from Oberlin College, then served churches in Lexington, Ky.; San Francisco; and Springfield, Mass. In 1951, he became pastor of St. Mark's Community Church in Detroit, and two years later he formed the Central United Church of Christ, which later became the shrine.
Though he had believed in integration -- some of the churches he served were racially mixed -- Bishop Cleage came to despair of the hope that whites would ever willingly help blacks advance. He also befriended Malcolm X, the Muslim leader, who had Michigan roots.
Bishop Cleage's vision of a church emphasized social service programs, reached out to young people and marched for civil rights. He organized black-owned businesses like grocery stores and bookstores, and built hundreds of units of housing.
All this activity made him frightening to many whites.
"When we take over, don't worry," he once responded. "We'll treat you like you treated us."
He later founded other shrines, including major ones in Atlanta and Houston. Today, Mr. Kimathi said, the church has about 50,000 members nationally.
In the 1970's, Bishop Cleage backed out of the national spotlight to concentrate more on church programs and working with young people. In the late 80's and much of the 90's, he lived in Houston, then returned to Detroit.
Bishop Cleage married Doris Graham in 1943; they divorced in 1955. His survivors include their two daughters, Pearl Cleage of Atlanta and Kristin Williams of Idlewild, Mich.; three sisters; a brother; six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

HEADLINE: Rising Tax Bills Fuel Anger in Canada

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
In a hotel restaurant here, Jordan switched her cell phone to voice mail, nibbled on a slice of cold salmon, and then spun a libertarian view of taxes.
"I work strictly on a cash basis, so I don't get bit on the tax," said the 28-year-old college graduate, who prefers to go by her first name when talking about her "escort" work, a business that is growing rapidly in Canadian cities. 
 On the Pacific Coast, marijuana growers have propelled their illicit exports to the United States into a $1 billion-a-year business, making it one of British Columbia's top exports. And for Toronto's button-down professionals, Caribbean tax havens have become such popular winter vacation spots that Revenue Canada has increased its international auditors by sixfold, reaching 300 last year.
A tax bite is transforming the Great White North. Long seen by Americans as law-abiding Dudley Do-Rights, Canadians today increasingly dodge taxes in ways more commonly associated with Brazilians, Italians or even Russians.
"Canadians are not in the same league as the Italians or Brazilians," said David Giles, a University of Victoria economist, who estimates that Canada's under-the-table economy now approaches 20 percent of gross domestic product. "Canadians are clumsy. But they are blushing less and less. In fact, they are becoming brazen about it."
At the same time, more cautious Canadians, who once sniffed that their unruly neighbor to the south was born of a tax revolt, are now undergoing a very un-Canadian experience: a tax revolt.
Over the last five years, payroll taxes increased by an average of 26 percent and the government's total take of personal and corporate income jumped by almost 40 percent. Here in Quebec, home to North America's highest income tax rates, 51.7 percent, the tax bite means that the average resident works for the government until July 6. Shoppers in Canada also pay a sales tax that averages about 15 percent.
On Feb. 28, when the federal government's new budget is introduced, the governing Liberal Party promises to offer a modest tax cut, probably around $32 billion spread over five years. Much of Canada's tax load, government officials say, comes from paying interest on debts inherited from past Conservative and Liberal governments. The Liberals add that taxes pay for benefits -- Canada's health care and inexpensive college education. Finally, they argue, Canada's tax load is about average for the 29 countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
"If you look at only one aspect of life, maybe you would prefer living elsewhere, there is nothing forcing you to stay here," Prime Minister Jean Chretien told a reporter last year, drawing political sustenance from public opinion polls that indicated Canadians cared more about improving health care than about cutting taxes.
But public sentiment appears to be changing. A new national antitax coalition is gaining ground, and leaders of the tax revolt contend that Canadians do not compare themselves with Swedes and Finns.
"People look across the border at New Hampshire, where there is no sales tax, no state income tax and a low federal rate -- and people become pretty envious," said Martin Solberg, tax critic for the Reform Party, the largest opposition party and a leader of the new tax-cutting movement. Speaking from his home in Alberta, in the west, he said: "When we do 85 percent of your trade with the U.S., it is really important that we are competitive with the U.S."
The Canadian Tax Foundation, a Toronto-based research group, has calculated that during the 1990's, partly because of the tax load, average disposable income for Canadians declined 12 percent, while average American disposable income expanded about 12 percent.
"The 90's will go down in history as the worst decade since the Great Depression in terms of G.D.P. per capita," Joe Martin, chairman of the National History Society, wrote recently in Canada's leading history magazine, The Beaver.
Smelling blood, the Reform Party moved out of its western stronghold in February and started forming a nationwide conservative political coalition. First, it adopted a radical central plank: the reduction of top federal income tax rates to 17 percent from 29 percent.
This new coalition, the Canadian Alliance, is growing on bases in Ontario and Alberta, two voter-rich provinces already ruled by tax-cutting conservatives. In Ontario, Mike Harris easily won re-election last May, after he cut provincial taxes 30 percent during his first term. In Alberta, Stockwell Day, the provincial treasurer, plans to carry out by next January Canada's first provincial flat tax, a top rate of 11 percent.
With the emergence of this coalition, Canada's finance minister, Paul Martin, ended a self-imposed silence during the pre-budget season to criticize the opposition's flat tax idea.
"That 17 percent proposal would clearly either put our health care system or our education system into jeopardy, or it would put us back into deficit," Mr. Martin told reporters. "We're simply not going to do that."
Mr. Martin said: "We are going to reduce taxes, and we believe that we must reduce taxes. However, we believe that it must be done in a fair and balanced way."
Indeed, news leaks about impending tax cuts reflect a political recognition that many Canadians want tax cuts. In mid-January, the Liberal government proposed a government subsidy to keep National Hockey League teams in Canada. Public anger was so intense that the proposal was dropped in three days. No sooner had that uproar died away than the government became tangled in one of the most embarrassing political crises of its seven-year rule. An audit that showed sloppy or nonexistent accounting for $2.2 billion in "job creation" grants doled out by the government's biggest department, Human Resources.
In moving public opinion, tax cutters have found a powerful new ally in The National Post, a 16-month-old newspaper edited by imported British journalists who seem intent on conquering Canada with Margaret Thatcher's ideology.
In a typically scathing essay, Conrad Black, the British-Canadian owner of The Post, recently belittled Ottawa's success in erasing an inherited deficit of $29 billion, writing that "70 percent of the progress has just been piggybacking on American prosperity." Mr. Black and other critics say that much of Ottawa's budget balancing has come by cutting health and education transfer payments to provinces.
Instead of urging Canadians to compare themselves with Scandinavia, The Post suggests Ireland. Twenty years ago, a Post columnist noted recently, Ireland had half of Canada's per-capita income. After embarking on radical tax cuts, Irish per capita income is now 15 percent higher than Canada's.
Tax resistance seems to cross the economic spectrum here.
Business leaders stress that among the top industrialized countries, Canada's average corporate income tax, 43 percent, is only topped by Japan's rate of 48 percent. Canada's maximum capital gains rate of 37.7 percent is almost double the top American rate of 20 percent.
Canadian Internet entrepreneurs bridle under this country's system of taxing stock options when they are granted, as against the American approach of taxing them when they are exercised.
"You trigger a tax without having the money to pay for it," said David B. Perry, a senior research associate at the Canadian Tax Foundation.
For personal income taxes, Canada's top federal rate, 29 percent, affects income over $40,834. By comparison, the 28 percent tax bracket in the United States affects income over $43,850 for married couples and the maximum rate of 39.6 percent kicks in at $288,350. Largely because Canada uncoupled tax rates from inflation a decade ago, more taxpayers have shifted into higher brackets. And in contrast to the United States, there is no deduction for interest paid on home mortgages.
High taxes also contribute to Canada's century-old problem of a brain drain to the United States. With higher salaries and wider opportunities contributing to the American lure, a poll taken in December found that about a third of Canadian Internet users surveyed said they expected a family member to move to the United States in the foreseeable future.
A separate survey of Canadian M.B.A. graduates of the Harvard Business School found that the portion returning to Canada had plummeted to 25 percent of the class of 1998 from 58 percent in the late 80's.
"Canadians earn less and pay higher taxes for generally inferior public services than Americans," The Globe and Mail, a newspaper that generally backs the Liberal government, said in a recent editorial. Indeed, with tax evasion increasingly mainstream here, few eyebrows were raised when Statistics Canada reported in January that spending on house renovation had dropped by almost 40 percent during the 1990's. Canadians are not letting their houses fall down. They are cutting cash deals with contractors.

HEADLINE: Effort for Lowering Oil Prices Gains at U.S.-Saudi Meeting

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The American effort to secure lower oil prices took an important step forward today when senior Saudi and American oil ministers agreed that there could be a better balance between oil supplies and demand.
The carefully worded statement issued here tonight by the Saudi Oil Minister, Ali al-Naimi, and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson did not state that boosting production would help end that imbalance or stabilize oil prices, which at more than $30 a barrel have hit their highest level in nine years. Nor did it commit Saudi Arabia to producing more oil. 
 But it did show, according to oil experts and diplomats here, that both Saudi and American officials are concerned that the soaring oil prices caused by production quotas imposed last year are creating speculation and shortages that jeopardize world economic growth.
In the statement, Saudi Arabia vowed that it would continue to "review the oil supply and demand levels to ensure market stability, prevent oil price volatility and avoid harming the world economy."
Officials said Mr. Naimi had stressed in his talks with Mr. Richardson that the decision to pump more oil could be made only by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is scheduled to meet in Vienna at the end of March to review production cuts it adopted a year ago after the price of oil fell below $10 a barrel.
But several oil experts and diplomats interpreted this statement to mean that Saudi and American oil officials had similar interpretations of oil market pressures and that the Saudis would try to persuade other OPEC members that some production increases were warranted.
Mr. Richardson's trip also suggests that a consensus is emerging among some OPEC states that the production cuts, which Saudi Arabia urged other members to adopt last March, may have outlived their usefulness. Oil prices have almost doubled since OPEC decided last year to reduce daily production by 4.3 million barrels.
Whether OPEC should pump more oil and at what pace will also be discussed in London on Thursday at a meeting of oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico. Before that, officials said, Mr. Richardson will meet with Venezuela's oil minister. OPEC members, together with nonmembers Mexico and Norway, produce about a third of the world's supply of oil.
Saudi officials said no announcement would be made before the OPEC meeting. But privately, several Saudi officials said they believed that an increase of more than a million barrels a day could be justified.
Yet differences persist over tactics and pricing strategy, not only among OPEC members but within Saudi Arabia's ruling family. While Saudi oil officials seemed impressed by American data showing that oil inventories in America have fallen to the lowest point in 20 years and that the world is consuming 75 million barrels of oil a day and producing only 73 million, a senior Saudi official wondered whether there was what he called a "false sense of crisis" spurred on by a media frenzy over rising prices and speculation.
"Reserves are meant to go down, especially during a harsh winter," Prince Saud al-Faysal bin Abd al-Aziz, the foreign minister, said in an interview. "That's what reserves are for, after all."
Saudi oil officials are concerned that rising prices for major consumers may jeopardize the economic growth upon which future oil sales depend. At the same time, they emphasize the need to build consensus in OPEC. Any suggestion that the kingdom is responding to American pressure would complicate that task, one diplomat said.
While the administration is said to be preparing measures to address shortages, Mr. Richardson reiterated today that oil from the strategic reserve should be used only to respond to a national emergency, not to affect price levels.
Asked about the discussions here, Mr. Richardson said, "This has been a very successful trip."

HEADLINE: Talk of a Merger Raises New Concern for Hotel-Hungry Atlantic City

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
It has been more than four years since the Las Vegas casino magnate Stephen A. Wynn announced plans to build a $2 billion hotel and gambling complex on a landfill in Atlantic City's marina district, and almost as long since MGM Grand said it would build a $700 million resort at the northern end of the Boardwalk.
New Jersey officials were so eager to get Mr. Wynn to bring badly needed hotel rooms and Las Vegas-style glamour to Atlantic City that they agreed to his demand for a new $330 million roadway and tunnel to whisk visitors from the Atlantic City Expressway to the western side of the city. That tunnel, known as the Brigantine Connector, is on schedule and expected to open in May 2001. 
 But neither company has yet broken ground. Both Mr. Wynn's Mirage Resorts and MGM Grand have been stymied by legal and political complications. And a bid a few days ago by MGM Grand for Mirage has suddenly left Atlantic City officials fearing further delays and the potential for serious business stagnation: with hotel occupancy near capacity, Atlantic City needs to add rooms fast to stop losing business.
On Wednesday, MGM Grand made an unsolicited $3.3 billion offer to buy Mirage. Two other major casino companies, Park Place Entertainment Company and Harrah's Entertainment Company, then said they were considering making their own offers for Mr. Wynn's empire, which is perceived as vulnerable because its lavish new resorts in Las Vegas and Biloxi, Miss., have failed to meet financial expectations.
Lou Toscano, the senior policy adviser to Mayor James Whelan, said Atlantic City feared that a battle between Mirage and other casino operators would lead to further delays in the Atlantic City projects, just at the moment when the impasse appeared to be ending.
"Takeover struggles have a tendency to freeze both the companies involved," Mr. Toscano said, "and this is not a good time for that to happen."
Mirage officials would not talk about what impact the proposed merger might have on its Atlantic City project. "All of the activity in Atlantic City is moving forward as planned," Alan M. Feldman, a Mirage spokesman, said Friday.
James J. Murren, the president and chief financial officer of MGM Grand, said it was "extraordinarily premature" to speculate about what would happen in Atlantic City.
If MGM Grand does acquire Mirage -- and no one can say whether it will -- the Atlantic City plans are likely to merge as well, resulting in one new resort instead of two, according to several analysts. The new hotel would most certainly likely be located on the larger 170-acre marina site rather than on the 30-acre Boardwalk parcel. "It is desirable because it's such wide open land," said David W. Anders, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. "You could develop the property exactly as you want to."
The loss -- or postponement -- of one of the resorts would be a disappointment for Atlantic City, where hotel occupancy rates exceed 90 percent. Thanks to the expansions of several existing hotels, the city has nearly 12,000 hotel rooms. But Atlantic City could fill twice that many, despite increasing competition from casinos in Connecticut, said Jason Ader, an analyst with Bear Stearns & Company. The room shortage makes it difficult to attract package tours or scheduled flights by major airlines.
The construction delays have also placed a financial burden on the city, which is heavily dependent on the casinos for tax revenues. The city's tax base took a hit recently when the aging Trump World's Fair Casino closed. Last month, Mayor Whelan said he was "out of smoke and mirrors" and proposed a 3.7-cent increase in the property tax rate, the first since 1996.
Although about 48,000 people are employed in Atlantic City's casino industry, the city needs the jobs that the new resorts would add. The unemployment rate in 1998, the last year for which figures are available, was 13.4 percent, more than twice the rate for the state as a whole.
"The longer this drags out, the more frustrated people become," Mr. Toscano said.
Mirage is also a partner in The Borgata, a $750 million casino resort planned at the marina by the Boyd Gaming Corporation, which operates the Stardust Resort Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Boyd still intends to break ground this summer, said Rob Stillwell, a company spokesman. Designed to resemble an Italian village, the resort would be next to the new Mirage complex.
Long before MGM Grand made its takeover move, the Mirage project had encountered a series of hurdles. Donald J. Trump, a longtime rival, tried to block it through litigation, saying Mr. Wynn had been given preferential treatment because he did not have to pay for the land. (Mirage did have to pay to clean the former landfill, however, and is contributing one-third of the cost of the tunnel, with the state subsidizing the rest.) A protracted legal fight was also waged by residents who said the tunnel would destroy their middle-class neighborhood.
Mr. Toscano said Mirage also contributed to the delays by revising its design plans twice. On Wednesday, however, in what Mr. Toscano described as "the first major step," the company is scheduled to appear before the city planning board to seek approval for roads proposed at the marina.
MGM Grand also faced obstacles in assembling its Boardwalk parcel, but Mr. Toscano and Mr. Murren said that the last holdout among the property owners was on the verge of making a deal.

HEADLINE: Miami Beach Clubgoers Creating New, Unwanted Image

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, Feb. 26

 BODY:
It is just past 9 o'clock on a Sunday morning and the Kit Kat lounge in South Beach has closed. A boy and a girl stand motionless on the sidewalk, clinging like mortared bricks. Three shirtless boys in black pants mill around them, and a girl in a white T-shirt gyrates and claps, lost to a beat that still hammers her head. She is a "roller," high on the drug Ecstasy.
Mari, in a red tube top and a clinging black miniskirt, is 20 but has a fake driver's license that gets her into the clubs here every weekend night and has for years, she said. "When I leave South Beach and see the sun coming out," she said, "I know it's been a good night." She does not use drugs, she said, but she says many kids she knows do. 
 Vaulting into celebrity as the backdrop of "Miami Vice," the hit television series in the 1980's, this oceanside gem of Art Deco whimsy and former resort of retirees has joined the company of the nation's most impudent and indulgent trend-setting societies, like Greenwich Village or Berkeley or Venice, Calif.
But South Beach has also inspired precarious excesses, especially among the young who frequent night clubs and the after-hours clubs, which first appeared three or four years ago and open at 4 a.m. "Eighty percent of the people going to the after-hours clubs use drugs," said Chief Richard Barreto of the Miami Beach Police.
So cautiously, the authorities have begun to crack down. So far this year, the police have corralled nearly 400 teenagers for curfew violations in the proximity of the clubs, compared with about 30 a month in the last half of last year.
In December, Mayor Neisen O. Kasdin of Miami Beach and the city commission moved the after-hours clubs' closing hour to 9 a.m. from as late as noon, and prohibited admission to people under 21. Last month, the commissioners voted to ask the state legislature to raise the admission age to 21 for all night clubs. Now they can admit 18-year-olds but not serve them liquor.
But the city has rebuffed Chief Barreto's appeals to shut down the after-hours clubs. The commissioners reached a "balanced decision," he said. They took account of the views that the clubs buttress the economy and burnish the community's image as a cauldron of creative vigor and its adult culture, as Mr. Kasdin put it, "of beautiful people."
South Beach stretches along the 17 southernmost blocks of Miami Beach, and the beach itself faces the Atlantic. With the nation's prosperity helping to fuel the nonstop creation of new businesses in modeling, new media, broadcasting and electronic commerce, Mr. Kasdin said, "South Beach is roaring."
The momentum is such, said Kevin Crowder, the city's development specialist, that business will need 700,000 square feet of new office space within three years (about several city blocks) -- 110,000 more than it already occupies.
The new business and the relentless growth of tourism have set off something close to anarchy on weekends along Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive -- a "controlled reverie," as City Commissioner Luis R. Garcia Jr. put it. "The chaos you see," Mr. Garcia said, "is because of different perceived values."
The cultural mix brings together races, diverse sexual orientations, languages and incomes. The average age of all Miami Beach plunged to 43 from 65 in the 1980's, with little change in the total number of people, just under 100,000. Mr. Crowder said the average age probably dropped another three or four years in the 1990's.
Fashions whip through South Beach. Against backdrops of ear-splitting music, shops display clothes on the mannequins that ignore any practical use. But people do wear them, in the clubs.
A trend among young men is a close-cropped, yellow-bronze mat of hair that glows in the strobe lights of the clubs. This look is hardest for men with black hair to achieve.
"Mine used to be green," said Michael Escamilla, 16, newly blond and with black fingernails, who was lingering with friends on South Beach's open Lincoln Road Mall. He tackled his dark hair first with a bleach. Then he applied yellow Manic Panic, a brand of hair dye. "The trouble is," he said, "it washes away after about 20 washes."
Tattooing is flourishing, with a parlor on nearly every block, and has evolved far beyond the World War II sailor's rite of passage. Brazilian-born Luiz Segatto said the popular variations are geometric or Chinese-character bands around the upper arm, all in black. He charges from $60 for a little tattoo, up to $10,000 for a "full body suit."
Carlos Ruiz, 20, a Cuban-American, stops in. A large red and yellow sunbust on his upper left arm is inscribed "Sunshine of my life. Betty." Betty is his mother. Tattooing hurts, he said. "It hurts enough so you say you won't get another," he said. "But I'm here to get another."
In the pyrotechnic scene inside the clubs, fashion turns lunatic. At the Bar Room and the Living Room, two prominent night clubs, and Kit Kat, one of the after-hours clubs, young women arrive in feather boas, stretch black miniskirts and bulky black platform shoes.
At Level, one of the newest clubs, with 45,000-square-feet of laser-illuminated dance floors, Fridays is gay men's night. On a recent Friday, most men had doffed their shirts, and some, in boxer shorts and boxing gloves, pumped their fists to hip-hop music. Waiters circulated selling bubble-gum filled lollipops. Dancing patrons waved neon-green glow sticks.
The glow sticks and lollipops, said Police Chief Barreto, suggest that the patrons are buying Ketamine, an animal tranquilizer also known as Special K, gamma hydroxybutyrate, or G.H.B., a muscle relaxer, and mesmerizing Ecstasy.
Ecstasy is dehydrating and causes users to grind their teeth, so lollipops and pacifiers offset the effects, Chief Barreto said, and glow sticks stimulate the senses. Another device, menthol inhalers, enhance the effect of some drugs.
"It is not unusual," Chief Barreto said, "to walk into a club and see some individual zonked out in a trancelike state with one or two inhalers hanging out of their nose." The fire department, he said, has been rescuing overdosed patrons at a rate of about three a month.
Such scenes have been jarring for both South Beach's image and its economy. In the early 1990's, Mr. Kasdin said, "beautiful people came to town, and people wanted to be around them."
"A whole night life grew up around this culture of beautiful people," he said. They were affluent people who stoked the economy with their spending in the shops, hotels and restaurants.
"But then the night life began to evolve," Mr. Kasdin said, "with more and more low-rent clubs catering to people who came from across the bay. A handful of clubs would let them in even if they were under age."
Merchants complain that the young club patrons simply come for the clubs, especially the after-hours clubs, ignore the stores and are tarnishing South Beach's glamorous image.
So the mayor and the commission have begun to crack down on the clubs. In addition to restricting their hours, officials have limited their operation to weekend and holiday nights and have barred any new after-hour clubs from opening.
That is an unfair assault on the clubgoers, said Leo Mena, the owner of Kit Kat. "There has not been one overdose or death in any of the after-hours clubs," he said. "It's not entirely true," he said, that some patrons use drugs. He said he throws out any one with drug paraphernalia. His patrons, he said, "just want to sweat and dance."

HEADLINE: Downloads From Uptown: A Web Portal in Harlem

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
As the co-producer of "New Jack City," a 1991 film starring Wesley Snipes as a Harlem drug lord, George Jackson introduced a mass audience to the sounds and sensibilities of inner-city streets.
More recently, after a string of other movies and a brief stint as president of Motown Records, Mr. Jackson embarked on a third career. He developed ambitious plans for reaching the expanding market for hip-hop and Latino culture through a network of World Wide Web sites. 
 With two close friends, he founded Urban Box Office Network, a year-old company that already employs 250 people at ramshackle offices in Chelsea. Later this year, it will become the first Silicon Alley company to set up headquarters in Harlem, bringing badly needed high-technology jobs to the neighborhood where Mr. Jackson grew up.
But there will be no homecoming. On Feb. 10, less than three weeks before the scheduled start of the company's first major Web site, Mr. Jackson died of a stroke. He was 42.
The death of Mr. Jackson, a 300-pound Harvard-educated bear of a man who was affectionately known as Papa, has devastated his young staff and left a void that his partners, Adam Kidron, a longtime British music industry producer, and Frank Cooper, the former vice president for business affairs at Def Jam Recordings, are struggling to fill. But they say they are not deferring any of their plans. And their backers maintain that Mr. Jackson left behind a company in good enough shape to withstand his loss.
"All the investors feel confident that the leadership and the depth is there to take it forward and make it a successful media company," said Kathryn Wylde, the president of the New York City Investment Fund, a private company that tries to stimulate job growth. The fund has given Urban Box Office $2 million.
The company also expects to receive from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a federal, state and city program designed to foster economic development in Harlem, a $4 million loan to be used to renovate an industrial building at 126th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. And the company will receive tax breaks for hiring neighborhood residents, who make up one-fifth of its current work force, said Terry C. Lane, the president of the Empowerment Zone.
Mr. Lane said he hoped that Urban Box Office would inspire other Internet companies to move to Harlem. He said he had been talking to two dozen other companies.
Despite its location, the new venture will not be aimed exclusively at African-Americans and other minority groups, Mr. Kidron said. He defined the target audience as young people with an "urban mind-set."
Ken Smikle, the president of Target Market News, a Chicago-based company that monitors African-American media and marketing, says that although African-Americans have been slower than other groups to embrace the Internet, they are catching up fast.
"There are a lot of sites trying to go specifically after the younger portion of this audience," Mr. Smikle said. But he said no one else had matched Urban Box Office in scale.
The idea of creating a Web portal for urban music, entertainment and information did not originate with Mr. Jackson. But his friends and business associates say that his ebullient and forceful personality got the project off the ground. "He was the type of guy who would take iconoclastic people and create a family," said Doug McHenry, his film-producing partner. "He would be the glue and help them formulate the vision and make it practical."
Mr. Jackson was the drawing card for Flatiron Partners, a venture capital company specializing in the Internet that has invested $16 million in the online network. Jerry Colonna, the managing partner, said, "I'd be lying if I didn't say that within 10 minutes of meeting George, I knew I wanted to fund this project."
Mr. Colonna said he was impressed by the breadth of the company's goals. In addition to serving as a distribution system, Urban Box Office will offer original content, including situation comedies, dramatic series, talk shows and animation. Other sites will offer hip-hop blended with Latin rhythms and what Mr. Kidron called "the full range of e-commerce."
As Mr. Colonna said, "As a venture capital company, you want to back entrepreneurs who think big, not people who say, 'I want to get bought out by Yahoo.' "
The Web sites are being rolled out one by one, and company officials say the network itself will not go online until a critical mass has been reached. The most elaborate one so far -- www.indieplanet.com, which is intended to showcase independent musicians, artists and writers -- will make its debut on Tuesday.
The online network was actually the brainchild of Mr. Kidron, who produced albums for the Sex Pistols in the 1970's. Mr. Kidron, 40, said he initially hoped to create a cable channel but was unable to secure an outlet in New York.
During a visit to a public library in Yonkers, Mr. Kidron said, he began to understand the changes the Internet had wrought. As a group of teenagers logged onto the Internet to listen to music, he noticed that they relished being able to flit from site to site. "What was more important than the quality," Mr. Kidron said, "was that the kids could go on the Web and they could choose what they were going to program. That was the defining moment in building Urban Box Office and why it is structured the way it is."
As Mr. Kidron was developing his idea, Mr. Jackson was coming off a frustrating year. He had moved to New York in 1997 to try to rescue Motown, a legendary record label founded in Detroit that had been run into the ground. Since he was a neophyte in the music business, his arrival was greeted with skepticism. But Danny Goldberg, the former chairman of Polygram's Mercury Group, which then owned Motown, said he had hired Mr. Jackson to run the label for other reasons. "He had tremendous executive and leadership qualities that are extremely hard to find," Mr. Goldberg said. "The things he didn't know he could learn."
As Mr. Jackson acknowledged, the Motown job was a struggle. "There's tremendous pressure on me, nothing but pressure," Mr. Jackson told The Boston Herald a few months after he took the job. Before he had a chance to prove himself, however, Polygram was sold to the Seagram Company and he was dismissed.
When he teamed with Mr. Kidron, Mr. Jackson was initially reluctant to base the new company in Harlem. "He didn't want to go there and have us be this isolated thing of privilege in this place of enormous destitution and lack of opportunity," Mr. Kidron said. But eventually, Mr. Jackson came to see the advantages of locating in a world-famous neighborhood with deep cultural roots, his friend said.
Mr. Kidron does, too. "Harlem," he said, "is this amazing urban brand that has fallen into decay."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: WASHINGTON;
A Mini-Tuesday, With Its Quirky Prize, Looms Larger

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 26

 BODY:
When the 2000 presidential campaign began, the Republican and Democratic primaries that will be held in Washington State on Tuesday were hardly more than blips on the political horizon, arcane little contests lying somewhere out on the trail between the first-in-the nation Iowa caucuses and the could-end-it-all mass of 13 primaries scheduled for Titanic Tuesday, March 7.
But because the early months of the campaign have been so unexpectedly topsy-turvy, the Washington primaries, with their quirky rules and oft-quirky voters, suddenly loom large, and candidates have been forced to change plans and divert scarce resources and time to compete. The Democrats were in the state today and they will be joined by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on Sunday. Senator John McCain of Arizona plans to arrive on Monday. 
 There is opportunity, and danger, for all candidates in these contests, but especially for Mr. McCain, still trying to forge ahead of Mr. Bush on the Republican side, and for former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, still badly trailing Vice President Al Gore on the Democratic side.
Washington has no party registration and voters may choose on primary day to vote in either contest. Mr. McCain and Mr. Bradley have been going after party switchers and independent voters, Mr. McCain particularly, while their opponents have been concentrating mainly on the hard-core base in their parties.
Given that at least half of Washington voters claim to be independents (many maintain that ideology is a private matter), there has often been a lot of voting flux in primaries.
"This can be a very tricky state when it comes to politics and voting," said David Brine, the communications director for the office of the secretary of state, which regulates state elections.
"Nothing is fixed in stone here," Mr. Brine said. "There's a long tradition of switching around in parties and on issues."
Mr. McCain and Mr. Bradley find themselves in competition for some of the same votes, particularly when they are talking up one of their favorite issues, government reform. In fact, Mr. Bradley has concluded that Washington not only offers him a big chance to go after independent voters but also offers what may be his last chance, with the help of independent votes, to post a victory over Mr. Gore.
Such a victory would come in a race that under party rules is essentially what is known as a beauty contest, with no convention delegations to be won. But Mr. Bradley nevertheless is committing huge amounts of time and money to what amounts to a bet-it-all gamble -- win a contest, any contest, anywhere.
The actual choosing of the state's allotment of 75 delegates to the Democratic National Convention will take place in a March 7 round of caucuses.
Mr. Gore, for his part, comfortably ahead in most recent Washington polls, has been forced to match the Bradley effort to protect his flank, something he had not anticipated.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Bradley were both in Seattle today to address a meeting of the state N.A.A.C.P.
While Mr. Gore attended a state Democratic Party chili dinner last night while Mr. Bradley held a chili dinner with supporters.
Mr. McCain is also committing significant resources to the contest here and, much to Mr. Bradley's frustration, seems to be dominating the chase after independents.
Mr. Bush, like Mr. Gore, is responding in kind with money and manpower.
The Republican contest is part beauty contest, part real primary and, like the Democratic contest, will be followed by a round of caucuses on March 7. Twelve of the state's allotment of 37 delegates to the Republican National Convention will be chosen on Tuesday, the rest on March 7.
Recent polls show the Bush-McCain competition too close to call, just as it was too close to call on the eve of voting in several earlier contests.
For Mr. McCain, coming off his surprise victory on Tuesday in Michigan, a Washington victory would add to the momentum he has been building as he seeks to overcome Mr. Bush's huge earlier lead over most of the country. This would be especially true if he were to win both the beauty contest and the 12-delegates contest, though he and Mr. Bush very well might end up splitting those contests because of the complex rules that govern them.
But if a McCain victory here is to have truly significant meaning, the senator must not only beat Mr. Bush but demonstrate in beating him that he can pull large numbers of conservative Republican votes -- the ultimate key to the party's nomination -- not just the votes of Republican moderates, dissident Democrats and independents, his victory mix so far.
He has not been very successful in doing that in other states, no matter how hard he has tried. But now that he has retooled his pitch -- "I am a Reagan Republican" is his mantra -- he may have a better shot at it, particularly here in Washington.
Washington Republicans tend to be more moderate than Republicans in many other states, though there are plenty of conservatives here. Certainly Washington Republicans are likely to be more receptive to the new McCain pitch than Republicans in Virginia, a conservative bastion and Bush stronghold that also will hold a primary on Tuesday.
"Washington is a McCain kind of state," said Kris Wilder, the director of the McCain effort here. "More than in most states, the Washington State voter has a mind of his own, of her own, just like John McCain."
Mr. Bush, for his part, needs to regain momentum in Tuesday's voting. He badly needs a success here to twin with a presumed victory in Virginia.
"Washington is a tough one but we feel good about the outcome," said Mike McKay, a chairman of the Bush effort here. "We feel we have the support and we're confident we have the organization."
Both campaigns are filling the airwaves with a round of last-minute television and radio advertisements, mailing out thousands of campaign fliers and inundating voters with telephone calls. The senator flew here for a day of campaigning just hours after his Michigan triumph and will return for another visit just a few hours before the polls open.
For Mr. Bradley, the Democratic contest here could be his last hurrah, because a loss in Washington would lengthen Mr. Gore's string of victories over him to four in a row. So unlike the other candidates, who are dipping in and out of the state so that they can also work the other states in the March 7 primaries, Mr. Bradley is remaining here almost the entire week leading up to Tuesday's vote. His main pitch: Mr. Gore is a conservative whereas he is the true liberal and Democrat.
"If we win this primary or have a very strong showing," Mo Elleithee, Mr. Bradley's spokesman, said the other day, "it will be a signal to the rest of the country that Bill Bradley is viable and this thing is not wrapped up."
Mr. Gore, confident momentum on his side, plans to visit the state briefly over the weekend but otherwise is leaving his campaign effort here up to surrogates, many of them top labor leaders and members of the state's Democratic establishment, like Paul Berendt, the Democratic state chairman. They have kept up a drumbeat of charges that Mr. Bradley is engaging in negative campaigning.
"He's taking the low road," Mr. Berendt said, "and what he's going to find is that Washington voters are going to punish him for it."

HEADLINE: IN BRIEF;
Zoning Incentives

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
Hoping to attract developers of high-rise apartments to downtown White Plains, Mayor Joseph M. Delfino is backing more relaxed zoning laws.
The proposals will be part of the second phase of the mayor's economic development plans to be submitted next month to the Common Council. 
 In many places downtown, developers cannot build apartment complexes higher than 13 stories. Mr. Delfino's plan would allow taller buildings with more units, making it more profitable for builders in the downtown area, George D. Gretsas, the mayor's executive officer, said.
Mr. Delfino said he felt the city could profit from the countywide dearth of rental space and, by increasing pedestrian activity in the downtown area, also help merchants.
The city had hoped that TishmanSpeyer Properties, which plans a shopping, movie and entertainment complex on the former Macy's department store site, would also build a 450-unit apartment building downtown. But the company recently dropped its plans.
Meanwhile, Mr. Gretsas said that other plans for a $125 million apartment and hotel complex near the Metro-North station and a supermarket on South Kensico Avenue are progressing.
A proposed development on 121 acres that are owned by New York Presbyterian Hospital would include a 60-acre public park, but that project has not been formally submitted. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: Deep in the Heart of Houston

BYLINE: By Phillip Lopate; Phillip Lopate is the author of "Totally, Tenderly, Tragically: Essays and Criticism from a Lifelong Love Affair With the Movies" (Anchor Books).

 BODY:
There is big houston and little Houston. It is possible to edit the city into an extraordinarily pleasant, civil, amenities-rich archipelago of urban spaces -- always aware, however, in the back of one's mind, of that infinitely nondescript, ever-expanding strip-mall, industrial edge of town, the receding periphery that is larger Houston. But then, this is what the intrepid traveler always does: edits a personal version of Florence, say, into a set of reliable gelaterias and inspiring Botticellis or restful Boboli Gardens benches.
I lived and worked in Houston from 1980-88, basked in its uniquely kind, welcoming spirit, saw it go through boom years, when it seemed almost pathetically anxious to become a "world-class city," witnessed the recession of the mid-80's, which saved much from the wrecking ball and gave everyone a breathing spell in which to contemplate what kind of city they really wanted. The paradox is that, now that it no longer cares about being accepted as a world-class city, Houston has a much better chance of being perceived as one. 
 I went back recently to see what differences had been wrought: the new buildings and museums, the revitalized downtown and changing neighborhoods. Yet I was chary, too, about revisiting a place that had so nurtured me.
I could tell I was back when I hit the corner of Bissonnet and Main. If I had to pick a single spot to which I return in reveries of Houston, it would be that corner, where Mies van der Rohe's Museum of Fine Arts faces the Isamu Noguchi-designed Sculpture Garden, with the tin-shedded Contemporary Arts Museum off to the side. The whole ensemble has that strange combination of reassurance and disquieting emptiness that gives parts of Houston the dreamlike character of a de Chirico. My friend Stephen Fox, an architectural historian and a walking encyclopedia of the city, calls the Mies "the finest modern building in Houston." Its daunting purity is, however, a challenge to curatorial ingenuity, since temporary walls chop up Mies's noble, sweeping spaces. The Sculpture Garden, which, when it opened, received criticism for its exposed starkness, has filled out nicely with tree growth, becoming a pleasurable oasis for contemplation and a bag lunch.
I made it a point to stay at the venerable Warwick Hotel, right in the middle of the museum district. The Warwick is where generations of Houstonians prommed and wedded; it feels comfortably stodgy, a dowager of a hotel, no room faxes or minibars (for those extras you might try a Doubletree or the St. Regis), but wonderful views of downtown Houston to the north, and Hermann Park (Houston's Olmstedian public space), Rice University and the humongous Texas Medical Center to the south. It is also next door to the Museum of Fine Arts, whose new addition by the distinguished Madrid architect Rafael Moneo, the Audrey Jones Beck Building, I was eager to see.
Maybe because much of the place got built before the current generation's eyes -- going from a sleepy town of 500,000 in 1950 to the country's fourth-largest city -- architecture is the premier art in Houston; it attracts the most kibitzers.
Houstonians had watched the Moneo building's construction with apprehension: it seemed large, and the stone facade, tasteful and urbane, was not exactly iconic, like Gehry's Bilbao Museum (the new standard). But the interior is quietly spectacular: it keeps opening up in surprising vistas, with shifting ceiling heights and atriums. Expensive to build ($83 million), the new wing has gorgeous detailing, a rich blend of materials: limestone, granite and marble all warmly interacting, with touches of bronze for color.
One of the problems any Houston museum must deal with is how to accommodate the big Texas sky: too much natural lighting can harm artworks, while nothing but artificial light makes one feel like a mole. Across the way, Mies perversely designed a facade of magnificent, curved glass windows, which then had to be reined in by curtains and blinds. Moneo, who likes to use natural lighting, came up with another solution: roof lanterns, which would draw in sunlight, tamed and evenly dispersed throughout the building. Enclosed gallery rooms speak in the vocabulary of a classical European museum, and will be perfect for housing the permanent collection. The elegant Moneo wing operates as a good neighbor, freeing the Mies pavilion for large, dramatic modern paintings and sculpture. Together, they catapult the museum's exhibition space to sixth-largest in the nation.
Not far away -- within walking distance, in fact -- is the other art "campus," the Menil Collection. If the Museum of Fine Arts has a corporate, invincible, National Gallery air, the Menil enclave is more idiosyncratic, personal, familial. In truth, there is nothing else like it in America. First, Dominique and John de Menil bought up all the wooden cottages on two parallel blocks (Branard and Sul Ross), painted them the same shade of gray and rented them to creative folk and arts organizations. Then they built the Rothko Chapel on the property, implanting those dark masterpieces of Mark Rothko's in a meditative space that would, Menil-fashion, combine spirituality and art. They sprinkled various sculptures, by Tony Smith, Barnett Newman and Mark di Suvero, on the lawn. Then Mrs. de Menil, after her husband's death, commissioned Renzo Piano to build a museum to house the family collections, which were especially strong in surrealism, tribal cultures, Byzantine and contemporary art. Piano, co-architect of the Beaubourg in Paris, came up with the brilliant solution of designing what looked like an oversize wooden bungalow, with gray cypress clapboards, so that it fitted perfectly into the neighborhood. Its intricate system of skylighting through baffles directs natural light to sweep dramatically through the galleries. The stained plank floors of the spacious museum are also distinctive, like those of a Japanese temple. An amazing piece of architecture.
Not content to stop there, Mrs. de Menil had Piano design the smaller, cubelike Cy Twombly Gallery across the street: this homage to a single living painter is the sort of treatment every artist dreams of.
Twombly's paintings from the 1950's to the present, most notably his "blackboard" series, are exhibited in nine connected rooms, which have stretched cotton fabric ceilings to diffuse the natural light. The effect is of looking up at a sail in becalmed weather. To complete the ensemble, Mrs. de Menil had her architect son Francois design a Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum, and saw to it that a Dan Flavin sculpture of fluorescent tubes was permanently installed in nearby Richmond Hall. Then she died, leaving the museum directors and trustees (including her heirs) to quarrel among themselves.
If this serene, utopian art village is to survive more or less intact, it will require a new breed of Houstonians to shoulder the responsibility initiated by this extraordinary patron, and to commit themselves to her exigent standards.
Houston's flatness and unboundedness -- it sprawls over a larger area than Los Angeles -- give it a theoretical quality, inviting developers and dreamers to imagine imposing schemes both greedy and utopian.
One of the most impressively visionary ventures to have arisen in recent years is Project Row Houses, in the Third Ward in east-central Houston. The city's black communities have historically settled in the Third, Fourth and Fifth Wards, in shotgun houses and paint-peeling shacks, in ghettos routinely starved for infrastructure and redevelopment funds by the city fathers. Since 1992, the artist Rick Lowe and his co-workers have taken a rundown set of one-story wooden houses on Holman Street, originally built for cheap tenant housing, and renovated them, assigning half to artists for work space and installation projects. The artists, both local and international, are encouraged to interact with the surrounding community while developing their spaces.
The other half of the houses are set aside as residences for single mothers, who are encouraged to turn their lives around with the aid of educational classrooms and child care. The personable Rick Lowe raised the money for purchasing and rehabbing the property largely from local philanthropic foundations and wealthy families. He also got a group of Rice University architecture students to build a new two-story house for single mothers, and recently acquired the El Dorado Ballroom, formerly a mecca for black musicians, a block away.
The idea of a grass-roots arts project that also provides affordable housing and social services is particularly noteworthy in a city that has turned its back on public housing, allowing most of USHA-financed Allen Parkway Village, in Houston's oldest black community, the Fourth Ward, to be torn down. The Fourth Ward had the ill luck to be in the shadow of downtown, and therefore ripe for the kind of "urban renewal" that displaces poor families and replaces them with speculative gentrification. The Third Ward, where the row house project is located, has the cushion of a little more distance, and developer indifference, to allow its plans to mature.
Another grass-roots effort that has helped to transform Houston is the rehabilitation of old loft buildings in downtown's Market Square area. I had heard that downtown was becoming more of a magnet after work hours; but it was hard to picture any life taking hold in that steel-and-glass zone of jumbo corporate headquarters, with formidable street-level lobbies. As it turns out, all the vaunted downtown vitality -- the new restaurants, tapas bars, movie theater, art galleries -- is on the fringes, in the remnants of an older downtown that had miraculously been spared development. As in other American cities, like Minneapolis and Los Angeles, this somewhat seedy area of warehouses and bail bondsmen suddenly looked good to artists and historically minded entrepreneurs. Floor by floor, storefront by storefront, they began bringing the area back to life in places like the adventurous new Lawing Gallery, the Notsuoh Cafe ("Houston" spelled backward), a funky coffeehouse where the prosperous and the poor commingle, and Tasca, an elegant new restaurant.
Already in place, downtown, were the major performance institutions -- the opera, the symphony, the ballet, the Alley Theater -- that constituted together a Lincoln Center-like phalanx, top-heavy with blue-chip culture. Now, Houstonians have somewhere to get a bite or a drink afterward. Or they can stroll along the Buffalo Bayou, one of the many streams that run through the city. The park still has that look of an architectural sketch, scrawnily detailed, isolated, more potential than reality, but in time the local people may take to it, the way San Antonians do their River Walk. For now, it is graced by an impressive public artwork, Mel Chin's "Seven Screens," a set of stainless steel towers with panels derived from drawings by Houston's children.
And rising a few blocks away from downtown's heart is the giant new Astros baseball stadium with a retractable roof. No great shakes architecturally -- in the de rigueur, turn-of-the-19th-century style of Baltimore's Camden Yards or Cleveland's Jacobs Field -- it's still a winning proposition to local sports fans who'll be able to walk to a game after work.
How Houston is changing may be symbolized by the fact that, less than 40 years ago, the city built the Astros' first home, the Astrodome, in the middle of an empty field on the edge of town and proclaimed it "the eighth wonder of the world." Now it's passe, turned over to cattle shows and rock concerts, while downtown beckons the fans.
Even with all this concentration of resources, some local observers, like Stephen Fox, are worried that downtown won't be able to continue drawing enough customers. He remembers how similar efforts in the past ran aground.
A persistent problem is downtown's lack of retail: all the big department stores except one (Foley's) relocated to the Galleria-Post Oak area, a paradise for mall shoppers and a nightmare for urbanists, just beyond the loop, the ring highway 610 that encircles little Houston. What speaks in favor of downtown's continuing revival is the fact that people have started to live there. A turning point was the decision in 1996 to convert the historic Rice Hotel to an apartment building, instead of tearing it down in proper Houston fashion.
That, as well as the loft dwellers around Market Square, ensures downtown at least some 24-hour presence.
The visitor new to Houston tends to bounce between downtown and the museum district, with shopping detours to the Galleria. One misses a lot of the charm and the soul of Houston that way. I recommend getting in a car and driving around the residential neighborhoods, such as Montrose, the West End, North and South Boulevards, West University Village, the Heights and River Oaks.
While too much attention has gone to Houston's so-called Emerald City image, the commercial towers that photograph well from 65 miles an hour even as they disappoint up close, the unreported story is its domestic architecture. Building on the past achievements of earlier Houston architects like John Staub, Karl Kamrath and Howard Barnstone, who set the regional standard of refined modernism with their ranch houses, mansions and apartment courts, a new set of local architects has sprung up to do brilliant work on small, relatively inexpensive houses. William F. Stern, for instance, designed a beauty of a wood-frame residence at 1202 Milford, that has the cozy feeling of a tree house; Carlos Jimenez has perfected the austere, glass-brick look with a dash of tropical elan, and Cameron Armstrong has worked wonders with his tin houses in the West End.
Alas, for every one of these architectural gems over the past decade, there have been 10 hideously clunky, oversize neo-Victorian town houses, wedged tightly together for maximum economic profit.
Houston was said to be a new kind of metropolis, a car city that subverted the concentrated, street-wall verities of European urbanism. The truth is somewhat more complex: having spread its borders wide and thin, it continues to fill in the empty pieces, like Los Angeles. More pedestrian-friendly zones proliferate, even if one has to drive to the edge of them and park the car.
For the truly intrepid traveler, there are the vast suburban tracts of Houston's "outer Siberia." The majority of Houstonians live in these areas, and I'm sure a lot of peculiar, interesting stuff must be going on in them, even if it's not yet clear to me how to decode it from the front seat of my car. One afternoon I headed out in the direction of southwest Houston, through Bellaire and Sharpstown, past South Gessner toward Alief (these names conjure up to me the place where ancient mariners expected a steep falling-off of the earth's surface). I found miles of street signs in Chinese and English, acres of Vietnamese and Chinese strip malls, the Jade Buddha temple and a Confucian temple. This was no mere Chinatown but a whole world of Asian Houston -- perhaps the future.
I got back in my car and returned to the museum district, where I checked out two new entries: the Children's Museum of Houston, designed by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott-Brown, a cheerful, playful structure, and the Holocaust Museum Houston, by Ralph Appelbaum, which is sober, moving and anything but playful.
Then I went home. I had seen enough good architecture for a while. The pleasurable sense that Houston keeps getting better was counterbalanced by the fact that no one in the outside world seems to know or care. It remains the most underrated of American cities.

HEADLINE: Entering New Castle, Del.

BYLINE: By Francine Prose; Francine Prose's novel "Blue Angel" is forthcoming from HarperCollins.

 BODY:
For years, i confess, i'd come to think of Delaware as that long, rather terrifying bridge between Maryland and New Jersey -- specifically, the Delaware Memorial Bridge that you cross (and cross and cross) on the way to Washington from New York. So it was a revelation and a pleasure actually to stop in Delaware, and to discover that what lives more or less underneath the bridge is not the troll one might sensibly expect, but rather the attractive town of New Castle. Old and lovely without being
cutesy or pretentious, relaxed but high functioning, cared for but not precious, fossilized or overrestored, New Castle is a rarity: a model of historical preservation and small-town civility in which the owner of that adorable brick Federal or imposing ivy-covered Victorian is more likely to drive a pickup truck than a BMW. 
 New Castle, with a population of just less than 5,000, is the sort of village you'd expect to find in Europe, a place that has noticed and prized its own good looks, and halted construction and demolition at a high point in its architectural history. Throughout the 20 or so square blocks that make up the town's historical section, an 18th-century Dutch cottage is around the corner from Federal mansions with soaring ceilings, which in turn neighbor Colonial houses painted in airy pastel colors and gabled Victorian dwellings in the more somber palette of the late 19th century.
It's also one of those towns (like Charlottesville, Va.) that demonstrate the great aesthetic appeal of old brick. New Castle's sidewalks are brick, as are many of its buildings, the walls that enclose the gardens and the paths that run among the spires of iris and lupine, the bushes of peonies, rhododendrons and roses. Everyone here seems to garden -- some in borders on green lawns sloping down to the Delaware River, some in tidy plots no larger than big-city yards. Time and sunlight have nurtured the perennials, and faded the brick into shades of sienna and salmon that, one imagines, Martha Stewart would offer a fortune to replicate, and to market.
From the first moment you register some marvelous architectural detail -- the pigtail curlicues of a Carpenter Gothic porch, the Palladian grace of a fan window, an elaborate chimney above a stepped roof straight out of a Bruegel painting -- you're obliged to slow down and pay attention to what each building has to offer. This is but one of many reasons why a visit to New Castle can function as a rest cure. I've never been more reluctant to phone into my answering machine at home than I was during the two days, this past spring, that my husband, Howie, and I spent there.
New Castle just barely provides that surge of tourist adrenaline inspired by acquisitiveness and new venues for shopping. The old part of town has a pleasant general store but no real grocery, a few interesting antiques shops, most of which stay open only from 10 to 4 and a rare-book dealer whose business operates "Saturdays, by appointment, and by chance." There are no luxury hotels, or, for that matter, hotels, just a few small bed-and-breakfasts, including the charming and well-equipped (private baths, phones and TV sets) Armitage Inn, where the tradition of hospitality goes back to the 18th century, when the house functioned as a stopping place for postriders.
Every year, on the third Saturday in May, New Castle goes all out and puts on "A Day in Old New Castle," a house-tour extravaganza during which 50 or so of the village's most gorgeous houses fling open their doors and show visitors that they are as beautiful inside as out. The people who live here seem to love it; everyone mentions it, sooner or later. And though I'll admit to a mild phobia of private-house tours, I can see the point of this one, which would have spared me the trouble of rudely trying to peek into people's living rooms and gardens. On the other hand, I don't know if I would have enjoyed New Castle quite so much if I'd had to troop through its narrow lanes in a large crowd convened to admire someone's silver tea service and someone else's snapdragons.
Even during tourist season, weekdays in New Castle are quiet. By late afternoon, the streets empty out, and the action, such as it is, moves to the Battery -- a lush park, shaded by fragrant flowering trees, that borders the Delaware River. It's immensely relaxing to spend the early evening by the shore, sitting on a bench, watching tugboats and thrillingly huge tankers sail slowly past, letting a horse-chestnut tree drop pale flowers on your head and idly wondering why the park isn't crowded with urban planners observing how variously and harmoniously this community makes use of its waterfront.
People come to the Battery to fish, jog, stroll, read and just hang out. In fact, on the afternoon we spent there, the passers-by were so lovely, the little vignettes they enacted so endearing -- the elderly couple roller-skating hand in hand, the un-self-consciously multicultural group of bright-eyed teenagers playing catch, the two women in their 60's doing their best to power walk but slowing down to gossip, the handsome young parents with babies in strollers -- that I couldn't help wondering if we had somehow stumbled into "The Truman Show." Because there is that about New Castle, too: After two days in town, you start recognizing faces in the street, and familiar names in the graveyards.
For lovers of historical cemeteries, old New Castle is paradise. Surrounding the Immanuel Episcopal Church -- a stately, austere structure that, from some angles, resembles van Gogh's painting of the "Church at Auvers" -- are tombstones dating from the early 1700's. Many have inscriptions that are not only touching but also, by modern standards, verbose. So we learn of Mary McWilliam, who died in 1749: "In her did conspicuously shine all the Devine & Amiable Virtues of the Human soul Piety without Ostentation Humility without Affectation unbounded Charity filial Duty Conjugal Love & Affection Maternal Tenderness and Indulgence but with Oeconomy beloved in living and in death lamented." In one especially lovely corner are the graves of the Van Dyke family, whose house on Delaware Street was the site of a wedding at which the Marquis de Lafayette gave away the bride. A nearby headstone is inscribed with a weeping beech, its shape familiar from Colonial funerary paintings and samplers, and also, as it happens, from the gardens of New Castle. Seeing these gracefully drooping trees -- in person, as it were -- makes it clear why they are such potent symbols of bereavement. And the unusually handsome calico cat that makes its home in the Immanuel Church cemetery recalls those sleek, well-fed, slightly spooked felines that appear, often in the clutches of their child-owners, in American primitive portraits.
One way to get a quick sense of -- and a lightning tour through -- New Castle's lively history is to tag along behind the squads of schoolchildren who regularly spill from yellow buses, equipped with pencils and assignment sheets covered with questions they're required to answer. Predictably, the kids are less susceptible than adults to the town's quaint charm. I watched a boy in skater shorts and a bowl haircut consider the goose-egg-size cobblestones on Market Street and tell his friends, "Man, I'm not walking on that, no way." But there's plenty to keep them busy as they race from one historical marker to another.
Their work begins at the handsome town green, allegedly paced-off by Peter Stuyvesant, who established Fort Casimir here in 1651, as a means of monitoring and intimidating the Swedes, who had settled the area in the 1630's. Victorious in a 1655 battle with their Swedish neighbors, the Dutch rechristened Fort Casimir "New Amstel" only to have their claim challenged by the British, who renamed the town New Castle. (An interesting history could be written of site names in the area, perhaps beginning with the nearby town of Odessa, where there are still other magnificent old houses that visitors can tour. Its name was changed from Cantwell's Bridge, in 1855, by town fathers who -- apparently practicing magical thinking -- believed that their flagging economy could somehow be revived if they adopted the name of the thriving Russian port.)
On New Castle's Market Street, a statue of William Penn commemorates the Quaker settler's receipt of what is now Delaware in a land grant from the Duke of York. In 1704, Delaware broke away from Pennsylvania, and New Castle was designated the colonial capital. The town retained its political importance, fleetingly, when Delaware became a state. In 1777, the capital was moved to Dover, the first in a series of setbacks (the Delaware Canal and the long-distance railroad were located some distance from New Castle, and in 1881 the county seat was changed to Wilmington) that stunted the town's economic growth while, in the process, blessedly safeguarding it from some of the more damaging side effects of rapid modernization, prosperity and growth.
A less frantic method of tracking the town's history is to take the brief, undemanding tours of several of its exemplary dwellings and public buildings. The Dutch House Museum dates from around 1700 and contains household objects -- ice skates, wooden clogs, a Bible in Dutch and a practice sampler -- from this early period. Far grander is the 1738 Amstel House; its artifacts include what must be the world's most ingenious oven timer: a candle burning down the length of a small notched post. Taking us through the Court House, our amiable guide showed us the room in which the State Assembly met until 1777 and where the Declaration of Independence was read; an instructive exhibit on the town's role in the Underground Railroad; and, best of all, the interior of the old courtroom, where a window in the floor offers a view of the foundations of the original 1689 courthouse, burned down by a prisoner condemned to hang for breaking and entering.
The most ambitious of the museums is the Read House, built in 1801. Like the stately homes in Odessa, this one has its Balzacian history of fortunes made by successful, self-made men and, in some cases, squandered by hapless older sons. The Read House also shares with Odessa's Corbit-Sharp and Wilson-Warner houses the concept of a museum as a sort of doll house, subject to periodic refurnishings by its curators. The rooms are regularly redecorated for Christmas, "summer dress" and so forth. When we were there, the theme was the War of 1812, during which the citizens of New Castle assumed that they were about to be attacked by the British, and got ready to flee en masse. The objects in the museum were packed and prepared for flight, stacked in the hall, the sitting rooms and bedchambers; it was sort of fun and sort of confusing to see an authentic, period version of the mess I'd left at home.
The Read House pays tribute to Philip and Lydia Laird, a stylish couple who sound a bit like Gerald and Sara Murphy, and who played an important role in New Castle's restoration and preservation. In 1920, they bought the Read House even though it was on the seamy side of town, a fact that, one supposes, would hardly have daunted a pair who built a speakeasy in their basement, on the model of a German rathskeller, and held lavish parties on their roof overlooking the river.
At 4 on a thursday afternoon, the kitchen at Jessop's Tavern was closed, but we were told we could sit at the bar and have a bowl of soup -- a corn chowder that was quite simply the most wonderful corn chowder I'd ever had, and probably ever will have; you'd hesitate a million times before you made a soup like that at home. For if most of historic New Castle's major construction ended early in this century, its cuisine (despite an occasional sun-dried tomato) ended at the midpoint.
Dining in New Castle, you understand why people liked the food of the 1950's, that innocent era before anyone knew that there was a problem with cholesterol, with heavy cream, butter and salt. The town's restaurants, you suspect, might not speak the same language as the health-and-weight-conscious, dressing-on-the-side tourists interrogating the waiter about a dish's every ingredient.
Considering the generous quantities of cream, crab meat and tomato used in its seafood soup, the David Finney Inn could hardly fail to produce a small masterpiece of old-fashioned American cooking, and the Arsenal on the Green Restaurant, housed in a structure built in 1809 to store ammunition, produced a model spinach and bacon salad.
Returning for dinner at Jessop's Tavern, we ordered a bottle of inexpensive wine (New Castle is not a place for the extensive, thesis-quality wine list) that turned out to be surprisingly good. We joked about not being able to find the label and vintage again, out in the real world, after we left New Castle. Indeed, the town does give one that feeling of having vanished off the edge of the known world, fallen down the rabbit hole, slipped into another time zone. Every time we left the historic center, we got lost, and got lost again returning, perhaps because the landscape changes so drastically the moment you leave.
Just as New Castle was saved from disfiguring change by apparent economic and political misfortune, so now, again, it seems paradoxically protected by its threatening surroundings. The high-speed rush of Interstate 95 is only a few miles away. From one end of town, you can see the Delaware Memorial Bridge. Every night, the prodigious refineries to the south produce a festival of lights, really rather pretty when reflected in the river. And the distant but unmistakable view of the Salem Nuclear Power Plant, visible from the Battery, makes it unlikely that the rich will be outbidding each other for prime waterfront property.
But perhaps that's what it takes for a town to be left alone and survive, undisturbed and vital, with a population on whom history, architectural beauty and a well-tended and utilized riverfront has so clearly had a salutary effect.
On the first afternoon we spent in New Castle, a vintage three-masted frigate with its sails lowered was floating in the river just offshore, bobbing gently in the wake of giant freighters transporting truck bodies and cement pipes. By the next morning, the old ship was gone. It was explained to us, logically, that over the Memorial Day weekend there was going to be a gathering of tall ships in Wilmington harbor, and that the ship was part of the flotilla. Still, it was hard to keep from imagining that the frigate's appearance and disappearance was a fortuitous, ghostly visitation, staged for our entertainment by the town to underscore its rich and colorful past.

 BODY:

THE PARADOX OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY
 Elites, Special Interests, and
 the Betrayal of Public Trust.
 By John B. Judis.
 305 pp. New York:
 Pantheon Books. $26. 
 John B. Judis began his last book, "Grand Illusion: Critics and Champions of the American Century," with a smart essay about the agonies of Herbert Croly. The author of "The Promise of American Life" (1909) and a founder of The New Republic (where Judis himself now serves as a senior editor), Croly is remembered for his insistence that national regulation was required to protect American democracy from the effects of the post-Civil War corporate oligarchies. Less well known today are the knots in which Croly tied himself as he pursued this argument. He distrusted labor and other populist social movements; he hoped instead that reform would come at the hands of benign elites wielding the tools of what he considered "disinterested" social science.
In the early years of Woodrow Wilson's administration, something like this actually seemed to be happening. But after World War I, Croly was bitterly disappointed by the follies of Wilson's wise men at Versailles and by the crass self-interest of the business lobbies that dominated 1920's Washington. Croly withdrew from politics and spent his last decade bitterly wondering, in Judis's words, "how the disinterested progressive intellectual . . . could influence a public and a corporate elite committed to the quest for individual gain."
Judis's new book, "The Paradox of American Democracy," plunges into the same questions that brought Croly to such frustration. Judis hopes to rebut, or at least to complicate, a common school of sociology, associated with C. Wright Mills and some of his disciples, that holds that a small "power elite" acts to stymie fundamental reform in the United States. On the contrary, Judis argues, reform is most successful precisely during periods when a certain type of elite policy analyst emerges. He has in mind the members of organizations like the National Civic Federation, which brought together business and labor leaders at the beginning of the century; people like the Ivy League-educated architects of the New Deal, who were branded class traitors in their day; and intellectuals like those at the Brookings Institution and the Ford Foundation, who supplied social science and policy advice to the ambitious liberals of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. These elites occupied what Louis Brandeis, referring to lawyers, called "a position of independence, between the wealthy and the people, prepared to curb the excesses of either." It is only when such high-minded elites are weak or absent, Judis suggests, that crude economic interests rule and petrochemical lobbyists are invited to rewrite the nation's regulatory laws, as happened in 1995. This is the paradox of American democracy.
One important virtue of this book is that Judis offers his paradox as an observation, not as a Grand Unified Theory of progressive politics. He clearly values the ideal of disinterested policy analysis, but understands (much better than the young Croly did) that democracy cannot be reduced to an antiseptic contest among "scientific" policy prescriptions. Judis never denies that mobilized social movements are fundamental, and he acknowledges that the high-minded elites he describes may have been as much symptoms as causes of the reform periods in which they appeared. The National Civic Federation was founded in 1900, after a decade of bloody labor conflict; the New Deal came amid a huge surge of left-wing militance and in the shadow of foreign tyrannies; and the Ford Foundation's 1960's antipoverty research coincided with summers of urban rioting. A historian of the C. Wright Mills school might look at this picture and say, with some good reason: Of course American society is going to cough up reformist elites during times when its fundamental stability is threatened.
But Judis understands that history can't be bottled in such deterministic maxims. He wants to bring our attention to the details and the contingencies of these elites' histories -- to an appreciation that the American establishment has "its own ethos and worldview," which can't "be fitted into conventional Marxist or sociological categories." In this respect, however, the book never quite goes for the kill. Judis provides quick, judicious sketches of his high-minded elites; but his argument might have been richer had he written a full-immersion portrait of at least one of the organizations: its fundamental beliefs, day-to-day operations and relationships with other political actors.
Judis also acknowledges, but never really tries to dissect, the dark side of center-left policy elites: their tendency to slide into technocratic hubris. In many ways the Kennedy years marked the apotheosis of the disinterested policy maker. The White House kept business, labor and civil rights leaders at arm's length, but opened its doors wide to the Council on Foreign Relations, the Brookings Institution and the RAND Corporation. But while we look back in admiration at the social movements that emerged in the early 1960's, the Camelot brain trust itself is remembered for . . . what? For Vietnam, and for its willful blindness to the simmering angers within American society. Kennedy himself told the Brookings Institution in May 1963 that "most of the problems . . . that we now face are technical problems, are administrative problems." Somewhere offstage, Betty Friedan, Malcolm X and George Wallace shook their heads and smiled.
This pattern of arrogance, of course, does not by itself refute Judis's central argument -- that the ideal of disinterested policy making is crucial to democracy, and that this ideal has been seriously corroded during the past quarter century. In the book's strongest chapters, Judis describes the business counteroffensive of the mid-1970's, the period when modern conservative think tanks and corporate lobbying took shape. Judis presents this material with far more detail and subtlety than most other liberal commentators. Among other things, he is attentive to the irony that progressives themselves helped set the stage for the rise of moneyed interests by enacting reforms that weakened the traditional powers of political parties. And he has a fitting rage at the parade of Carter, Reagan and Bush administration veterans who have moved straight into million-dollar K Street berths: "By becoming business lobbyists, the former officials deprived the country of responsible mediating voices. By making it appear that even the most distinguished Americans could be bought, they contributed to public cynicism about all political opinion, including that of elites."
This is a valuable and consistently provocative book. But I wonder, finally, if Judis's well-earned anger at Washington corruption hasn't clouded his judgment about very recent events. His account of the 1994 health care train wreck, for example, rightly deplores the power and demagogy of the insurance lobbies, but underplays the failures of Ira Magaziner's arrogant, closed-door White House task force. Here is where a deeper understanding of Kennedy-era hubris might have been helpful. Just as Kennedy's team consistently underestimated and misunderstood the desires of the civil rights movement, the Clinton White House was extraordinarily clumsy in its relations with the social movements (especially labor) that might have been expected to fight for its health care plan.
Finally, what about the possibility of conservative reform campaigns and disinterested elites? The strange-bedfellow coalitions -- churches, business, neighborhood organizations -- that have fought for school vouchers in Cleveland and Milwaukee can't be dismissed as the mere products of narrow corporate interests or free-market dogma. Indeed, in these coalitions street-level social movements and think-tank elites seem to have listened to and learned from each other far more harmoniously than the left's components managed to do during the health care fight.
These doubts and questions are intended as a tribute to, not a critique of, the arguments Judis raises in "The Paradox of American Democracy." This book will provoke long and diverse reflections on the state of our politics, and on why, if he's still watching from beyond the grave, Herbert Croly is probably in as much anguish as ever.

THE CLUSTERED WORLD
 How We Live, What We Buy, and What It All Means About Who We Are.
 By Michael J. Weiss.
 Illustrated. 323 pp. Boston:
 Little, Brown & Company. $29.95. 
 There are two kinds of people in this country, one of which believes there are 62 kinds of people in this country. Michael J. Weiss is among these, and 12 years ago his book "The Clustering of America" described the work of a man named Jonathan Robbin, who had divided the nation into ZIP codes and, using census information, public opinion polls and other data, lumped together different codes with similar statistical profiles.
These groupings -- population segments within which people buy the same things, get their information and entertainment from the same sources, vote the same way and generally behave as consumer clones of one another -- were called clusters, describing what Weiss calls "distinctive lifestyle types." At that time, there were 40 of them -- Robbin gave them distinguishing and vaguely offensive names, like "Blue Blood Estates" and "Shotguns & Pickups" -- and the cluster became a fundamental term in business thinking, the niche in niche market.
Now, in "The Clustered World," Weiss has enlarged his scope. In it he tells us that Americans now constitute 62 clusters -- as defined by Claritas Inc., a marketing information company in Arlington, Va., that has broadened Robbin's work -- and that the rest of the world has become clustered too, as marketing companies abroad have found it appropriate to divvy up those populations as well. Not only that, Weiss tells us, Americans may well have more in common with their similarly clustered brethren in another country than with their fellow citizens in another cluster.
This is all mildly interesting, mainly because it provides a framework for Weiss to present a wealth of amusing arcana about the habits of people within vaguely defined boundaries. In American college towns (the "Towns & Gowns" cluster), for instance, tequila and Dove Bars are popular, and twice as many people watch the soap opera "Another World" as do people in the rest of the country. In the "Military Quarters" cluster, that is, people living on or near military bases, people are four times as likely to watch "Hard Copy" as the average American, and more than twice as likely to watch "Ricki Lake"; they also eat more than their share of canned chili. Among young middle-class exurban families (the "New Homesteaders" cluster), furniture refinishing, downhill skiing and cats are in; chess, HBO and tractor pulls are out. Call waiting, it turns out, is heavily used in two kinds of clusters: those with affluent suburban families (because of their teenagers) and those with working-class minorities (black Americans spend more than an hour and a half a day on the phone, three times the norm).
Unfortunately, Weiss is no mere presenter of data. Rather, he seems to think of himself as a kind of Margaret Mead of marketing, an interpreter of the customs of the inhabitants of these strange, newly discovered lands. Indeed, he says that in 15 years of studying geodemographics, as the statistical portraiture of circumscribed populations is known, he has become a true believer. He actually describes his experience as "my long love affair with clusters," and it has convinced him, he says, of "their power to divine the mysteries of how we live."
This is a rather monumental claim for the clever and effective marketing tool that clusters represent, and Weiss never approaches substantiating it. It's difficult to tell whether this is merely an example (one of many in this book) of cliche-ridden writing and imprecise thinking or whether Weiss is rather wackily out of sync with his material. That clusters are useful -- for businesses seeking customers, for candidates seeking votes, for nonprofit organizations seeking new contributors, for health organizations tracking the incidence rates of disease -- is amply demonstrated here. That they are sociologically important is not, and it is unnerving -- weird, actually -- that Weiss repeatedly asserts it anyway.
On the opening page, for example, Weiss says that clusters reveal both "profound and trivial" things about American lifestyles: "What prompts some of us to eat Brie and others to devour Velveeta cheese?" he writes, as a sample of, presumably, one of the trivial things clusters can tell us. His answer is presented a couple of pages later in a chart comparing Velveeta buyers and Brie buyers in Washington, where, Weiss writes, "a fault line exists between the fans of Brie cheese, who tend to hold down executive jobs and write the laws of government, and those of Kraft Velveeta, who maintain the service economy." So affluent, influential people eat more Brie; blue-collar folks eat more Velveeta. That's not exactly evidence that being elected to Congress "prompts" a taste for French cheese, is it? (And a fault line between cheese eaters? An overripe metaphor, to say the least.)
This willful inflation of logic pervades the book to such a degree that the whole isn't logical. In addition, the author's truly awkward way with words -- Granted, not all diseases are cluster sensitive," he writes at one point, meaning (I think) that some infectious germs are not influenced by the socioeconomic status of their victims -- often clouds his intentions further. Weiss writes about the "popularity of clustering." What does that mean? Who likes to cluster?
Most telling, even the central concept of the book -- the cluster -- is ill explained. What is a cluster, anyway? Weiss never acknowledges the cluster as a concept, an artifice; rather, he seems to think that such a thing exists in nature. But he never defines it absolutely. At various times it is equated with a neighborhood type, a population segment, a lifestyle type. He says clusters are used to "demarcate a variety of small geographic areas," and that the "core truth" of what we learn from them "can be simply expressed: You are like your neighbors." But he also declares that "thanks to technological advancements, no physical contact is required for cluster membership." And if he sometimes speaks of a cluster this way, as something one belongs to, like a fraternity, at other times he apparently views a cluster as a palpable place.
"In clusters like Hispanic Mix," he writes, "home to downscale, predominantly Hispanic families, you can live most of your life without needing to speak or read English. "
There is something intellectually alluring about the idea of redrawing the boundaries among the world's communities to create a new paradigm for observing civilization. That's what Weiss seems to think he's done here, and maybe there are some clusters whose residents will agree with him. In the Skeptical Readers cluster, however, which includes my neighborhood, we find books that analyze humanity as a collection of target markets a little depressing.

HEADLINE: Fort Bragg's Changing Tide

BYLINE: By SUSAN ALLEN TOTH; SUSAN ALLEN TOTH's most recent book is "England for All Seasons" (Ballantine).

 BODY:
WHEN I'm walking on Fort Bragg's Glass Beach, I'm easily distracted. If I look out to sea, restless swells break over seaweed-drenched boulders. At my feet, the sand glitters with pebbles of green, red and yellow. This rough beach was once the town dump -- hunks of rusted metal blend into the dark rocks -- and now, after decades of sea-polishing, trash has turned into jewels. On the headland shore above, huge smokestacks at Georgia-Pacific, the forest products company, belch white and gray dragon-puffs into the sky.
Glass Beach hints at some of the hidden pleasures -- and contradictions -- of Fort Bragg, a logging, fishing and commercial center with a population of about 6,000 on the midnorthern coast of California. Just eight miles north of artsy Mendocino, a Victorian picture-postcard village full of galleries and trendy restaurants, Fort Bragg, which shares Mendocino's startlingly beautiful coastline and back country, has remained largely working-class. 
 But after many quiet years, change is arriving in Fort Bragg with almost alarming speed. California's Highway 1, which runs through the town, is lined with establishments like Baxman's Gravel andWoody's Weld-All. But on our most recent visit, in July, my husband, James, and I were surprised to find that the town's business district had taken on a cosmopolitan spirit.
Art galleries and bookstores are popping up near the Sugar 'n' Spice Discount Store and the Tip Top Lounge. Antiques and collectibles fill several stores; the 300 block of North Franklin is now known as "Antique Row." Merchants and the local Chamber of Commerce, realizing the attractions of Fort Bragg's early-1900's painted-wood streetfronts, have begun to publicize their Historic Downtown Business District.
A few doors down from the Headlands Coffeehouse, a down-to-earth place filled with local residents, the Tattoo Tavern's picture windows display portfolios of tattoo art (as well as an unadvertised flesh-baring show, since patrons lie back in a dental chair and get their elaborate tattoos in full sight of the street). Around the corner, but a world away, the gift-filled Hot Pepper Jelly Company sells its own fancy jams, relishes, chutneys and vinegars in flavors like lavender-and-blueberry or apricot-and-rosemary. The Company Store, which sold hardware and groceries to generations of mill workers and their families, is now a flashily restored mini-mall recalling the building's history in vintage redwood but selling contemporary art, crafts and boutique clothing.
Despite its deceptively old-fashioned name, the North Coast Brewing Company, opened in 1988, was named by the Beverage Testing Institute as "one of the 10 best breweries in the world." Its eclectic menu offers not only lumberjack-heavy food like "killer nachos," but also fresh Pacific red snapper crisped in Scrimshaw beer batter and French fries.
But Fort Bragg is not merely retooling itself as a retro town. For more exotic tastes, the new Cafe Prima offers such traditional dishes from Kenya as kimanga cha mboga -- cassava root and kabocha squash, boiled, mashed and mixed with red beans. At the Mendo Bistro, upstairs at the Company Store, pastas include sweet-potato gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce and spiced pecans. The Old Coast Hotel, built in 1892 and recently refurbished, will serve up a bowl of its specialty, shellfish cioppino with crab, prawns, mussels and clams.
Fort Bragg's lumberyards are visibly languishing, and asking about this decline in the industry is almost guaranteed to spark a heated discussion about its probable causes, from overlogging to cheap imports. But several of Fort Bragg's attractions recall a more prosperous past. An imposing Victorian mansion, built by the timber magnate C. R. Johnson, is now the Guest House Museum, restored by Georgia-Pacific and given to the city. Operated by the Fort Bragg-Mendocino Coast Historical Society, it focuses on the logging industry.
At 700 North Main, now the gingerbread-Victorian Pudding Creek Inn, a Russian count nicknamed "Bottle Brown" once lived. Somewhere on the property he is supposed to have hidden a trove of jewels, which, like most such treasures, remain unfound.
From the old railroad depot, built in 1924, the California Western Railroad runs daily excursions on the Skunk Train, a leisurely half or full-day trip into what remains of the redwood forest. (The vintage trains, with their gas engines, were named long ago by loggers who claimed, "You can smell 'em before you can see 'em.")
But what brings James and me back to Fort Bragg, again and again, is not really its history or its changing fortunes but its setting. The Mendocino coast -- the plunging, rocky, surf-tossed stretch from Gualala to Westport -- is still a gloriously unspoiled part of California. It is far enough from San Francisco to deter hordes of day-trippers: a three-and-a-half-hour inland drive on Highways 101 and 128, far longer on the scenic but tortuous coastal Highway 1. In the middle of this coast, where redwoods still sometimes crowd close to the road, Fort Bragg offers a perfect base for exploration.
Within a 20-minute drive of the town are state parks and reserves with challenging or restful walks for an hour's or a day's hike. Between Mendocino and Fort Bragg, Highway 1 gives direct access to Russian Gulch State Park, whose short oceanfront trail circles past a blowhole (an ocean-cut tunnel collapsed at its inland end) called the Devil's Punch Bowl. On the other side of the highway, linking trails covering more than nine miles climb through redwoods, fir, laurel and other trees that cover the canyon of Russian Gulch.
Less than two miles north, another road angles off the highway to Point Cabrillo Preserve, on a windswept peninsula crowned by a lighthouse. A short drive away, a roadside parking lot at Jughandle State Reserve provides a starting point for a two-and-a-half mile inland trail, called an "ecological staircase," at Jughandle State Reserve. This trail winds past creekside bogs, then through meadows and scrub forest, and finally up to a "pygmy forest," full of stunted trees and shrubs. Even in mid-August, at the height of tourist season, most of these trails are remarkably peaceful.
One of our favorite walks does not appear in tourist brochures. Driving north from Fort Bragg, 11.5 miles from the Pudding Creek railroad trestle that is one of the town's landmarks, James and and I watch for a familiar sign: "Vista Point." Many Vista Points, similarly posted, abound on the Mendocino coast, but this one is special. Parking in a small pulloff, we follow an unmarked trail that drops steeply, past a sheltering band of pines, to a meadow of waving tall grasses that flow straight to the edge of the sea-cliffs.
From there we can look back at the high treeless hills that rise behind the road, as well as many miles up and down an almost empty coast. To the north, the road curves and disappears into a faint blue mist. As we thread our way along a narrow path along the edge of the cliffs, we can always catch glimpses of the seals that sun themselves on the low rocks offshore. We too bask in the vast space and silence, broken only by the rumble and roar of the surf below.
SEALS are also on display, more publicly, at MacKerricher State Park, about two miles north of Fort Bragg. Here a wheelchair-accessible boardwalk loops over spongy terrain past an overlook with viewing benches, where protected and much-admired seals gather on a chain of half-submerged rocks below. Walking from MacKerricher's parking lot along an abandoned seafront road, we can arrive in about half an hour at Ten Mile Beach. The piecemeal road, shattered and washed away in many places, finally disappears, testimonial to the violent winter storms that have battered this section of coast.
Although Ten Mile Beach has a pedestrian name, it unrolls into miles of wide firm sand washed by constant surf. On the shore side, a long line of high dunes hides Ten Mile from the distant highway. Since it is far too dangerous (and too cold) for swimmers or surfers, the beach is virtually deserted.
We are not always alone on Ten Mile Beach. Seals often swim by, poking their heads above the low riffs of crumpling surf. Once, during a March visit, when the spouts and flukes of migrating whales punctuate Fort Bragg's offshore horizon, I took a solitary walk along a far stretch of Ten Mile. Suddenly, almost in front of me, a whale rose up vertically in the low foaming surf -- I could never have imagined that water deep enough to cover such a huge animal -- so that, for an instant, I could see its sidewise eye. Then, almost in the same instant, it disappeared. It was as though I had seen a vision; and indeed I had.
From late December to mid-April, gray whales migrate back and forth along the Mendocino coast. The whales have become much-advertised tourist attractions. In March, Fort Bragg, as well as Mendocino, celebrates a Whale Festival, when restaurants compete in seafood chowders, local specialty brewers host a beerfest, and musical events might include the Spyhopping Harmonicas or a barbershop quartet.
During the whale season, several boats leave from Noyo Harbor for whale-watching excursions. Fairly close sightings are almost guaranteed, and a captain will sometimes cut his motor and drift among the whales. When we tried one of these expeditions, I found it exciting to hover close to a lolling pod of partly submerged whales -- but I still remember much more hauntingly my brief lone encounter on Ten Mile Beach.
Almost every walk in and around Fort Bragg leads to the ocean. At the Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens, whose entrance lies just off Highway 1, the front section displays grouped special collections, including dwarf conifers, heathers, succulents, rhododendrons, and more than 165 varieties of fuchsias. (Fuchsias, which thrive on this coast, reach their apotheosis at Fuchsia rama, a large retail nursery on the north side of Fort Bragg.)
From the more formal beds, woodsy trails then veer past a small bog and rise through a narrow gorge, darkened by tall Monterey cypress and lined with luxuriant ferns. Following a creek that tumbles with golden brown water in early spring, the trails snake up and down. Then they join and suddenly emerge from a tunnel of cypresses onto an open headland, dashed with surf from the rocks below.
Even when we stay indoors, we remain on the sea. Although its Main Street is lined with motels and inns, Fort Bragg also abounds in "vacation rentals," private homes rented by absent owners through commercial agencies. On a recent visit, we splurged on California-style luxury at "Seashine," a contemporary three-bedroom house on its own peninsular point.
Seashine was a stunning place to call home. Its floor-to-ceiling windows brought unimpeded views of sky and sea into every room. On the sheltered deck we could watch an ocean sunset, or even enjoy the rain, from the depths of a hot tub. Then, sitting in front of the fireplace, we could catch the first glint of moonlight on the water -- or, early in the morning, the first faraway white jet of a passing whale.
At the end of our week, as we left Fort Bragg, I wondered what I would remember most: the polished-trash pebbles at Glass Beach, the many colors of spiky heather at the Botanical Gardens, the tall-grass meadow at Vista Point, or the barely muffled surf outside our bedroom window. Unlike many vacation towns, Fort Bragg resists a single defining image. Perhaps that is a sign that the town is still alive and changing, ready to surprise me upon our return.

On Staten Island, the New Media Are the Message

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
PETER EISENMAN'S design for the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences brings into focus a theme that has preoccupied him in recent years: the relationship between the history of places and the history of ideas. The $65 million project, which partly straddles the St. George terminal of the Staten Island ferry, is a favorite of the borough president, Guy V. Molinari. The building will house a new branch of the Staten Island Institute, called the Center for Electronic Culture, and will feature displays on the new media that are helping to bring a global culture into being.
Situated near the mouth of New York Harbor, the center will honor a city that began to expand the circulation of Western ideas more than three centuries ago. It offers a microcosmic version of the global forces that are reshaping the contemporary urban condition. Many museums today use advanced media technology in the presentation of shows, the creation of Web sites, the expansion of programs outside the museum's stone and mortar walls. At the Center for Electronic Culture, these new media become the message. 
 Plans for the Center include these exciting upgrades: an Infohall, described as an electronic town square, with games, projections and other media attractions; a museum, featuring five long, serpentine galleries with interpretative displays, along with a library, bookstore and cafeteria, and an Industrial Documentary Center, with research stations for new developments in high-tech communications.
Now, check out these deflating downgrades: our central cities and their architecture, an ancient communications medium that will remain with us so long as people don't tire of ruins. There's no longer any doubt that cities, buildings and interiors are being rapidly affected by new media. Manuel Castels, the urban theorist, has charted what he calls the space of flows, the global network through which information and money are transmitted in ever-shifting patterns without regard for traditional boundaries of city, state and nation. Tourism is the social equivalent of this electronic space. The tourist attraction is one of its architectural devices. The Center for Electronic Culture will be a new attraction for a city that increasingly relies on tourism to shore up its economic base. Eisenman's design gives the space of flows an architectural shape.
The center is integrated with the ferry terminal building and the transportation systems that converge there: boats, trains, buses, cars as well as the parking lots, roads, platforms and piers that serve them. The center's most conspicuous form is a large rotunda, made of intersecting, twisted, tapering oblongs, which rises 44 feet above ground level. The curving shapes recall the sculptures of Clement Meadmore, while the building skin, slit with openings for skylights, will remind some viewers of the steel and concrete roof designed by Eero Saarinen for his Trans World Airlines terminal at Kennedy Airport.
Unlike Saarinen or Meadmore, however, Eisenman asserts that he arrives at his forms by a systematic design process. The process starts by draping a two-dimensional grid over the site. The grid assumes the contour of the site's topography. It is then superimposed with shapes derived from the transportation systems: ferry lanes, train platforms, bus ramps and so on. These shapes are extended into three dimensions and then packed with the building's program: galleries, library, cafeteria, offices and anything else that fits.
No doubt there's a certain amount of gimmickry, not to say hocus-pocus, involved in this process. The point is that, once again, Eisenman has convinced himself of the logical basis for his forms. They are not to be seen as willful, Expressionist shapes but as emanations of a site, its natural topography and its patterns of social use, frozen in architectural form. Obviously, the design bears no resemblance to contextualism, in the customary sense of the term. Unlike the 1992 design by Venturi, Scott Brown for the Manhattan terminal of the Staten Island ferry, for example, Eisenman's plan does not mimic the surfaces of adjacent or prior structures. Rather, it links the specifics of its physical location to the larger grid of Western ideas.
Eisenman has been using this design method at least since 1982, when he designed the Wexner Center for Art in Columbus, Ohio. In that project, the particulars of place are represented on an organizing grid derived from the city's street system and the partial reconstruction of an old armory building that had once occupied the site. The history of ideas is represented by the expansion of the grid into an abstract, three-dimensional form of white painted steel. This form, which resembles a scaffold, contains the Wexner's gallery spaces. It signifies the classic framework of Cartesian thought.
The scaffold also brings to mind the roughly contemporaneous work by Sol Lewitt and is thus a clear indication of the source for Eisenman's topographical method of design. Like Lewitt, Eisenman is a Conceptual artist, but one who happens to work in the architectural field. Like Frank Gehry, who has derived inspiration from Robert Rauschenberg, Ellsworth Kelly and other artists, Eisenman has drawn architecture into a wider frame of cultural reference. This is a natural move for architects of cultural institutions, and one that should be welcomed by those who esteem Beaux Arts edifices for incorporating painting and sculpture into their designs. In this sense, Eisenman's Staten Island project must be seen as a legitimate heir to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Public Library and other landmarks.
Since Eisenman is our foremost anti-Classicist, this line of descent is not easily apparent. Nor is Eisenman's work routinely discussed in the context of Conceptual Art. This is partly a result of the gap that divides architecture from other art forms, and partly a result of the modern attachment to originality. Eisenman himself is hardly innocent of this attachment. He has always wanted it both ways. He likes to startle viewers with novel forms and with claims that his projects are helping to undermine the grand Western tradition. At the same time, he is possessed by a deeply conservative craving to belong to that tradition.
Perhaps he's entitled to have it both ways. Even so, the contradiction needs to be clarified. Eisenman is what used to be called a New York Intellectual. But he's working at a time when that species has become nearly extinct. There is, for now, no community of informed opinion to give his work either support or constructive resistance. If there were such a community, the Conceptual roots of Eisenman's architecture would be less obscure, and his forms would appear less startling. He would not have been branded a theorist nor would the audience for his work been largely confined to academia. In fact, the principal interest of importing Conceptualism into architecture lies with the potential to extend that movement's intellectual framework beyond the art world cloister into the larger public realm.
EISENMAN is not the only contemporary architect who draws on or parallels Conceptual themes. A significant strain of contemporary architecture comes out of what Harold Rosenberg called the dematerialization of the art object. John Hejduk, Diller and Scofidio, Bernard Tschumi, Lebbeus Woods, Neil Denari and others have created memorable projects relying on conventional building materials. The emerging generation of computer-based architects are Conceptualists, whether they're aware of it or not.
This work stands in a critical relationship to the conventions of mainstream practice, but it also reveals the extent to which even traditional architecture is conceptually based. Architects produce ideas, plans, blueprints -- concepts -- that, like Lewitt wall paintings, will be realized by others: executive architects, space planners, construction companies and such. The completed building, in turn, takes on an expanded life in the mediated form of published drawings, photographs and other images (like those published here). At both ends, that is to say, architecture is a medium of consciousness. It can transform our inner as well as our outer landscapes.
Conceptual art is thus an ideal form for reckoning with the pressures of globalization. The space of flows does not reside solely in software, streams of electrons, and pixels on a screen. It also exists in the realm of information and ideas. It lives, that is to say, in the head. Architecture like Eisenman's capitalizes on information as the international currency of the global marketplace.
The design vocabulary of the Staten Island project -- the grid, the diagrammatic abstraction -- points to another consequence of globalization: our increasing awareness of the distinctiveness of Western thought. In the emerging global culture, the West has begun to look at itself with an anthropologist's eye. We walk down streets full of buildings, advertisements, fashions and window displays designed to appeal to normal tastes, and say to ourselves: "How weird! Somebody thought of that." Seen in this way, Eisenman's Staten Island design does not seem weird at all. Mediating between places and ideas is a natural, even an essential function for architecture to take on in changing times.
New York intellectual life was created by immigrants, and the global network made possible by tourism and the media has gone far toward compensating for its erosion. As an enduring cultural center, New York deserves a place where this history can be told. Thanks to the Staten Island Institute, we will have one.

A Japanese Treasure Moves to the Midwest

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
OVER 20 years, Alan Strassman, a Boston investment manager, collected 95 Japanese paintings from the Edo period (1615-1848). Twenty were gloriously painted screens that included depictions of a field of tall grasses glowing gold in the moonlight, corpulent gods wrestling, evocative scenes from "The Tales of Genji," wild dancing in the streets near a tea house and a Noh theater performance in an aristocrat's courtyard. His collection became one of the largest and finest of its kind in private hands.
From the start, when he bought his first scroll painting -- which showed a tiger gazing at the moon (prompting him later to call his Edo works the Tiger Collection) -- Mr. Strassman was dazzled by, as he put it, the "unique flat perspective" in Japanese art. "It was striking and beautiful," he said. 
 He was also impressed by the history and stories depicted in these works on paper and silk, and soon assembled a library of 1,400 books on the subject. "Much of Edo painting has roots in mythology, roots in history, roots in some kind of narrative that is deep in the Japanese psyche," he said. "There is something literary that lies behind each image, making these paintings especially meaningful."
As the collection grew, he enjoyed planning exhibitions of the works in his home, frequently changing them to avoid overexposure to light and moisture. He even had a vault built there to store them. Their fragility and his space limitations made it impossible to view all of his collection at one time.
But Mr. Strassman will finally be able to see most of these Edo paintings when they go on view in "300 Years of Japanese Painting: New Treasures for Indianapolis," an exhibition that opens at the Indianapolis Museum of Art on May 20 and remains until Aug. 6. Last month, the museum acquired 70 works from the Tiger Collection, including the 20 screens. The museum paid more than $7 million, and Mr. Strassman donated five screens and his library.
The show will not include 25 scrolls that Mr. Strassman still owns; he plans to give them to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where he is a trustee and was board president from 1993 to 1997. But the exhibition will also include five Edo scrolls that were bought by the Indianapolis museum from Leighton Longhi, the New York dealer from whom Mr. Strassman acquired most of his Edo art. "These works strengthen the collection at key points," said James Robinson, the museum's curator of Asian art.
The acquisitions, with a total value of $10 million, represent the largest purchase of Japanese art by an American museum, and are the Indianapolis Museum of Art's second-largest purchase, exceeded only by the $30 million it paid in 1998 for 101 paintings and prints by Paul Gauguin and his Pont-Aven followers.
The museum's Japanese additions complement these works as well as works by other early modernists of the late 19th century, most of whom were influenced by Edo paintings. The acquisition more than doubled the museum's Japanese art holdings; its Edo collection now ranks with those of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Smithsonian's Freer Gallery and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
"These works, which are in immaculate condition, are of a quality and rarity no longer available in the art market at any price," said Bret Waller, the Indianapolis museum's director. "The weakness of the economy in Asia in recent years became a major factor in making this purchase possible. And we were lucky: the prices for Japanese art had not escalated as swiftly as those paid for other artworks."
The acquisition is part of the museum's $160 million development plan, which will include an expansion of the Asian art galleries to accommodate the Japanese acquisitions. Until now, such holdings were overshadowed by the museum's substantial Chinese art collection, the core of which was donated by Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical magnate, who was the museum's largest benefactor until his death in 1977.
The expansion also reflects the museum's awareness of the growing Japanese presence in Indiana. Today, there are some 200 Japanese companies, including Toyota, Subaru and Isuzu, in the state, employing more than 40,000 workers. Since 1993, Indiana has led the nation in attracting new Japanese investment and now ranks third, after California and Ohio, in the total amount invested: $8 billion plus.
The museum's search for Japanese art began in 1997, when Mr. Robinson alerted dealers in this country and abroad that the museum was interested in acquiring a major holding. But he never expected that he would luck into anything like the Tiger Collection, which includes all the major traditions of Edo painting. The screens are the stars of the exhibition, revealing the virtuosity that the Japanese achieved in this art form during the Edo period, a level of screenmaking unmatched anywhere else.
"When all the scrolls and screens are exhibited together, I hope that the extraordinary density will give people a sense of the opulence of this collection," Mr. Robinson said. "It cuts a broad swath through Edo painting, something that should knock your socks off."

HEADLINE: FILM;
Jarmusch Still Fills the Role of Favorite Outsider

BYLINE: By LAURA WINTERS; Laura Winters's most recent story for Arts & Leisure was about the French director Olivier Assayas.

 BODY:
ONE day a few weeks ago, the filmmaker Jim Jarmusch was hunkered down in a corner of the Pink Pony, a favorite hangout near his Lower East Side home, trying to have a quiet conversation. But a steady flow of colleagues and well-wishers kept wandering by -- drawn, it seemed, by his signature silver hair, as well as by his laid-back manner. After the umpteenth interruption, Mr. Jarmusch smiled wryly. "It's still odd to me if somebody on the street knows who I am," he said. "I'm not interested in the whole celebrity cult thing. Is it better to be semi-known or semi-unknown?"
The 47-year-old Mr. Jarmusch personifies this riddle better than almost any other American director today. An intensely private man, he became a downtown celebrity with his second movie, the art house hit "Stranger Than Paradise" (1984). With its throwaway but graceful style and no-budget economy, "Stranger" helped pioneer the American independent film movement. "When Jim hit with that film, he forged the way for all of us," says Spike Lee, who attended film school with him at New York University. 
 Though Mr. Jarmusch is still an emblem for many younger filmmakers, his path after "Stranger Than Paradise" has not always been easy. His last few films have drawn only modest audiences in the United States -- though abroad they draw crowds and his laconic humor is admired as deeply American. An industry outsider, he has become a world-cinema insider, with a loyal band of A-list collaborators -- "a strange, international biker club," says his friend, the musician Tom Waits. His reputation has drawn Hollywood stars like Winona Ryder, Johnny Depp and now Forest Whitaker, who stars in Mr. Jarmusch's new film, "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai."
"Ghost Dog," which opens on Friday, is Mr. Jarmusch's first non-documentary in four years. Like much of his work, it weaves together strikingly disparate elements: he calls it a "gangster samurai hip-hop eastern western." And yet, despite its oddness, "Ghost Dog" has a wild-card commercial potential -- both because of its star, Mr. Whitaker, and because of the film's highly bankable soundtrack, created by the hip-hop master the RZA, of the Wu-Tang Clan.
The film follows an urban loner named Ghost Dog, played by Mr. Whitaker, who makes his living as a Mafia hitman. A modern-day samurai, he follows the precepts of the "Hagakure," the early-18th-century Japanese warrior codebook. Every samurai swears undying loyalty to a master, and Ghost Dog's master is Louie (John Tormey), a small-time mobster who once saved Ghost Dog's life.
When one of Ghost Dog's missions goes awry, Louie's own bosses, a comical bunch of aging mafiosi, decide that the lone gunman has to be eliminated.
Mr. Jarmusch began writing the film, he says, with the idea of "a character who was a likable killer." He tends to write with particular actors in mind, and in this case he was thinking about Mr. Whitaker: "Forest is very gentle and soulful," he says, "but there's a dark side to his presence which I haven't seen used very often. I wanted to make a character who had that contradiction."
When the filmmaker Sara Driver ("When Pigs Fly"), Mr. Jarmusch's longtime girlfriend, gave him the "Hagakure," the book became "Ghost Dog's" spiritual well. Mr. Jarmusch has aphorisms from the "Hagakure" written out onscreen -- solemn lines like, "The end is important in all things." But the film has his signature zany humor as well, in his portrait of America as a place of crossed cultural wires. The mafiosi can't afford to meet in an Italian restaurant, so they hold court in a fast-food Chinese joint. "Jim likes to put things together that might explode," says Mr. Waits. "He may be a white-haired beatnik from Ohio, but he knows how to rub two sticks together."
Mr. Whitaker, whose implacable presence anchors the film, has long been interested in Eastern philosophy and spent many hours discussing his character with Mr. Jarmusch. "It was one of the most collaborative experiences I've had with a filmmaker," Mr. Whitaker said. "Jim really pays respect to his inspirations."
In fact, Mr. Jarmusch decided to make "Ghost Dog" an outright homage to certain gangster classics. The film is punctuated with direct references to films like Jean-Pierre Melville's "Samourai" and Seijun Suzuki's "Branded to Kill." But Mr. Jarmusch pays homage as well to whole cultures that he admires. "I didn't cast Forest because he was black," Mr. Jarmusch said, "but having a black character created a lot of nuances that I wanted in the story. I wanted hip-hop culture to be in the film."
The director, who used to play in a downtown band called the Del-Byzanteens, was struck by the Wu-Tang Clan's synthesis of African-American and Asian motifs. So he tracked down the RZA, their elusive leader, to do "Ghost Dog's" soundtrack.
"Three weeks later I get a call," he recounts. "And RZA says, 'Meet me in a blacked-out van at 3 a.m. on 50th Street and Broadway.' I go there and he gives me a tape and says, 'Yo, check this stuff.' I ask if he has any directions for me and he says: 'Nah. This is hip-hop style! Try it in the film, juice pieces together.' "
Beneath the film's playfulness, however, lies Ghost Dog's pained awareness that his code of honor is vanishing in the modern world. This melancholy comes directly from Mr. Jarmusch. "I've tried from the beginning to have a code," he says, "but you learn real fast in the film business that that's a good way to get eaten alive."
He grew up far from the film business, in Akron, Ohio, where his father worked for B. F. Goodrich. After attending Northwestern University for one year, Mr. Jarmusch transferred to Columbia. When he spent a semester in Paris, he discovered the Cinematheque and the films of Yasujiro Ozu, Carl Dreyer and Robert Bresson.
Returning home, he entered film school at N.Y.U. and became the assistant to the filmmaker Nicholas Ray, who in turn introduced him to Wim Wenders.
When Mr. Jarmusch finished his student film, "Permanent Vacation," Mr. Wenders gave him some leftover film stock, which Mr. Jarmusch used for part of "Stranger Than Paradise."
With the help of two investors, Mr. Jarmusch completed the film, a deadpan, black and white feature about three drifters on an impromptu road trip. It went to the Cannes International Film Festival in 1984 and stunned Mr. Jarmusch by winning the Camera d'Or for best first feature. "We were at Cannes, sleeping on the floor, and then the water got cut off," he remembers. "When I had to do a television interview, I shaved using leftover tea water."
When "Stranger" was released later that year, Mr. Jarmusch saw himself hailed, at 31, as the creator of a new film style. The film's influence extends even to directors today like Kevin Smith, who directed "Clerks" and "Dogma.""Seeing 'Stranger Than Paradise' is an empowering experience," said Mr. Smith. "Here was a movie that they made for a hundred, two hundred grand, and suddenly the power was in the hands of the people."
Mr. Jarmusch found all the attention rather overwhelming. But at another film festival, he met a young Italian actor named Roberto Benigni. He asked Mr. Benigni to star with Mr. Waits and John Lurie in his next movie, in which they would play three innocents who escape from a Louisiana jail.
At the time, Mr. Benigni spoke no English. During the shooting of "Down by Law," Mr. Jarmusch and Mr. Lurie patiently taught him their own version of the language. "I learned that a cup was a 'clamp,' " Mr. Benigni said, laughing, on the telephone from Rome, "and that 'to urinate' was 'to flame.' The entire set used these words."
Mr. Benigni credits Mr. Jarmusch for having introduced him to America. "I love really Jim's way to live and to direct actors," he says. "He let me improvise during rehearsal time and then left me an open door." He adds, mysteriously, "He is a real poet, a cross between brains and beauty -- between Orson Welles and Brigitte Bardot."
Mr. Jarmusch's fascination with the coexistence of cultures permeated his two next films, "Mystery Train" (1989) and "Night on Earth" (1992). "Mystery Train" is set in a seedy but evocative Memphis, while "Night on Earth" was shot nocturnally in five cities around the world. Rather than accept Hollywood production money, Mr. Jarmusch began at this point to seek foreign financing. "I've been stubborn, but I've kept artistic control over my films," he said. "I see them through every step of the process, even owning the negatives."
This involvement explains the occasionally long stretches between films. With "Dead Man," his most ambitious project, he shot a hallucinatory black-and-white period Western with Johnny Depp as a fugitive befriended by a Native American.
The film was panned by critics when it was released in 1996, but it has recently undergone a startling renaissance, with many end-of-century wrap-ups (including a current series at the Film Society of Lincoln Center) naming it one of the best films of the 1990's. Mr. Jarmusch is typically modest about this. "If it goes through the culture in some minor way, I'd be glad," he said.
Before "Ghost Dog," he shot a concert film/documentary of his friend Neil Young and his band, Crazy Horse, called, simply, "Year of the Horse." And he has appeared in cameos in some of his friends' films, including Billy Bob Thornton's "Sling Blade" and Wayne Wang and Paul Auster's "Blue in the Face."
The acting is a lark for him, whereas his own films are deeply personal. The sympathy for the outsider which has inspired all of his work is especially clear in "Dead Man" and "Ghost Dog." "A bunch of old white men have run things so far," he said. "That's why I've always been interested in people who don't fit in. I have friends who are in prison, off the grid, living on reservations. I learn more from them, somehow, and I respect them."
NOT many people know that before making his name as a filmmaker, Mr. Jarmusch worked as a factory welder, a hydraulic drill-gun operator, a moving man and a process server for Legal Aid. He would be the first to admit that the people he encountered in these professions would not, probably, go to see his films.
But his far-flung experiences have shaped his concerns as a filmmaker, just as they have shaped his desire to reach an audience, whether it be big or small. "It's very important to me that the audience completes the electric current, because otherwise a film is just a dark lamp sitting in a corner," he said. "I'm not trying to teach a lesson to anyone.
"I'm just trying to make a world which they can enter and observe, bringing with them whatever has shaped their own lives."

HEADLINE: SPRING THEATER/VISIONS OF AMERICA;
What It Means to Be Both Cuban and American

 BODY:
A GENERATION separates the Cuban-American playwrights Maria Irene Fornes and Nilo Cruz. Ms. Fornes was 15 when she left Cuba in 1945 -- long before Fidel Castro seized power in the 1959 revolution. Mr. Cruz was 9 when he and his parents left in 1970.
Today, nearing 70 and epitomizing the outsider tradition of the Off Off Broadway theater movement, Ms. Fornes is being celebrated by the Signature Theater Company with a seasonlong festival of her work. The world premiere of her latest play, "Letters From Cuba," continues through March 12 at the Signature. Directed by the author, it is based on more than 200 letters she received over 30 years from an older brother who remained in Cuba. After writing some 30 plays, musicals and operas, "Letters From Cuba" is the first time that Ms. Fornes has dealt directly in her work with her Cuban heritage. 
 Mr. Cruz, who is almost 40, has explored his own sociopolitical roots in such plays as "Dancing on Her Knees" and "A Park in Our House." He discovered theater in 1981 as a member of a local troupe in Miami, and in the late 1980's directed Ms. Fornes's play "Mud" at the South End Alternative Theater there. Ms. Fornes saw it and invited him to become a member of her Intar Hispanic Playwrights Laboratory, now defunct, where he started to write seriously. His current play, "Two Sisters and a Piano," directed by his frequent collaborator, Loretta Greco, runs through March 12 at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. It is based in part on the lives of his sisters and a cousin in Miami and on the house arrest of the dissident Cuban poet Maria Elena Cruz Varela, who in 1991 was forced by Cuban security agents to eat some of her political writings and was sentenced to two years in prison.
Ms. Fornes and Mr. Cruz talked recently in Manhattan with Randy Gener, a reporter for Theatre.com and a freelance theater critic, about the influences of their homeland and adopted country on their playwriting. Here are edited excerpts from the tape-recorded conversation.
 
Q. As Cuban-Americans and as dramatists, how strongly have you taken on social and political matters in your two new plays?
MARIA IRENE FORNES. My play never mentions Castro.
NILO CRUZ. Neither does mine.
FORNES. Your play mentions a person in prison. So it is more directly about politics. My play deals with life in Cuba but it is set in two places -- Cuba and America. On the stage set, there is a regular apartment in New York but only a roof in Cuba. The Cuban world on the roof has stars above it all the time. There is a girl who receives letters in America written by my brother in Communist Cuba. But he could be living in another city where there aren't too many advantages. It could be a small Italian village. It's not that I was avoiding talking about politics. It just didn't seem to be the energy of the play. What interested me was that all of my family had left Cuba, and my brother was still there. Yet he was never a sympathizer with the Castro regime.
Q. Why did he choose to remain in Cuba?
FORNES. To me, it has to do with attachment. It's something that we usually don't think of: place as a love. It seems almost corny -- I don't know why I'm crying. But I'm so moved by the idea of loving a place. Usually you love a person and you cannot live without them. People have an attachment to their animals, their dogs, there's a love there. But the love for place is so hard and so beautiful.
The New York characters in my play are artists: there is a poet, a painter, and the girl who is a dancer -- my alter ego. In Cuba, there is my brother and his son. In the play, the character who is my brother usually has a letter in his hand, and as he speaks to the person in the New York apartment, he reads the actual text of my brother's letters. We have been corresponding for the last 30 years.
My brother is now 80. Rafael is the oldest and I am the youngest of six brothers and sisters. In the play, he is called Luis. I guess in some ways I have wanted to write about Cuba but I did not know exactly how.
Q. Nilo, your play, too, has your family stitched into it -- the two sisters are based on your own -- although the story also involves the experiences of a real-life dissident poet under house arrest who received letters from her husband in France.
CRUZ. Yes, the character Maria Celia, the older sister in the play, writes letters to her husband, and the substance of the play is the letters he writes to her from France. I come from the Irene Fornes school of playwriting. She was my professor and my mentor. I pretty much assemble my plays in the same way Irene does because that's what I learned. I think it's the only way to write.
As Irene was talking, I was realizing that there are so many parallels. Of course, her play is very different from mine, but my characters go up to the roof, even though they are under house arrest. It's a way to feel outside, in the world; it's almost like getting away with murder, to write while on the roof. In fact, the first line of the script is: "My dear husband, I am standing on top of this roof wanting to leap into the sky and send you this letter."
Although my sister Marilyn was not under house arrest, she was never able to leave the country. She always wanted to leave. She got married when she was 16. My older sister, Martha, who was 19, got to leave Cuba for the United States via Spain.
Q. How come Martha left earlier than Marilyn did?
CRUZ. She left in 1980 with her husband because she didn't have any children. My sister Marilyn didn't leave because her child was 8 years old. The government always kept people tied to Cuba. Marilyn came to visit us once with a special permit, but she could not come to this country with her husband and child. Since they were left behind, she had to go back. She's 46 now. She has two children and they have both been able to leave Cuba. It was all a scheme: she had to divorce her husband so he could leave Cuba first and she could come back here and remarry him.
In writing "Two Sisters and a Piano," which is set in 1991, I also drew on the life of a cousin who left a marriage behind in Cuba. I remember her in Miami, always anxious to get mail from her husband. She lived through his letters.
Q. How do generational differences affect your identity as Cuban-Americans?
FORNES. I came to the United States with my mother. My father had died. We had no means of support in Cuba. We came here for economic reasons. It might not be ideal, but you can work here and earn a living. In Cuba, it wasn't so. When we came here, there was no sadness whatsoever. My mother loved it. I thought I was in a Hollywood movie.
CRUZ. Irene is more of an immigrant. I'm more of an exile. I came to the United States with my mother and father. My father was in prison for two years because he was very outspoken about politics. I grew up with my mother, two sisters and my grandmother. My mother had to wash clothes to earn a living. We were not wealthy. I lived about 10 years under Castro, and that's all I knew. I would overhear my parents talking about getting their passports together, but I could not talk about it to friends. I remember having to lie in school.
FORNES. The difference between Cubans who leave because they had to, because Cuba under Castro is unbearable, it's such a different story from mine. It must be the most painful thing in the world to leave a place that you love.
CRUZ. People might think that my plays are about politics, but the politics are very simple. "Two Sisters and a Piano" is about two women who, even though they live in very harsh conditions, make the best of their lives. They create a little paradise in their house. Even though they are under house arrest, they bring out the beautiful china and use a tablecloth. It's the integrity of that, the dignity of it, that moves me.
Q. When you write, do you feel a greater responsibility to Cubans or to Cuban-Americans in the United States?
FORNES. I don't feel any responsibility at all. If I write something about Hispanic people, it's because I am attracted to writing about it. It may sound selfish, but in my workshops I teach people to write about whatever comes to their minds. You have to approach the state of dreaming, where you put yourself into contact with things that are saying something. The only way to do it is by allowing part of your mind to dream.
Many Cuban-Americans are too obsessed with Castro. I don't blame them -- they have lost what they knew, their home, their jobs, everything in their whole lives has been taken away. If I lost that, I don't know what I'd do. But sometimes I don't think they are interested in anything else. Their minds have been frozen, almost.
I remember when I went to Havana in 1962. It was the first celebration after Castro took over. There were all these slogans. People would say slogans to identify themselves, or identify something they liked.
New York has a number of Cuban-American playwrights who are emerging, but because of the revolution of 1959 I think in some ways the question of a writer's politics becomes an obstacle to developing a real Cuban-American style: either you are anti-Castro if you live here or pro-Castro if you are there.
In spite of this, some Cuban-American writers here have been able to develop their own personal voice, imagery and style. I would say that Cuban artists tend to display a light surrealism, as opposed to Mexican surrealism, which feels heavier -- in epic rituals, there are always images of skeletons and candles.
Cuban-Americans put on view an almost subconscious imagery that is a mixture of African culture and Catholic spirituality. In the home of any Cuban family, very middle-class and very white, you will see, for instance, on an altar, a picture of the Santa Barbara a Roman Catholic saint . But everybody knows that the picture does not represent an incarnation of the Catholic Virgin Mary. That picture is a disguise for a Yoruban deity, like a double exposure. They see one image, but they are really dancing to another. The two images have blended together. When you think of a Cuban-American style, it has to do with a different coloring, a different tempo.
CRUZ. My identity as an artist is what defines who I am more than anything else. I don't identify with a lot of Cuban-Americans in Miami, or with Cubans in Cuba. I find that Cubans in Miami tend to be too radical. I also feel that some people in Cuba are still very dogmatic. Lately, I've been writing a lot about Cuba. I feel that my own reality was so tinged by the political situation of my country that I have to reflect on it. I'm interested in documenting history, but ultimately my plays are about being an individual. Belonging to a particular group, left or right, entails a political loss. When you embrace your whole being and all that you can be in this world, that's the strongest position.

As Mortgage Rates Rise, Options Help Buyers Cope

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
NO ONE will argue with the truism that with every upward tick in mortgage interest rates some people are pushed out of the housing market.
Nonetheless, as the Federal Reserve keeps raising the basic rate -- this month's .25 percent increase was the fourth since June -- and home prices continue to rise, the economic equivalent of a one-two punch has so far only "cooled, not killed off" New Jersey's overheated housing market, said Keith T. Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, publishers of mortgage information based in Butler. 
 Over the last 12 months mortgage rates rose by 1.55 percentage points, putting the average rate for a 30-year-fixed mortgage at 8.51 percent last week , compared with 6.96 percent at the same time last year. Still, the New Jersey Association of Realtors in Edison reports that 141,900 existing homes were sold in the state last year, up from 129,900 the year before, and that the average sale price had increased to $205,000 from $197,300.
Timothy Richards, president-elect of the realtors association, said that while there has been a thinning out of buyers "the market is moving forward, just not as frantically as it has in the past year."
Industry professionals say there are several reasons why the upward movement on prices and mortgage rates has not turned the market downward. For one thing, the state's strong economy and job growth have kept consumer confidence high and the demand for homes continues to outstrip the supply. For another, banks are offering different loan products and enhancements that help neutralize the higher rates by providing buyers with monthly payments that are still within their grasp.
Though rates are a lot higher than they were a year ago they are still reasonable when compared with the rate of 16.1 percent reached in 1981, "and even then people were out buying houses," said Brian Carey, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association of America in Washington.
Adjustable rate mortgages are gaining popularity among buyers as a way of avoiding the higher rates, at least for awhile. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, 28 percent of all loans originated in the country in the third quarter of last year were adjustable-rate mortgages, compared with 12 percent for the same time a year earlier.
Such loans come in a variety of forms. One gaining in acceptance is the hybrid adjustable, which carries a fixed rate for one to 10 years, after which the rate adjusts upward or downward up to 2 percentage points a year, based on a pre-established formula. The rate cannot exceed 6 additional percentage points over the life of the loan.
Banks have enhanced such loans with a "lock-in, float-down" option, which essentially allows borrowers to lock in their mortgage rate before it goes even higher and, if rates go down, reduce their rate when they close on their home. As rates drop, buyers are also able to switch to a fixed-rate mortgage prior to closing.
"People are more comfortable with risk and with refinancing, so their mindset is, 'I can get out of the mortgage if rates go down,' " Mr. Gumbinger said.
The lock-in, float-down adjustable-rate mortgage is the kind of loan William and Liza Wallach, of Manhattan, took out through a broker for the five-bedroom center-hall Dutch colonial in Montclair that they bought for over $500,000 earlier this month after a lengthy search on both sides of the Hudson River. The Wallachs, both lawyers in their 30's, are moving with their two young sons from the loft in Manhattan's West Village that they recently sold to gain more space and a front and back yard for their children. The house, for which the couple paid about $100,000 more than the asking price after winning a bidding war, is just a few blocks from where Mrs. Wallach grew up.
"With two children we had to move," said Mrs. Wallach, who is at present not practicing law. "And as obscene as prices seem in New Jersey they are reasonable compared with those in Manhattan."
BUT just as the Wallachs found the house they wanted, rates went up, said their mortgage broker, Melissa Cohn, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, which has offices in Hackensack. Though the couple initially was wedded to a 30-year fixed-rate loan with a 60-day lock-in period, Ms. Cohn said they switched to a seven-year adjustable loan with a 90-day lock-in, float-down option.
"This way they were able to lock in a 7.125 percent rate through the time of their closing and the difference in their monthly payments is great," she said. With a fixed-rate loan at 8.375 percent their monthly payment on a $500,000 loan would have been $3,800. With the adjustable it is $3,368, a savings of $432 a month, or $5,100 a year, Ms. Cohn said.
"Consumers are buying for today not tomorrow," she said, noting that the average time people stay in a home is five to seven years.
"Who knows how long we'll be in this house," said Mrs. Wallach. "It seems smaller now -- it's not the Versailles I originally thought it was."
Other mortgage options that help keep the lid on monthly payments, but are used less frequently, are so-called negative amortization loans and the 40-year fixed-rate loan.
Negative amortization offers the borrower an artificially low, or "teaser," rate for 60 days -- though some lenders will allow him or her to pay the low rate for as much as a year, said Ms. Cohn of Manhattan Mortgage. But the deferred payments on the higher interest rate must ultimately be made up, she added. The 40-year loans reduce the payments by stretching them over a longer period, but the total amount buyers ultimately pay is higher.
For instance, Mr. Gumbinger said, for a $100,000 loan the borrower with a rate of 8.51 percent would have interest charges of $252,250 on the 40-year loan, against $177,064 on a 30-year loan. And the difference in the monthly payments is scant, he said, noting that with a 40-year loan it would be $734 a month, while for a 30-year loan it would be $769.
Still, Chet DeStefano, senior vice president at First Union Mortgage Corporation, based in Morristown, a subsidiary of First Union Bank, said his company started offering 40-year mortgages in January in response to the diverse needs of borrowers and the rising rate environment. Such loans, he said, "are not for everyone." But, he added, they work for "first-time buyers, whose potential earnings are ahead of them, and want more purchasing power and a comfortable monthly cash flow and for high-net-worth individuals who want an increased cash flow and need a tax writeoff."
At the same time, banks are also willing to commit to the current rate for up to one year, but here, too, buyers usually will pay for that privilege. Mr. DeStefano said the longer lock-in rates are typically for people who are waiting for their homes to be built. He said for a nine-month lock-in, the maximum for First Union, his company charges 1.5 percent of the mortgage amount. On a $150,000 loan the charge would be $2,250; for six months it would be $1,500, or 1 percent.
And what if mortgage rates continue to go up, as they are expected to do? Mr. Carey of the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington said his group was predicting that the Federal Reserve would raise rates again next month followed by at least one more increase by the first half of the year.
Mr. Gumbinger said mortgage rates would have to increase one-half to one full percentage point to have an impact on the market. Jacelyn Botti, regional vice president at Weichert Realtors in Morris Plains, one of the state's larger residential brokerages, said rates would need to go to the double digits for an impact to occur.
"The key," Mr. Carey said, "in determining what happens to the housing market going forward is the continued strength of the economy and the wealth creation of the stock market."
For now, Ms. Botti said, the single condition having the most impact on the marketplace is the lack of inventory of existing homes to sell, which is about 10 to 15 percent lower in most areas this year compared with the same time last year. That, in turn, pushed the volume of sales down and home prices up, she said, adding that the situation is compounded by the fact that new home production also is not keeping pace with demand.
For instance, she said, as of the fourth quarter of 1999 the median sales price of existing homes sold in Somerset, Middlesex and Hunterdon Counties was $221,200, up 23.3 percent from $179,400 the same time in 1998. "Home buyers," she said, "are pushing to buy before home prices and mortgage rates go up even higher and because they have waited so long to find a house."
As the spring buying season approaches, Mr. Richards of the realtors association said, "we'll see a resurgence in activity."

Rehabilitating Historically Significant Enclaves

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
WORK will begin next month on restoring 16 deteriorating houses in Frog Hollow, a devastated area of Hartford long plagued by drugs, crime, vandalism and large-scale abandonment. The project is the first to be implemented under a new state law, effective Wednesday, called the Connecticut Historic Homes Rehabilitation Tax Credit Program.
The purpose of the law is to rehabilitate modest but historically significant neighborhoods where single- and multifamily homes have fallen into such serious disrepair that the area cannot attract investment. Most of the houses have been bought at foreclosure. Announcements of the program will be distributed next month by the Connecticut Historical Commission to chief elected officials and preservation organizations in targeted towns. 
 "The law does not provide for an income test for ownership of the restored homes," said Linda Spencer, director of the commission and one of the legislation's crafters, "although the definition of a target area does say 'where residents have incomes below the median.' We expect to start getting requests for applications over the summer."
In its effort to increase the availability of affordable housing and at the same time preserve national- and state-landmarked structures, the legislature identified 29 municipalities where homeowners, nonprofit corporations and developers can apply for tax credits to help rehabilitate inner-city historic districts.
The designated communities are Ansonia, Bridgeport, Bristol, Danbury, Derby, East Hartford, East Haven, Enfield, Griswold, Groton, Hartford, Killingly, Manchester, Meriden, Middletown, New Britain, New Haven, New London, Norwalk, Norwich, Plainfield, Shelton, Stamford, Torrington, Vernon, Waterbury, West Hartford, West Haven and Windham.
Within two years a total of 50 houses on Mortson Street and Putnam Heights in Frog Hollow are expected to be restored as one- to four-family units. Completed single-family houses with about 2,000 square feet will be sold for around $80,000, far below the $120,000 cost of restoration. Two-family homes will cost around $95,000; three- and four-family homes will be priced higher based on restoration costs. Property taxes will remain at pre-rehab levels -- a few hundred dollars a year, for five years.
"Frog Hollow," said Kenneth D. Johnson, senior program officer of the Hartford office of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, "is a 19th century Victorian neighborhood and the best example of Perfect Sixes" -- three-story, six-unit structures with bowed facades, a type of construction endemic to Hartford.
(The national nonprofit corporation is a financial intermediary that puts together public and private investments to rebuild neighborhoods.)
Special-permit zoning will allow the buildings and lots to be, in legal terms, split down the middle, producing two symmetrical, three-story units that comply with the new law's one- to four-unit rule.
The way the program works, a property owner may apply to the Connecticut Historical Commission for a tax credit equal to 30 percent of the rehabilitation cost. Renovation of each unit in a multifamily dwelling may not exceed $30,000, but total rehabilitation costs of any project must be higher than $25,000.
Cost estimates and plans must be approved by the commission, which then reserves the tax credit from a $3 million annual pool supplied by the state. The credits must be purchased by a corporate entity chosen by the property owner, and cannot be issued until the project is completed.
If individual homeowners, rather than owner-developers or nonprofits, apply for the program, they would designate a bank as the corporate purchaser of the tax credit and take a loan from that bank of, say, $30,000 for the work to be done. The bank would collect $9,000 in tax credits from the commission and reduce the loan by that amount -- to $21,000 at the end of construction.
In Stamford, the sale price of rehabilitated homes in the South End, where some 250 structures could be eligible for the program, would be higher, reflecting the city's vibrant economy. The South End peninsula, stretching from the Metro-North railroad south to Long Island Sound and from the East Branch of the harbor to the West Branch, is listed in its entirety on the National Register of Historic Places.
T HE South End has many commercial, industrial, and residential buildings, but less than 10 percent home ownership," said Timothy Beeble, Stamford's Community Development Director. "Many two- and three-family homes are owned by elderly people who could end up selling to an investor." He said he befelt the tax credit program could assure the city of an opportunity to rehabilitate those properties as affordable housing. Preliminary talks with Pitney-Bowes, which is situated in the South End, and Chase Bank as potential corporate purchasers of tax credits have not yet produced commitments.
Many towns, including Stamford, have housing initiatives of their own that can be combined with the tax credit program. "Under a federal Housing and Urban Development program," said Mr. Beeble, "we can lend $15,000 per unit for rehabilitation. If someone wanted to spend $45,000, they could borrow $15,000 from us on a zero-interest deferred loan to be repaid when the house is sold, get $13,500 as the 30 percent tax credit then borrow $16,500 from a bank."
A tax credit of $1.5 million for the first 16-house phase of construction in Frog Hollow has been assigned to the Travelers. The insurance company has committed a total of $7.4 million to the $10 million overall cost of the project, including 20 new single- and two-family houses to be built outside the tax credit program.
Citibank's Hartford office will provide a $1.5 million construction loan, to be paid off by the Travelers, which can then apply the tax credit to its state corporate tax. Tax credits cannot be applied to personal income taxes. The credits offer only a dollar-for-dollar reduction.
Once restored, multifamily buildings must have one unit occupied by the owner. Private or nonprofit developers must sell their restored buildings to such an owner-occupier. Investors in the program believe that the restored neighborhoods will rapidly appreciate in value.
Martin Legault, president and chief executive of the Corporation for Independent Living, said owners would have to sign a deed restriction. "If they sell the house in the first five years they must repay the subsidy in full -- possibly $20,000 to $40,000," he said. "Repayment in the sixth year would be 50 percent of the subsidy. Nothing would be due after that."
Because the market value of the completed buildings is always less than the cost of rehabilitation, other contributors are filling the financial gap with amounts still in negotiation. Among them are the nonprofit Connecticut Housing Investment Fund, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, Fleet Bank Community Preservation Loan Fund, and Hartford's Department of Economic and Community Development. Developers include the Corporation for Independent Living, Broad Park Development Corporation, Greater Hartford Realty Management Company, and the Milano Corporation.
W E don't make money on this," said Andrew Bassette, vice president of corporate real estate for the Travelers. "We are using our funds to make possible the buyout of the construction loan, but there is a six-month to a year window in which we lose the ability to use that money and we can't deduct the loss from taxes."
Citibank and the Travelers, members of Citigroup, the giant financial services group based in Manhattan, look for ways to improve the quality of life in cities where they are established.
"The quality of life in Hartford," said Mr. Bassette, "is a major impediment to attracting young people right out of college. They are more interested in Boston and New York. But once they get here they find the quality is pretty darned good -- with some of the richest cultural institutions in the country" -- including the Wadsworth Atheneum, America's oldest continuously operating art museum; the Hartford Stage Company, the Hartford Symphony Orchestra, the Hartford Ballet, the ornate State Capitol, Bushnell Park and Trinity College.
Edward Musante, director of Norwalk's Redevelopment Agency, said that his city would look into the program, possibly dovetailing it with an ongoing Housing Rehabilitation Low Interest Loan Program. A state and nationally designated Historic District in South Norwalk extends from Washington Street south to Hanford Place, and from Water Street west to South Main Street. "Some 50 to 75 houses could be eligible," he said.
Many houses along Danbury's historic district on Main Street date back to the 18th century.
"They are predominantly three- and four-family units," said Dennis Elpern, the city's planning director. "They are occupied and in need of major renovation. The problem has been that it's not financially rewarding to the owners to make those kinds of repairs. This sounds like a very welcome program."

THE deed, dated July 20, 1668, conveys a 15,000-acre swath of northern New Jersey, now including the Borough of Rutherford, from Tantaqua, a chief of the Lenni Lenape Indian Nation, to an Englishman, William Sandford, "for the following consideration:"
"One hundred and seventy fathoms of black wampum, 200 fathoms of white wampum, 19 watch coats, 17 guns, 60 double hands of powder, 10 pair of breeches, 60 knives, 67 bars of lead, 1 anker of brandy, 3 half vats of beer" and various other sundries. 
 The commission on the deal, said Peter Van Winkle, a Rutherford real estate broker -- tongue slightly inserted in cheek -- "was probably 6 percent."
"It may have been, because 6 percent has long been the customary commission," said Mr. Van Winkle, who offers farsighted historical perspective on such matters. It was in 1692 that his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Waling Jacob Van Winkle, founded the Rutherford real estate firm that still bears the family name.
So just how far back does the traditional 6 percent brokers' commission on residential deals go? "Certainly as far as I know," said Mr. Van Winkle, "and as far as what my father told me, and his father before that."
So far back that the 6 percent figure seems etched in stone -- at least in the minds of many, and maybe most, real estate customers.
But it's not.
And in recent years, some brokers have been chipping away at that set-in-stone perception -- advertising their willingness to negotiate commissions or even to offer flat-rate fees -- despite the fierce and often carefully reasoned resistance of their peers. One broker in Queens said his firm takes a "Home Depot, Priceline approach, where you can name your own price," much to the chagrin of his competitors. It is a phenomenon impelled, particularly over the last five years, by a housing market in which listings are precious, prices are dear and homeowners can be demanding -- a classic seller's market.
"The most dreaded words in our industry are, 'Will you take less?' " said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Manhattan brokerage firm that bears her name. "The commission we charge as a firm is 6 percent, but we're constantly questioned." Ten days ago, the Corcoran Group held an in-house seminar for its sales agents to discuss strategies for "Holding On to That 6 Percent Commission."
Clark Halstead, founder of the Halstead Property Company, is adamant about holding the 6-percent line. "If you need brain surgery," he asked, "would you negotiate a lower price with your surgeon? You would probably decide you need the best expertise and be willing to pay." Lower commissions, he insisted, mean diminished interest by potential co-brokers from other firms, leading to decreased exposure to the market and, consequently, less than top dollar.
To be sure, brokers' commissions have been entirely negotiable since 1950 when, in a case called United States v. National Association of Real Estate Boards (predecessor to the current National Association of Realtors), the Supreme Court ruled that fixed commission schedules constituted restraint of trade under the Sherman Antitrust Act.
"Brokers can never discuss the commission among themselves," said Barbara Frechter, president of Glenjay Realty in Forest Hills and past president of the Long Island Board of Realtors (which includes Queens). "I can only discuss it with my sales agents, not with another brokerage" -- which might end up splitting the commission, assuming one firm takes the listing from the seller and the other finds the buyer.
"When people teach sales classes," said Ms. Frechter, "they say, 'X commission,' without the number, because it's such a stringent law. And in the 80's, when you joined the real estate board, they showed you a movie and the jail door slams shut to teach you that you are never to discuss the commission with another broker."
Since that 1950 Supreme Court ruling, and subsequent legal opinions that bolstered the high court's original finding, there have been varying attempts at discounting commissions -- both by brokers and sellers; most legal, some questionable; some profitable, others not.
"In the old days," Ms. Frechter said, "a seller might tell you: 'This is what I want for the house; anything you get above that is yours.' It's called a net commission. But, by law, you can't take a listing that way. You have to tell the person what the commission is up front."
These days, Eileen Scott is a sales agent for Mr. Van Winkle. But back in the late 80's, Ms. Scott said, "my husband and I opened a Help-U-Sell franchise."
"It was a fixed-rate commission: $3,450 for a house priced up to $150,000," she said. "After that it switched to $4,450. That was it."
For that set fee, Ms. Scott would help her clients sell their homes. "They would do their own advertising, and also the showings," she said. "We would put a sign up: 'For Sale By Owners, Assisted by Help-U-Sell.' "
It didn't work.
"We couldn't survive because of the expenses of running an office and charging such low commissions," Ms. Scott said. And the timing for the Help-U-Sell franchise company was unfortunate -- a depressed housing market. "The promises were that we would capture at least 10 percent of the market, whereas, after the first year, it was more like 4 percent," Ms. Scott said. "By the third year, after we lost all of our money, we closed the doors."
TWO years ago, Help-U-Sell, which had about 100 franchises, was purchased by the American Pacific Financial Corporation, and now has 158 franchises nationwide -- seven in the New York area. "It was ahead of its time in the 80's," said Rick O'Neil, Help-U-Sell's president.
These days, Ms. Scott and Mr. Van Winkle hold a decided preference for the standard fee. "Most of our residential commissions are 6 percent, but on occasion we do deviate," Mr. Van Winkle said.
"Peter and I agree that if you need to take 5 percent, you take 5 percent," Ms. Scott said. "But in the long run, when you consider the expenses, we'd rather get our 6 percent."
Since 1995, on the other hand, newspaper advertisements placed by the Fleet Street Properties Company in Rego Park, Queens, have asked, "Why Pay More Than 4?"
And the logic of the question seemed unassailable to Nicholas Cerrito Jr. Mr. Cerrito, 40, an air freight dispatcher, has lived with his wife, Marie, and two children in Babylon, on Suffolk County's South Shore, for 10 years.
"And I bought a rental property in North Babylon in 1992," Mr. Cerrito said. Last year, the Cerritos put that rental home on the market.
"A friend told me about Fleet Street, that they only charge 4 percent," Mr. Cerrito said. "I had it on the market for $137,000; 30 days later, I closed for $135,000." Mr. Cerrito was pleased with the 4 percent, rather than 6 percent, commission. The difference, in cash to him, was $2,700.
Thomas Henry is president of Fleet Street Properties. "We've been in business here for 54 years," Mr. Henry said. "For the past five years, we're doing this special deal: 4 percent. We put it on the multiple listing service under LIBOR" -- the Long Island Board of Realtors, which lists 1,550 brokerage firms -- "and we split 50-50 with the selling broker."
For sellers who would like to negotiate with buyers themselves, Mr. Henry said, "We have a program where we will list a property with the M.L.S." -- for a flat fee of $199.95 -- "and they can name the commission they wish to pay."
Mr. Henry said he recommends that the seller choose a 3 percent commission, "because this is what the selling broker would get on a 6 percent split, and we still have the right to get the 3 percent, if we sell it ourselves."
Of his company's "Home Depot, Priceline approach," he said, "We're doing a good business."
"At first, five years ago," he said, "they threatened us with lawsuits, the other brokers. We got calls saying, 'You're killing the business. We're not going to sell your listing.'
"We're not killing anything," Mr. Henry insisted. "Now they've capitulated and they can't get enough of our listings. They seem to accept that splitting 4 percent is better than splitting nothing."
Even splitting 3 percent -- on a property selling for $1 million or more -- can be profitable, said John P. Noonan, past president of the Brooklyn Board of Realtors and president of the Park Slope brokerage firm that bears his name.
"We've had this huge increase in real estate values and there's certainly a lot of room to negotiate and still get a handsome commission," Mr. Noonan said, citing several factors bearing on his decision to accept a commission lower than 6 percent. His primary consideration would be if the homeowner gave Mr. Noonan's brokerage firm the exclusive right to sell the home, without the participation of a broker representing the buyer.
"My personal feeling is that if a seller gives an exclusive to a broker, it's certainly worthy of a reduced commission payment," he said. "You're not competing with other brokers and it's a more comfortable way of working." The listing broker, in that instance, would keep the entire commission.
BESIDES being granted an exclusive, Mr. Noonan said he would consider a reduced commission if he had several "good prospects" lined up to buy the property promptly, and if the house was appropriately priced in the current market. "And, certainly, if I'm involved in a bidding war between clients from different brokers, I would cut a commission to make the deal work," he said.
Asked if he would negotiate commissions on a home priced for less than $1 million, Mr. Henry said: "We don't see $100,000 houses any more; if we see anything below $300,000, it's a rarity. So any of these could be negotiable, absolutely."
Numerous wrinkles exist in the seller-broker relationship.
Essentially, there are two opportunities during the marketing process for a seller to seek a reduced commission: at the time the listing agreement is being written and, again, when a deal with a buyer is about to be reached.
At listing time, the broker's resistance to a reduction may be stiffer, probably prompting the argument that a lower commission will dampen the interest of all the other brokers who belong to the multiple listing service.
If, however, at the time the deal is about to be struck, the broker says to the seller something like, "Your asking price was $250,000, we have an offer for $225,000," the seller could say, "Cut your commission a bit and we have a deal."
"It happens occasionally," said Michael Finder, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan. "A seller might try to persuade a broker to reduce the commission to conclude the deal."
A seller has no obligation to accept anything less than the listed price. Yet, as Mr. Finder pointed out, "once the broker does produce a purchaser willing and able to pay that asking price, the seller runs the risk of litigation with the broker if the seller refuses to proceed with the deal."
Some listing agreements tie the commission fee to a specific asking price, but most commissions are tied to a certain percentage of the final purchase price. "Almost always," said John Hall, former chairman of the real property section of the New York State Bar Association, "the commission is computed as a percentage of the selling price, rather than a percentage of the listing price." And in some cases, a flat commission amount is agreed upon, regardless of the selling price, Mr. Hall said.
"I have a theory on all this bargaining," said Ms. Corcoran of the Corcoran Group: "that sellers believe that apartments today sell themselves -- and they're right."
BUT in the current torrid market, Ms. Corcoran pointed out, "where brokers truly earn their money is in 10 times the number of showings and navigating the bidding wars through the feeding frenzy."
R. Kenyatta Punter, president of the Greater Harlem Real Estate Board, and of the brokerage firm that bears his name, said that commissions may also rise. "It can be indicative of a property that is unusually difficult to unload," he said.
"For example, rooming houses are difficult to sell because financing is not readily available for that type of building," Mr. Punter said, "although they are getting scooped up for family use in my community."
In a case like that, a broker might ask for 7 percent, Mr. Punter said, "versus a building on a very desirable block, say a brownstone on Striver's Row or Hamilton Terrace. A broker there may be willing to take 5 percent because it tends to move quickly, because of demand in that marquee location."
Mr. Halstead, however, believes that bargaining is bad business -- for both the broker and the seller.
"There are two tools a seller needs to be certain he's getting the best price," Mr. Halstead said. "One is a battle-hardened, energetic broker with a full quiver of marketing arrows. The other is a full competitive commission, because what the seller wants is all the brokers in town motivated to show his property."
His company, Mr. Halstead said, has 250 agents. Once the listing is shared with members of the Real Estate Board of New York, he said: "That brings several thousand agents and their customers in. And the point is that what the seller wants is as many interested parties as soon as possible in order to insure the best price."
Mr. Halstead did the math to illustrate how reduced commissions squeeze brokers.
If, for example, a Manhattan apartment sells for $1 million, the standard commission would be $60,000 with, most likely, a 50-50 split between the listing brokerage firm and the firm that brought in the buyer.
"Generally, for the listing firm," Mr. Halstead said, "of the $30,000 received by them, 50 percent goes to the sales agent, leaving $15,000 to address marketing expenses and overhead. For a $1 million property, marketing expenses could easily be, say, $5,000 to $7,000."
Those expenses would include, in Mr. Halstead's evaluation, "the most expensive agate advertising in the world -- that's classified advertising -- offered by The New York Times at $18 a line," before quantity discounts.
IN addition, he said, "We have to take photographs, put the property on our Web sites; do a brochure or a fancy oversized postcard. We have to hold open houses, if the board allows. And we do mailings to people in the building and in the neighborhood."
For a multimillion-dollar property, display advertising might be required in glossy publications like Quest or Avenue, or in The Times's Sunday magazine, he said, "and we're talking there, now, rates of $8,000 for a quarter page."
"These are the economic realities of operating a real estate brokerage," Mr. Halstead said.
Just such realities prompted an audacious experiment two years ago by Long & Foster, the largest brokerage firm in Washington -- a standardized commission of 7 percent.
"Let me give you the Washington plea," said Wes Foster Jr., the company's president. "In the last 15 years, the amount of money the company has left after we've paid our sales agent -- what we call the company dollar; it's what we use to pay our overhead and hopefully have something left over -- has dropped from around 45 cents of the whole dollar to 29 cents."
"This is a national problem," Mr. Foster said.
The experiment was short-lived.
"A total, ugly failure," Mr. Foster said. "We wish we'd never done it. It cost us market share, and we backed away quickly, in a couple or three months. But it stuck with some of the public and made them angry with us."
Long & Foster has since expanded into titles, mortgages and insurance, "so that we can give the customer a one-stop shop," Mr. Foster said, "and us a chance to make a little more profit."
These days, he said, the struggle is on to maintain the 6 percent commission, "which we really need to stay in business."
"Right now we're doing O.K. because it's a good market," Mr. Foster said. "But I can tell you this: when another slow market comes, you're going to see real estate companies going out of business left and right, because the margin is too slim. It's tough."

HEADLINE: 'Hidden' Workers Nurse Hope of Amnesty

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
AS members of an underground in plain sight, Hispanic workers in the United States illegally lead furtive lives on Long Island, dodging authorities even as they are welcomed with open arms by some employers.
Fearing an official knock at the door of their often illegal and crowded rental houses or a raid by immigration officers at work, the laborers trade social invisibility and official nonexistence for jobs as landscapers, bus boys, field workers and maids. Their wages are low, but still far more than they could earn at home. 
 For the thousands of undocumented Latinos in Nassau and Suffolk caught between these economic imperatives and Americans' ambivalence, news that the United States labor movement now favors amnesty for illegal immigrants has raised hope for better days.
"They feel so happy," said Carlos Canales, an organizer at the Workplace Project in Hempstead, which aids Latinos. "They think that finally the sun is rising for them."
On Horse Block Road in Farmingville, where several hundred Latinos arrive with the rising sun to stand near two 7-Eleven stores and in sidewalk groups in hopes of job offers from passing tradesmen, word of "amnistia" spread rapidly. But to many it had a far-off ring, and will not put money in their empty pockets.
"I have nothing," said a man in his 30's in a knit cap and a U.C.L.A. sweatshirt, patting his pants pockets, as he waited for work on Tuesday. "I will do anything. I am here for the money."
From Mexico City -- a place, he said, with no jobs and too much crime -- he had come to Long Island because he heard there was money to be made, as much as $8 or $9 an hour for the lucky ones. Amnesty and a green card, he said in halting English, would make job-hunting much easier.
Backing for an amnesty, which reverses years of opposition to immigrant workers because it was felt that their presence depressed wages, emerged at a meeting of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. this month in New Orleans.
A resolution by the executive council said blanket amnesty would recognize a growing segment of the labor force vulnerable to exploitation. It also called for an end to most sanctions against employers who hire illegal immigrants.
With some business organizations backing similar action to help industries with labor shortages, officials and organizers at immigrant groups on Long Island said an amnesty that went beyond a limited decree in 1986 was now possible.
"What's interesting is that even before the official announcement from New Orleans, there had been a buzz in the immigrant community about this," said Patrick Young, the program director of the Central American Refugee Center in Hempstead, which is known as Carecen. "Most of the immigrants on Long Island are here legally, but they may have relatives and friends here who are undocumented. And they realize that the current system lowers the working conditions for both the documented and the undocumented."
Mr. Young estimated that there were 30,000 to 40,000 undocumented Latinos living on the Island, but he said the undocumented population did not appear to be growing.
A Census Bureau estimate on July 1, 1998, put the Hispanic population at 98,000 in Nassau and 116,000 in Suffolk. The figures are largely those for American citizens and legal immigrants, but may also include an unknown number of illegal aliens. There are also groups of illegal immigrants from Ireland and Poland, but their numbers are far smaller.
According to the Census Bureau, Puerto Ricans, who are American citizens, account for half the Latinos. The largest immigrant groups come from El Salvador, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Mexico.
Cecilia Moran, the director of the Centro Salvadorno in Hempstead, said an amnesty would recognize the importance of the undocumented work force and allow immigrants who had been virtually in hiding for years to live openly.
"It is wonderful because they will pass from anonymous persons to people who can count in this society," she said. "These are people who are not only living here and getting salaries here, they are giving something."
Matthew T. Crosson, the president of the Long Island Association, the major business group, was more restrained in his reaction to the news from New Orleans.
"It is a proposal that should be studied with an open mind, but not necessarily one that should be adopted," he said. "The cost implications to the federal, state and local governments need to be assessed," including items like Medicaid.
Mr. Crosson said that while labor shortages were "a severe problem" on the Island, it was not clear "to what extent undocumented aliens help resolve that problem."
"They are clearly a part of the labor force," he said. "How significant is difficult to assess."
A major cconcern is that the prospect of amnesty will cause a surge in illegal immigrants eager to gain footholds in the United States before the amnesty takes effect.
But support groups said many of the beneficiaries would be undocumented workers who had lived here for a long time. "It's a fiction to say they are not here," Mr. Young said. "Why not recognize that they are here and create a way for people with clean records to be here legally?"
The immigrants' stories are often heart-rending. A woman who gave her name as Rosa said she had come from Ecuador in 1988 on a tourist visa, and remained when it expired. Divorced and now 47 years old, she earns $140 a week off the books as a housekeeper and lives with a friend in a Hempstead apartment.
A son, 20, also lives on the Island and works when he can find employment, but another son and the rest of her family remain in Ecuador. Her father and two brothers have died while she has been away, and this month her mother had a stroke. She paid for the funerals, and is paying now for medicine and treatment for her mother.
Going home is not an option.
"No, it is impossible," she said through an interpreter. "How could I? I am the only one who can make money, and I am sending money for medicine and treatment."
Amnesty, she said, would be "fabulous."
"It would give me an opportunity to get a better job and pay taxes," she said. "It gives me hope that one day it will be better and I will see my mother while she is still alive." She would also like to become a citizen.
Some employers facing labor shortages favor amnesty. A commercial landscaper who spoke on condition his name not be used said amnesty would end unfair competition from small businesses that hire undocumented workers for low pay.
"It's hard to tell who is legal and who isn't, and some of the people who are hiring don't ask any questions," he said. "That's why these small guys are squeezing us out of business." With amnesty, undocumented workers "would be getting benefits and they would also be paying taxes," he said.
Angelo Auricchio, the president of the 400-member Long Island chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association, said amnesty could be a boost for restaurant owners, who faced mounting difficulty finding workers.
"We have to rejuvenate, and since there has been such an influx" of undocumented workers, he said, "I would think the way to do that would be to legalize them."
Mr. Auricchio said he could not say whether many restaurants employed illegal aliens. But he said the 1986 amnesty brought greater numbers of legal immigrants into the business and reduced labor shortages then.
Without legal status, undocumented workers have little choice but to accept rock-bottom wages without complaint, said the Rev. William Brisotti, administrator of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Roman Catholic Church in Wyandanch.
"A lot of communities are very slow to admit they have this population in their area," he said. "But they are there, they are excellent workers, many businesses depend on them, and generally speaking they are being abused."
Father Brisotti said it was not unusual for laborers to be cheated. "They do the work and the guy only pays them half of what he said he would, and they are afraid to do anything about it because he might call immigration and report them," he said. "These are the kind of things that would end if there were amnesty."
Mr. Young said current rules hurt both legal and illegal immigrants.
"Some employers only want to hire the undocumented," he said. "That disadvantages workers who have documents. And the employer can hold over the heads of the undocumented workers the threat of being handed over" to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
"With the documented workers," he added, "the threat is that if they don't want to work for low wages, the undocumented will."
Among the men outside the 7-Eleven on North Ocean Avenue and Horse Block Road on Tuesday morning, the quest for work of any kind seemed desperate. Dozens advanced rapidly on a person they took for a potential employer, quickly surrounding him. "You need someone? You have work?" they asked.
The store manager came out to usher the men out of the parking lot and behind a fence at the edge of his property. Speaking in English, he also warned them not to come off the curb and stand in the busy street.
"There are 50 of you now, and this summer there will be 200," he said. "Somebody will get hurt."
He was trying to be helpful, the store manager said (though he would not give his name), but if the men would not stay out of the way, he added, he would have to call the police.
The men stared at him blankly. One, an intense man in his 20's in an Army fatigue jacket, related to the others in Spanish the warning about "la policia."
The manager told the men, "I have to feed my family, just like you have to feed your family." A young man behind the fence stared down at the manager's new brown leather shoes.
An old pickup truck paused at the parking lot entrance.
"Don't stop there! Don't stop there!" the manager yelled. The driver pretended not to understand. Two men came from behind the fence and climbed in beside him. After brief discussion they drove off.
Over the next hour, no other trucks stopped.

HEADLINE: Looking for 'Connecticut' in the Credits

BYLINE: By FRANCES CHAMBERLAIN 

 BODY:
HOW many times do you go to the movies and see places that look like the wood lot down the road or the center of a neighboring town? The location may not show up in the credits, but there's a good chance you were right, because Connecticut is still a popular spot to shoot movies.
Katherine Ray, who was director of the Connecticut Film Office until this month, had spent her days with location scouts, helping them find the perfect setting within the state for a film shoot. "A Little Bit of Lipstick" will be under way soon in New Milford and the Mystic area. A previous film, "Coventry," was shot in Coventry. A movie called "Snow Days" was shot in Westport and Greenwich; "The Thomas Crown Affair" featured water stunts in Norwalk Harbor; and a Hallmark Hall of Fame production, "Grace and Glory," was shot in Watertown and Waterbury. 
 The film office is being run by the Connecticut Economic Resource Center and is now headed by Guy Ortoleva, who said a 1995 study found that film is a $300 million industry in the state. Under the umbrella of the state organization, smaller film commissions have been formed in individual towns, all with the same goal -- bringing film production into the community to boost not only the arts but also the local economy.
The Southeastern Connecticut Film Office in New London, formed five years ago, is in an area with a rich history of film-making. After "Ah, Wilderness," done in 1935, there have been many others, including "The World According to Garp," "Mystic Pizza," "The Hunt for Red October, "Amistad," and "All Shook Up."
Connecticut is generally willing to cooperate with film makers, Ms. Ray said. "We recently staged a series of three bank robberies with chase scenes and got a road to do the chase scenes," she said.
The scenes were filmed in New Milford.
"It was a Japanese film crew, looking for vehicles," said Frank Weller, chairman of the New Milford Film Commission. "Someone told me they were going to film in New Jersey, and I told them I thought we had a better selection of locations. It was a weekly TV show about a female character who robbed 36 banks in Canada by dressing as a man and then stuffing her disguise in a shopping bag immediately afterwards. The segment filmed in New Milford involved a stunt driver, dressed in drag, crashing a car on Ridge Road after robbing three local banks."
The New Milford Film Commission was formed about 18 months ago, and its five members are appointed by the mayor. Saun Ellis, commissioner of the New Milford Film Commission, said its purpose is to encourage production of films and sponsor events. "People in the industry are anxious to locate outside of New York City and we'd love to see the industry move up here."
Other municipalities also have film offices. The Hartford Tourism Office has a person who works with the film industry. Danbury has a film commissioner, and the Stamford Economic Development Office is creating a film commission.
The Connecticut Film Office coordinates the efforts of local film commissions, including Hartford, the Southeastern Connecticut Film Office, Danbury and New Milford.
"If MGM calls and says they are looking for something, I can call each film commission and ask if they've got it," Ms. Ray said. "I keep a data base of everyone who works in the state."
For the New Milford Film Commission, the big coup was to lure Campbell Scott (grandson of George C. Scott) to shoot part of his new film "Final" in two locations in New Milford. The film stars Denis Leary, who lives inf Washington, Conn., and Hope Davis.
Other Connecticut projects in the works include one being produced by Killer Films that was shot at Fairfield Hills Hospital, Danbury and Waterbury. A film called "Happy Accidents," shot in Branford and Guilford, was shown at Sundance.
"Blue Eyes, Blue" with Eric Clapton was filmed in Hadlyme, and "Judging Amy," a CBS series, will be shot in Hartford.
Not all of the films are coming from big companies. Paul Lombardo, 36, runs Speed Twin Films in Glastonbury. He wrote, produced and directed "Love . . . At Your Disposal," a romantic comedy that Mr. Lombardo shot all around Connecticut, including in Rocky Hill, New Britain and Glastonbury. He also used local actors and crew members.
Mr. Lombardo, who also acts, said his full-time job is working at his family's waste disposal company, Trash-Away Inc., in New Britain.
"You have to do something to pay the bills. I'm an aspiring trash man forced to make films," he said, laughing.
Another important aspect of film production in the state is the work of people like Ron Howard of Glastonbury, who owns Lion Heart Films. As a free-lance director for programs like "60 Minutes" and "20/20," he became interested in producing documentaries. "I came here 10 years ago for "Mystic Pizza" he said. "I liked New England so much. It isn't a center for film production, but it's starting to pick up and there are a lot of good people here. The state doesn't understand the importance of the industry like some other states do."
Mr. Howard's work in Connecticut has focused on documentaries. A piece on the abolitionists of the state is scheduled to air on C.P.T.V. this spring.
Film production in Connecticut needs to be encouraged, Ms. Ray added, but the challenge is luring the industry away from Canada, where filmmaking is subsidized, the value of the dollar is greater, and the union structures are different.
"The only way to combat what's going on in Canada is to work on economic growth, get financial institutions to invest in films, get Connecticut writers to be paid for writing scripts," she said. "If we have a vision like that, we can turn things around. If we have a starry-eyed vision of Hollywood, it won't happen here. We all have to work together with the film offices."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Art Commission Awards;
8 Are Honored For Excellence In Design

 BODY:
What is the architectural firm du jour -- lionized for the sphere-in-a-jewel-box Rose Center at the American Museum of Natural History -- doing at a sewage plant on the banks of Newtown Creek?
Being honored by the New York City Art Commission for excellence in civic design. 
 The Art Commission weighs the aesthetic appropriateness of architecture and works of art on city-owned property. Every year, it cites outstanding design in municipal projects, in the hope of encouraging city agencies to do even more. At City Hall tomorrow, the panel will give awards to eight projects, most of them not yet under construction.
 Among the winners are the disinfection and support buildings at the Newtown Creek Water Pollution Control Plant in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, designed by the Polshek Partnership for the Environmental Protection Department. The Polshek office also designed the Rose Center.
"Each building is an elegant composition that uses color and materials in a very bold way," said Jean Parker Phifer, the president of the 11-member Art Commission, who is an architect herself. "The level of effort is similar to an institutional building and that's so gratifying."
Joel A. Miele Sr., the environmental protection commissioner, said the focus on aesthetics and the choice of a renowned architect for a waste-water plant reflected the agency's goal of being a good neighbor. "The projects we build tend to clash with the community if care isn't taken," he said. The $237 million project is to be completed in 2004.
Other award recipients are:
* Harlem River Boathouse, Swindler Cove, Manhattan: Robert A. M. Stern Architects, for the New York Restoration Project.
* Hunts Point Teen Center, 765 Manida Street, the Bronx: Hanrahan & Meyers, in association with Castro-Blanco Piscioneri & Associates (recently acquired by Arquitectonica).
* Streetscape plan for lower Manhattan: Cooper, Robertson & Partners; Quennell Rothschild & Partners; Vollmer Associates and Pentagram Design, for the Alliance for Downtown New York.
* Improvements at the Alley Pond Park, Queens, interchange of the Long Island Expressway and Cross Island Parkway: Vollmer Associates.
* Restoration of murals, including the dome, at the New York County Courthouse, 60 Centre Street: EverGreene Painting Studios.
* Conservation of a Romare Bearden mural at the Bellevue Hospital Center: Luca Bonetti.
* New Chinese Scholar's Garden at the Staten Island Botanical Garden: Demetri Sarantitis and the Landscape Architecture Company of China.

HEADLINE: New Landlord, Old Tenants, Hard Questions

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
"IT was a beautiful offer," said Marie Johnson, a former homeowner from Queens and a tenant since 1991 at the Martha Washington Hotel. "But some of the women did not believe it was possible. They thought he was tempting us and would not live up to his promises."
The developer in question, Kevin P. Maloney, is now in the process of trying to live up to those promises, made to 83 longterm tenants at the Martha Washington. These tenants accepted an offer under which their rooms will be upgraded and re-equipped and they will be able to stay as long as they wish at no increase in rent. In return, they backed the developer's application for a certificate of no harassment to permit the conversion of the single-room-occupancy Martha Washington into a modern tourist hotel. 
 The building is near the middle of the block between Madison Avenue and Park Avenue South, with entrances on 29th and 30th Streets. Mr. Maloney and his partner, Ziel Feldman, principals in the Manhattan-based Property Markets Group, paid $18 million last year to buy it from Bernard Sillins, a longterm owner-operator of single-room-occupancy hotels. Three-quarters of its 423 rooms, most of which have no bathrooms, were vacant at the time. The conversion is creating the Hotel ThirtyThirty, with 370 modern rooms and suites. Its first three floors are scheduled to open in April.
While 83 of the tenants supported the conversion plan, 37 did not. The 29-member Martha Washington Tenants Association, represented by MFY Legal Services, which provides free legal services to tenants under a city contract, charged harassment by the owner. It demanded as a remedy that the owner agree to keep 150 rooms permanently at a rent level affordable to low- to moderate-income singles. But Property Markets Group received the certificate despite the charge, after which it declined to give the tenants that MFY Legal Services represented the same deal it gave the signing tenants, noting that they had rejected it over a period of eight months. There are 13 such tenants, according to Property Markets Group.
Now MFY Legal Services is in court, claiming that the certificate of no harassment is invalid. The certificate is a prerequisite to making significant room alterations in an S.R.O. hotel. Without it, the developer cannot get a permit from the Department of Buildings to add bathrooms to any rooms, whether vacant or occupied.
The owner's refusal to make anything other than a "punitive" offer once it had its certificate of no harassment left the tenants association no alternative to filing the lawsuit, said Janet Ray Kalson, the MFY Legal Services attorney. In the suit the tenants association maintains that the housing agency erred in failing to hold a public hearing on the harassment charges. The agency replies that it found no reasonable cause to believe that harassment occurred, and therefore no hearing was required. Justice Charles J. Tejada is hearing the case. An unfavorable decision could block the scheduled hotel opening in April.
One question that the Martha Washington situation raises is whether it is in the interest of single-room-occupancy tenants who think they have been harassed in a conversion to insist on a remedy that is unrelated to their own welfare as tenants. If the charge fails, the tenants may be left with nothing but the status quo. And it is unlikely that they care what happens to future rents in their rooms once they move out.
Another question is whether it is sound to attempt to "preserve" obsolete housing in buildings that have been given substantial economic value by the upsurge in Manhattan tourism.
At the Martha Washington, Property Markets Group estimates the total cost of its conversion effort at $49 million. Allocated across the 370 suites and rooms the company is creating, the acquisition alone amounted to an investment of $48,000 per unit, or "key," in the language of the hotel business. The total costs, including construction and the fees and services that constitute "soft" costs, come to $130,000 a unit.
For the public sector to match the acquisition price, it would have to have made or backed a competitive offer from a nonprofit group of at least $42,550 a room ($18 million for the 423 existing rooms). Nonprofits rarely pay more than $10,000 to $15,000 a room, and usually take much longer than a private buyer to close on a purchase.
It is not that the city has been inactive in helping to create or maintain single-room-occupancy housing units. Over the last 12 years a total of 5,548 S.R.O. units in 59 projects have been completed with city or state funding or both, figures from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development show. Twenty additional projects with 1,200 housing units are in construction or renovation, the agency says. Under the city loan program, 60 percent of new tenants must come from the city's shelters; the rest are neighborhood residents.
The S.R.O. housing unit is typically a tiny one-room apartment with no private bathroom or kitchen, although new publicly assisted units often have both bathrooms and kitchen equipment. Using the broadest definition of an S.R.O. unit, a study done for the city in 1993 found that there were 46,700 such units citywide. Seven percent of them were found to be in dilapidated buildings.
"When the real estate market is high it's difficult to preserve this resource," said James A. Krauskopf, president of the Corporation for Supportive Housing, a national organization that supports service-enriched housing for homeless and disabled people. In his view, consideration should be given to placing a moratorium on conversions of S.R.O. buildings to standard modern hotel rooms "unless the cap can be raised on the total development cost allowed per unit under the S.R.O. loan program."
THE city's cap currently stands at $95,000 per developable housing unit, a figure that includes both acquisition and rehabilitation costs. After acquisitions, the buildings generally require a substantial level of rehabilitation to rooms, building systems and common areas. For buildings that appeal to the private market, the nonprofits usually have no way to compete, mainly because of cost. But it also takes about nine months before city underwriting is complete, rent-assistance subsidies are committed, a loan is authorized and a sale can be consummated. Sellers prefer buyers who can make rapid commitments.
"I don't think we should be trying to compete in the private market for high-cost buildings," said Claire Haage, president of Housing & Services, which manages 700 units of supportive housing and acts as developer for nonprofit housing organizations. "But we should be trying to get hold of more buildings and vacant land that the city owns and no longer has use for. And we should also be building new housing."
While insisting that the law against harassment must be vigilantly enforced, Richard T. Roberts, the city's housing commissioner, said that it was not possible in a healthy real estate market to preserve all single rooms permanently for low-income occupancy. "We have a supportive-housing production program, not a single-room-occupancy preservation program," he said. This will increasingly include new construction of units for low-income singles, he said.
At the Martha Washington, a small group of pro-rehabilitation tenants, dissatisfied with MFY Legal Services' representation of the tenants association, organized on their own, and with financial help from the developer hired their own lawyer, Mitchell H. Kossoff, a partner in Kossoff Alper & Unger in Manhattan. From a one-page letter that covered the basic benefits, he negotiated the detailed contract that the 83 tenants signed over a period of six months. He also represented the pro-conversion tenants in public meetings, hearings and court proceedings.
"We needed to find a lawyer who had handled a case of this nature," said Brenda Waites Bolling, a hat designer who has lived at the Martha Washington for 10 years. Ms. Bolling took a leading role in finding a private lawyer. "I realized we were getting an offer that was just unbelievable, and I had faith in Mr. Maloney, although some people did not trust him," Ms. Bolling said.
For no increase in rent, the tenants who signed up are to get full bathrooms, color television with free cable service, free air-conditioning, and new or relocated closets. During construction the tenants are offered refinished rooms within the hotel. But they are not obliged to move out of the own rooms. If a tenant decides not to have a private bathroom, a public bathroom is to remain on that floor.
Tenants who move during construction may move back to their room when it is completed. During the reconstruction they pay no rent. Current rents range from $225 to $700 a month, and average $450 a month, the management says. When and if the room is vacated, it becomes part of the general inventory of hotel rooms, for which guest rates are expected to average $130 a night.
Property Markets Group, through a division called the Citylife Hotel Group, also owns and operates the 300-room OnTheAve Hotel, a reconstruction of the former Broadway American Hotel at Broadway and 77th Street, and Habitat Hotel at Lexington Avenue and 57th Street. The Habitat is the former Allerton Hotel, a 430-room S.R.O.
Property Markets Group was denied a certificate of no harassment at the Allerton last year after a finding by the housing agency that harassment had occurred under the former ownership.
After a three-year wait, an owner can reapply for a certificate of no harassment. "We're going to offer the tenants there a program similar to the one we offered at the Martha Washington," Mr. Maloney said.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Choosing Oil Heat or Natural Gas

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
HOMEOWNERS who have been thinking about converting their oil heating systems to natural gas recently found a reason to stop thinking and start acting when heating oil prices rose earlier this month to more than $2.60 a gallon in some areas.
While prices have since fallen to under $1.50 a gallon, natural gas suppliers say that the demand for oil-to-gas conversions has significantly increased. One of the area's largest natural gas providers, Keyspan Energy -- the parent of Brooklyn Union, which supplies natural gas to homes in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island -- recently reported that it had signed up 1,492 new gas customers in January, up from 962 for the same month last year. 
 But as alarming as the recent increase in oil prices may seem, oil dealers say that homeowners should make sure to "crunch the numbers" before making the decision to abandon oil for natural gas.
"It's simple economics," said Robert Frezzo, a principal of Jules Frezzo Oil Service in Union City, N.J. "If you want to change from oil to gas to save money, the first thing you should do is figure out how much you're going to be saving on heating bills. Because if you aren't going to be saving money, you're never going to recover the money you spent on the conversion."
Even without considering the costs of conversion, oil prices have in recent years been less than those for gas, when computed on the basis of British Thermal Units, or B.T.U.'s, In fact, according to statistics compiled by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, a state agency that monitors utilities, the average price for home heating oil was lower than the average price for natural gas on a "B.T.U. for B.T.U." basis in each year from 1993 to 1998, the last year for which such figures are available -- and, of course, well before the recent runup in oil prices.
"And 1998 was a banner year for oil," said John Maniscalco, executive vice president of the New York Heating Oil Association, a trade organization based in Manhattan. Mr. Maniscalco said that the average price for oil in that year was 34 percent less than the average price for natural gas.
"People have to look at the big picture," he said. "Oil has a track record of being less expensive than gas for the last six or seven years. So do you really want to make a decision to spend thousands of dollars based upon one 30-day blip in prices?"
The most obvious consideration for those who are thinking about converting from oil to gas is whether gas is available for a particular property. Joseph Alba, manager of gas conversions for Public Service Electric & Gas, a utility based in Newark, said that for customers who have already installed gas appliances like hot water heaters and clothes dryers, the existing gas supply to the house should be adequate.
Those who do not now have a gas line running to their house, however, can have one installed -- usually free of charge -- if there is a gas line in the street outside the property in question. If there is no gas line running down a particular street, he said, it is unlikely that a utility would install one unless it could be reasonably assured that several homes would utilize the service.
For homeowners who have access to gas, the experts say, the decision to convert should be made only after figuring out the total cost of the conversion -- an amount that may include hidden costs that could add thousands to the final price tag. Mr. Frezzo, who is a licensed plumber in New Jersey, pointed out, for example, that while parts and labor for a new gas boiler would normally cost anywhere from $3,000 to $4,000, homeowners often fail to take into consideration the costs associated with abandoning the existing oil storage tank.
In many places, he said, local law requires underground tanks to be tested for leaks, emptied of oil and filled with sand. Some jurisdictions, however, require removal of the tank from the ground. Accordingly, he said, the cost of dealing with the old tank can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. And just leaving an underground tank empty, he said, is asking for trouble since it will eventually corrode and could even collapse.
Mr. Frezzo added that homeowners should also resist the temptation to save money on an oil-to-gas conversion by replacing only the burner assembly on the existing furnace. "You can put a gas gun in an existing boiler for about $1,500," he said. "But unless you have a fairly new boiler, you're probably going to be wasting your money because the inefficiencies of older boilers are outrageous."
Another possible addition to the cost of converting to gas results from the fact that since natural gas produces cooler exhaust gases than oil, a chimney flue that was properly sized for an old oil furnace might be too big for a new gas furnace.
"It might appear that bigger is better," said Ashley Eldridge, technical director of the National Chimney Sweep Guild, a trade organization based in Indianapolis. "But with modern gas appliances, the flue gas temperature is lower. And if the flue is too big, the exhaust gases can condense to form hydrochloric acid that can eat away at the lining."
The remedy, Mr. Eldridge said, is generally to install a liner inside the existing flue -- a job that can cost several hundred dollars, depending on the size of the liner.
For homeowners who crunch the numbers but nevertheless remain undecided, some natural gas providers are now offering some additional incentives for converting switching from oil to gas. Keyspan Energy, for example, is now offering new customers their choice of $700, a free gas boiler or interest-free financing on the boiler and the additional installation costs.
"When you're asking people to choose between oil and gas, you're asking them to make a 25-year commitment," said Robert Mahony, president of the company. "So you better have an aggressive marketing campaign."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property /Telecommunications;
Wiring Buildings for High-Speed Internet Access

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THERE is little doubt what business the Intellispace company is in. Right at the entrance to the company's offices at 1156 Avenue of the Americas, at 45th Street, there are racks of telecommunications equipment that stand between the reception area and the executive desks.
But there is nothing traditional about the equipment or the company's approach to the telecommunications business. It is all related to the development of the Internet. 
 Intellispace is one of dozens of companies to which building managers are turning to prepare their properties for the high-tech future, providing telecommunications services to their tenants. From Bell Atlantic to the newest startup, each seems to have a different technical approach and economic model, with most providing a mix of local and long distance voice service plus video and Internet connections.
The Internet connections have become increasingly important, particularly for the young companies, usually referred to collectively as dot-coms, that conduct virtually all their business on the Internet. According to figures compiled by Insignia/ESG, the real-estate services company, 75 percent of all the commercial leases executed in Midtown South in the month of January this year were by such technology-related companies.
While most personal-computer users are content to rely on dial-up modem connections with Internet service providers, despite the occasional difficulty in gaining access, for companies developing businesses on the Internet, continuous, reliable, high capacity connections are essential. Other concerns in the field include OnSite Access, Allied Riser and Eureka Broadband.
"We are just at the beginning of a technological revolution," said Marc Josephson, the founder and chairman of Intellispace. "It is very difficult to do both voice and the Internet, so we just do Internet." Not everyone might agree with this assessment, but Mr. Josephson has chosen the Internet-only approach to differentiate his company from competitors.
He said that designing a system for the Internet optimizes the connections for Internet use rather than trying to add Net services to a system designed to carry voices. And, he said, standard voice and data services may one day be available over the Internet in a manner less costly than the present system.
Mr. Josephson said he became convinced about the commercial future of the Internet when he connected the building at 55 Broad Street in the summer of 1995. The building, owned by the Rudin family, had been sitting empty. It has since filled with Internet-related tenants and become a leading example of how technology can help cure real estate ills.
SINCE then, Intellispace has wired Rockefeller Center, the Jacob Javits Convention Center and 190 other buildings containing over 55 million square feet of space. Recently it reached an agreement with Hartz Mountain Industries to wire 18 properties in New York and northern New Jersey.
Among the Manhattan buildings wired by Intellispace are about 40 managed by Williams Real Estate for third-party owners. But Williams executives said they are still trying to choose among the vendors for buildings owned by the principals of Williams. "We are still trying to choose the right carrier," said Robert Getreu, a senior managing director of the firm. "We want the most flexibility for the tenants and a full package of services."
As a property manager, he said, he tries to differentiate among the many companies offering communications services using three criteria: the financial capability to deliver promised services, the range of services offered and the technology being used.
Intellispace's approach is to equip a building for very high speed communications and then sell each tenant the capacity it needs. It installs a device called a router, which is capable of handling 100 million bits per second of information and runs individual optical fiber connections to each tenant.
By way of comparison, a simple voice telephone line can carry 56,000 bits per second.
Although all the traffic in a building goes through the same piece of equipment, Intellispace officials say internal controls prevent one client from seeing another's messages. Each customer has its own dedicated fiber connection to the router, they add.
The company makes the installation at no cost to the landlord, who nevertheless must provide space for the router and space in the vertical shafts in a building, called risers. Finding riser space can sometimes be an issue, particularly in older buildings, real estate executives say.
"As building managers we are concerned that we may fill the risers with so much telecom wiring that when we want to do something for a building there will be a problem," Mr. Getreu said.
Intellispace also makes deals on a nonexclusive basis, so other Internet communications companies can offer competing services to tenants, easing landlord fears that tenants will be reluctant to lease space in a building with only one Internet connection.
The landlords also share in the revenue produced by tenants' use of the system, typically receiving 10 percent of revenues once a certain threshold has been reached. After an initial charge of about $2,000 for wiring a tenant's space and establishing the connection, a typical monthly fee for 1 million bits of capacity -- which would be typical for a dot-com with about 15 employees -- is about $1,000, said Bob Froberg, Intellispace's senior vice president and chief operating officer.
He said the system is flexible and can add capacity quickly if a company grows or just has a short-term need. If a company using 5 megabits of capacity suddenly needs 50, he said, the change can be made in a few days.
Intellispace executives say they are targeting the dot-com companies in the buildings they have wired and selling them reliability.
The company runs a minimum of two fiber connections out of each building and links them to two high-capacity fiber "rings" around Manhattan that connect to long-distance carriers such as Level 3 Communications, Cable & Wireless and GTE Internetworking. A third ring is due to go in operation within 60 days, company officials said, adding to redundancy.
The system is designed so that if any circuit is interrupted, all the traffic is switched to one of the backups.
ALTHOUGH this system bypasses the traditional telephone company switching system, Mr. Froberg noted that Bell Atlantic built the company's fiber rings in Manhattan.
"The dot-coms live on the Internet so they need high-speed, dedicated service," Mr. Froberg said, adding that the ability to scale up the amount of service is important as well. "But other businesses are seeing the need for employees to have access to the Internet."
For a company that is selling the future, it is using well-established marketing techniques. It is mounting a print advertising campaign on the city's subways and commuter railways. And it is using a direct sales force -- live people talking to other live people -- to persuade landlords to allow their buildings to be wired and tenants to sign up for service.
"We'll do things like host a breakfast in the lobby of a building to explain what we are offering," Mr. Froberg said.
The company recently received a $35 million investment from Chase Capital Partners, an affiliate of Chase Manhattan Corporation, and Weston Presidio Capital, both venture capital operations.
Intellispace officials say they are using the funds to expand regionally and, they hope, nationally. The company has opened offices in Philadelphia and Princeton, N.J., and is preparing to open offices in Boston, Stamford, Conn., and Washington.
"We are using the investment to expand rapidly," Mr. Josephson said. "In 2000, we expect to be in Baltimore, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco."

HEADLINE: ENVIRONMENT;
Deer May Lose Sunday Day of Rest From Hunters

BYLINE: By RICHARD BRAND 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
New Jersey legislators have proposed a number of laws, including one that would end a 97-year-old ban on Sunday hunting, in an effort to control the exploding deer population.
The proposals have been supported by the state Division of Fish and Wildlife and by state farmers, who complain that deer are eating crops and threatening their livelihood. But animal rights groups and outdoor recreationalists say that an extra day of hunting will scare hikers away from visiting the state's wooded areas. 
 The Sunday hunt bill is one of 11 being considered by state lawmakers to deal with deer. Two bills offer funds for deer fertility research, and two others would require the state to reimburse municipalities for cleaning up road kill. Two more bills call for the state to keep records of traffic accidents involving deer, and another would create a method for hunters to donate deer meat for the needy.
Another bill would give the Department of Agriculture the power to grant hunting licenses to farmers, and the last two require applicants for open space preservation funds to impose deer-management plans.
According to the state Division of Fish and Wildlife, New Jersey's deer population, which was almost wiped out at the turn of the century, has grown to 170,000 today, with a sharp rise from two mild winters.
A Rutgers University survey issued in 1998 attributed 68,000 acres of annual crop damage to deer, saying the damage cost farmers $6 million to $10 million each year.
Farmers say they will be unable to make ends meet if something is not done soon. "The situation is very acute here," said State Senator William Schluter of Hunterdon County. "We want green acres and we want to have farms preserved, but if we can't control the deer numbers then we can't preserve farms."
Mr. Schluter is sponsoring a bill that would end a "blue law" ban on Sunday hunting, letting municipalities decide whether to allow Sunday hunts.
Last week, the Senate Economic Growth and Tourism Committee approved the Sunday hunting bill, and it will go before the full Senate this spring with the support of the state Environmental Protection Agency's Division of Fish and Wildlife, which oversees hunting in the state.
"The most effective method to control deer populations is still sport hunting," said the director of the Division of Fish and Wildlife, Jim McDowell. "And too many deer are impacting on the farmer's ability to make a living."
The bill's opponents say that adding another hunting day will be dangerous for residents of the most densely populated state in the country.
"Most New Jersey citizens choose not to hunt for sport," Nina Austenberg, Director of the Humane Society's mid-Atlantic office, wrote in a letter to state senators. "With more than 100 days for hunters to kill deer, the overwhelming majority of citizens deserves access to public lands without fear or risk from hunter's guns and arrows for at least one day a week."
Mr. McDowell says hunters and hikers can safely share the woods.
"The hunters in this state have an extremely good safety record," he said. "Only one or two participants have been killed in the last few years. It's safer than swimming and golf. We invest a lot of money in the enforcement of safety regulations and its paid off in a safe recreational activity."
Mr. McDowell added: "The recreational use of deer pumps $106 million dollars a year into the state's small business economy. Deer are both an asset and a liability."
Today the deer are the bane of farmers, motorists, and home gardeners, and they are largely responsible for the prevalence of Lyme disease across the state.
Although the state does not keep data on deer-related accidents, some counties and towns keep count. Union County, for example, reported 670 deer-related accidents between 1992 and 1998, and Hunterdon County confirmed at least two fatalities in the last year.
Farmers remain the most broadly affected group.
"Farmers are willing to lose a percentage of their crop to wildlife damage. It's the nature of the beast," said Mary Mott-Kocsis, a member of the Hunterdon County Board of Agriculture who owns a 3,000 acre farm with her husband and his brother. 'But when you consistently lose 20 percent of your crop, it's too excessive.'
Hunters killed 75,283 deer during the season that ended last month, and slightly over 60,000 the year before.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
For House Candidates, Inflation Is a Big Issue

BYLINE: By Laura Mansnerus; Laura Mansnerus reports from Trenton for The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The cost of living is high in this state, for politicians as for everybody else. And this year, while complaints focus on a Senate race that promises to devour millions, House seats are going to be expensive, too, and a few will be amazingly expensive.
The inflation shows up across the board. In the 1998 elections, primary and general, all the candidates for all 13 House seats raised a record $17.5 million. In the current cycle, House candidates raised nearly $8 million just by the end of 1999, five months before the primary and almost a year before the general election. 
 The giving and spending will probably accelerate as the national party organizations get to work on a few campaigns judged critical to control of the House, where Republicans now hold a six-seat edge.
One contest alone, the race to unseat Representative Rush Holt in the 12th District, is expected to cost the participants a total of $4 million, which Mr. Holt attributes not only to the perpetually high cost of media time in the state but also to "the fact that I probably have the biggest bull's-eye on my back of any member of Congress."
Mr. Holt wrested the central Jersey district from the Republicans in 1998 and has been fending them off from the day he did. He expects to raise and spend $2 million, more than twice his total for 1998, and expects his opposition to do the same.
In 1999 Mr. Holt raised $968,075, with $665,339 in the bank at the end of the year. The two Republicans fighting for the nomination to oppose him, Dick Zimmer and Michael Pappas, were trailing, Mr. Zimmer with $674,390 in receipts and Mr. Pappas with $123,476. And for now they have the expense of beating up each other.
Still, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, while enjoying the messy split among Republicans, is not letting go of this one. "We stand ready to help him in any way," John Del Cecato, a committee spokesman, said of Mr. Holt. "Financial support, any counsel he needs, human resource help, anything he needs."
The Republican Congressional Campaign Committee feels the same way about whoever wins the June 6 primary. Representative Holt's seat is "a top priority," said Jill Schroeder, a committee spokeswoman. "It's an expensive year, but in particular this race is expensive because Rush Holt is one of the more vulnerable members."
Another race that is already engaging the national operatives is Susan Bass Levin's challenge to Representative Jim Saxton in the Third District, in South Jersey. While she has just a fraction of the $1 million-plus that Mr. Saxton has in the bank, Ms. Levin, the mayor of Cherry Hill, is working fast; she raised a total of $219,296 in 1999, before announcing her candidacy, half of it in the last 10 days of December.
Then there is the seriously crowded Seventh District, where Democrats are given decent odds of winning the seat that Bob Franks is vacating to run for the Republican Senate nomination. As of the end of December, four Republicans and three Democrats had raised a total of $1.4 million. Since then, two more Republicans and one more Democrat have joined the race.
Not all of the major money raisers are in close contests. Some incumbents raise large sums just to scare off opposition, and some of the richer incumbents, it is understood, will dispense money to allies in need.
Two of the richest, Representatives Robert Menendez (just over $1 million in receipts last year) and Frank Pallone (almost $600,000), both Democrats, raised cash furiously for possible Senate campaigns. Now, with virtually no opposition for their House seats, both could probably win re-election without leaving their offices.
For the participants not yet released from fund-raising, the experience is taxing. Ms. Levin said her days were getting longer, with at least two hours a day on the phone at campaign headquarters. "I'm also meeting people for breakfast and lunch," she said. "Sometimes two breakfasts."
For his part, Representative Saxton will have to spend much of his $1 million on himself, whereas in recent years, he said, he had been in the "enviable position of being able to help somebody else." (In 1998, Mr. Saxton won by 31 percentage points, against an opponent who raised a grand total of $2,740.) He is doubtful that the national party organization, which can make only small cash contributions anyway -- will be very helpful. "It's kind of hard," he explained, "to convince the powers that be that you need help above and beyond what you can do when you have a million dollars in the bank."
Ms. Levin's response: "He has a million and I'll have to have a million, and maybe more. Then, when I'm elected, I'll fight tooth and nail for campaign finance reform."
That is what Representative Holt said in his 1998 campaign, and upon taking office he signed on to a bill to restrict the ever-larger soft money contributions to party organizations.
Now that the stakes in his district have doubled in two years, Mr. Holt said, "all of this just highlights the need for reform."

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES;
At Least for Now, Retirees Find That New Jobs Come at a Price

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF 

 BODY:
AMERICA needs more workers. Without them, the nation's economic boom may be threatened, if current workers can command big pay raises and thus bring inflation into the picture. Luckily, there is a solution readily at hand: a gray horde of retirees, many of whom want to work at something.
But there's also a catch: 
 If you want to hang on to all your Social Security benefits, you'd better not work too much. If you are under age 65 and collecting benefits, you can earn up to only $10,080 a year before giving up some Social Security money. And if you are 65 through 69 you can earn up to just $17,000 this year; in 2001, the cap will rise to $25,000.
Why punish the ambitious? That is a question being asked in Congress. House Republicans have introduced a bill to allow Social Security recipients from age 65 (but not recipients under 65) to earn as much as they want with no threat to their retirement benefits. And President Clinton has said he will sign such a bill if it comes to him with no links to other issues. So things could change fairly soon.
But for now, financial penalties are still in effect. Some 800,000 Social Security recipients aged 65 through 69 gave up part of their benefits last year because they earned too much.
John E. Abate found out about this recently while keeping busy consulting for Lucent Technologies; he had retired in 1998, at the age of 67. Something that his financial adviser had told him was nagging at the back of his brain. The adviser, Doug Stives, an accountant with Wiss & Company in Red Bank, N.J., who had helped him make the transition to retirement, explained to Dr. Abate that he should keep his earnings below $15,500 (the limit then in effect) if he went back to work in 1999.
With all the confusion attendant to starting a new way of life, Dr. Abate, who holds a Ph. D. in electrical engineering, put the information on the back burner and began his consulting work. But then he realized that he should get in touch with his adviser.
"John came in to see me for 15 minutes, and we went over his options," Mr. Stives said. "He decided to stop consulting for the rest of the year, and he said, 'If I hadn't come to see you, this could have been a pretty expensive situation.' "
"Yes," Dr. Abate said the other day, "there are unfortunate consequences for people who make some money."
Although workers who earn more than the cap will end up with a higher income than if they had not done so, they may well lose most of their gains.
Dr. Abate, who lives with his wife, Mary, in Holmdel, N.J., is typical of the new retirees who are in good health and in good financial standing with plenty of energy to pursue hobbies and work opportunities.
The Abates have four grown children and five grandchildren. In his spare time Dr. Abate, who had a distinguished career as a research scientist and a manager with AT&T Bell Laboratories, studies music at Monmouth University and plays the clarinet, saxophone, piano and organ. He bicycles and swims, monitors his investments on the Internet and is looking into volunteer work.
But he wants to keep his hand in his life's work, and that is why he was consulting for Lucent, which was spun out of AT&T. When he realized he could not continue without imposing a penalty on himself, he decided to turn over his project to a colleague. He decided against one option, which would have meant finding a way to push part of his consulting fee into the next year.
Under Social Security rules, benefits for people who are 65 through 69 are reduced by $1 for every $3 in earnings over $17,000. But that is not all. These recipients must pay Social Security tax on their earnings, even though doing so will not enhance their future benefits. And they must pay income tax as well.
"The end result is an effective tax on earned income of about 85 percent, which is ridiculous," Mr. Stives said.
There are limited ways around this. One route suggested by Mr. Stives was for Dr. Abate to incorporate and limit his salary to $17,000 a year. That way, he could profit from consulting and not hurt his Social Security benefits. Setting up what is known as a C corporation would allow him to limit his salary, but profit would be subject to corporate income tax. Or, he could set up an S corporation, which would pass through its profits to shareholders of the company.
Of course, there are limits to how creative you can get with these situations. Say you founded an instantly successful Internet company making millions of dollars but paid yourself only $17,000. You would probably hear from a tax agent. "You would need to prove $17,000 is reasonable compensation for what you are doing," Mr. Stives said.
Another option is retreat. Suppose that you are receiving Social Security benefits and decide that retiring was a mistake, that you want to work full time and make as much as you can. Not to worry, according to Avery E. Neumark, a principal in the accounting firm of Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin & Company: You can call the Social Security office and explain that you want to drop out of the program; later, when you decide to claim your benefits, your latest earnings will be included in the computation of benefits, so that you may be eligible for a larger benefit.
For people planning to work heavily during retirement, it would generally make sense to defer putting in for Social Security benefits. People who wait until age 70 get a much bigger benefit, and there is no limit on earned income as far as Social Security goes.
The Social Security Administration contends that you should not necessarily keep your earnings under the limits because you think you will lose too much money. On its Web site (www.ssa.gov), it provides examples showing that even if you give back some of your Social Security benefits, you can still come out ahead in overall income. That may be true, but if you worked since you were a teenager to earn those Social Security benefits, it hurts to give any back.
The agency also explains that if you work for someone else, only your wages count toward the earnings limit. If you are self-employed, net earnings, not gross earnings, are counted, allowing room for deductions -- a home office for those who qualify, for example, or costs for computers, cars used in work, or even employees. At any rate, nonwork income like investment earnings, interest, pensions, annuities and capital gains are not counted.
Still, the self-employed should look at the tax consequences of taking on new projects. A person with investment income, for example, or whose spouse was still working, could find that freelance work made his Social Security benefits subject to income tax. For married taxpayers filing jointly, 50 percent of Social Security benefits are taxable if income as calculated on a work sheet is $32,000 to $43,999, and 85 percent taxable if income is $44,000 or more.
People in the first year of retirement may disregard all of the above. There are a different set of rules for that period. Generally, people who have retired in midyear have earned more than the yearly earnings limit, so Social Security will give them a full Social Security check for any whole month they are retired, regardless of yearly earnings.
In any case, check for details with the agencies involved or advisers like Mr. Stives. There are all sorts of ins and outs.

Chart: "From Regular I.R.A. to Roth I.R.A. and Back Again"
In a regular I.R.A., pretax money is contributed, and taxes are due on distributions. The reverse is true with a Roth. After-tax money goes in, and distributions after age 59 1/2, including money earned in the account, may be tax-free.
 Taxpayers whose adjusted gross incomes are $100,000 or less may convert regular I.R.A.'s to Roth I.R.A.'s but will have to pay taxes based on the value of the taxable holdings at the time they do so.
 What are known as recharacterizations back to regular I.R.A.'s are also allowed. The intention was to provide a way to undo the conversion for taxpayers who turned out to be ineligible for Roths, but the law does not limit their use to that purpose.
 Here, a taxpayer whose account dropped in value was able to cut his tax liability by recharacterizing and then reconverting to avoid paying taxes on the original value of the I.R.A.
 
A taxpayer has $10,000 in a traditional I.R.A. invested in a mutual fund.
The taxpayer decides to convert the traditional I.R.A. to a Roth.
 
If no further action is taken
Balance: $10,000
Tax due in 28% bracket: $2,800
 
The fund drops in value to $7,000, so the taxpayer chooses to recharacterize the I.R.A.
The taxpayer turns the Roth I.R.A. back into a traditional I.R.A.
 
Balance: $7,000
Tax due: $0
 
The fund rises in value to $8,000, so the taxpayer decides turn the I.R.A. back into a Roth.
The taxpayer owes taxes on only $8,000, not the original $10,000.
 
Balance: $8,000
Tax due: $2,240

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES;
Beating the Tuition Blues and Earning Some Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By CHARLES DELAFUENTE 

 BODY:
THERE are many ways that Eleanor Terzian and Antonio Ciolino could save on income taxes while also saving for their son's college education. They could invest in a child's name, buy savings bonds, open an Education I.R.A., build up savings in a state-sponsored tuition-payment plan or even increase contributions to their own retirement plans.
The problem faced by Ms. Terzian and Mr. Ciolino -- and many couples like them -- is that they have to choose among these available strategies, because the tax code does not allow all the breaks to be used at the same time and sets income limits on others. Further, some of the choices are complicated by scholarship-eligibility rules that depend on future income. 
Predicting which strategies will work best years from now is tough, to say the least.
Ms. Terzian and Mr. Ciolino, who live in Mineola, N.Y., have so far chosen just one way to put away college money for their son, Giancarlo, 11. When he was about 5, they bought $5,000 of stock in three major companies for him. (They declined to specify the companies.)
"I'm not a fan of mutual funds," Ms. Terzian said, differing with most financial planners. "I'd rather pick a stock and take my chances."
The shares are owned by Giancarlo, with his mother as custodian, under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, a law adopted by most states that allows a parent or other custodian to set aside money in a minor's name. The arrangement gives the minor the tax responsibility while the custodian makes the investment decisions.
Monetary gifts to Giancarlo, including some from his grandfather, of about $200 a month, also have been invested in those same stocks. And Ms. Terzian participates in the companies' commission-free dividend-reinvestment plans.
From a tax standpoint, this has been "a reasonable first step" in a college-financing plan, said Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and accountant.
Because Giancarlo's stock has yielded annual dividends of less than the amount of a standard exemption for a dependent, which was $700 for 1999, he has never had to pay any tax. If he had more than $700 in dividends, he would owe tax at the 15 percent rate on the next $700. After that, under the kiddie tax rules, his income would be taxed at his parents' rate of 28 percent.
With some planning, Giancarlo will not have to pay much tax on the increase in the stock's value. When he turns 14, he will no longer be subject to the kiddie tax and his income will be taxed at the lowest rate, currently 15 percent, or 10 percent for long-term capital gains.
The College Board, which tracks the cost of higher education, says the average annual cost of attending a private four-year college, including tuition and room and board, was $20,500 during the 1999-2000 school year. The average cost of a public school was $10,909. Multiply that by four, and it is clear that most people will need to make every smart financial move they can.
There are other steps that can be taken by Ms. Terzian, a teacher in New York City, and Mr. Ciolino, a chef who is both an owner of and a salaried employee of Spazzi, a restaurant in Fairfield, Conn.
They could buy United States Series EE Savings Bonds. The interest is tax free for joint filers with income below $79,650 (or $53,100 for individuals) if the proceeds are used for college. But the tax break is phased out after the parents' income reaches $109,650 for couples or $68,000 for individuals in the year the bonds are redeemed.
Giancarlo's parents could also open an Education I.R.A. for him, or he could open his own, but the maximum contribution to each child's account is only $500 a year. Because of that low ceiling and the various strings attached, such accounts are not popular. The amount is not deductible from income, but the growth of the investment is tax free if the money is withdrawn to pay tuition bills. Married taxpayers with adjusted gross income of more than $160,000 cannot contribute, nor can singles with adjusted gross income of more than $110,000. However, a child can open the account, even with gifts from ineligible parents.
Alternatively, the couple could invest in a state-sponsored prepaid tuition plan or a college savings plan. (The Internal Revenue Service, however, does not permit both that and an Education I.R.A.) According to the Ayco Company, a national financial planning firm based in Albany, the Montana Family Education Savings Program (800 888-2723), is the only prepaid state tuition plan available to residents of every state. The plan will calculate how much is needed to pay for the college education, including room and board, of a child of a given age. If that much is invested over a prescribed period, the plan guarantees to pay for the child's education. For Giancarlo, the Montana plan would require a lump-sum investment of $94,238 or six annual investments of $18,000 for a private college. The earnings would be tax free.
As Ayco pointed out in a recent report to its clients, the drawback of such a plan is that the account holder does not benefit if asset growth outruns the inflation rate for college tuition, now about 4.25 percent a year. What the plan does provide, the report notes, is a guarantee that the money will be there when it is needed.
Among state-sponsored college savings plans, Ayco says one that stands out is the New York College Savings Program (877 697-2837, www.nysaves.com), which Mr. Kess calls "a terrific new thing." That would be the next step in his suggested strategy for Giancarlo.
Unlike the Montana plan, college savings plans are not tax-exempt, according to Ayco, but no tax is due on the investment's growth until the principal is withdrawn for college. New York State residents can also deduct contributions of up to $5,000 a year each from their state income taxes, a break worth $686 a couple to most middle-income and upper-income taxpayers and less to low-income parents.
But the fund, not the investor, decides on the investment mix, and Ayco says the New York fund's investment allocations "are very conservative." Ayco suggests that a growth mutual fund might provide a higher return for younger children.
Several other states offer similar plans. Details are available on the Internet (www.savingforcollege.com).
A drawback of both the Education I.R.A. and the state-sponsored plans is that the money belongs to the child, not the parents. That can make a big difference to a child who is being considered for scholarship aid.
Most colleges determine a student's financial need using a formula that requires a student to contribute 82 percent of his or her assets over four years, but requires parents to contribute only 21 percent of their assets. One way to escape the kiddie tax and also avoid limitations on financial aid is to use a child's assets for purposes other than tuition once he or she turns 14 but before it is time to apply for aid.
The state-sponsored plans are so new that it is not yet clear whether they will be counted in the formula that reduces scholarships based on a student's assets, although many financial planners predict that they will. Michael H. Iacolucci, the chief technical, training and investment officer for Ayco's financial-related services division, said an informal survey showed that some colleges had not yet decided the issue.
Another strategy available to Mr. Ciolino is to contribute $2,000 to a traditional I.R.A. every year. He can deduct the contribution from current income because he is not covered by a pension plan and because the couple's adjusted income is less than $150,000. If Ms. Terzian were not covered by a plan, either, she could take the same step. (For people who are covered by a plan at work, I.R.A. contributions are deductible only if the gross income on a joint return is less than $61,000.)
Normally, I.R.A. withdrawals are subject to a 10 percent penalty if the account holder is less than 59 1/2 years old. But withdrawals to pay a dependent's tuition are free from penalties, although income tax is due on the amount withdrawn.
A similar strategy for parents is to increase contributions to voluntary retirement plans at work if they are not investing the maximum. The contributions reduce taxable income dollar for dollar, and most plans will allow participants to borrow against their holdings.
Ms. Terzian, for instance, contributes 14 percent of her salary to a tax-deferred 403(b) retirement plan. If she put in another $2,400, as she could, she would cut her New York State and federal tax bill by $791.
The 401(k) plans sponsored by corporations are similar, and many companies make them even more attractive by matching a portion of their employees' contributions. Employees can contribute up to 15 percent of their income, to a maximum of $10,500 a year in 2000.
David S. Rhine, a partner who is national director of family wealth planning at BDO Seidman, the accounting firm, said that "for the average middle-income taxpayer, retirement plans are the best way to save for college." That is because of employer matches and wider investment choices, he said. Also, retirement savings do not count against the financial aid formulas, he said.
Mr. Rhine recommends borrowing over withdrawing from retirement funds as part of a strategy of maximizing financial aid. A parent who withdrew $20,000 in retirement funds during a child's freshman year, he explained, would have $20,000 more in income that year, and that might disqualify the child from getting aid the next year.
Another borrowing strategy with favorable tax implications for parents who own homes is a home-equity loan. The interest on loans up to $100,000 is deductible.
One other strategy mentioned by Mr. Kess is for Giancarlo to earn some money each year when he is old enough. If he earned $2,000 as a kitchen helper in his father's restaurant each summer, he would owe virtually no income tax. If he put that money into a Roth I.R.A., the principal, which is not subject to tax, could be withdrawn to help pay tuition. Mr. Kess would leave the account's earnings alone, because they could become the foundation of Giancarlo's own retirement plan.

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES;
How the 2000 Ballot Could Amend Form 1040

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
RARELY have voters had such a clear opportunity to let Washington know what they want to do about taxes.
It is a presidential election year, and between the two major parties, the four leading candidates are offering a spectrum of proposals. At one end of the spectrum is Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who generally wants to provide tax relief of Reaganesque proportions; at the other is former Senator Bill Bradley, who has called for only limited tax cuts to reduce poverty and improve health care. Mr. Bush's Republican rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, champions a substantial tax-cutting package, although much smaller than Mr. Bush's, and Vice President Al Gore supports modest tax cuts. 
 Taxes always play some role in presidential politics, but this year they are an even bigger issue than usual, because there is a huge pot of money on the table, estimated at as much as $1.9 trillion over the next decade, depending on what assumptions are made about government spending. In addition, Social Security is projected to generate a surplus of more than $2 trillion over that period, but it is expected to face severe problems longer term, as the population ages.
The two parties more or less agree that the Social Security surplus should go toward shoring up the retirement system or reducing the national debt. But with the federal government shifting from an era of crippling budget deficits to one of large and growing surpluses, tax cuts are at the center of a fundamental ideological debate over how the government should apportion the torrent of tax revenue being generated by the strong economy.
Send it back to the taxpayers, say conservatives, who contend that the surplus will otherwise be squandered by the government. Invest it in education, health care and other social needs rather than handing out tax breaks to the rich, argue liberals, who see the flood of revenue into the Treasury as a chance for government to make a real difference.
Moderates in both parties say that there is enough money available to balance those two goals. They also assert that a substantial chunk of the surplus should go toward dealing with an aging society's long-range problems, most notably the financial strains facing Social Security and Medicare.
Voters seem to favor using the surplus first to bolster Social Security and Medicare, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll this month. The poll found that 56 percent of those surveyed made preserving the old-age programs their top priority when it came to allocating the surplus, followed by reducing the national debt, at 17 percent, and cutting taxes, at 13 percent. Some analysts think that Mr. Bush's defeats in the Republican primaries in New Hampshire and Michigan are evidence that the Republican tax-cutting orthodoxy lacks its former political punch, and that voters are, as Mr. McCain is betting, at least as intent on using the surplus to address the long-term needs of the nation.
"There's a clear set of options," said Clint Stretch, a tax policy analyst at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm. "You can get small, medium-sized or big. You can get tax cuts for low earners, for the middle class or for everybody. And you can get it simple or you can get it complicated."
To some extent, the partisan and philosophical differences on taxes are also playing out this year between Congress and President Clinton. Republican leaders plan to bring up a variety of tax-cutting proposals in a piecemeal fashion, and the House has already passed a Republican-sponsored cut in the "marriage penalty," which has left some two-income couples paying more in taxes than two single people would if they had the same incomes. There is some hope in both parties for compromise this year on a few tax issues, including this one.
But the basic direction of tax policy is unlikely to be settled until the voters have decided whom to install in the White House and whether to leave Congress under the Republicans' control.
"After the election, assuming the surplus numbers remain big, we will come to a consensus or a compromise," Mr. Stretch said. "But it has to be next year and not this year."
THE debate comes down to two basic questions: How much of the projected surplus should go toward tax cuts? And how should any tax cuts be spread among low- , middle- and high-income taxpayers?
Mr. Bush's proposal would cut taxes by $483 billion over five years and by about $1.3 trillion over 10 years. Its centerpiece is a gradual reduction in marginal income tax rates, meaning that everyone would get a tax cut. Under current law, there are five income tax rates: 15 percent, 28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent and 39.6 percent. Mr. Bush would replace those five brackets with four: 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent.
Mr. Bush would also double the child tax credit to $1,000 a child and increase the income level at which the credit phases out. He would allow two-income couples to take a deduction of up to $3,000, to reduce the marriage penalty, and would phase out the tax on large estates.
Mr. Bush argues that by giving a tax cut to the working poor, his plan would help people struggling to climb into the middle class. He also contends that the plan would appropriately return excess revenue to the people who had earned it in the first place.
"We're dealing with the people's money, not the government's money, and I want to give people their money back," Mr. Bush said during a debate in South Carolina just before his victory in the primary there. "And if you're going to have a tax cut, everybody ought to have a tax cut."
But Mr. McCain and Democrats contend that Mr. Bush's plan is fiscally reckless, because it allocates all or most of the excess revenues from general taxation to tax cuts, leaving little or nothing to bolster Social Security and Medicare or to reduce the national debt further. And they argue that Mr. Bush's plan would give far too much of its benefits to the wealthiest taxpayers.
An analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal-leaning research group, found that more than one-third of Mr. Bush's tax cut would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers -- those with incomes of $319,000 or more -- while the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers, those with incomes of less than $39,300, would get 11 percent of the benefits. Mr. Bush says his plan fairly gives the biggest tax cuts to the people who pay the biggest tax bills.
MR. McCAIN'S tax-cut plan is valued at $238 billion over five years and $500 billion over 10 years. Its centerpiece is an expansion of the lowest income tax bracket, 15 percent, to cover higher incomes.
Under the plan, the ceiling for the 15 percent bracket would rise to $70,000 from $43,050 for married couples filing jointly, and to $35,000 from $25,750 for single taxpayers. The effect would be to give a $3,504 tax cut to a couple with taxable income of $70,000 or more.
Mr. McCain's plan would also double the child tax credit to $1,000 a year, expand tax incentives for savings and investment, reduce the tax on large estates and reduce the marriage penalty for some people by increasing the standard deduction for couples. Mr. McCain would offset a portion of the tax cuts by closing corporate tax loopholes.
His pitch is that the plan is modest enough in size that it leaves plenty of money from the surplus tax revenues to deal with other needs. By expanding the 15 percent bracket to cover millions of additional taxpayers, he says, his plan amounts to a start on creating a system of flatter tax rates. And he argues that his plan gives much less of its benefits to the wealthy than Mr. Bush's plan does.
"I want a balanced approach," Mr. McCain said in the South Carolina debate. "The difference between Governor Bush's proposal and mine is that I put a whole lot of money into Social Security, Medicare and paying down the debt. He puts a whole lot of money into tax cuts."
An analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice found that only 1.8 percent of the benefits of the McCain plan would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. Most of his proposed tax cuts would go to a broadly defined middle class: more than 52 percent to taxpayers making $65,000 to $130,000, and 21 percent to taxpayers making $39,000 to $65,000.
Mr. McCain's plan, however, would do almost nothing for taxpayers with incomes below $39,000. Mr. Bush asserts that Mr. McCain's plan would leave too much of the surplus in Washington, where, Mr. Bush says, it would inevitably be spent not on Social Security but instead on bigger government and wasteful programs. And Mr. Bush regularly criticizes Mr. McCain's plan, contending that it would not help the working poor.
NEITHER of the Democratic candidates is making tax cuts a big part of his campaign. Mr. Gore has proposed allocating $250 billion to $300 billion to tax cuts over the next decade for specific goals. In particular, he supports expanded tax incentives for education and retirement savings, a reduction in the marriage penalty for low- and middle-income couples and a permanent extension of the tax credit for corporate research and development.
As a former member of the Senate Finance Committee and one of the fathers of the 1986 overhaul of the tax code, Mr. Bradley arguably has more experience with tax policy than any of the other candidates. But he has offered no detailed tax proposals.
He has suggested using most of the surplus to deal with two big issues, reducing child poverty and finding ways to make health care more accessible and affordable. The only specific tax cuts he backs are tax breaks on health insurance payments, an expansion of the earned-income tax credit for the working poor and an expansion of the child care credit in a way that would help low-income people.
Mr. Bradley has also proposed clamping down on corporate tax loopholes, a step also favored by Mr. Gore.
Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain agree on one thing: that the Democratic candidates' lack of enthusiasm for big tax cuts reflects the Democrats' desire to expand the size and influence of the federal government. The Democrats, their Republican opponents say, believe that Washington is better qualified to use taxpayer money than the taxpayers themselves.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FORT GREENE;
Long-Absent Greyhounds May Return To Brooklyn

BYLINE: By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
A decade after Greyhound stopped direct long-distance service to and from Brooklyn, two local businessmen are trying to return the bus company to the borough. But some community board members have raised concerns about noise and pollution from buses.
Darnell Canada, president of the Fort Greene Empowerment Organization, a community group, and Wallace Scott, its financial secretary, say they hope to open a Greyhound office on Myrtle Avenue near Prince Street by May. Greyhound tickets can be bought in Brooklyn, but passengers must go to the Port Authority in Manhattan to board buses. 
 "An incredible amount of Brooklyn people trek over to the Port Authority," said Ike Davis, Greyhound's manager for New York City and Long Island.
He said the company would lease the space and pay for phone lines, computers and personnel training, with Mr. Canada and Mr. Scott responsible for ticket sales, hiring and supervision. Buses would stop at the station two or three times a day.
The chairman of Community Board 2, Robert Evans, says members have had mixed reaction to the plan. "We were getting people who were concerned," he said. "Some were overjoyed, some were not."
Roy Vanasco, head of Community Board 2's traffic and transportation committee, said: "As far as I'm concerned, there's no need for any more buses coming through here. You just can't park in front of people's stores and houses, with the smoke going in their doors and windows."
The plan would would have to go before the borough president's office and the community board, and would require the approval of the City Planning Commission. Greg Brooks, the chief of staff for Borough President Howard Golden, said, "Nobody has contacted the president's office regarding a Greyhound station."
Mr. Davis said Greyhound had already been considering a Brooklyn station before the two businessmen approached him.
Victor A. Vora, who sells Greyhound tickets out of his three card shops, in downtown Brooklyn and the Flatlands section, said that in recent years he had explored the idea of returning Greyhound buses to Brooklyn. He said he would like to build a bus terminal, and said that the area known as Dumbo (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) would be a good location. But Mr. Davis said that while Mr. Vora had discussed the idea with him, he had not presented a formal plan.
Mr. Scott, who has worked as a driver and a supervisor of drivers for Greyhound, said he and Mr. Canada were negotiating with Red Apple Realty, developer of the site, for a three- to five-year lease. He said the Greyhound name could attract other businesses to the area. "We can revitalize Myrtle Avenue and at the same time bring in more employment," Mr. Scott said, saying that the bus station could create about 30 jobs.
A consultant to Mr. Scott and Mr. Canada, S. Eric Blackwell, said he would consider other locations, like East New York or the Brooklyn Navy Yard, if necessary. TARA BAHRAMPOUR

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Suburban;
Still XXXL, but Softer

BYLINE: By LEONARD M. APCAR 

 BODY:
BY the early 90's, as Chevrolet Suburbans multiplied on American roads, they came to be viewed as symbols of automotive excess. The Suburban had big V-8 power, 18 feet of pressed metal, seats for up to nine and enough room to move a lot of Hillary Clinton's White House mementos up to Chappaqua.
Then excess became fashionable and the Suburban, once a favorite of ranchers, road crews and Texans -- who have their own views about personal space -- became something of an extra-large family wagon. There it was on city streets, in cramped parking lots, waiting outside grade schools. 
 But women, who now account for 60 percent of Suburban drivers during the week, were not crazy about making U-turns in these land barges, or the glares they got from Subaru drivers down below.
So when General Motors contemplated a redesign of its big banana, it didn't forget that the Suburban was finally living up to its name. Families liked it for its anything-but-a-minivan appeal and its interior acreage.
G.M. sketched carefully. Its all-new design gives families what they want -- more usable space inside -- without abandoning the Suburban's lineage as a can-do truck.
G.M. is also making more of the distinctions between the two types of Suburbans, which went on sale late last year: the 1500 model that does family duty -- 96 percent of Suburbans are bought by married adults with children -- and the beefier 2500 favored by rescue squads and road crews. The two are identical in size inside and out, but the 2500, which is based on the frame of the big three-quarter-ton pickup, offers more towing capacity. My test truck was the 1500.
While the exterior has been redesigned, it does not look a lot different. At a glance, you hardly notice the new curve here, the sculptured panel there, the extra bulk on the bones. But the inside grew a bit and got a few minivan touches like optional captain's chairs, replacing a bench, in the second row of seats. The third seat got wheels, making it a little easier to remove, and access to that seat was slightly improved. The drop-down tailgate was eliminated in favor of a one-piece hatchback door. (Old-fashioned, side-hinged doors, akin to those on commercial vans, are still available, too.)
And because they are used more as cars than as trucks, just about everything about the ride and handling became softer. It is now slightly easier to turn on a curve or maneuver in a garage. But parallel-parking is still a high art, never mind navigating fast-food drive-throughs.
The new Suburban holds the road better on twists and turns, but, again, this is still a truck to its very core. Nothing conjured up in Detroit's dream works is going to make a Suburban into a jaunty roller skate.
The foundation comes from the redesigned Chevrolet Silverado pickup; the frame, which is crucial to ride, handling and vibration, is no small matter in a truck whose body and frame are still bolted together the old-fashioned way. This frame, shared by the Silverado and GMC Sierra and the Suburban's GMC counterpart -- now called the Yukon XL -- is a three-part affair that was re-engineered to reduce welds and weight and to increase strength and durability. The truck's foundation is indisputably stiffer and quieter.
In the rear, coil springs were added to most Suburbans to level out the ride, which could be bouncy on the previous model, with its leaf springs.
The new body makes the 2000 Suburban roomier than its predecessor in the ways that count: room for heads, hips and feet. On the outside it's a tad shorter, but not enough to matter. It is wider and taller, but more important, you can sense the tighter turning circle when you loop around to catch the turn that you missed.
All this adds up to a better truck. It is definitely easier to maneuver the big guy, and it seems much quieter and better put-together than the creaky, lumbering living rooms I remember from the 80's.
It is also easier to stop, thanks to a serious brake redesign. G.M. finally acknowledged that the old brakes never inspired much confidence. The 2000 models come with decisive four-wheel disc brakes, instead of a mushy front-disc, rear-drum combination.
In the pricing department, the most luxurious versions have been marked up the most, more than 10 percent for the fancy four-wheel-drive LT. That model, with front and rear air-conditioning and automatic climate control, exceeds $42,000. The plainest 1500 starts at $26,400 with rear drive and $29,337 with four-wheel drive, but these are for fire chiefs and deer hunters.
In most respects, the redesign is cautious. Seating is plush, of course, and the storage bins and cup holders are sufficient, if not as abundant as in today's minivans. Power seat controls are still on the side of the seat, an awkward reach for big hands that have to be wedged in next to the door. The glove box is fairly sized, given the air bag stuffed in nearby; the latch has shifted to the left so the driver can reach it.
The front bench has been smartly split in a 40-20-40 proportion; the middle backrest folds to provide an armrest and storage.
In safety tests, the Suburban excels if for no other reason than its size. The frame is designed to absorb more energy from a head-on collision. There are four air bags, including two in the sides of the front seats.
The standard engine is a 5.3-liter, 285-horsepower V-8, compared with the 5.7-liter, 255-horse V-8 of the previous model. By refining an engine that dates to the celebrated small-block V-8's of the 50's, G.M. has managed to improve power, emissions and fuel economy slightly. The mileage rating is 14 in town, 16 on the highway. But in these days of $1.50-a-gallon gas, filling the standard-sized tank costs about $50 and gets you 450 miles down the road.
The Suburban is no longer the nation's No. 1 road hog, a title that now belongs to the Ford Excursion, which is more than 7 inches longer. Toyota is coming to market this fall with the Sequoia, which will be only a bit smaller, and DaimlerChrysler is said to have a similarly large S.U.V. in the works. But the Suburban will not be easily knocked off its pedestal; half of all sales go to presumably satisfied previous owners.
 
INSIDE TRACK: Sorry, cowboy, this makeover was for mom and the kids.

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS;
Nicole Shidler, Vincent Sampson

 BODY:
Nicole Robin Shidler and Vincent Thomas Sampson were married last evening by Rabbi Gershon Fisher at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Calif.
Mrs. Sampson, 28, is a project director for Moving Beyond Cancer, a study that focuses on the long-term care of breast cancer patients. It is conducted at the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington. She graduated magna cum laude from the University of California at San Diego and received a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from George Washington University. 
 Mr. Sampson, 32, is legislative counsel at UWC-Strategic Services on Unemployment and Workers' Compensation, a trade organization in Washington that lobbies on behalf of businesses. He graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles and received a J.D. degree from Santa Clara University, as well as a master's degree in labor and employment law from Georgetown. He is the son of Irene Sampson and the late William James Sampson.
The couple met at a November 1995 mixer in Washington for University of California alumni. "Nicole had incredible presence," Mr. Sampson recalled. Not wanting to seem too forward, he invited her to a party he was organizing. "It was just a ruse to get her phone number," he said. "I don't really organize happy hours."
As Ms. Shidler and Mr. Sampson began to date, they found they shared a bond as Californians in Washington. "But there's really no career common ground, and we like it that way," he said. Ms. Shidler said, "I teach him some medicine, he teaches me some politics."
When Ms. Shidler, a daughter of Linda and Joseph Shidler of Agoura Hills, Calif., moved away in 1998 to spend an internship year in Philadelphia, Mr. Sampson proposed on the steps of the Capitol. It was an unseasonably mild November night.
"He told me to turn around, close my eyes and turn around again," Ms. Shidler recalled. "I opened my eyes. I saw stars. I saw the Washington monument. I saw Vince on one knee." She understood, or heard, little else.
She said: "For the longest time all I could remember was, 'Blah blah Nicole blah blah Nicole blah blah. Will you marry me?' The only sad thing about it was I had to go back to Philadelphia to finish my internship."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
10 Employees. No Headquarters. $45 Million Payoff.

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
FOR its first two and a half years, the Valent Software Corporation was a most virtual of companies. The chief executive lived in Massachusetts, the president was parked in Utah, the engineering team was based in Ohio and a handful of other employees worked out of their dining rooms and basements. The "workplace" consisted largely of cell-phone calls, e-mail correspondence and meetings in hotel lobbies.
Except for a small office in Woburn, Mass., that it rented primarily as a place to receive mail, Valent did not have a brick of property to its name. 
 But earlier this month, this 10-employee company found itself worth $45 million in stock when it was bought by Lycos Inc., a leading Internet portal with some 900 employees. And Lycos, which will use Valent's technology to expand its network of online clubs, did not seem to care one iota about Valent's incorporeal existence.
"We value the product, the number of users and the revenue stream; that's what matters to us," said Ron Sege, executive vice president of Lycos, which is based in Waltham, Mass., and has acquired nine businesses since 1998.
By limiting staff size and keeping down overhead costs, more and more start-ups are following the same no-frills recipe for being bought out, said Charlene Li, a media analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
"When I talk to these small companies, quite a few of them in the back pocket say, 'No, we don't want to go I.P.O., we just want to be acquired by an America Online, a Yahoo,' " she said. "They are trying to be low cost. Until they really need the space, they just work out of the basement."
Almost from Day 1, the goal was to "get acquired," acknowledged J. Scott Benson, the former chief of Valent, who was instrumental in brokering the Lycos deal. Early on, he had Lycos in his sights.
"Lycos is an acquisition engine," he said.
And Lycos was happy to oblige. Mr. Sege said it was interested in Valent's product as a tool for its own growth.
Despite their makeshift offices, Valent's founders were not wet-behind-the-ears entrepreneurs. The idea for Valent came from Leigh Turner, former director of Internet engineering at CompuServe, who in the fall of 1997 told Mr. Benson, a business acquaintance, about his plan for a service that would help companies communicate internally. Mr. Benson had already found considerable success as a founder of Software.com, an e-mail services and software provider. To direct operations, they called in Anthony Antonuccio, a veteran of computer start-ups including Vivo Software Inc., a videoconferencing business, who had made his first million by the time he was 30, a decade ago.
They decided that the Valent intranet idea was more marketable as an Internet services platform for creating virtual communities, or "clubs." The technology would allow Web users with common interests like sports or gardening to communicate through instant messages, online chats and photo albums. Valent's founders said they used $500,000 to $600,000 in start-up money, some from their own savings and some from individual investors.
The company sold the service to several clients, including the portal NeoPlanet.com, but Lycos quickly became Valent's largest partner.
Mr. Turner lived in Columbus, Ohio; Mr. Antonuccio in Park City, Utah; and Mr. Benson in Hopkinton, Mass. With all of them in their 30's and 40's and settled in their communities, none was eager to move, so the company stayed decentralized. The three men worked out of their homes, and so did the seven people they brought on board. "We had meetings in my dining room," said Ann-Marie Sweeney, a senior engineer who worked out of her house in Acton, Mass. "There were big sheets of white paper taped all over my porch one day, the white board set up in my den."
She knew some colleagues only as voices on the phone. "There are still guys out in Ohio that I haven't met, that I've been working with for two years," she said. "But it always felt like a real company, because everyone did have the expertise. They knew how to communicate."
To keep in touch, they used their own product, creating a Valent "club" online where they would hold meetings, chat or share files.
"Since our product was community communication tools, a lot of times we wound up using the tools to replicate what it would be like in an office," said Mark G. Staton, Valent's marketing analyst, who worked out of his apartment in Cambridge. "Suddenly Anthony would instant-message me -- 'Hey, what's going on with this?' -- like he had knocked on the door of my office."
Mr. Staton, who at 27 is the youngest employee, said his bosses and co-workers were disciplined enough to make the unstructured situation work. And he was impressed that "even though everyone worked really hard, everyone kept the priorities of their lives in order."
For most, those priorities included finger painting and nap time. Ms. Sweeney would often write code after putting her 5-month-old son and 3-year-old daughter to bed. Ted Weiss, who handled distribution and partnership, convinced his wife to convert her wardrobe room into office space for him. That way, he was just a few minutes from the day care center their son and daughter attend. All but three employees have young children, so flexible schedules were a given.
"All we were after were results," Mr. Weiss said. "We didn't care if someone was coding at 2 in the morning."
That did bring the desired results, and, ultimately, the deal with Lycos.
Spending $45 million in stock for a software service is not surprising, said Ms. Li, the Forrester analyst. She noted that Excite@Home, a Lycos competitor, recently paid $1 billion to acquire Bluemountain.com, the electronic greeting card company. Just as Excite bought that free online service to increase traffic to its site, she said, Lycos expects that expanding its clubs will get users to stick to its network.
"The problem is that it is very difficult to monetize stickiness," Ms. Li said. "The real money these days is to get people to shop. The connection between clubs and shopping isn't as strong as it potentially could be."
R. BENSON would not say exactly what each Valent employee gained in the $45 million stock deal, but he did say that all had equity in the company, and that most are now at least a million dollars richer.
Though Mr. Benson has again been bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, this time to run his own record label, eight of his nine Valent colleagues have signed on with Lycos. They will continue to run the club service, this time all together, from an earthbound workplace: Lycos's headquarters in the Boston suburb of Waltham.
While the workers in Ohio are still scouting for Boston-area homes, five from the Valent team are already commuting to the Lycos office -- including Mr. Antonuccio, who pulled up his Utah stakes.
As empowering as working independently was, Mr. Antonuccio doesn't see himself jetting off to start another company anytime soon. "If you asked my wife that, she'd hang right up on you," he said. "This was a planned objective, to add a little more normalcy to our lives."
For Mr. Staton, who worked for a large advertising firm before heading to Valent, going back to "Cubeville" has brought "culture shock." Ms. Sweeney still works at home on Fridays but says she misses not being able to work in her pajamas all the time.
It may take a while for their families to get used to the new schedule, said Mr. Antonuccio. "This is the first time I've had an office since 1997," he said. "My kids are really wondering where Daddy goes now every day."

In Atlanta, Both a Feast and a Famine of Jobs

BYLINE: By ANNE BERRYMAN 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
THE layoff announcements have seemed to come in waves in the last month.
The Lockheed Martin Corporation said it would cut 800 workers at its local plant beyond the 2,000 who lost their jobs last year. BellSouth announced that it was eliminating 1,300 local jobs. Worst of all, Coca-Cola, long a bulwark of the economic and social scene here, said that it was laying off 2,500 workers -- 40 percent of its Atlanta work force. 
 In a front-page article, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution asked, "Is something going wrong?" The question echoed worries that Atlanta's economy was in deep trouble.
A wide consensus of economists, government officials and business leaders here contend, however, that if Atlanta's economy has run into a rough patch, it is not because there is a shortage of jobs. On the contrary, they say, there is a lack of people to fill them, particularly in technology.
The job cuts have received wide publicity. But in reality they are not having a big impact on the job market, with unemployment hovering just above 2.5 percent. The job losses make a splash, said David Echols, a statistician at the Georgia Department of Labor, "but the ripple is never going to make it to the shoreline."
Donald Ratajczak, director of the Georgia Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta, said: "It's going to hurt. But we think that Atlanta will still be a significant job generator for 2000."
Last year, Atlanta created 113,600 jobs, more than any other major metropolitan area in the nation. By comparison, metropolitan New York, defined as New York City plus Putnam, Rockland and Westchester Counties, created 105,600 jobs in 1999, said Michael L. Wald, regional economist for the United States Department of Labor in the Southeast. New York City alone created 92,100 jobs.
In Atlanta, 15,000 technology workers are needed, said Sam A. Williams, president of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, even though the "dot-coms and telecommunications companies in Atlanta added more than 30,000 workers" last year.
"We're talent starved," he added.
So even with the layoffs, the chamber is running advertisements in college newspapers at Rutgers, Harvard and New York Universities, as well as others around the nation. It is also reaching out to students with its own Web site. The ads beckon the young to fast-paced fun and work in Atlanta, where they can "live in the current."
The corporate layoffs, however, have not been the only recent negative publicity for the city. Atlanta's battle with urban sprawl has also been the subject of news reports. So has the seamier side of local night life, after two stabbing deaths here the morning after last month's Super Bowl resulted in murder charges against three men, including Ray Lewis, the professional football star.
State and local officials are keeping a distance from the employment issues. Gov. Roy E. Barnes is concerned about the hardship for workers making transitions to other positions, said Henry Thomassen, the governor's economic adviser. "There is, of course, nothing we can do about it," Mr. Thomassen said.
Mayor Bill Campbell has issued no public statements concerning the job cuts, his spokesman confirmed.
Randy Cardoza, commissioner for the Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism, said each company had "good solid reasons for doing what they did."
"It's a little hard to interfere with the decisions that corporate America has any right to make," Mr. Cardoza said. "Everybody from a personal standpoint is very sorry for the people who are losing their jobs."
Not all of the workers will have skills to match those needed for technology positions, he said.
FOR many laid-off employees at Coca-Cola, this is an extremely painful time. Few have been willing to talk publicly about it.
"All my friends are being let go," said one employee who has worked for the company for 20 years and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
She worries about a laid-off worker in his late 40's. "Who's going to hire him?" she asked. She also worries about women who have become their family's primary breadwinners. "They have $200,000 to $300,000 homes and they don't have jobs," she said.
Tim Jacobi, 32, laid off on Tuesday after two years as a Coca-Cola marketing manager, was more sanguine. "I want to stay in Atlanta because of my wife," he said. "I'm hoping to find a decent job here. So, we'll see. It's a strong economy. If ever there were a time to be laid off, it's now."

A Revival of Older Suburbs As Ethnic Businesses Take Hold

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN; Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy. His column on the Main Street economy appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: grassrts@nytimes.com

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.

 BODY:
FOR years, the old central core of this aging Long Island suburb seemed in permanent decline. Yet today, the once nearly deserted shopping areas have become a beehive of activity, much of it fueled by newcomers from Central America.
"When we opened 10 years ago, we were practically the only one," recalled Roberto Rivas, at his crowded Main Street restaurant, Antojitos Salvadorenos. "There wasn't much going on. Now people are opening stores around here." 
 Such activity is a boon for Hempstead. And it is representative of a revival taking place in some old shopping districts in the wave of suburbs that trace their lineage to the building boom after World War II. Once prosperous commercial hubs, some of these areas suffered major declines in the 1970's and 80's, victims of competition from new shopping centers, an aging population and the continued push of affluent whites further to the periphery.
Of course, the current commerce prevalent in downtown Hempstead -- Latin record stores, a dance club, travel agencies, ethnic eateries -- will not remind old-timers of the glory days of the 1950's, when the area was the upscale retail jewel for the burgeoning, and virtually all white, suburbs of central Nassau County. Yet the Hispanic-led surge does represent a marked improvement over more recent times.
The Central Americans "are very entrepreneurial and opening lots of small businesses," said Glen Spiritus, commissioner for community development for the Village of Hempstead.
"The village is changing," he added. "We will never be what we were -- the shopping center for all Long Island -- but we're better."
A wave of immigrants from Central America began arriving in Hempstead in the late 1970's and the 1980's -- some, like the Salvadorans, to escape civil war and others to escape poverty. Like immigrants from elsewhere a generation earlier, they found an economic niche: working in restaurants and taking care of the lawns and the children of people in more affluent neighborhoods nearby. With their earnings, some managed to open businesses; some became customers.
The Hispanics, Mr. Spiritus said, helped reduce the retail vacancy rate in downtown Hempstead to roughly 10 percent, from nearly 70 percent in the early 1990's. In fact, said Emilio Ruiz, publisher of La Tribuna Hispana, a local weekly, the village now serves as a kind of commercial and cultural focal point for other, smaller communities on Long Island, whose Hispanic population is estimated at 200,000 to 250,000.
Similar revivals have taken place in other older suburbs, including the heavily Asian and Latino communities around sprawling Sun Belt cities like Houston, Dallas, Atlanta and Los Angeles.
The new ethnic diversity marks a sharp contrast to the immediate postwar era, when these suburbs were bastions of homogeneity. From 1950 to 1970, a period of intense suburban development, 95 percent of suburbanites were white. "The people you want for neighbors are here," noted an advertisement for one Long Island development in the 1960's.
The demographic shift started in the 1970's, when African-Americans began moving in large numbers to the suburbs. In the next two decades, middle-class American-born Hispanics and Asians as well as upwardly mobile recent immigrants surged in, particularly into the older, closer-in suburbs. Today, nearly 51 percent of Asians, 43 percent of all Hispanics and 32 percent of African-Americans live in suburbs.
The immigrants have moved to suburbia, rather than to the cities, for many of the same reasons that others before them did: cheaper land, more open space, better schools and business opportunities, said Robert Bruegmann, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago who has studied suburban development. "It's the classic American pattern."
This development is particularly notable in regions surrounding cites like Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, Houston and Miami, where immigration has been heaviest.
Perhaps no place has changed more rapidly than the San Fernando Valley, which mushroomed into a major bedroom community in Los Angeles during the postwar boom years. In the 1960's, the valley was roughly 90 percent white. By 1997, according to county estimates, Latinos accounted for roughly 41 percent of the valley population, and Asians 9 percent.
As it has in Hempstead, the movement of immigrants, particularly Latinos, has transformed several shopping areas in the San Fernando Valley into districts that cater to the new population. In many cases, this has meant large new investments like the Gigante supermarket, a 55,000-square-foot, ultra-modern facility in the working-class Arleta neighborhood.
Jose de Jesus Legaspi, a developer who works with Gigante, one of Mexico's largest grocery chains, said the company was increasingly placing its stores not in traditional inner-city barrios like East Los Angeles but in suburbs like Arleta, Buena Park and Walnut.
"People have to realize that the Asian and Latino markets now are primarily suburban," Mr. Legaspi said. "When you have 3.2 million Latinos in Los Angeles County, you can't expect them all to live in the inner city."
THE rush of new businesses has generally been good for these communities, though Mr. Legaspi and other marketing experts are experiencing more competition for the new suburbanite dollar.
In Hempstead, for example, where membership in the Salvadoran Chamber of Commerce has grown from 10 a decade ago to more than 200, Mr. Rivas's restaurant must compete for diners with scores of newcomers.
"It used to be we were the only ones in the market," he said. "Now there's a lot more competition from other Salvadoran people. It makes you have to work harder."

HEADLINE: The Two Faces of Bushwick;
A Troubled Brooklyn Neighborhood Is Mending. But Its Leaders Are Feuding Over the Size of the Gains and What to Do Next.

BYLINE: By JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
THREE paces down the front walkway, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez stopped to admire the two-story brick house before him. The home was one of the first his social service organization helped build in Bushwick a decade ago. Since then, he has spurred the construction of hundreds more new houses.
"To me it's beautiful," said Mr. Lopez, a towering man with the sound of Brooklyn in his voice. "You might say it's not Manhattan, but you should have seen what was here before." 
 Another day, inside a church school less than a mile away, Msgr. John J. Powis opened a classroom door and saw a different Bushwick. Five preschoolers, each with a different learning disability, were playing with blocks and crayons. Father Powis boasted of the teachers' ability to ready the children for kindergarten, but he despaired of their future.
"They get all prepared," said Father Powis, who speaks in a soft voice and often wears a sad smile. "And then they get into the public schools and they lose it all."
A decade-long infusion of new housing and a significant drop in crime has formed the foundation of what many neighborhood political leaders call the Bushwick renaissance. But amid the construction projects, an intense discussion has begun over how much Bushwick has really improved and how it should move forward. In many ways, Mr. Lopez and Father Powis represent opposite poles of the debate.
To supporters, Mr. Lopez, 59, a longtime civic and political organizer, is the chief architect of the renaissance. Through his chairmanship of the Assembly's housing committee, his strategic alliances with the Giuliani administration and the sprawling social service organization he founded in 1973, the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, he has built, renovated or sponsored 1,200 homes and apartments in the last decade.
If Mr. Lopez is the architect of the renaissance, Father Powis, 66, has shouldered the role of chief critic. For the last decade he has served as pastor of the century-old St. Barbara's Roman Catholic Church, one of the most influential institutions in the neighborhood. Father Powis, who speaks fluent Spanish, has rebuilt the congregation as Mr. Lopez rebuilt housing, raising its weekend attendance from 800 to more than 1,400. He has also brought several nonprofit groups to the neighborhood. These groups provide a range of social services and organize residents on issues like school reform.
On one point virtually everyone agrees: life has improved in Bushwick, a poor, largely black and Hispanic neighborhood nestled between Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant just across the Queens border from Ridgewood. No other neighborhood suffered more when a citywide blackout in July 1977 ignited an outburst of arson and looting. When the embers cooled three years later, Bushwick had lost 20 percent of its housing, a third of its population and nearly half its businesses.
Today, most of the tracts of charred, vacant land have given way to new homes. Between 1990 and 1997, the neighborhood had a net gain of 738 new housing units, a number likely to increase in this year's census count. As in the rest of the city, crime has dropped sharply, as a result of a strong national economy, less crack cocaine use and more aggressive policing. In the last six years, murders are down 72 percent and robberies 58 percent.
But for every gain, a problem lingers. Bushwick has the borough's highest number of children on public assistance and its second highest rate of hospitalization for asthma, and the city's highest rate of childhood lead poisoning. The graduation rate at Bushwick High School is 35 percent, compared with 61 percent for the borough.
With these competing visions as a backdrop, Father Powis and Mr. Lopez have been at odds for more than a decade.
"They don't see eye to eye," said Milagros Negron, a Bushwick resident who has worked for two community organizations. "Vito sees it like he's done all this wonderful work, and Father Powis lives here and doesn't see a change. Wherever you go, you see the friction between them."
The dispute between the men, which at its core is a philosophical difference over how best to help people in need, began over housing and now extends to a long list of issues. Mr. Lopez believes that two-family homes are best for Bushwick. Father Powis supports one-family homes. Mr. Lopez says the police have removed many drug dealers from the streets. Father Powis says the nature of the drugs may have changed, but they still destroy families.
The rivalry is so intense that there are even two local newspapers espousing the two men's view. The People's Voice, founded last September by Father Powis and a community group he brought to the neighborhood, Make the Road by Walking, has praised reform efforts by groups allied with St. Barbara's and criticized the local school superintendent, the police and Mr. Lopez.
Ridgewood Bushwick publishes its own newspaper, The Bushwick Observer, which focuses on the improvements in the community, often crediting them to Mr. Lopez and his allies.
Mr. Lopez believes that Father Powis's critical stance threatens those gains by undermining local morale.
"I believe the neighborhood is starting to turn around," he said. "Does it need improvement? Yes. But the way to do that is not to say everything is no good."
Father Powis takes issue with the idea that examining problems will hurt the neighborhood.
"We are not putting down Bushwick," he said. "We are trying to pull it up."
 
An Old-Fashioned Boss With Big Plans and High Aims
 Mr. Lopez's 6-foot-4-inch frame appears to fill any room he enters. Where his arms do not reach, his booming voice does. His tone and message often shift abruptly. One moment he is the former social worker, eager to discuss how to help the poor. But with little provocation he is the demanding political boss, condemning his detractors or soliciting agreement from supporters.
Mr. Lopez was born in Bensonhurst, took a graduate degree in social work from Yeshiva University, and opened a city-run center for the elderly in Bushwick in 1971. Two years later, he founded Ridgewood Bushwick to provide services the center for the elderly could not offer.
By the time Mr. Lopez and his wife, Joan, from whom he is now divorced, arrived in Bushwick, the neighborhood had begun its transformation from the city's largest Italian neighborhood to a predominantly black and Hispanic one. Mr. Lopez, who has two adult children, is primarily of Italian descent; his surname comes from a Spanish grandfather. When he moved to Bushwick, Mr. Lopez spoke no Spanish, and even today his fluency in the language is limited.
Mr. Lopez was a long shot when he entered the 1984 Democratic primary in pursuit of the Assembly seat being vacated by Victor Robles. His surname helped, but more valuable were the two organizations he controlled, Ridgewood Bushwick and Brooklyn Unidos, his political club.
Because of redistricting, Mr. Lopez now represents only half of Bushwick. The rest of his district is in Williamsburg, where he now lives. Nonetheless, he is the neighborhood's most influential politician, and by virtue of the growth of Bushwick Unidos and Ridgewood Bushwick, one of the most powerful men in Brooklyn. Mr. Lopez has also built power through an eclectic mix of strategic alliances with politicians like Mayor Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and Assemblyman Clarence Norman, the Brooklyn Democratic leader.
Later this year, Mr. Lopez will decide whether to run for public advocate in 2001. Although the office has little power, Mr. Lopez said was is drawn to it because he felt he had accomplished many of his goals in Bushwick, and that the advocate's office had a broader constituency.
His goals have also been influenced by his health. In 1993, two forms of leukemia were diagnosed, and his doctors gave him three years to live. The cancer is in remission, Mr. Lopez says, but chemotherapy has weakened his immune system, leaving him susceptible to other illnesses.
"I have a certain amount of time given to me," Mr. Lopez said. "I'd like to get as much done as I can in the next few years."
If he runs for citywide office, Bushwick's renaissance will be the foundation of his candidacy. On a recent day, he gave a guided before-and-after tour of the neighborhood to make his case for its rejuvenation.
As his van approached a vacant lot, newly fenced but already filling with rubbish, Mr. Lopez ordered the driver to slow down. "That's what Bushwick was, a thousand of these lots that you see here," he said.
Two blocks away on George Street is the home of Lena Rivera, a school bus escort who is a leader of the local block association. The homes on her block were built in 1989, the first erected by the New York City Housing Partnership in conjunction with Ridgewood Bushwick. When Ms. Rivera first moved in, she said, the neighborhood was overwhelmed by crime. Now she is no longer afraid to go out at night, and friends who had left are returning.
"We need a lot more housing just like this," Ms. Rivera said. "This is the best thing that happened to Bushwick."
From there, Mr. Lopez's van drove past condominiums renovated by Ridgewood Bushwick, past two of four federally subsidized apartment buildings for the elderly, past the site of a planned $6 million youth center and a $40 million nursing home under construction, soon to be completed. He concluded his tour at the headquarters of Ridgewood Bushwick at 217 Wyckoff Avenue. According to the most recent available public records, the organization has an annual budget of $6 million, employs 241 people and serves 6,000 individuals each year.
Although home building is the heart of the group's effort, the organization runs several other programs, including legal aid for tenants, apartment winterization, adult education, after-school tutoring and many services for the elderly, including the Christmas Day delivery of 2,700 meals.
"The greatest accomplishment, besides the new housing, is the heightened sense of morale," said Angela M. Battaglia, who heads the group's home-building program. "The people feel united. It's the feeling of, 'I saw the neighborhood burn and I saw it come back.' "
 
A Priest Finds His Ministry On Hard-Scrabble Streets
When Father Powis was ordained in 1959, he said, the Catholic Church did little to prepare priests to serve poor urban parishes, the places in which he has ministered for nearly his entire career. He spent 5 years in Fort Greene and 25 years in Brownsville. In 1989 he was assigned to a parish in the more affluent City Line neighborhood of Brooklyn, where he was born and raised, but he believed his talents could be put to better use in a needier community. So he went to St. Barbara's, where he has been ever since.
Over his black shirt and clerical collar he wears a flannel shirt. It keeps out the cold and makes his parishioners feel at ease. When he speaks, his voice drops almost to a whisper as he comes to an important point, forcing his listeners to pay attention.
But Father Powis's demeanor disguises the role he carved for himself in Bushwick. In the mid-90's he filled the balcony of City Hall with his neighbors in a successful protest against a city plan to eliminate street fire boxes. In 1998, he marched his parishioners to Central Avenue and Menahan Street every Sunday for three months to demand a traffic light, which the city eventually installed. During Easter week, his parishioners parade through the streets acting out the Stations of the Cross; when the man in the role of Jesus stumbles, it is in front of a house where drugs are sold.
"We try to connect religion with real life," Father Powis said. "Religion is not an opiate. You have to be involved and make a change in the community."
He said he admires much of what Ridgewood Bushwick has done, but he sees Mr. Lopez as a man who has used his organization to build up a Tammany-style political machine. Those who receive Ridgewood Bushwick's help, Father Powis says, are expected to support Mr. Lopez, his allies and their civic endeavors.
"Why does he feel he has to control everything?" Father Powis asked.
Mr. Lopez denied that implication, although he acknowledged that the organization encouraged its clients to participate in the community. "If those people at Ridgewood Bushwick wanted to, they could bring 2,500 people together," he said. "They could generate three or four thousand votes. And they have done that repeatedly."
Father Powis also insisted that the neighborhood needs institutions and leaders independent of Ridgewood Bushwick and Mr. Lopez. And Father Powis has inspired an emerging cadre of other dedicated leaders to get involved with neighborhood issues.
"Father Powis was the first activist I ever knew, although I didn't know it was activism then," said Julissa Gonzalez, 17, one of the first female altar servers in St. Barbara's and now a youth organizer for Make the Road by Walking. "He just wants what is right for the community."
Make the Road was founded in 1997 by two New York University Law School graduates, Andrew Friedman and Oona Chatterjee. Father Powis helped bring the pair to Bushwick and gave them temporary space in St. Barbara's until they moved to a Grove Street storefront the following year.
Make the Road has 11 employees and a projected budget of $500,000, almost double last year's because of increased grants from private foundations, Mr. Friedman said. Last year the group offered 2,000 people legal counseling and served 800 at its food pantry.
In addition to those services, Make the Road spends much of its time organizing residents to help themselves. It formed a tenants' group that has sponsored cleanups of vacant lots and protests for more parks. A committee of Spanish-speaking women organized by Make the Road has lobbied federal officials for better translation services at welfare offices and hospitals.
"If you love somewhere, what you need to do is what people do with their children," Mr. Friedman said. "You work to make them stronger, better and more vital."
 
A Long-Standing Rivalry Intensified by Press Volleys
 Although the ill feeling between Mr. Lopez and Father Powis is of long standing, the newspaper published by Make the Road has intensified the rivalry. The second issue of The People's Voice in December contained a long editorial that attacked Mr. Lopez and his allies for "the stranglehold that they have in this community."
The Bushwick Observer, published by Ridgewood Bushwick, touts neighborhood improvements like the construction of a new park and other achievements of Mr. Lopez. By contrast, The People's Voice has kind words for reform efforts led by Father Powis's allies and criticizes institutions the other publication routinely praises. The founders of The People's Voice assert that Mr. Lopez has focused too narrowly on housing and the elderly.
"There are new buildings," Mr. Friedman said. "That's a terrific accomplishment, maybe. But that that's not what it is about. That's not enough. It's sickening how far from enough that is."
That assessment has clearly annoyed Mr. Lopez, who in conversation mangles Make the Road by Walking's name, perhaps intentionally, calling it Walk Don't Run.
"They should roll up their sleeves and build some housing," he said.
It was over the issue of housing that the rivalry between the two men began a decade ago. Father Powis wanted to bring to Bushwick the Nehemiah housing program -- a program to build affordable single-family houses in poor neighborhoods -- that he had helped start in Brownsville.
Mr. Lopez said the Nehemiah program required large tracks of vacant land, which were unavailable in Bushwick. Instead, he supported the New York City Partnership for Housing's program. Partnership homes can be built on any vacant city-owned lot.
Father Powis believes that the Partnership houses require too many subsidies, cost too much for many working people, and drive up rents on unimproved buildings nearby. The houses currently being sponsored by Ridgewood Bushwick cost $235,000 to build and are sold for $185,000.
The two men also differ on crime and drugs. In recent years the drug trade in Bushwick has shifted from crack to marijuana, and as a result violent crime has declined. But illegal drug use continues.
Mr. Lopez acknowledges that. But he ridicules Father Powis's portrayal of Bushwick as a place where drug dealers' bullets are heard through the night.
"Whatever you want to think of the neighborhood, crime is now down and people want to stay in the community," Mr. Lopez said. "No one lies with those statistics."
Father Powis, by contrast, contends that the drug trade remains strong and continues to devastate the community, encouraging students to drop out of school and become petty dealers. A study by John Jay College of Criminal Justice shows that among Bushwick residents between 18 and 24, 45 percent of blacks and 35 percent of Latinos use marijuana regularly. Despite the thousands of drug arrests each year, Father Powis said the police need to do far more to control the problem.
"So crack is down, but drugs in general are not," he said. "Kids still depend on drugs for their livelihood."
If an area of partial agreement exists between Father Powis and Mr. Lopez, it is over the state of the schools. Both men agree they desperately need improvement, and both have helped create after-school and summer programs for students. But they disagree over who bears responsibility for the generally dismal achievement scores for children in the district. Father Powis says Mr. Lopez should use his political influence to fight to remove the current district superintendent, Felix Vasquez. Mr. Lopez says the issue is not the superintendent, but the neighborhood's poverty.
Some Bushwick residents say that certain issues get lost in the argument between the two men.
"I think they are both about building their own empires," said Rick Curtis, an associate professor at John Jay College who has studied drug use in Bushwick for a decade. "I don't know if they are concerned about the neighborhood as a whole, or just their constituency or their parishioners."
But Dr. Curtis may hold a minority view. Most Bushwick residents seem to think that either Father Powis or Mr. Lopez offers the best strategy for helping the neighborhood.
Jose Olmo, 41, a behavior specialist at a school near Tampa, Fla., left Bushwick last year after 10 years of leading several nonprofit groups in the neighborhood and watching the two spar. Mr. Olmo is an ally of Father Powis who believes that both men's resolves remain firm.
"I really see these guys as two heavyweight champions who are boxing it out for 15 rounds," Mr. Olmo said. "Now it's the 14th round. We will have to see who has the strength to last."

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES;
Making the Most of That Stock-Option Gold

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN 

 BODY:
THOSE poor dot-commies. Not only do they work themselves to the bone, but they also face the ominous task of paying taxes on all their hot stock options.
Of course, not every option holder is a millionaire. After all, it isn't easy to pick a start-up whose stock will take off when it goes public, enabling insiders to exercise options for pennies that will be immediately worth megadollars. 
 And for those who have chosen their companies well, it can still be a daunting task to figure out what their holdings are worth in a very volatile market, when to exercise their options and how to keep taxes from gobbling up their gains.
Consider the experience of Abhi Shelat, who at 24 has exercised two kinds of options that have become widespread in the New Economy: incentive stock options, intended to motivate executives to make sure the company does well, and nonstatutory stock options, which may be awarded by new companies in lieu of cash compensation.
Directly out of Harvard, where he earned a degree in computer science in 1997, Mr. Shelat was the first person to be hired by E.piphany Inc. (then called Epiphany Marketing Software), which develops software for managing customer relationships. Two and a half years later, he is worth several million dollars -- "I don't want to give a fixed value," he said -- and is a graduate student at M.I.T.
E.piphany, based in San Mateo, Calif., went public last September at $16 a share, and its stock soared to $275 in just three months. It is now trading at $187.
Mr. Shelat was hired at $72,000 a year and was granted incentive stock options, or I.S.O.'s, that would have allowed him to buy stock in the company at 6 cents a share. Originally, that would have given him 0.45 percent of the company, but that stake was diluted when the company issued additional stock.
During his tenure -- he quit in February 1999 -- he received two additional stock option grants allowing him to buy shares at 15 and 25 cents apiece. These strike prices, as they are known, differed from those in his first options because, in order to receive the best tax treatment when an I.S.O. is exercised, the strike price cannot be less than the fair market value at the time the options are granted.
"With an I.S.O., there are no tax ramifications on the granting of the options or when you exercise the option and buy the stock," said Prof. Patrick Colabella, a certified public accountant and chairman of the Global Institute for Taxation at St. John's University in Jamaica, Queens, which researches new taxation methods nationwide.
Rather, taxes will be due after the stock is sold. If the stock is not sold until two years from the date the option was granted or one year from the date it was exercised, whichever is later, any capital gain will be treated as long term, subject to a maximum tax of 20 percent at the federal level. "Should you sell the stock before that time, you'll have to treat the gain as compensation, or ordinary income," Professor Colabella said.
So anyone who believes that his stock will keep climbing has a strong tax incentive to delay selling. But those who fear that their highfliers may be coming down to earth may want to sell quickly -- even though that means paying taxes as high as 39.6 percent at the federal level.
The tough choices do not end there, Professor Colabella said. Once options are exercised, the difference between the strike price and the fair market value of the stock is considered income for purposes of the alternative minimum tax, which is intended to make sure that affluent taxpayers do not take advantage of too many tax breaks. Under the A.M.T., the definition of income is more inclusive than it is for the regular tax system, and certain deductions are denied. The A.M.T. rate for upper-income taxpayers is 28 percent.
"At this point you own the shares but have not realized any cash gains," Professor Colabella said. "So although you don't think you owe any tax, you very well might. And if you're in a borderline situation, you'll unexpectedly pay an A.M.T. on all or part of the unrealized gain."
With that potential pitfall in mind, Mr. Shelat took steps to minimize his tax liability.
In his original agreement with the company, it would take four years for all his options to "vest," meaning that he would retain ownership even if he left the company; one-eighth would vest every six months. But E.piphany allowed him to exercise 75 percent of his options after the company went public. Because that exceeded the vested percentage, Mr. Shelat signed a repurchase agreement that allowed the company to buy back any stock he purchased with the unvested portion.
Professor Colabella said the new agreement "spreads out the A.M.T. impact" for Mr. Shelat.
Finally, Mr. Shelat submitted what is known as an 83b election form (the name referring to a section of tax law) to the Internal Revenue Service, informing it that he would rather be taxed on the difference between the strike price and the fair market value in the current tax year than in the year in which he decided to sell the shares. That meant that he would be subject to a higher tax rate, but he hopes that it will be on a lower overall gain than if he held on for a long time and the shares soared.
AFTER leaving E.piphany last year, Mr. Shelat worked as a consultant for a friend's company and was given the second type of option -- nonstatutory options, known as N.S.O.'s, which he exercised soon afterward. Those options were taxable as compensation when they were exercised.
"The whole tax thing is very confusing, but it's possible to figure out," Mr. Shelat said. He prepared his return last year using Turbotax, the Intuit software program, and he intends to do so again this year. And he said he had learned the tax consequences of exercising his options and selling or holding the stock "from older people who have gone through the same kinds of things and the I.R.S. Web site."
In total, Mr. Shelat said, "I think I paid around $18,000" in taxes in 1998. "This year, I expect to pay a lot more from capital gains and from the N.S.O. options," he added.
Referring to a Hindu goddess of prosperity, Mr. Shelat said: "Laksmi smiled on me during my brief foray in the Valley rat race. If I owned 0.45 percent" of E.piphany today, "it would be worth nearly $24 million." Now, he said, his holdings are "greater than several million dollars, and less than $24 million."
Mr. Shelat, who grew up in Austin, Tex., is happy to be back in school and not have to worry about finances for a while. He won a National Science Foundation fellowship that paid his tuition and a stipend at M.I.T., and he bought a house in the Beacon Hill section of Boston. He lives frugally, although he plans to buy his mother a new car; he is quick to point out that he has not yet treated himself to a television set nor indulged his penchant for Zegna suits.
"The best outcome from my E.piphany detour is not the money, but rather that I figured out how to be fulfilled in my life," he said. In addition to teaching and researching in computer science, he plans to make a documentary film about diplomats, run a marathon in less than seven-minute miles, work on a Spike Lee film and learn how to build Shaker-style furniture. "The secret," he said, "is to find something that you really just love to do and pursue it with utopian exuberance and reckless abandon."

HEADLINE: The Tax Maze Begins Here. No,Here. No . . .

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
MUCH of the tax agenda that Republicans promised in the "Contract With America" has been enacted into law in the last five years. But as Newt Gingrich, the contract's author, is fond of saying: There is no free lunch.
The contract's new tax breaks for middle-class parents, investors, the self-employed and others have come at a price that millions of Americans are discovering as they engage in the annual ritual of filing their income tax returns: a complexity that might make even Rube Goldberg indignant. 
 Federal tax laws and regulations filled 40,500 pages when the Republicans took charge of Capitol Hill in 1995, according to CCH Inc., a publisher of tax information. In the last five years, 6,400 pages have been added, CCH said, making the tax laws 16 percent longer. That pace of growth, almost 10 percent faster than in the previous five years, required major revisions of tax forms for individuals.
And the time it takes to fill out a tax return is growing, too. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it will take a taxpayer 35.8 hours to fill out a Form 1040 and Schedules A through D, up from 30.6 hours five years ago and 28.6 hours in 1989.
People with doctoral degrees and even some tax lawyers and accountants say they find themselves stumped by the requirements to qualify for some of the new tax breaks and complete the necessary forms. Indeed, last week, the American Bar Association's tax section, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Tax Executives Institute jointly urged Congress to make tax simplification a priority.
Joseph Harris, a retired professor of neurochemistry at Arizona State University in Tempe, said that for years he and his wife, Irene Dorothy, did their own taxes.
But after Mrs. Harris died in 1998, the professor decided that the tax system's rules on capital gains had become too complex even for his numerically inclined brain.
The I.R.S. instruction booklet, combined with documents sent to him by investment houses, indicated that he had a huge capital gains tax bill on stocks he sold after his wife's death. In fact, no taxes were due, because Arizona is one of nine community property states where, when one spouse dies, the other avoids capital gains on investment gains recorded until the day of the death. Professor Harris's brokerage firms had overlooked that provision in reports to him, and the I.R.S. instructions were unclear.
It took a visit to LaVon Martin, a Phoenix accountant, to straighten out Mr. Harris's Schedule D, the form for reporting capital gains and losses on investments.
"At one time, I thought about becoming a lawyer, so I am not averse to legal thinking," Professor Harris said. "But by the standards of what I was used to trying to understand, the tax law had suddenly become much much more complicated. English is a beautiful language, because you can describe things so elegantly and with such precise shades of meaning that you can make everything fine and sharp, but what I found was muddled."
Much of the complexity is testimony to the political horse-trading by which tax laws get written. After 1997, Schedule D grew from a simple 23-line form into a mind-boggler with 36 lines devoted just to calculating if capital gains must be paid at the higher rates for earned income.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that "much of the complexity was due to compromises Republicans had to make to get President Clinton's signature on their bills."
"President Clinton wanted 'targeted tax relief,' which meant that the tax code became more complicated," he added. "For instance, the Schedule D capital gains form is a direct result of the Clinton White House rejecting our approach that would have made capital gains taxes very simple," by taxing half the gains.
What Mr. Archer calls simplification the White House sees as favors for the rich, resulting in its insistence on rules to phase out many of the tax breaks as incomes rise.
Elliott Manning, a law professor at the University of Miami in Florida, and Lawrence M. Andress, a tax lawyer in Coral Gables, Fla., made an exhaustive study of how these phase-out rules, which critics call "clawbacks," increase the real tax rates that people pay.
The highest statutory rate, 39.6 percent, applies to incomes of more than $288,350. But the highest real rate in 1996, the study found, was 93 percent -- paid not by the rich, but by an individual with income of $27,327 to $32,768 who was 65 to 69 years old, collecting Social Security and working at a low-paying job. Congress is considering repealing reductions in Social Security benefits for retirees who return to work.
"The phase-outs hide the real rates people pay," Professor Manning said.
Taxpayers are not the only ones drowning in complexity. One 1998 law made more than 1,200 changes in the code that governs I.R.S. operations, the agency estimated. Here are some ways that the tax law has grown muddier over the last few years -- and accounts of taxpayers' efforts to cope.
 
Problems With Phase-Outs
A tax credit of $500 per child was the centerpiece of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the most comprehensive of recent tax laws. But instead of a simple tax credit for all parents, something much more complex resulted from negotiations between Congressional Republicans and the Clinton administration.
Families with three or more children cannot fully benefit, because the maximum credit is $1,000. And because the credit can be used only to write income taxes down to zero, a family with two or more children and an income tax bill of less than $1,000 gets only part of the credit.
Many other parents lose, too: the credit begins to phase out for single parents with $75,000 of income and for married couples with $110,000 -- squarely middle-class households in high-cost areas like the urban centers on either coast.
David and Barbara Gordon of Liverpool, N.Y., a suburb of Syracuse, were frustrated to learn from their accountant, Marc Albaum of New York, that the credit wasn't meant for them. The phase-out rules will reduce their credit this year from $1,000 to just $100 -- not much help with the costs of raising David, 11, and his sister Shaina, 9.
"I think it is unfair," said Mrs. Gordon, who is studying for a doctorate in geology at Syracuse University and working as a freelance consultant; her husband is an engineer at Lockheed Martin. "I work as hard for my money as anybody else," she said. "My children are just as important as anyone else's children are."
There are at least 11 education tax breaks, according to H & R Block, including tax-free interest on some United States Savings Bonds and the new Hope and lifetime learning credits, each with its own rules and phase-outs.
In customer surveys, Block found that many people were overwhelmed by the number of options, said Kathy Burlison, Block's manager of tax operations training.
 
I.R.A. Intricacies
Most of Arthur A. Spetter's peers have retired. But at 67, Mr. Spetter still turns up every morning to teach social studies at Adrian Block School in Flushing, Queens -- "even though economically it is costing me money, because I like teaching," he explained.
By collecting a pension and Social Security, Mr. Spetter could have more money in his pocket than he earns after taxes and expenses.
A few years back, he did take advantage of an opportunity to pull his retirement savings out of a state-run plan and roll them into Individual Retirement Accounts.
"Good thing I did that," Mr. Spetter said, "because when Congress said you could covert to a Roth I.R.A. and your earnings would never be taxed again -- and they said you could spread the taxes on the I.R.A. you were converting over four years -- I did it."
A rule in effect only in 1998 allowed people to undo their Roth conversions and then reconvert, as often as they wished. With stocks rising to new heights and then falling as economic turmoil in Asia spread to Russia, Brazil and the Long Term Capital hedge fund, many people switched in and out of Roths -- including Mr. Spetter, who did so a total of five times over the range of his investments.
Why all the switching? Because with a Roth, you pay taxes on your contributions, and then make withdrawals tax free; with a traditional I.R.A., you invest pretax dollars and pay taxes on withdrawals. So as stocks fell, it made sense to withdraw shrunken assets from a Roth, convert them to a traditional I.R.A. and then move back into a Roth.
This was a short-lived instance of complexity in the tax code offering real benefits for taxpayers who could understand and surmount it. But Mr. Spetter's mutual fund company, like many others, was not fully prepared to negotiate the twists and turns of I.R.A. conversions and reconversions, and it sent him and the I.R.S. inaccurate reports that would have cost Mr. Spetter a painful sum, had he not caught the errors.
Mr. Spetter, who studied for an M.B.A. and is certified to teach accounting to high school students, said he complained, but the fund company "never got it straight."
"Finally," he said, "they sent me a check for $500 and told me to go hire a professional to straighten it out."
He could figure what he owed the I.R.S., Mr. Spetter said. But putting it down correctly on his tax return was another matter. So he went to Ed Slott, an accountant in Rockville Centre, N.Y., who publishes a newsletter on retirement accounts.
"Art understood what he owed, but he tried and tried and could not figure out how to make it flow through the tax forms to produce the right number," Mr. Slott said. "When I finally got through this, his number was right, but the process is so mind-boggling that it is sending people like Art with a very good education in accounting to specialists to deal with retirement account problems."
Another of his clients, Joe Ciaccio, a retired teacher in Levittown, N.Y., said he was told by his mutual fund company that he and his wife, Eileen, could each contribute $2,000 annually to a Roth I.R.A., because their income was far below the $150,000 at which married couples begin losing eligibility.
Such advice is wrong, however: A person must have earned income to contribute to a Roth I.R.A., and the couple's income was almost entirely from pensions and Social Security.
"I put $12,000 in over three years, and then Slott tells me you can't do that," said Mr. Ciaccio, who had to withdraw all but $1,800 from their Roths. "When the mutual funds can't keep track of all the rules, there are just too many of them."
 
Health Care Concerns
As an architect, mall owner and now an urban planning consultant, Angelo J. Chiarella is used to working on intricately detailed projects. But he said that even his experience as chairman of Via Health, a nonprofit health care provider that owns four hospitals in Rochester, did not prepare him to understand Medical Savings Accounts.
The accounts became available in 1996. They allow individuals to invest pretax dollars in accounts where the money can grow tax free until it is needed to cover medical expenses.
The Golden Rule Insurance Company of Indianapolis, which sought the legislation, wanted the accounts to cover anyone and with rules that it said would benefit people who were already ill as well as those who were saving to cover future medical bills.
At first blush, Mr. Chiarella thought he might be an ideal candidate for a Medical Savings Account, based on articles he had read that emphasized their value to the self-employed. But the compromises in the law enacted by Congress and signed by President Clinton made his decision very complicated.
"I'm over 65 now and on Medicare," he said, "but Medicare doesn't cover prescription drugs." He figured that he could use one of the new accounts to pay his prescription bills with tax-advantaged dollars.
But the more he learned about the accounts, the more befuddled he became. "I found that the formula for what's deductible, and how much the deductions are worth, is beyond complex," Mr. Chiarella said.
He turned to his accountant, Steven G. Schwartz of Rotenberg & Company in Rochester, for advice.
"Valuing this benefit requires a lot of tax gymnastics," Mr. Schwartz said. "Three different deduction limits apply. Out-of-pocket expenses -- which under the Medical Savings Account are capped at $5,500 -- are deductible, but only after they exceed 7.5 percent of your income. Then there is the insurance premium, which for my client's family would be $3,151, which is 60 percent deductible. And there is the Medical Savings Account contribution, which is 65 percent deductible for my client, because he is self-employed."
Mr. Chiarella had one question: How much would he save if he opened a Medical Savings Account, rather than paying for a policy to fill in gaps in Medicare coverage?
Mr. Schwartz could not answer that question. "From my point of view, the issue became impossible," he said. "There are so many uncertain factors that I have no idea how to make an informed opinion for my client about whether this is a benefit he should take or not."
Mr. Chiarella said he decided to go with his gut and not open an account. 'I don't think it is worth it," he said. "But what I don't understand is why we get a tax law with a series of convoluted rationalizations instead of straightforward policy."
 
I.R.S. Keeps Eye on Earned Income Credit
THE last thing that many middle-class taxpayers may care about when it comes to taxes is the Earned Income Tax Credit, a negative income tax intended to encourage people to work instead of going on welfare.
They might think again: divorce, disability or just a spell of joblessness could put them in line for the credit. But instead of having their tax obligations wiped out or collecting up to $3,888, they might face a protracted struggle with the Internal Revenue Service.
"Many people think that tax complexity applies only to high-income people, but it also affects the poor, especially when family and tax matters come together," said Nina E. Olson, executive director of the Community Tax Law Project in Richmond.
The I.R.S. is under orders from Congress to crack down on abuse of the credit. And the agency is getting so picky that even minor errors on a return, like mixing up the names and Social Security numbers of children, can cause a claim to be rejected.
Just applying for the credit adds complexity for low-income taxpayers. People without children who make less than $50,000 can use Form 1040EZ. But those with children must file the more complicated Form 1040A; additional forms are needed to deduct child care expenses and get the Earned Income Tax Credit.
Louisa L. Ramirez, 25, of Jersey City said she had never filed a tax return before this year, when she picked Marc Albaum, a Manhattan tax accountant, out of the telephone book and hired him to bring her tax situation up to date. She acted, she said, because she had heard she "could get some percentage off my taxes," because she has a 2-year-old daughter, Anya.
Miss Ramirez, who made $15,000 last year, qualified for a tax credit of $1,882.
One further complication to be aware of: The first person to use a Social Security number on a tax return is presumed by the I.R.S. to be entitled to it. So if an estranged spouse files first, claiming exemptions for the children even if they live with the other parent, it can be a headache to straighten out the mess.
"The I.R.S. sometimes takes more than three years to get around to these situations, which means they can't get the money back from the other spouse and they have to pay it out twice," said Sandy Freund, director of the Rutgers Law School tax clinic in Newark. "The I.R.S. hates to eat it and pay twice." DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

HEADLINE: For Gatekeepers at Colleges, A Daunting Task of Sorting

SERIES: Admission Maze

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: MIDDLETOWN, Conn.

 BODY:
The two applications on the card table in front of Raphael Figueroa were for admission to Wesleyan University, sifted from 6,849 requests for 715 seats in the Class of 2004.
One 17-year-old was a standout, an Asian-American from California whose score in the high 1400's on the College Board exam, out of a possible 1,600, earned her a coveted berth as a National Merit Semifinalist. 
 The other, a Dominican from New York City, had struggled, her score in the 900's on the College Boards and "D" in English hardly representative of the private school she was attending on scholarship.
Seated on a folding metal chair on the porch of his home here, the heat off to keep him awake, Mr. Figueroa, an admissions officer, spent 11 hours contemplating whether either of them -- along with 20 others under review that snowy February day -- merited entrance to Wesleyan, a liberal arts college that is among the most selective in the nation.
This is the season when such hard choices are made -- indeed, they have never been harder -- and like many in college admissions, Mr. Figueroa's was personal and even idiosyncratic, reflecting not only shifting views of academic merit but Mr. Figueroa's own background.
Though the Californian's SAT scores exceeded the median of those applying to Wesleyan (1,350), and her race and West Coast origin were in high demand, Mr. Figueroa finally circled the preliminary recommendation "deny." Among his concerns, he said, was that she had not selected very challenging courses.
The New Yorker, despite scores that ranked her among the bottom of this year's applicants, got a tentative "admit." Mr. Figueroa liked the portrait of a scrapper and born leader that emerged from her essay and teacher recommendations. But he conceded that he also saw a grainy reflection of himself -- he is the sixth of seven children raised by Mexican-born parents in California -- staring back from her manila folder.
"She's an academic risk," he said. "It's one I'm willing to take."
Mr. Figueroa is an anxious sentry at Wesleyan's front gate these days, and like those doing similar work at dozens of other selective colleges and universities, his job is tougher than ever .
By every measure, last year was the most competitive on record for students seeking admission to the nation's top colleges. Harvard rejected more than 9 of every 10 students who applied. Columbia spurned suitors at a similar rate. Wesleyan rebuffed 7 out of 10.
Fueled by an increase in the number of high school graduates and a growing perception that top educational credentials create the best job opportunities in an information-based economy, this admissions season is on track to break many of last year's records -- applications to Harvard and Columbia are up 3 percent; those to Middlebury are up 6 percent; Wesleyan, 7 percent.
And while admissions officers are having a hard enough time swimming in such deep applicant pools, they are also fighting a fierce current, one being churned by the rewriting of decades-old affirmative action policies at state universities in California, Texas, Florida and Washington, where critics have put deans on notice that they believe whites have been treated unfairly.
By the last week of March, when Wesleyan and most other colleges mail their decisions, Mr. Figueroa and his eight colleagues here will have read enough applications to fill the freshman class 10 times over.
Because many of those admitted will decide to go elsewhere, about 1,900 students, or 28 percent, will be invited to take one of the 715 spots in Wesleyan's freshman class next fall; 4,949 others, or 72 percent, will not.
 
An Art, Not a Science
The daunting task of determining who makes the cut and who does not is anything but scientific.
Mr. Figueroa, 35, and his colleagues will consider an applicant's grades, class rank and test scores, of course, and an SAT score below 1,400 would immediately be considered a negative. But it would hardly be a deal-breaker.
That's because the officers will also weigh a student's race, ethnicity and hometown, as well as course selections, athletic prowess, alumni connections, artistic skill, musical talent, writing ability, community service and the quality of the school. (A student's means to pay Wesleyan's annual tuition, room and board -- $31,600 -- is not to be considered by the admissions officers.)
The officers will assign the applicant a rating of 1 to 9, with 9 highest, in a half-dozen broad categories. Applicants be warned: letters of recommendation from members of Congress or Gen. Colin L. Powell; boxes of cookies sent by priority mail, and essays about discovering yourself at summer camp have, this year as in others, provided little added traction.
In the end, the officers will often rely as much on their gut feelings as on numbers, balancing an applicant's chances for academic excellence at Wesleyan against the broader contribution the applicant might make to the college community and, ultimately, the world.
Mr. Figueroa, echoing colleagues at Wesleyan and elsewhere, sees himself as a social engineer, one charged with making sure that the Class of 2004 is not only academically sound and ethnically and racially diverse, but also well-stocked with poets, running backs, activists, politicians, painters, journalists and cellists. That philosophy trickles from the very top of the university, from Douglas J. Bennet, Wesleyan's president since 1995.
"It's a mistake to hold out that total fairness is the only objective," said Mr. Bennet, who graduated from Wesleyan in 1959, though he wondered if he would be admitted today. "It's intuitive. It's a guess, to some degree, about where an individual at 16 or 17 will end up at 18 or 20."
Mr. Figueroa's first word in the process will not necessarily be the last, though it often foreshadows an applicant's fate.
From January to early March, each application will be read by at least two officers -- the first selected at random, the second because he or she covers the particular region from which the student is applying. If the readers concur, the director or dean of admissions, who will review the recommendations, will probably endorse them.
But often the officers' verdicts are at odds. And the fate of hundreds of applicants will be left unresolved until late March, when the officers will convene for several days of fiery committee meetings.
 
Role of Gatekeepers' Pasts
The Wesleyan admissions officers are encouraged to bring their own life experiences to the deliberations. For it is their own diversity, both of race and of interests, that the university hopes to replicate in Wesleyan's next class.
One of the nine, for example, is a white, former Philadelphia high school teacher, age 39. Another, who is 25, grew up in Hawaii. A third, now 53, was director of a community halfway house before he came to Wesleyan more than 20 years ago. A fourth graduated from Wesleyan last year with a double major in English and African-American studies.
Mr. Figueroa grew up in Southern California. His mother's father, a miner in Mexico, did not attend college but took engineering courses by mail. Mr. Figueroa still keeps his grandfather's worn correspondence books in his office. And his grandfather's mantra -- "I'd give anything to have worked with my head, and not my hands" -- served as a prod to Mr. Figueroa's father, who became a lawyer, and his mother, who obtained a master's in bilingual education. Mr. Figueroa and his six siblings all graduated from college, and most also received graduate degrees.
Even with a College Board score of 1,400, Mr. Figueroa believes his own application to Stanford University would have been considered anything but unique, had he not been of Mexican descent. The experience of attending and graduating from Stanford, as well as the University of California Los Angeles Law School, has made him a passionate defender of affirmative action.
"These are students who have overcome hardship," he says. "And these are students who, the evidence shows, are much more likely to go back to their communities as leaders."
It was his gratitude for the gifts of affirmative action, he said, and his high regard for his mother's work as a college counselor to Mexican children, that persuaded him to bypass a legal career for admissions.
 
Picking and Choosing
This year's admissions season, at Wesleyan and elsewhere, began in November, when the officers began considering applicants who sought early admission, on the promise that they would attend Wesleyan if accepted. Some 40 percent of the new freshman class was taken up by those accepted early.
But Mr. Figueroa and his colleagues have read the bulk of the applications, including personal statements, high school transcripts and references, over the last few months, from 9 a.m. until 11 at night, six days a week, mostly from home. Of the 22 applications Mr. Figueroa read one recent day, he tentatively recommended admitting nine candidates -- which, he worried, was too many. Accepting no more than six of every 22, given the size of the pool, is more of a goal, he suggested. He says he is always telling himself, "Read faster, say no."
Among the applicants who made strong impressions on Mr. Figueroa that day were a young woman who had competed in the United States National Chemistry Olympiad and a young man who wrote about saving someone's life.
The prospects were less clear for a young Connecticut man who devoted his personal statement to the rules of his Italian family -- "If you're wise to your grandmother, it's a slap upside your head."
But it was the applications of the California merit scholar and the struggling Dominican from New York that ate up much of Mr. Figueroa's time, nearly two hours.
He was disappointed that the merit scholar had taken few advanced placement courses at her top-notch public school and had several C's.
Mr. Figueroa recommended denying the woman admission -- but he added the designation "plus," which meant that if another reader strongly disagreed with him, the committee should discuss it.
The Dominican woman from New York was a harder call. Her grades were worse than the Californian's, as well several others whom Mr. Figueroa had recommended rejecting that day.
But Mr. Figueroa liked that she had gotten herself a scholarship to private school, that she had taken leadership positions there and that, like his own parents, she had already exceeded the education level of her parents. He marked her application "admit minus" meaning he wanted it discussed by the committee.
"Spanish is her first language," he said of the New Yorker, reading to a visitor from her application. "Her parents didn't go to school."
"Coming from the Southwest," he said, "I know that 1 in 4 high school dropouts is a Latina female."
Though Wesleyan -- where this year's freshman class is 9 percent black and 7 percent Latino -- has no quotas for minorities, the officers are encouraged to admit as many as possible. Mr. Figueroa said that such cases often kept him up at night.
"You can't help but thinking, 'Those kids are out there somewhere. They don't even realize we're sitting here and agonizing about them and spending time really worried about their lives and what's happening to them,' " he said.
But a moment later, his mind drifting to the sheer number of applicants for so few slots, he added: "They're going to end up in good places. They're going to have good lives. I don't have the ability to bring them all to Wesleyan."
 
Admissions Maze
Admission to elite colleges is more competitive than at any time in history. The New York Times asked Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., to give a reporter full access to it's selection procedure. It did so, permitting him to read applications and attend admissions meetings, on the condition that applicants' identities not be revealed. This is the first of several articles on that process.

HEADLINE: Reviving the Waterfront: Victory and Frustration;
For Many Communities Along the Hudson, Development Remains a Dream After Long Delays

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: IRVINGTON

 BODY:
WITNESSING the rebirth of the waterfront here an area of the village once thought to be irrecoverable -- Mayor Dennis Flood is scarely able to contain his pride these days.
Gone are petroleum hydrocarbons and lead in the soil, drifts of trash and broken glass and deteriorating buildings from a former industrial period that once fouled the river's edge. 
 In their stead, the Mayor said, will be amenities that many towns along the Hudson River still only dream about: ball fields where children play, parkland that offers stunning vistas and walking paths fanned by cool breezes on even the hottest days. The commercial section of the waterfront is already alive with businesses, including a thriving restaurant and a women's clothing manufacturer.
Celebrating Irvington's reclamation of the site, state and local officials gathered along the Hudson early this month to proclaim the completion of the first phase of the village's effort and to cheer the beginning of the final $12.8 million construction phase.
"I can't say exactly why things have worked so well here and haven't elsewhere along the river," Mayor Flood said, "but for us it has been the best of all possible worlds."
A variety of problems have kept other towns along Westchester's 49 miles of Hudson River from achieving the success that Irvington has.
Hastings-on-Hudson, for example, has the highest concentration of potentially cancer-causing PCB's in the state at the former site of the Anaconda Wire and Cable Company, and a $50 million cleanup is anticipated before any rebuilding can take place there.
The site, which is now owned by the Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Company, has concentrations of underground PCB's that have measured as high as 381,000 parts per million, the State Department of Environmental Conservation estimates. The state standard for PCB's below the surface is 10 parts per million.
PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, accumulated in the soil and leached into the river during wire-making operations at the Anaconda factory from 1919 to 1978. The chemicals, which were banned in 1977, have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals and are linked to learning problems in children exposed to even small amounts before birth. Other hazardous chemicals and heavy metals also permeate parts of the 26-acre tract.
The cleanup plan will be undertaken and paid for by ARCO, although no timetable has been set up.
In the short run, village officials hoped to remove some of the unsightly abandoned buildings on the waterfront, which is on the state's Superfund list.
But last month, the State Department of Environmental Conservation said that ARCO must test for lead paint and asbestos before applying for a village permit to raze eight buildings there. That could delay the demolition several months or more.
"For us, it has been extremely frustrating," Mayor William Lee Kinnally of Hastings said. "It seems that our hopes keep getting raised and then dashed."
In Ossining, the waterfront has posed a similarly frustrating situation, and plans there are also proceeding in a halting fashion.
In Ossining's case, the delays are the result of a recent change in plans by the developer, Cappelli Enterprises of Valhalla. The company reported earlier this month that it would scale back its original $70 million plan to develop housing, an amphitheater, a restaurant and a health and fitness club on 10.5 miles of the village's waterfront.
"It's back to the drawing board," said Joseph V. Apicella, the company's vice president for development. He said the company did not know how much it would downscale the project. Mr. Apicella said that in September, tropical storm Floyd exposed some storm drainage problems along the riverfront, and that was one of several reasons that his company reconsidered its plans.
In Sleepy Hollow, village officials have had to take a passive role, with little say in determining the fate of their waterfront. General Motors, which closed its plant there in 1996, is choosing the developer and the use for the 97 acres it owns there.
The former General Motors buildings have been leveled, and the land, which is capped by a concrete pad and asphalt, "now looks like the middle of a La Guardia runway," Mayor Philip Zegarelli said. The village has publicly said that it hopes the site, which is not contaminated, will be used for a public promenade and park, for a conference and retail center and about 700 units of housing and recreation.
Along a 5.3-mile strip of waterfront in Yonkers, "there were also a lot of starts and stops," before the city took the first steps to reclaim its waterfront, said Jim Pinto, the acting director for waterfront development for Yonkers. Most notably, a plan announced in 1979 for a 1,850-unit condominium project, Pierpointe on the Hudson, was barely under way before it collapsed under financial pressure. Fewer than 10 percent of the units were developed, and the rest of the plan was abandoned.
After Collins Enterprises of Greenwich develops 300 units of rental apartments on the Yonkers waterfront this summer, the city also plans a movie theater and catering hall, along with new parking and office space.
The process for Yonkers -- and for most communities along the river -- has been long and sometimes fractious, said Robert Lane, a director for the Regional Plan Association in Manhattan, a nonprofit, civic planning and advocacy organization with branches in Stamford and Newark.
Environmental challenges are often the first source of frustration, Mr. Lane said. "But then you have to choose a development program, decide on tax ratables, determine the amount of open space a municipality can afford and build so you don't overburden resources."
But since its acquisition of land for a 12-acre public park two years ago, Irvington has been able to move ahead swiftly. Unlike the five-acre Matthiessen Park, the new park will be open to the public. State money was used to clean up the site and it was acquired through the Scenic Hudson Land Trust, which stipulated that the park be open to all. The village also received $175,000 in state Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act funds at the time to clean up the lead and petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil.
The waterfront is on land that was created before 1940 by filling the Hudson River. Although an environmental investigation showed lead in the fill, it revealed no contamination in the adjacent river.
Irvington's cleanup plan included removing several leach fields where the highest concentrations of lead were found and laying a soil cap across the site.
The final reclamation plan on the small village-owned portion of the 12-acre waterfront calls for a regulation-size Little League ball field and two other playing fields, a senior citizens' center, parks and a picnic area.
To help the other municipalities along the river also realize their dreams, some help arrived last month in the form of a state Waterfront Rediscovery Program grant. The program is designed to help communities improve the recreational, cultural and economic value of their waterfront resources.
Since 1995, Gov. George E. Pataki has awarded 417 Environmental Protection Fund grants totaling more than $26.7 million for waterfront planning and projects.
Under the latest grant Hastings will get $300,000. (Waterfront municipalities throughout the state will receive a total of $4.5 million.) The money will be used in Hastings to design a bridge crossing over the train tracks to the river, to study access issues and to prepare an overall waterfront redevelopment plan.
Dobbs Ferry will receive a $20,000 grant. Mayor Brian Monahan of Dobbs Ferry said the village will use the grant to stud the feasiblity of a playground, open space and walkways on its 3 acres along the 8.5-acre waterfront.
"Fortunately, there are no contamination issues that we know about, although a portion of the land is landfill," Mr. Monahan said.
Tarrytown will use part of its $10,000 award to update a revitalization plan for its 22-acre waterfront and prepare a village master plan. Mayor Paul Janos said the village might allow one commercial building along the waterfront to generate tax revenues but would not consider new homes or a concentration of commercial uses. The focus, he said, would be on providing riverfront access for residents.
Sleepy Hollow, which received $25,000 from the state, will conduct a study of potential uses for the General Motors waterfront area -- the single largest tract on the Hudson River waterfront -- even though the decision is not in the village's hands.
"The grant money will give us muscle power in terms of consultants to analyze what will be the single most important development decision in this village in a generation," Mayor Zegarelli said. Sleepy Hollow cannot afford to turn all the property into parkland because it must find uses that will generate at least some of the $2 million in tax revenues that G.M. once did, he said.
Although frustrating to elected officials and developers, years of delays and disappointments are typical of redevelopment attempts along the river, Mr. Lane of the Regional Plan Association said.
He said his agency worked closely with Yonkers and is now helping Hastings negotiate with the state and commercial interests to see that in the long run, "the right thing happens" along the waterfront.
The Regional Plan Association is also working on New York City waterfront projects and views locations like Yonkers and Hastings as part of the larger New York City harbor estuary.
"Our feeling is that a lot of these issues, like pollution, don't respect borders," he said. "The best strategies are comprehensive ones. Each municipality has its own special interests and concerns, yet they are all part of a bigger region."

 BODY:
To get to the house where Stephen and Megan Scheibner live with their seven children, you skirt past Allentown, Pa., and drive for another half-hour into the hills above the Lehigh Valley. The Scheibner place is on Blue Mountain Road, a few miles past a forlorn establishment called Binnie's Hot Dogs and Family Food. Standing behind their white clapboard farmhouse, where the backyard unfurls over three and a half acres and where, in summer, you can see a tangled strawberry patch and a tree fort, you could swear you were deep in the country and maybe deep in the past too. The front of the house is a different matter. It's practically on top of a busy road that leads to the local ski resorts; the view is of a housing development under construction.
Inside, there is no such ambivalence. Although the Scheibners are well off and their house is comfortably appointed -- Steve is a pilot with American Airlines and a commander in the Naval Reserves -- what might strike many visitors first is what's missing. In the Scheibner household, where the children are 12, 11, 9, 7, 6, 4 and 20 months, there is no Pokemon or "Star Wars" paraphernalia. There are no Britney Spears or Ricky Martin tapes. There are no posters of Leonardo DiCaprio or Michael Jordan taped to the walls, no pots of lip gloss or bottles of metallic nail polish scattered around. No Mortal Kombat, no "Goosebumps." No broadcast TV -- though the family does watch carefully selected videos, which often means movies from the 1940's and 50's. (The older kids are big Cary Grant fans.) There is no giggling about the cute guys and girls at school, because the Scheibners are home-schooled and besides, their parents don't believe in dating. There is little sign of eye-rolling preteen rebellion, because Steve and his wife, Megan, don't believe in that either, and have set up their lives in such a way that it is unlikely to manifest itself. Katie, the oldest, reads Louisa May Alcott and reissued girls' classics like the Elsie Dinsmore books, and is partial to white patent-leather Mary Janes worn with ankle-length floral dresses. Peter, who comes next, likes Tolkien and the muscularly Christian boys' adventure stories written by the 19th-century author G. A. Henty, and favors chinos and logo-free button-down shirts. Peter wants to be a missionary in Russia, which he describes as a "forsaken" country; Katie wants to be a home-schooling mom. They are each other's best friends. And if they quarrel, it's not in a way that involves the dissing of one another in viciously up-to-the-minute slang. 
 There is no sports gear lying around the Scheibner household, because Megan feels that team sports breed competitive "behavior that we would not deem Christlike"; more important, they interfere with the weekly rhythm of schooling, service and worship. Holidays don't disrupt much, either. The Scheibners don't celebrate Halloween -- Satanic overtones -- though one year the three oldest children dressed up as a couple of shepherds and a sheep and went door to door handing out evangelical tracts. At Christmas, they decorate the house and take baskets of food to their neighbors and to the poor, but they don't indulge in a buy-fest.
Megan, who is 37, guesses she has been to a mall "maybe three times" in the seven years the family has lived in Pennsylvania, and she can't remember the correct name of Toys "R" Us. For the children's clothes, she does a lot of her shopping at consignment stores because she objects to "the way most girls' stuff looks like it was designed for 20-year-olds and the boys' clothes all have some cartoon character on them." This Christmas, as they have for the past several years, the kids got a shared family gift -- a "Sunday box" of special games and toys they can take out only on the Sabbath. It contained a Noah's Ark puzzle, several books, a tape of Christian children's songs with titles like "Keep Your Tongue From Evil," and a board game called Sticky Situations, a Christian version of Chutes and Ladders based on such moral dilemmas as what you should do if the most unpopular kid you know invites you over.
None of this is what Steve and Megan Scheibner would say first about themselves. What they would say first is that they are Christians -- fundamentalist Baptists who were born again when, as teenagers, they found Jesus Christ and accepted the doctrine of salvation. And yet the way they practice their faith puts them so sharply and purposefully at odds with the larger culture that it is hard not to see the Scheibners, conservative and law-abiding though they are, as rebels.
We have arrived, it seems, at a moment in our history when the most vigorous and coherent counterculture around is the one constructed by conservative Christians. That sounds odd to many of us -- especially, perhaps, to secular liberals, who cherish our own 60's-inflected notions of what an "alternative lifestyle" should look like. Ever since Theodore Roszak first coined it in 1968, the word "counterculture" has retained its whiff of patchouli, its association with free love, long hair and left-wing youth. "The counterculture," as Roszak defined it, "is the embryonic base of New Left politics, the effort to discover new types of community, new family patterns, new sexual mores . . . new personal identities on the far side of power politics."
Yet today it is conservative Christians like the Scheibners who, more self-consciously than any other large social group, buck mainstream notions of what constitutes a fulfilled life. Indeed, much of what Roszak said of the 60's counterculture could be said of them too. It's true that the "patterns" and "mores" they have discovered are not so much new ones as reinvigorated traditional ones. Parent-sanctioned courtship, the merging of school and home, the rejection of peer-group segregation, the moral value of thrift -- all are ideas that, in the United States, last held real sway in the 19th century. But the impatience that people like the Scheibners display with acquisition, their unflagging commitment to putting the group -- in their case, the family -- above individual ambition, their rejection of pop culture, their characterization of themselves as, in Steve's words, "people who question absolutely everything," make them radical in ways that would be recognizable to some 60's counterculturists too.
There are about 20 million evangelical Christians in the U.S. today; together with fundamentalists, who tend to be more withdrawn from public life and more theologically conservative, they make up about 25 percent of the American population. Many of them lead lives that are far less sequestered and culturally abstemious than the Scheibners'. (Only 6 percent of conservative Christians educate their children at home, for instance, though the numbers are growing.) Some lead even more walled-off lives: at a conference for home-schooling families in Virginia last summer, I heard one speaker urge parents to reconsider sending their kids to college -- even a Bible college -- because dorm life encouraged "fornication" and "homosexual rape." But nearly all evangelicals struggle with the question of how staunchly they should separate their families from a majority culture they believe flouts their values.
A sense of this struggle came to the fore last spring, when Paul Weyrich published his "turn off, tune out, drop out" letter -- the very phrase self-consciously echoing the hippie slogan. Weyrich, a founder of the Christian right, now urged "a strategy of separation," a "sort of quarantine" for Christians who he argued had been trying too hard, and at too much cost to their own morality, to insert themselves into the mainstream. "We need," he wrote "to drop out of this culture, and find places, even if it is where we physically are right now, where we can live godly, righteous and sober lives."
In their 1999 book, "Blinded by Might," Cal Thomas, a conservative columnist, and Ed Dobson, a Baptist minister, offered a similar analysis, arguing that "religious conservatives have heard sermons that man's ways are not God's ways. . . . In politics they have fused the two, causing damage to both church and state." In a series of forceful columns, Thomas went on to argue that for Christians, worldly power was "not a calling, but a distraction" from the next world and that the faithful often stumbled in the public square anyway. Consider Prohibition: "Good people diagnosed a social ill, but they used the wrong methods to correct it," he wrote. "The lesson: by and large, the Christian mission should be to change hearts, not laws."
Weyrich, Thomas and Dobson found few adherents among the leaders of the Christian right, but they touched off an emotional debate at the grass roots. Embittered by Clinton's survival of the impeachment scandal, some conservative Christians were despairing of politics altogether: how could Christians hope to influence a polity that supported a manifestly immoral leader? Even those who did not feel quite so deeply estranged from the American electorate still found something meaningful and provocative in the call to concentrate on discipleship, not politics. In an article in Christianity Today, the former Reagan aide Don Eberly wrote, "The greatest fallacy that has emerged in recent years is the expectation that national politicians and other civil authorities should take the lead in restoring biblical righteousness or, worse, using political power to create a 'Christian America.' "
It would be premature to declare the end of religious-right political activism. There are too many issues, from abortion to same-sex marriage, that continue to galvanize the faithful. But it cannot be denied that as a political force, the religious right is flagging. The Christian Coalition is deeply in the red. The two presidential candidates most identified with savvy Christian conservatism -- Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes -- have dropped out of the race, while the protest candidate Alan Keyes blusters on to tiny audiences. Yet even as Christian political movements flounder, the strategies that might be thought of as countercultural -- home-schooling, building up a self-contained pop culture -- are flourishing.
Not long after this debate was under way, I met the Scheibners. I had become interested in the idea of a Christian counterculture, and I wanted to write about a family who seemed to be living it out. I wasn't looking for people involved in a violent or illegal confrontation with the government -- militia types, say -- nor for people who belonged to a tradition with a long history of separateness, like the Amish. What I was looking for were people who were, as Steve Scheibner later described his family, "selective separatists": people who voted and paid taxes, worked in the mainstream world and even did community service, but who quite deliberately chose, as Megan put it, "not to participate in those parts of the culture that do not bring glory to God."
Partly I was interested because as a mother of young children, I had grappled with some of the same questions about what to keep at bay and for how long. TV or no TV? Did I want my 3-year-old to start playing on the computer now so he wouldn't be behind or hold off as long as possible, knowing his life will be colonized by dot-com this and digital that soon enough? Did toy guns lead inexorably to a taste for brutal video games? When you are awash in media and awash in stuff, what hope do you have of picking and choosing anyway? Could you do so only if armed with a totalizing worldview like the Scheibners'? How feasible -- and how desirable -- was it to "drop out" anyway?
When Megan Scheibner answered a message I posted on a Christian Internet discussion list last summer, her e-mail convinced me that I had found the right family. "We don't isolate our family," she wrote, "but we do feel like we are called to shelter them from evil until they are spiritually ready to stand firm." Sheltering them, she explained, meant screening out almost all pop culture. "We have seen the fruit in kind, polite children," she went on to say. "Others have noticed, too, and this has given us many opportunities to share, i.e., one time at Pizza Hut, the man at the next table bought us lunch because the kids were so nice to each other. . . . Only God gets the glory for things like this. Neither my husband nor I were raised in Christian homes, but God has been faithful to show us his desire for our family, and then as we obey, He has blessed us abundantly."
On a rainy Sunday morning in August, I arrived, with my husband and son, for my first visit to the Scheibner house. The family was busy conducting its own Sunday school, and Megan sent Emma, then 8, out to greet us. Like all of the Scheibner children, Emma addressed me as Mrs. Talbot and my husband as Mr. Talbot. It seemed pointless to insist that they call me by my first name, and downright mean to introduce the idea that my husband and I have different last names, so there it stood. Of another 8-year-old, it might be fair to say that she bounded out of the house, but Emma walked delicately, on the balls of her feet, self-consciously ladylike. With a curtsy, she conducted us inside. All seven of the Scheibner children, and three of their friends, sat cross-legged on the tan carpet in the living room, reviewing their catechisms and listening to a sermon delivered by their father.
It may be because he is a pilot or because he has spent much of his adult life in the military or because he believes so firmly in parental authority, but Steve Scheibner seems at ease in the role of teacher and preacher to his own children in a way that few parents I know would be. Not that anything in his appearance or demeanor suggests an old-fashioned patriarch. He's a young-looking 39, slim, sharp-featured and dark-haired; he can be sarcastic; and he uses lots of guy lingo like "Bogus!" and "Where the rubber hits the road." But he's also got a storehouse of metaphors and concepts for child-rearing and for life that he dips into without hesitation or doubt. Steve explains to me later that he and Megan don't like the way many churches, including their own, shunt kids off to children's services where "they hear about Jonah and the whale for the umpteenth time." They think that children are capable of more or less following the main sermon by the age of 3; when they start their own church in Brunswick, Me., next summer (Steve is studying at a seminary now), there will be booster seats in the pews.
For now, though, he has taken to conducting his own Sunday school, with another couple and their children. Megan, in a smocked denim dress, a headband and no makeup, sits next to him. Though it's only 9 a.m., all the children look freshly scrubbed and shiny-haired, outfitted in their Sunday best. When little Baleigh cranes her neck to peer at us with a radiant, inquisitive smile, her mom gives her a whispered scolding, accompanied by the look a border collie might give a straying sheep. She turns around immediately.
At 10:30, Steve piles the kids into the van and drives to church, and Megan stays behind to talk to me. She'll miss church this morning, which she hardly ever does, but there's another service tonight, which the family always attends as well. In her high-ceilinged kitchen, where one wall is lined with homemade preserves, she tells me about their decision to teach their kids at home. "I worked in a day-care center for a while as a young Navy wife, and it really shocked me -- the lack of discipline, the hitting, biting, screeching. We always thought we would home-school, but somehow we lost the nerve for a while and with Katie we sent her to kindergarten at a private Christian school for a year. But what we noticed was that she got more interested in what her peers were doing than in what her family was doing! We felt like our family-centered little girl was being pulled away from us."
Family identity is extremely important to the Scheibners -- they have their own sayings, code words, even a family song. The turning outward that most parents expect of their children and accept, with varying degrees of wistfulness, was to them an intolerable betrayal. "We didn't want to lose our children to other people's ideas and ideologies," Megan will say, or, "We wanted our children's hearts, and we really feel we have them." Home-schooling afforded the prospect that the older kids would help with the younger ones and the younger ones would emulate the older ones instead of their peers.
While we talk, Megan is cooking gravy and pot roast and two kinds of pie, and when the rest of the family comes home it's time for Sunday lunch at the big butcher block table Steve made for them. Despite the presence of seven children, lunch is an orderly business. Interruptions are kept to a minimum -- talking out of turn elicits the border-collie look. Still, Peter, who has been studying pirates, chats charmingly about Bluebeard, and Katie reminds me that there were female pirates who "fought like demons." There is a lot of anticipatory discussion of the pies. But lunch, like most meals in the Scheibner household, is also an occasion for moral pedagogy.
The thing about living in a culture from which you feel estranged, and which you therefore do not trust to reinforce you own values, is that you must be vigilant; you can't lose an opportunity to remind your children that they are different, and why. The Scheibners surround themselves as much as possible with a culture of their own making and friends of their own choosing who share their religion, but it's not as though they actually live in a 19th-century village. Just the other week, Katie innocently typed in "girls.com" on the computer -- the Scheibner kids are allowed to do research on the Internet -- and got hit with a dozen porn sites.
Just before pie is served, Steve asks Katie, as he has many times before, to explain what courtship is. Shyly, she looks down at her plate. "I don't know," she says. To which her mother replies, "You can do better than that, young lady." And she can. She has known the word, at least, since she was 9 and her father took her out for ice cream and a portentous chat. The Scheibners believe that dating, because it usually involves breaking up, is, as Steve puts it, "practice for divorce."
It goes without saying that they do not approve of premarital sex, but what is a little more surprising is that they do not approve of premarital emotional intimacy either. If a couple are courting, they are supposed to be seriously considering each other as husband and wife, and they are supposed to do so with some overt participation by parents or other elders. Ideally, they should not be alone together, or if they are it ought to be in a public place -- a Friendly's, say -- where liquor is not served and where they are unlikely to give in to temptation. As Steve later explained to me: "If a girl dates 100 guys before she gets married, she's given her heart away 100 times but every time she gets it back, it's a little more scarred. So, when I took Katie out, I had bought this cheap little wedding ring in my size, and I gave it to her and I said: 'This is yours and what it represents is your heart. Go ahead and try it on.' Well, of course it was about as big as three of her fingers. So I said, 'See, it doesn't fit you, but it does fit Daddy, so if you don't mind, I want you to give Daddy your heart and let him hold on to it until the appropriate time when I will give it back to you and you in turn will give it to the man you marry.' "
Katie looks up -- she's a good girl who wants to please -- and murmurs: "It's better than dating. It's waiting for the right man." Now Peter raises his hand. For him, this is all a little more abstract and a little less embarrassing, and he knows he has the answer. "It's keeping your heart pure!"
"Right!" says his father approvingly.
After lunch, Katie goes upstairs without prompting to put young Baleigh and Stephen down for their three-hour afternoon naps -- nap time is inviolable at the Scheibner house -- and Peter and Emma cheerily start in on the dishes. To a girl and boy, the Scheibner kids are a pleasure to talk to; they're polite and brimming with book-gotten information. They're also a little otherworldly, a bit unnervingly preprogrammed.
When the family came to Washington, where I live, to attend a rally for home-schoolers on the Capitol steps, I went along. It was a hot day and I was nine months pregnant, so I sat down, and while the rest of the children stood patiently with Megan and Steve, Molly, the 7-year-old, wandered over to me. Molly is the dreamy one, the dress-up artist -- the one who likes to trail around the house in her mother's wedding gown and who says she wants to be a princess when she grows up. Her hair is honey-colored and waist length, and so, naturally, she maintains a lively interest in the general subject of hair. On the steps, she began doing what a lot of little girls with a lively interest in hair would do, which was to brush mine and, with my permission, to poke through my purse looking for hair ornaments. But though the motions seemed familiar, the dialogue was disconcertingly awry.
"Is President Clinton a Christian?" Molly asked in her singsong voice.
"I think he would say so, yes."
"No. He's not. He lies. Do you have a barrette?"
The sun was beating down. A boy skateboarded by in a black T-shirt reading, "Jesus: The Force Without a Dark Side."
"I know who is always against us," Molly continued.
"Who?"
"Satan." Brush. Brush.
"Really? What does he do?"
"Makes us lie." Brush. Brush. "Makes us sin." Brush. Brush. "Makes us turn our back on God. What's Play-Doh?"
For more moderate Americans, the persistence of the evangelical strain in our culture is a mystery that both requires and defies explanation. After the embarrassment of the Scopes trial, conservative Christians of all stripes were supposed to have sunk into the past like woolly mammoths in a tar pit. The re-emergence of a Christian right in the mid-80's took no one by greater surprise than the liberal academics and journalists who were frequently called upon to account for it, and to whom the equation of secularity and modernity was itself sacrosanct. As a result, much of the commentary on conservative Christians has tended to portray them, the historian Alan Brinkley points out, "as a group somehow left behind by the modern world -- economically, culturally, psychologically." They were, in short, H. L. Mencken's "rustic gorillas" updated, but barely.
The trouble with this theory of "status discontent" -- of conservative Christians as downwardly mobile rubes -- was that most of them were neither. On "most measures of backwardness," as the sociologist Christian Smith puts it, evangelicals look no different -- and frequently look more advanced -- than their counterparts who identify themselves as mainline or liberal Protestants, as Catholics or as nonreligious. Of all these groups, evangelicals are the least likely to have had only a high school education or less. They are more likely than liberals or the nonreligious to belong to the $50,000-and-above income bracket. And they are no more likely to live in rural areas than anyone else; the new centers of conservative Christianity, it turns out, are the prosperous suburbs in Midwestern states like Kansas and Oklahoma.
Moreover, if you started with a theory of conservative Christians as orphans of history stranded in the modern world, you were more or less helpless to explain why the movement has been flourishing -- both in new converts and in retention of members -- since the 70's. Smith, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, has one convincing answer. He argues that American evangelicalism is flourishing "because of and not in spite of its confrontation with modern pluralism." In other words, the fragmentation of American culture has encouraged the flowering of all kinds of minority groups, from gays to conservative Christians. More important, modern pluralism allows evangelicals to rub up against ideas and sensibilities that offend them, and this is itself a revitalizing force. "Contemporary pluralism," Smith has written, "creates a situation in which evangelicals can perpetually maintain but can never resolve their struggle with the nonevangelical world."
Over the past few years, engaging in this daily struggle to lead a "godly, righteous and sober life" has been made much easier by the exponential growth of Christian media. People like the Scheibners now have a storehouse of goods and services to which they can return, again and again, to refresh themselves and be entertained without guilt. The ability to encapsulate themselves in a culture of their own making removes some of the incentive to reform the culture at large, while at the same time offering a more fully realized reproof of it -- a parallel world, imagined to the last, vivid detail.
Christian books and TV are just the beginning. The contemporary Christian music scene, with its groovily-named bands like Leaderdogs for the Blind and the Insyderz, is a $1-billion-a-year business. You can now buy, over the Internet, everything from Christian computer games to poseable biblical action figures. In the video market, "VeggieTales," a popular kids' series featuring animated vegetables enacting biblical parables, is just one among hundreds of titles -- from the "Mother Goose Gospel" to "The Adventures of Prayer Bear."
Conservative Christianity has its own chaste heartthrobs, like Joshua Harris, the raffishly cute author of "I Kissed Dating Good-Bye," and the singer Rebecca St. James, the Alanis Morissette of the W.W.J.D. set. It even has its own indie film scene with movies like "End of the Harvest," in which "a college philosophy club meeting filled with atheists humiliates a new believer who tries to prove to them the existence of God." It has its own magazines for every demographic niche, including Hopscotch and Boys' Quest for kids 6 to 13, which promise "no teen themes, no boyfriends, girlfriends, makeup, fashion or violence and NO ADVERTISING!"
Combine all this with the fact that the number of home-schoolers has been increasing since 1985 at a rate of 15 to 20 percent a year -- there are now about 1.2. million -- while enrollment at evangelical colleges grew 24 percent between 1990 and 1996 (compared with an enrollment increase of 5 percent at other private colleges), and it seems fair to say that conservative Christians can live as much as they choose within a culture of their own construction. And that a lot of them are choosing to do so much of the time.
For some people, this separatist impulse has been strengthened by a newfound disillusionment with politics. It's not that conservative Christians are fleeing civic duty altogether: evangelicals still vote, for example, at a higher rate than do members of almost any other major religious group. It's more a matter of emphasis -- of saying, maybe we were seduced by the promise of political power, and now we have to free ourselves from its thrall and concentrate anew on living faithfully and saving souls.
Steve Scheibner is certainly a patriotic guy: he has served in the Navy for 17 years, most recently flying drug-interdiction flights in the Caribbean. But whereas he once thought of running for political office, he now feels he "could have a greater and longer lasting impact on the lives of people as a pastor." He and Megan are Republicans, and they always vote, but they're not going to be active participants in Campaign 2000. Jerry Falwell, Ralph Reed and most other religious-right leaders don't impress Steve much -- they "are mostly political creatures," he says. The one candidate he admires is the firebrand Alan Keyes, who doesn't stand a chance of getting the Republican nomination. The political issue the Scheibners say they care most about is being left alone to home-school, and they see the discipling of others -- the training of hearts already opened up to Christ -- as their best hope for making a difference in the world.
One icy evening in January, nine young couples crowd into the Scheibners' living room for a class Megan and Steve teach on parenting the Christian way. Angie Dalrymple and her husband, Bruce, have come because they are both new Christians -- my husband got saved in March and I got saved in April" -- and she needs help picking her way through unfamiliar moral terrain. Just last week, the Dalrymples' 9-year-old son, Josh, who has also been born again, was facing all kinds of grief at his public school because he now insists on "dressing real nice." Given that he had already ostentatiously thrown his Pokemon cards away, explaining to his classmates that an obsession with the cards could lead to a lifetime fascination with the dark side, he was taking some risks as it was. But Josh is big, which helps, and Angie coaxed him to "get rid of the tie, but keep the button-down shirts." She's proud of him but sometime she feels he's getting ahead of her, spiritually speaking. When his 4-year-old brother, Cody, talked back to her the other day, Josh called his attention to the Ten Commandments on the wall. Now Josh is saying he wants to be home-schooled, and Angie admits to the group that her first thought was, "Whoa, there." She and her husband, a machinist, have already stopped drinking and cursing, cut up their credit cards and canceled their cable TV. How many more changes are there going to be? She's glad to have the group for support.
The agenda for the evening involves watching a video produced by the Christian child-rearing gurus Gary and Ann Marie Ezzo, whose advocacy of rigid schedules for feeding babies, among other things, has been widely criticized by mainstream pediatricians. Tonight's program, though, is a gentler offering, focused on the need to help your child grow morally by giving him "the moral reason why" when you reprimand him for, say, careering around the churchyard and knocking old ladies off-balance -- the example given in the video. The evening's discussion also gives the Scheibners a chance to touch on one of their favorite metaphors: the funnel.
The Scheibners think that most parents today err by trying to be "buddies to their babies and little kids." As Megan puts it, they start out with "a big fat funnel, and then, when the kids get to be 13 or 14 and become rebellious, they try to tighten it, and by then it's too late." The Scheibners' idea, they explain, is that you start off with a tight funnel, then gradually open it so that by the time your kids get to be teenagers, you can trust them. They reject what is, in essence, the modern idea of adolescence -- that a teenager's alienation from his parents is an inevitable, even necessary step on the way to individuation. For Megan and Steve, rebellion within the family is not an acceptable option; they need a united front at home to wage rebellion against the larger culture. And more important, they believe that obedience to parents trains a child for obedience to God. When the Lord calls him to do something, he has to be ready to say, "Yes, Lord, here I am." So kids need practice in the prompt and cheerful response to commands, learning to do as their parents ask in what the Scheibners refer to as the RAH spirit -- for "the Right way, All the way, the Happy way."
In other classes, Steve will talk about the need to stand firm when your children push, how you must be the wall that doesn't give way. He'll defend spanking, a practice that the Scheibners have thought through in detail. (Never do it in anger; never do it when you've lost control; use a flexible instrument so you don't break down muscle.)
The atmosphere tonight is a little like a consciousness-raising session -- there's an earnest aura of learning together and sustaining one another in a benighted world. During the short break, everybody stands around drinking Diet Cokes and eating the taco salad someone brought, but there's not a lot of small talk. Steve is indisputably the leader, but he's willing to make himself vulnerable with a well-placed confession or two. He mentions, for example, his own upbringing in a very 70's family that left him with nothing in what he likes to call his "moral warehouse." His parents divorced when he was 2; his dad was a pianist who played in clubs, drank a lot and dropped in and out; his two sisters were out of control. "We didn't eat meals together and we had free run. My mom would see me going out the door with a six-pack and say, 'Have fun.' "
Megan's not talking about it tonight, but her story is not all that different. She was the youngest and the only girl her family. In high school, she played tennis competitively and was a waitress after school to save money for a car and a trip to Europe as a pompom girl. Her parents doted on her and couldn't wait for her to start reeling in the boyfriends. "When I was 15, I started dating a college boy, and for my mom, that was just the apex," Megan told me. Tennis kept her straight for a while, but after she suffered a serious ankle injury in her senior year, her "safeguard" was gone and she started drinking as competitively as she had played tennis. She spent summers at Delaware beaches, where, as she says, "it's always happy hour somewhere," and it wasn't long before she had "quite a reputation as party girl." "Makes me sick now to think of it," she says. Billy Joel and Jackson Browne provided the soundtrack for her life. She says now: "I still wake up some mornings with the lyrics of their songs running through my head. Unbelievable! Anyone who thinks music doesn't affect teens is woefully unaware."
Both she and Steve found Christ when they hooked up with a teen ministry called Young Life. Steve was impressed by the "air of confidence" and "inner peace" he detected in a Young Life staff member named Scott, who was then 24 but willing to hang out with teenagers. "There was something about him that was different, and it kept bugging me and I kept asking him and he kept saying Jesus Christ." Steve didn't want to hear that at first, but after a while he and Scott started talking about the Bible, and something fell into place.
As for Megan, she says she got sick of the beach scene and the sense of purposelessness that washed over her every morning. She found she needed to stop worrying about "having the right boyfriend" to "try and be quiet and learn who it was Christ called me to be." She had started calling herself a Christian in high school, but she hadn't really admitted her sinfulness, let alone renounced it. As a sophomore at West Chester College in Pennsylvania, she finally did, and her "measuring stick" became the Word of God. "He wasn't interested in what I looked like on the outside, but who I was on the inside. Galatians 5:22 says, 'The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.' Suddenly instead of looking in the mirror to see how I was doing, I had to check my heart." She found it an enormous relief "to have the focus off me, me, me."
Megan and Steve initially shocked their families with their conversions. One of Steve's sisters, now a Christian herself, was then a graduate student in philosophy at Penn and told him he was "committing intellectual suicide." Megan's mother, "an intelligent woman who considered herself a feminist," as Megan recalls, thought her only daughter was ruining her life. Considering this was at the end of the Me Decade, Steve and Megan were choosing a radical path indeed.
In the Young Life chapter they joined at West Chester, Steve and Megan were the two resident sticklers. They were the ones who, if somebody in Bible study suggested going out for beers afterward, would catch each other's eyes and say naaah. They were friends first, but their sense of needing to start life anew -- their joint weariness with their past selves -- brought them closer, and they married just after Steve joined the Navy. He was 23 and she was a year younger. Now the two of them have created a life that sometimes, as Steve jokes with the class that night, "can look a little like a bad 'Ozzie and Harriet' rerun."
"Hey," interrupts a young mother in the class. "There are worse things!"
It could be a rallying cry for the group.
10:30 a.m., a school day at the Scheibners'. It's a scene remarkable, as usual, for its orderliness. Everybody has been up since at least 7:30 (all the kids go to bed by 8:30, so rising early is no problem); they've completed their morning clean-up chores, which Megan reminds them of by affixing a yellow Post-it with a specific assignment directly onto each child's body. They have sung hymns, read some Scripture and gone over their catechisms for the day; they have said the Pledge of Allegiance together. The house is warm and tidy and smells pleasantly of the chili Megan is cooking for lunch.
Downstairs, in the sunny family room, Baleigh is quietly playing a computer game, while Stephen, the baby, bounces up and down in his playpen. In the "library," a room lined with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves made by Steve, Molly is practicing her handwriting, while Nate works on his reading and tries not to let his mind wander to the dinosaur picture he wants to draw when it's free time. Emma perches on a high stool at the kitchen counter, doing sums in her math book. Upstairs, at a pair of scuffed red old-fashioned school desks, Katie studies grammar while Peter reads about Jamestown in a textbook called "America's Providential History." ("Since God is the author of history and He is carrying out His plan on the earth through history, any view of the history of America, or any country, that ignores God is not true history.")
A week at the Scheibner household follows a neat and repetitive arc, constructed along what the Scheibners call the Loving Our Family Guidelines. Each day has a theme, and a biblical verse to go with it. Monday is Ministry Day ("For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints and do minister," Hebrews 6:10). On this day, the children might deliver meals to sick or housebound neighbors. Tuesday is Give Day ("For God so loved the world that He gave his only Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life," John 3:16), and so in addition to their regular schoolwork, the kids are supposed to think of something to give one another. Wednesday is Serve Day ("By love serve one another," Galatians 5:13), and the Scheibners do so by performing each other's chores. The family spends every Wednesday evening at Awana Bible Club, a Bible memorization program with about 80 kids in its local chapter. Thursday is Edify Day ("Love edifies," I Corinthians 8:1), which means the kids are supposed to make an effort to compliment each other -- and not in a fakey way either. Friday is Prefer Day ("Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love, in honor preferring one another," Romans 12:10), which means, for example, letting your sibling pick the hymn the family will sing in the morning. Friday evenings, Katie and Peter help set up the refreshments for the parenting class, then put the younger kids to bed. Saturday is mostly a preamble to Sunday, but sometimes Megan and the older kids will do some volunteer work at the local homeless shelter, and then follow it up with a special treat -- a trip to Friendly's, a rented Shirley Temple video, a game of red rover in the backyard.
One consequence of teaching your children at home -- and of carefully customizing their media intake -- is that you almost never have the experience of hearing them say something you are surprised and sorry that they know. Maybe your 3-year-old comes home one day with a rather specific question about pro wrestling. Or maybe he has somehow sucked out of the cultural ether the message that you "gotta catch 'em all." Maybe your kid is older and it's something worse. Home-schooling appeals to the parental fantasy of unchallenged dominion over -- or at the very least familiarity with -- all the detritus that crowds the shelves of your child's "moral warehouse."
I think all parents must be subject to this desire now and again, though comparatively few are willing to remake their lives in the service of it. If your kid were with you all the time, you figure, she would not ask questions that reminded you of your lapses in judgment or vigilance; she would not be in possession of information that you regarded with embarrassment or regret. On the other hand, neither would she be likely to come home with a delightful bit of knowledge that you had nothing to do with putting in her head -- a sweet and silly song, a smattering of Spanish, a moral lesson as imparted by someone else -- because you might not have known it, perhaps, or thought to plant it there.
Once I asked Steve and Megan if any of their kids ever did come out and say something that shocked them or made them wonder where he or she could possibly have heard it. "That doesn't happen often," Steve replied. "Every now and then we get one of those, but we spend so much time together that it just doesn't happen."
Megan and Steve tend not to let their own guard down much around their kids either. Lately, in fact, they have even stopped watching movies with more adult themes by themselves. "We never did used to rent R- rated movies," Steve says, "but we would get a movie that would use some curse words or maybe had some brief nudity." They'd watch it after the kids were asleep and "justify it by saying, 'Oh, but it's a great story.' Well, now we've changed our view on that. I can't ask them to do something I'm not willing to do," Steve continues. "I don't want to be a hypocrite. And you know my relationship with God is just the same as theirs. My soul and my spirit is just as precious to God as their little souls and their little spirits, so how can I justify watching something that is vulgar and obscene for them? Isn't it vulgar and obscene for me too?"
To many of us, the specter of so much control suggests the possibility, even the inevitability, of rebellion. The Scheibners' oldest children are 12 and 11. What happens when they hit their teen years? Won't their hermetically sealed world spring a leak? Generational self-definition is a dearly held precept in our culture, which is why it seems to make sense to us that both Megan and Steve come from religiously indifferent families in which they defiantly distinguished themselves by their theological conservatism.
When you ask the Scheibners to imagine the future for their own kids, though, they can't picture them going astray. Peter has wanted to be a missionary for the longest time now, and since he and his parents regard this as something he has been called to do, they entertain few doubts about his doing it. Admittedly, it's hard to imagine Peter as a renegade. He is the kind of kid who, when asked in all innocence whether he ever listens furtively to his beloved "Lord of the Rings" tape in bed, looks shocked and says, "Oh, no, when it's time to go to bed, it's time to go to bed." He loves being home-schooled, and not long ago took it upon himself to write a letter to Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. It read, in part, "I have the joy of knowing I am going to heaven because when I was 4, I asked Jesus to come into my heart and save me from sin."
After spending some time with the Scheibner family, I was not particularly surprised to learn that evangelical Christians have one of the highest intergenerational retention rates of any major religion -- meaning that, as Christian Smith puts it, "they have a great ability to raise children who do not become theologically liberal or nonreligious when they grow up." Certainly they work extremely hard to prevent what they see as the tragedy of apostasy. And the new availability of Christian media and of home-school curriculums helps enormously. A generation ago, evangelical families who wanted to shield their children from mainstream culture had little to replace it with, other than self-denial. Now they can offer goodies of their own. And new companies and institutions are springing up all the time to meet their needs. The Scheibners, for instance, are very excited about the founding of the first college primarily for Christian home-schoolers, Patrick Henry, in Purcelleville, Va., which will be accepting its inaugural class of students in the fall. Among other things, Patrick Henry will ask its students to sign a pledge in which they promise to court and not date.
And after college? Neither Megan nor Steve is outright opposed to their daughters' working, especially before they have children. Like many conservative Christians, they warm to the idea of a wife running her own little business from the home. "Proverbs 31 talks about the woman who made purple linens at home and sold them," Steve points out. But they warm even more to the idea of their daughters "having an eye to serve without compensation," as Megan says. They think too many working women have forgotten the virtues of volunteerism. And if one of their girls was to pursue a full-fledged career, Steve says, "we'd still love her and encourage her and, after all, at some point it's her life," but they would also find it hard to disguise their disappointment. "A career takes away from what I think their primary happiness will be, which is being a good mother," Steve says.
And then he gives a little speech that bears the distinctive hallmarks of the new Christian counterculture. "You know," he says, "you may have lots of pats on the back at work, you may have a successful career and a lot of money and great cars to drive, but in the end it always lets you down. Look at any number of gazillionaires out there -- men, women, it doesn't make any difference -- who have awful, tragic lives. Those things are not the things that satisfy. The things that satisfy are raising a good family, having love."
America has a long history of separatist movements, and within that history, there are, to put it bluntly, the bad separatists and the good ones. In the former category are the stockpilers of guns, the people who don't pay taxes or vaccinate their children -- people who lack any sense of their duty as citizens. And in the latter category are people like the Scheibners. Indeed you could argue that their sort of separatism is good for the culture at large -- or at least represents a reasonable compromise. If they are committed to teaching Creationism, for example, better that they teach it at home than insist that the public schools do. Besides, a culture that lacks a thriving and reproving counterculture is always in trouble. The very existence of alternative ways of life like the Scheibners' keeps alive a debate about the role of morality and religion in our culture and politics that probably ought never be declared over and done.
And yet you have to wonder about a way of life that requires such rigorous policing of its psychic boundaries. There is something poignant, for a parent like me anyway, about the idea of sons and daughters who love you as uncomplicatedly in their teenage years as they do when they were small -- who are, indeed, your best friends -- but there is something unreal about it too. There is something inspiring about the prospect of an American childhood in which advertising does not invade the imagination so relentlessly, but something claustrophobic about the notion that the only alternative is a sequestered family life. There is something fundamentally right and useful about the argument that American culture promotes independence at the expense, often, of the more nurturing virtues, but something sad and scared about the idea that the safest solution to this is early marriage. If the Scheibner philosophy allows girls to linger longer at the threshold of adolescence -- not having to worry about being thin or sexy -- it also pushes them much earlier into wifely domesticity.
By next summer, the Scheibners will be living in Maine, and they are looking forward to the move. Steve is eager to "plant" his new church. Megan thinks "the slower pace of life" there will make it that much easier to shelter the children from evil. The younger kids are excited about going crabbing and maybe seeing a moose or two on the rambling, wooded acreage where their new house will be. Katie, the oldest, is excited, too. She says she's hoping to find "a little place of my own, where I could read or think, and nobody would know about it."

The White Death
 Tragedy and Heroism in an Avalanche Zone.
 By McKay Jenkins.
 Illustrated. 228 pp. New York:
 Random House. $23.95. 
 A friend of mine was caught in an avalanche in the Cascade Range five years ago. I heard about the event two years later, and after that, whenever I saw her, I sneaked glances when she wasn't looking. I was compelled. She was now different -- like the girl in high school who had had an abortion or the survivor of a car wreck. She and I had trod the same exhilarating peaks and dangerous crevasses, but she had been trapped and now wore that mysterious, magnetic tiara that comes with survival. Our voyeuristic wondering is the central seduction of "The White Death," by McKay Jenkins. What is it like to be in an avalanche: the chaos, the horror, the dark conclusion as tons of snow settle like concrete around you? A twisted fascination sustains us through the story of five men, all under the age of 22 and competent mountaineers, who died on Dec. 29, 1969, during a winter attempt on the brutal north face of Mount Cleveland in Glacier National Park. It is clear from the outset that Jerry Kanzler, Clare Pogreba, Ray Martin, Mark Levitan and James Anderson will not survive. Yet we are led through a six-month, 228-page death march.
Norman Maclean's "Young Men and Fire" explores similar terrain. In both books the setting is rural Montana, and the task at hand is for a community to make sense of tragedy through a desperate reconstruction of events. What game of cosmic roulette allows vital young men to be snuffed out or, in the case of "The White Death," wiped off the face of the earth?
This book does rumble and move, but not before we slog through several relatively static chapters. Jenkins starts at the very beginning: snow. There are 10 kinds: "plates, stellars, needles, columns, capped columns, spatial dendrites, graupel, sleet, hail and a catchall category called 'irregulars.' "
This kind of minutiae might keep a Weather Channel fan on seat's edge, but eventually the details skirt the border of tedium. But just as the book starts to feel as placid as a snowfield, we're swept headlong into the young men's plight and, for the duration, a deft exploration of mountain history and culture. Jenkins retraces the victims' last days and recounts the huge rescue mission. Why do young men risk their lives and the lives of those who will try to rescue them against all good sense and advice? Are they driven by empty bravado and a youthful lack of judgment and humility? Or rather, is risk-taking the stuff of men? As one of the boys' former scoutmasters says: "Without this burning desire to conquer we would as a nation long since be reduced to a covey of slaves. This has to be what our greatest leaders, explorers, scientists, journalists, doctors are made of." Jenkins suggests that this macho approach may be particularly Western, and explores how Eastern and Native American beliefs reflect a different ethos. "The Judeo-Christian notion of mankind's having 'dominion' over nature has contributed immeasurably to his sense of isolation and alienation from the natural world," Jenkins says, citing the Zen scholar D. T. Suzuki, and the image of a mountaineer conquering a mountain can be seen only as a predictably neurotic outgrowth of this. "We of the Orient have never conceived Nature in the form of an opposing power," Suzuki says. "On the contrary, Nature has been our constant friend and companion. . . . The idea of conquest is abhorrent."
Take sport mountaineering's mostly Euro roots, toss in a bit of contemporary narcissism, and a whole new profile emerges. Jenkins quotes Edwin Bernbaum, the author of "Sacred Mountains of the World," who writes, "In keeping with the individualistic nature of their sport, climbers tend to view mountains as centers in a personal rather than a cosmic sense."
Meanwhile, the cosmic outlook among the rescuers scrambling about Glacier National Park is glum, and hopes of finding anyone alive are plummeting. Interviews with avalanche survivors yield a vivid picture of what might have been the boys' final moments, and a flashcard version of survival probability emerges. If you've managed (1) not to have your neck snapped, (2) to have the presence of mind and ability to create an air pocket and (3) not to suffocate because of the snowball in your mouth, then, on average, you have bought yourself 30 minutes. Of course, if nobody saw you go under, that half-hour doesn't do much good.
By the time Ray Martin's head and arms dangle from a snow cavern five months after the accident, when the search is resumed with the spring thaw, the families have entered a different stage of grief and the rescuers' new job is body retrieval. The long rope that still ties the five bodies together reveals what happened. The young men didn't have to hang in a dimensionless, chilling stasis for 30 minutes. Their fatal chaotic descent was two miles long, and they dropped 1,500 vertical feet.
THE epilogue soberly cites (almost as if the author, who teaches literature and nonfiction writing at the University of Delaware, worried about the book glorifying this tragedy) the innumerable avalanches that happen each year. The adventure industry, in part because of the booming economy and its moneyed clientele, is walking on thin ice indeed. Ski resorts push boundaries, and sports like heli-skiing are growing in popularity. Electronic gadgets offer false security to the inexperienced, and advertising depicts outdoor risk-taking as the only true way to reach one's potential. "The White Death" zeroes in on our relationship with the natural world, rather than just merely standing in awe of its power or making this tragedy another notch in the adventure-as-commodity belt. "It is not the physics or the conditions" that make the mountain dangerous, Jenkins says. "It is the presence of people."
Walking on an unstable slope or checking gauges six fathoms down requires us to pay Very Close Attention. This focusing starts the heart, and sometimes creates the plot on which a survivor hangs the garland. Thus, a new heroism is born. It seems unlikely that "The White Death" will send young climbers to scale Mount Cleveland's dangerous north face in search of this new heroism. Mount Cleveland is not a sexy iconic mountain like Everest. But of course, there is the power of avalanches -- and there is the power of publishing.

 BODY:

1. In a Kidbot world, Patty Playpal is just so last century, but if you're old enough to remember that disconcertingly life-size plastic companion, you're also old enough to remember giant rollers (do frozen-juice cans ring a bell?), like the ones Christophe Saluzzo used to give Chandler Hecht's hair that extra lift. There was no star attitude on this set. During the time it took to do her hair, Chandler, 6, who that very morning had calmly reminded her mother, Ellen, that "this is my first print assignment," read (a) "Sayonara, Mrs. Kackleman" (Barnes & Noble, $17). Shawn Huang (b) also submitted cheerfully to the indignities of rollers -- which is a lot to ask of anyone, especially a 5-year-old guy.
 
2. All models were required to do two sittings in front of the camera -- one as themselves and one in metallic paint for their "robot." Ryan Dozier (a), also on his first print job, thought the assignment was "pretty interesting," reported his mother, Paulette McGee. But he was intent on making sure that all of the metallic paint was off him before the end of the day, fearing his brothers would tease him. Would that he had had (b) Shower Blast GeLather in Orange Missile with real fruit juice that "explodes" in lather (www.body-at-best.com, $6).
 
3. The robot heads were created by Todd Tucker of Wonderworld Entertainment. Tucker has created makeup for movies like "The Mask," "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Dracula." Michael Elins then photographed the heads and married them with images of the kids. He used a Mac equipped with Adobe Photoshop 5.5 and a Wacom tablet that allows him to augment the digital effects with illustration. The entire process takes at least a week. To ensure that the concept was authentic, a futurist from the RAND Corporation and a robot designer from Jet Propulsion Laboratory were consulted.
 
4. Aibo, the robot dog from Sony, now qualifies as a global fetish. Ten thousand Americans were chosen by lottery to purchase the $2,500 pooch before Christmas, and demand was so exorbitant that Sony sold them again this month (until last Friday). Sadly, there are no additional production plans. But there's always eBay, where you can expect to pay even more.
 
5. Of course, price is no object when a girl loves a shoe. However, these sandals by Stride Rite are, at $27, very reasonable, Mom.
 
6. Besides chicken breasts with peanut sauce, vegetable salads and green beans, Loesha Zeviar of GoodFood Catering prepared kid-friendly lunch classics like macaroni and cheese, chocolate cupcakes decorated with flowers (a) and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. And speaking of jam, G Star Jam Gel (b), $10 at Zitomer (969 Madison Avenue), is a soap for washing out fresh little kids' mouths. Of which there were none.
 
7. Fresh is the definition of these vintage jeans appliqued by Ellen Hecht, who runs a clothing business called Reciprocity (310-271-5573) when she's not ferrying daughter Chandler to and from assignments.
 
8. Robotic clones are just the beginning: Kevin Warwick, a professor of cybernetics at the University of Reading, in Britain, had a chip implanted in his body as the first part of an ongoing effort to see how up close and personal we can get with our computers. For nine days, while the implant was in Warwick's arm, his whereabouts, he reports in the February issue of Wired, were monitored by a computer that was able to perform simple tasks like opening doors for him. Within the next two years, Warwick hopes to have another chip implanted that will tap into his central nervous system and enable him to communicate intranervously with his wife, Irena, who, if all goes well, will be outfitted, too.

 BODY:
The Internet, a phenomenon that has filled the pages of newspapers and magazines since 1995, is now emptying a few of their newsroom cubicles.
Beautyscene.com, Business.com, Cybergold.com, Drspock.com, Goodhome .com, Office.com, Petopia.com, Rivals .com, VoxCap.com, Women.com. The names are new enough to befuddle even the most dot-com obsessed observer, but they are becoming irritatingly familiar to newspaper and magazine editors, as one seasoned journalist after another is lured away to the Internet. 
 The sites listed above, for instance, have recently attracted a Los Angeles bureau chief from The Wall Street Journal, a New York Times copy editor, a Seattle Times sportswriter, an assistant city editor at The San Francisco Chronicle, a Chicago bureau chief from Business Week, a business writer and a copy editor from The San Jose Mercury News, the beauty director of Elle, a Fortune columnist and the editor of American HomeStyle and Gardening.
A more complete list, including better-known sites like Forbes.com, CNN.com, America Online, Salon.com, Slate and TheStreet.com, and Internetcentric magazines like The Industry Standard, Red Herring and Fast Company, might fill an entire column of newspaper type. If journalists from trade publications and recent journalism school graduates were thrown in, the names and their associated dot-coms would fill a whole page.
Publications in the West Coast high-technology centers like Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose are particularly vulnerable, as are those covering financial news, technology, sports, health and beauty.
Even journalists familiar with the unproven financial strategies of many sites have taken the leap. "Six months to a year ago, I wouldn't have dreamed that I would be leaving The Journal and doing anything like this," said Peter Gumbel, the departing Los Angeles bureau chief of the Dow Jones newspaper and the incoming editor of Business.com, a business information site created by eCompanies of Santa Monica, Calif.
"This was an opportunity The Journal couldn't provide," Mr. Gumbel added. "I had this image of my daughter saying to me in 20 years' time, 'What did you do in the Internet revolution, Daddy?' If I had to stand there and say, 'Nothing special, dear.' " His voice trailed off.
Then Mr. Gumbel, a former Moscow correspondent, added that he had found the technology revolution just as transforming as the collapse of Communism. Only this time, he asked himself, "Do I want to be an observer or a participant?" So, at 42, Mr. Gumbel is pocketing a fistful of stock options in his new company and preparing to be editor in chief of an enterprise whose journalists are mostly yet to be hired and whose editorial product is yet to be shaped.
The magazine industry, too, has been losing people for several years, most recently the head of one of the top magazine companies.
John Heins, the chief executive of Gruner & Jahr Publishing -- a unit of Bertelsmann that publishes Family Circle, McCall's and Parents -- took a job as a vice president of sales and international operations at Netscape, a unit of America Online.
Mr. Heins said that he had been exploring ways to bring Gruner & Jahr up to Internet speed when he became intrigued with Internet culture. "I became fascinated by the industry," he said. "I wanted to be in the middle of it."
At Gruner & Jahr, he found it hard to keep the dot-com raiders from his staff. "We have had an incredible number of cases where you have a person making $60,000 a year who gets lured away with $100,000 and stock options," he said.
The exact number of Internet journalism jobs is impossible to pin down. But Marsha Stoltman, who ran a recent Editor & Publisher conference on interactive newspapers, said the migration from old media to new media "has yet to peak."
Editors like Michael R. Fancher of The Seattle Times and David Yarnold of Knight Ridder's San Jose Mercury News, while acknowledging some irritating losses, see the phenomenon as part of a broader dynamism within the newspaper industry -- driven by a booming economy and old media's need to hire for its own Internet sites.
"The total loss last year was 11 people," Mr. Yarnold said about his newspaper, "and 11 people out of 400 or more does not constitute a crisis or a brain drain." With the newsroom expanding by 26 people -- including 16 technology reporters -- the newspaper is on a hiring binge.
Still, aware of the high premium that Internet companies place on journalists who know their world, he said that The Mercury News pays technology reporters a premium of perhaps 10 percent more than it does other reporters.
Mr. Fancher of The Seattle Times believes that "the real question is who will develop a business model that sustains quality journalism." He added: "Journalists recognize that new media may or may not be a place to do journalism. People who are in this for the craft or the public service aren't so concerned about stock options."
Still, both old and new media managers say options are a successful lure, since they could be worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars -- unless the company crashed.
Steve Outing, who has covered Internet journalism for years for Editor & Publisher Interactive, believes there is "a real brain drain," though he added, "It's hard to quantify."
He said that the real impact was likely to be felt by the smallest newspapers. "They get people right out of college," he said. "They don't pay well. When I got out of college -- this was 1978 -- the major alternatives were public relations or technical writing. One of the offers I got was a technical writing position, which paid double the newspaper salary. I took the newspaper job because it was more exciting.
"Now would a kid coming out of college take a newspaper job because of the glamour? I doubt it. The dot-coms are glamorous themselves."
Geoffrey Cowan, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California, estimated that 10 percent of the journalists who graduated in June went to Internet concerns. But, he added, "The dot-coms are paying in the high 40's and low 50's, whereas the print outlets are paying their entering journalists in the high 20's."
Andy Wang, who began teaching this year at the graduate school of journalism at the University of Missouri after four years in online journalism, said, "Clearly the students have no desire to get a fact-checking job with Esquire when they can get $50,000 plus options at a Web site."
The Web sites that are most attractive to magazine employees tend to be those that cover beauty, home design and decoration and finance. In 1999, almost a dozen editors left women's magazines like Glamour, Allure, Cosmopolitan and Vogue to join beauty retail sites like Eve.com, Beautyjungle.com, Beautyscene.com and Sephora.com.
In one case, Jean Godfrey-June, the beauty director of the Lagardere magazine Elle for six years, left the magazine last August to become Beautyscene.com's editor in chief, and Elle was not able to fill the post until January.
Doug Turshen, editor in chief of Goodhome.com, left his job last September as editor in chief of American HomeStyle and Gardening, published by Gruner & Jahr. Mr. Turshen said the attraction Net sites associated with home design was their depth and retail possibilities.
"If you presented rooms and merchandise in a magazine, well, you had rooms and merchandise," he said. "On a Web site, you can present a room full of ottomans, and the viewer can buy everything."
At The Seattle Times, which lost people to Microsoft in the mid-1990's and to MSNBC.com three years ago, the last year has been marked by attrition of a different sort. "Only a handful of the people who left went to interactive media," Mr. Fancher said. "In our case, the drain is not to new media, it's to traditional media in a very competitive market."
In some cases, people join sites after writing about them. Jodi Mardesich of the Time Warner magazine Fortune wrote in a column on Fortune's Web site last week that she was leaving Fortune's Silicon Valley bureau for Drspock.com. She wrote, "What if I could write about a topic that's meaningful to me and create something valuable at the same time?"
But some defectors return. Danny O'Neil was a summer intern in The Seattle Times's sports section in 1997 before he headed for the Internet, eventually landing at ESPN.com. Last year, he came back to The Times to cover high school sports.
"I came back for less money," he said. "I want to write. In my experience, people in the Internet are looking for scores. They don't digest long articles." He concluded: "I wasn't going to come out of there being a reporter. I didn't want to be part of the quick hit."

HEADLINE: I.B.M. to Introduce Advance in Chip Manufacturing

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
Technologists for I.B.M. will describe new details this week of a next-generation chip-making system that uses beams of electrons, rather than light waves, to etch circuits onto chips.
The company believes the technology will make it possible in the future to shrink individual circuits to a size nearly as small as atoms. 
 The new system, which I.B.M. is developing in cooperation with the Nikon Corporation, has created excitement in the semiconductor industry as word of it has spread in recent months. There have been growing concerns that current lithographic systems, which project light waves to etch circuit patterns on silicon wafers, may be reaching fundamental physical limits.
The new details will be presented by Hans C. Pfeiffer, who is an I.B.M. researcher at the company's semiconductor research center in East Fishkill, N.Y. He will make his report at an industry conference sponsored by SPIE, the International Society for Optical Engineering, this week in Santa Clara, Calif.
Although the semiconductor industry has already developed techniques for using ever-shortening wavelengths of light to reduce circuit size in the chip-making process, each new generation has required tremendous engineering feats. The cost of light-wave etching is rising to levels that may soon be prohibitive.
Electron beam systems have been explored in chip-making research efforts for decades. But the new I.B.M. system, known as Prevail, for Projection Reduction Exposure With Variable Axis Immersion Lenses, could represent an advance in throughput -- the speed at which silicon wafers can be processed.
In the past, I.B.M. has used so-called e-beam manufacturing systems in making specialized semiconductor chips used in its mainframe computers. But the company has acknowledged that those systems could not process wafers quickly enough to be economically viable in mainstream chip applications.
With light-wave etching, the circuitry can be projected at once onto the surface of the chip. With electron-beam etching, past systems have required millions of circuits to be etched, in effect, a line at a time. But I.B.M.'s new system can project a pattern of electrons to etch many lines of circuits simultaneously.
"We have been thinking very hard about the next big step forward in throughput," Mr. Pfeiffer said in a telephone interview on Friday.
The alliance with Nikon was announced last year after Nikon executives expressed confidence the technology could be successfully commercialized.
"When we started working with Nikon they were very concerned that this would ultimately not work out and they would be embarrassed," Mr. Pfeiffer said. "Only when we reached certain levels of performance were they ready to announce this to the world."
He acknowledged the two companies had not yet completed a working model based on their technical advances, but said he believed such a step was now possible.
I.B.M and Nikon are in a race in this field with Lucent Technologies. Lucent and the semiconductor equipment makers Applied Materials and ASM Lithography N.V. are building a similar electron beam system, which is named Scalpel.
The systems function in a manner similar to -- but much more sophisticated than -- the electron beam technology that is used to rapidly scan the images appearing on television screens and desktop computer monitors. The systems could advance quickly enough to begin to play a role within the next two generations of chip-making gear, I.B.M. said.
That would be a faster transition than has been assumed until now by the semiconductor industry, which has planned for light-wave etching to be the principal technology through the next two and possibly three generations of semiconductor manufacturing, beginning in 2007.
"Optical is hitting real-world limits," said Richard Doherty, the president of Envisioneering, a Seaford, L.I., computer industry consulting firm. "Ultimately, electron beam systems will be a replacement technology."
The I.B.M.-Nikon Prevail system is based on the ability to steer a small electron beam through a series of magnetic lenses that can achieve the same ultra-sharp resolution on the edges of the projection field as in the center of the field.
Making a working system requires the ability to control a remarkable dance in which the wafer and the mask containing the circuit pattern are continuously moved while the electron beam is switched on and off as it shifts from circuit to circuit.

HEADLINE: THE RURAL LIFE;
Voices From a Forgotten Landscape

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG 

 BODY:
The premise of the American West has always been that there is another west lying just over the horizon, a place to annul the past, to re-originate. That premise was never completely true, but it was a way of making sense of such a vast quantity of land. Now, however, the next west lies well within the circle of the immediate horizon, and it is annulling the past at an unforgiving, and unforgivable, rate. East of Denver, heading west, you almost hate to come to a ridgeline on the prairie for fear of what will unfold before you. First a lone outpost of houses clustering on a slope, still raw from the earthmovers' work, then garrison after garrison of signature subdivisions closing in on Denver itself.
For many Coloradans, a kind of geographical fatigue has set in, fatigue being another word for a sense of helplessness. The old wounds -- the places where a megamall or a new crowd of houses has replaced hayfields and pastures -- do not necessarily heal in the minds of some of the drivers inching through Boulder, for instance. The shock of the new does not necessarily go away when the new turns less new. All around the fringes of Denver, you come across roads like one I took across Lafayette a few weeks ago. On one side of the highway, the old pattern of land use was still visible -- aging farmsteads, mostly shorn of their outlying acres, set back from the pavement among mature windbreaks. On the other side, the bare earth was glazed with freezing rain, which fell as well on a sinuous array of newly built houses, already hard-wired for an alternate reality. The highway, until recently a rural road, had become a two-lane bypass for irritable commuters. 
 I often think about some words written a few years before the Ghost Dance massacre at Wounded Knee, more than a century ago, by R. B. Cunninghame Graham, an English horseman, essayist and politician. Graham, who had spent years in Texas, Mexico and South America, was commenting on the Indian question in The Daily Graphic. "The bulk of mankind," he wrote, "declare that a prairie with corn growing on it, and a log house or two with a corrugated iron roof, is a more pleasing sight than the same prairie with a herd of wild horses on it, and the beaver swimming in every creek."
But these two scenes -- the log-house prairie and the wild-horse prairie and even the old farmsteads near Lafayette -- are now so distant in time that they almost seem to us to be the same place. In America, we've learned to dismiss rural life as a relic of the past, and in so doing have made it easier to justify the sprawl now girdling every city in this nation. Where asphalt-shingled houses spread across the horizon, it sometimes looks like the ash a prairie fire leaves behind. The houses spread almost as fast as prairie fire, but their effect is longer lasting. They are monuments to incomplete arguments, to false assumptions about economic progress and demographic necessity. The strange part is that those endless new streets and new houses almost always enshrine an idea of land use, of community, of living itself, that is already old and failing, an experiment that is tried and found wanting day after day.
Moreover, what you do in one place affects what you do elsewhere. Denver and its environs are the proof. If you turn the Rockies into a playground or, at best, an idealized wilderness, and if you reduce agricultural living to a vestige of an almost forgotten past, then you have cleared the ground for paving the rest of the state clear to Kansas in one direction and to Wyoming in another. To speak from the rural conscience -- to say, simply, that this is the wrong way to go about things, reflecting a deep human venality and a willingness to be bribed into ignorance -- is to speak from a place of silence, where no one expects to hear wisdom anymore.

HEADLINE: The Next Leader of the I.M.F.

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund, the guardian of global financial stability, will soon select its next director. Unhappily, and true to form, it is proceeding in secret, with little opportunity for the public to appraise the leading candidates or their views on critical questions about the future of the fund. The lack of openness is intolerable for one of the world's most influential organizations.
The fund's primary mission is to stamp out currency crises like those that struck Korea, Thailand and Russia in recent years. In exchange for a bailout, the fund extracts commitments by beleaguered countries to change their monetary, fiscal, banking and other economic policies to the liking of the fund. 
 Critics accuse the fund of overreaching. It intervenes in dozens of countries, only some of which are in immediate financial turmoil, to fight poverty or to help shift their economies from socialism to capitalism. The fund's mixed record of success has led powerful members of Congress to ask whether the fund should leave issues of poverty and development to the World Bank. There are also important questions about whether the fund should bail out fewer countries, pour less money into bankrupt nations, impose less onerous conditions on its loans or lift the debt of poverty-stricken societies.
The next director will face these and many other difficult issues. Yet not one of the three top candidates has adequately described in public how he would handle them or made clear whether he would try to lead the fund in new directions.
Stanley Fischer, deputy director of the fund and a former chairman of the economics department at M.I.T, has been endorsed by several African and Arab countries. He is widely respected for his intelligence, policy acumen, experience and commitment to helping poor countries. If Mr. Fischer is prepared to rethink some of the fund's policies, and can shake free of the customs of an institution that he has helped lead since 1994, he would almost certainly be the best man for the job. The White House, which would doubtless like to see Mr. Fischer installed as director, cannot openly support him. The reason is an outdated gentlemen's agreement among nations that a European should run the I.M.F. while an American manages the World Bank.
For the moment, the leading European candidate is Caio Koch-Weser, deputy finance minister of Germany and a former official at the World Bank. Though he was effective at the World Bank, his leadership skills and qualifications to run the fund are questionable. The third candidate, Eisuke Sakakibara, a former vice minister of finance in Japan, is a sophisticated financial expert, but he has a parochial view of many global economic issues. He long extolled the superiority of Japanese economic institutions, even as his country sank into a decade-long hibernation.
The European members of the fund may decide as early as today to back Mr. Koch-Weser. The governing board of the I.M.F. could take a straw vote on its official candidates as early as this week. This is much too hasty. Whatever else the fund does in days ahead, it must shed the secrecy that surrounds its deliberations. The best way to begin is by opening up the process of selecting its next director.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ARIZONA SENATOR;
McCain Opposes Tax Breaks Important in Washington State

BYLINE: By DAVID BARSTOW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Two days before the Republican primary in Washington State, Senator John McCain said today that he opposed a tax provision that has saved some of that state's largest employers, including the Boeing Corporation and Microsoft, hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
During an appearance this morning on ABC's "This Week," Mr. McCain was asked if he supported a recent ruling by the World Trade Organization to eliminate foreign sales corporations, the off-shore subsidiaries that many United States companies set up to channel overseas sales through places like the Virgin Islands. 
 The United States does not tax sales made by those subsidiaries, nor does it impose duties when they transfer profits to their parent companies. Because of the provision, hundreds of United States companies, including Boeing, Microsoft and General Motors, avoided paying about $4 billion in federal taxes last year. Boeing alone saved $130 million in 1998.
Mr. McCain's rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has supported foreign sales corporations and his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said today, "The governor views the W.T.O. ruling as harmful to American companies that export."
But Mr. McCain, taking the side of the trade organization -- which is much reviled by labor and environmental groups in Washington State -- said that he opposed the corporate tax shelter. "We're spending millions of dollars to help McDonald's sell -- and I love McDonald's, don't get me wrong -- to help them sell hamburgers overseas," he said.
Asked to elaborate, Mr. McCain said that the protections are unnecessary. "We can compete with anybody in any market in the world because our products and our workers are the most productive," he said. "The answer is not to subsidize with taxpayers' dollars these major corporations and companies. The answer is to say to every country, 'Allow our products into your country and then we'll allow yours into ours and we'll compete on a level playing field.' "
The Clinton administration has strongly supported foreign sales corporations, arguing that the provision is necessary to level the playing field with the European tax system. But European analysts argued that the offshore tax havens violate W.T.O. rules that prohibit nations from subsidizing exports to make them more competitive.
Mr. McCain's aides shrugged off his comments on the program, saying they have come to expect him to restate long-held positions even when they exact a political price, and Mr. McCain's attacks on "corporate pork" are a major part of his stump speeches.
"John McCain historically will tell you what he thinks," said Warren Rudman, the former New Hampshire senator and national chairman of Mr. McCain's campaign. "And I watched that this morning and I understood that some people would not like it. But the bottom line is John McCain believes deeply that American corporations should not be subsidized or helped."
He said Mr. McCain was prepared to stick by his position even if it costs him votes in Washington State.

McCain Pulls Out of Debate
 (By The New York Times), WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 -- Senator John McCain has decided not to participate in a debate planned for Thursday in Los Angeles, his campaign spokesman said today. It was the only one scheduled for California before that state's primary on March 7.
Howard Opinsky, a spokesman for Mr. McCain, said the candidate had initially accepted the debate invitation, but then made other plans when Gov. George W. Bush delayed his decision to participate. The Bush campaign agreed to the debate on Feb. 23, almost three months after it had been invited by the debate's sponsors, CNN and The Los Angeles Times.
"By that point we had already changed our schedule," Mr. Opinsky said, adding that Mr. McCain was scheduled to hold a campaign rally in New York on Thursday night.
Governor Bush, on his way this evening from Austin, Tex., to Seattle, told reporters on his campaign plane: "He's going to have to explain why he's not going to the debate." And Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, accused the McCain campaign of pulling out because some polls show that Mr. Bush holds a substantial lead among California Republicans.
"It would appear that Senator McCain would be walking away from California and wants to concentrate his resources on New York," Mr. Fleischer said, a comment that Mr. Opinsky ridiculed as "completely disingenuous."

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Great Leap Backward

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The tectonic plates are shifting under China's political system. The resulting stress seems to be leading toward a political earthquake.
How else to explain Beijing's apparently irrational threat last week of growing readiness to take Taiwan by force? 
 Here is China, working closely with the Clinton administration to join the World Trade Organization, and thereby to further penetrate the American market while removing the annual human-rights pressure from the U.S.
And here is China, working in Washington to block the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, helping President Clinton prevent that nation of 22 million free Chinese from buying defenses against Beijing's new missile batteries across the Taiwan Strait.
At this critical moment, with both China's W.T.O. admission and Taiwan's anti-missile defense in the balance in Congress, Beijing's Communist leaders undermine Clinton's efforts to help them.
Moreover, they double-crossed Clinton in the most insulting way. The U.S. president sent a mission to Beijing headed by his closest diplomatic and military advisers. Their goal was to prevent any rash moves by China against dissidents or harsh rhetoric about Taiwan that would embarrass Clinton's pro-China backers in Congress.
But unbeknownst to our mission, the Beijing regime was preparing an 11,000-word white paper escalating the tension. Just after our delegation left, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was delivered the diplomatic equivalent of a slap in the face with a wet fish.
China's leaders are not crazy. The only rational explanation for their seemingly aberrant behavior is that a split in their leadership is widening rapidly. That severe internal stress could cause a lashing-out into war in the Strait.
One side -- the "half good" side behind Prime Minister Zhu Rongji -- while stifling political freedom at home, wants to take the capitalist road, loosen economic constraints, do business with the U.S. and join the W.T.O.
The far worse side -- behind President Jiang Zemin and the corrupt military-industrial cartels -- fears free trade, and counters worker and student unrest by arresting dissidents and cracking down on (and driving underground) the growing Falun Gong movement.
Clinton has been assuming that the half-good side behind Zhu is winning. That (and not just the suasion of his lucrative Riady connection) accounts for his flip-flop from "butchers of Beijing" to "strategic partners."
The tragedy is that the Jiang hard-liners are winning. To be charitable about the motive for Clinton's appeasement, see it as intended to help the better side -- but the practical result has been to enrich, embolden and empower those hard-core Communist despots whose families are tightly tied to the militarists.
That's why China sells arms to rogue states, why it sides stridently with Russia against the West on Kosovo and Iraq, and why it sent a mob to trash our embassy in deliberately violent response to our accidental bombing. Most important, the failure of Clinton's appeasement is revealed in China's sharp escalation of military threats to Taiwan.
Jiang's Communist militarists have recently seen what a dose of nationalist fervor can do to keep a repressive regime in power. They watched how Vladimir Putin used "breakaway Chechnya" as his scapegoat to take workers' minds off economic distress, and how Washington reacted by admiring his intellect and thereby supporting his election. They have been making the same noises about "breakaway Taiwan" as Putin did before his popular rape of the Chechens.
America's policy must not reward the Jiang adventurists by extending them W.T.O. membership and by failing to be the arsenal of Taiwan's democracy. That would further enervate Jiang's internal opposition in the Forbidden City.
Our candidates for President, Al Gore included, should call on Clinton and Congress to respond with resolution to the new intimidation of Taiwan. The way to prevent war -- and the terrible decision that would face the next president -- is to make clear now that belligerent threats by Beijing's dominant faction trigger consequences that will weaken China.

HEADLINE: Booksellers Grab a Young Wizard's Cloaktails

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
The young and Harry-saturated arrived at Joseph-Beth Booksellers in Cincinnati in numbers that startled adults like a Hogwarts magic spell.
Even the 9-year-olds were desperate; they had exhausted the available supply of three Harry Potter books with frequent readings and yearned for some palliatives until the fourth book appears sometime this summer. 
 And so the folks at Joseph-Beth, who organized the group and christened it the Harry Potter Withdrawal Club, comforted its members with the adventures of Dorothy in "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz," and with "The Book of Three," the first volume in a 35-year-old series about a gallant pig keeper named Taran and his nemesis, the grim Horn King.
"I've been doing kids' books for 10 years, and I've never seen anything like this, kids coming in and saying give me something like this book," said Wendi Gratz, a children's buyer for the Joseph-Beth chain, who counted 20 children ages 9 to 13 at the inaugural meeting of the club, one of literally hundreds that have been organized by bookstores around the country.
Such is the literary halo effect of J. K. Rowling's best-selling fantasy series. It has turned knobby-kneed Harry Potter into the Medici patron of children's literature.
Last year the sales of children's books soared on the windstream of Harry's Nimbus 2000 flying broom. Classics like C. S. Lewis's "Chronicles of Narnia" experienced an otherwise inexplicable burst in popularity, as did newer fantasy titles like Brian Jacques's "Redwall" series, which had been selling well and steadily over the years until Hogwarts magic gave it a sudden lift.
The Potter series -- with more than 18.5 million copies in print from its publisher, Scholastic -- accounted for much of the general sales growth in children's literature. Last year paperback sales alone increased almost 24 percent to $660 million and hardcover sales grew more than 11 percent to $1.6 billion.
Publishers said they suspected that the sales were buoyed, in part, by a prosperous economy, but that theory does not extend to adult books. Hardcover sales to adults increased a modest 2.6 percent to $2.8 billion last year, while trade paperback sales grew a little more than 3 percent to almost $2 billion.
That literary divide was sharply apparent this month when youthful readers demonstrated their growing cultural clout. For the first time, five children's novels elbowed aside the grown-up fare on the fiction best-seller list of The New York Times on Feb. 20, with a sixth juvenile title, "Holes," by Louis Sachar, hovering on the fringes of best-sellerdom. (The Times is now considering creating a separate children's list.)
All of the best-selling children's novels -- three of them the Harry Potter titles -- are 230 to 400 pages and emphasize a linear plot, vivid writing, a high degree of sophistication and a minimum of illustrations, if any.
Jonathan Lucas, 11, a charter member of the Harry Potter Withdrawal Club in Cincinnati, said Harry, the junior wizard, had given him a taste for this sort of literature.
"I always liked reading, but after Harry Potter I got more into the magic ones than the normals," he said on Friday while at home with the flu and speeding to the end of his current book, "Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger," by Louis Sachar.
"It's just a completely different world," he said of his new penchant for fantasy titles with a touch of magic. "You know how they make books and movies for TV? I've read the books, and my mom would get the video. I've noticed that every single time the book is better than the video."
Librarians and booksellers say that as mighty as Harry is, there is no doubt that other factors are also driving the fantasy book boom. They cite a prosperous economy, growing efforts by parents to encourage children to read and perhaps an inflation in purchases by adults who are buying children's books to read themselves. Some also said the Potter boom was not an undiluted plus.
"There's a lot of halo effect from Harry Potter that's positive and negative," said Diane Garrett, owner of Diane's Books in Greenwich, Conn., which on Wednesday attracted nearly 150 children and adults to a reading of the newest "Redwall" book by Mr. Jacques. " 'Harry Potter' is getting many people to read who wouldn't pick up a book. But what's happening is that it's eclipsing some of the literature. Kids don't want to read about animals, or they don't want to read fabulous things for their own age, or they're reading Harry too young. So we're spending a lot of time reminding parents that their kids are too young for 'Harry.' "
But tell that to the four children of the Jernick family of Portola Valley, Calif. Ranging in age from 5 to 14, they have all worked their way through the Potter books and are now exploring other literary fare.
"I've read all of the 'Redwall' books," said Michael Jernick, 14. That is no small boast, since he has gone through 12 books in the fantasy series about Redwall Abbey mice by Mr. Jacques, whose latest book, "The Legend of Luke," occupies grown-up best-seller real estate. "I've also read all three Harry Potter books," he added. "And I have to read the next one. I can't wait. But I have to read different things."
With the ascendance of the high kiddie literary form, publishing executives are already rushing to capitalize. Their promotions offer various solutions to the question librarians and booksellers say they now frequently face: children ask what else they can read while they wait for the next "Harry Potter" book.
"I never thought I would say this, but for the first time I'm grateful to 'Harry Potter,' " said a keen Potter competitor, Craig Virden, the publisher of Random House Children's Books, where net sales were up by 12 percent last year and are expected to rise by double digits again this year. "I think 'Harry Potter' has made reading cool. The best advertisement you can have is a kid talking to another kid about a book."
The "Harry" halo effect has touched classics like "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," the first book in C. S. Lewis's "Chronicles of Narnia" series, which was first published in 1950. All seven titles reliably sell about 1.7 million copies a year for the publisher, HarperCollins, but in the first half of the company's fiscal year sales have already reached that amount. Sales have also tripled for Lloyd Alexander's "Chronicles of Prydain" series about Taran, the assistant pig keeper, which in ordinary years sells about 10,000 copies.
Last year "Harry Potter's" creator, Ms. Rowling, expressed a fondness for Dodie Smith's 1948 book, "I Capture the Castle," about 17-year-old Cassandra, who keeps a 6-penny journal of life in a ramshackle English castle. In response, the book's publisher, St. Martin's Press, immediately repackaged the book, included an endorsement from Ms. Rowling on the cover, and then watched a steady backlist title rise in sales to 54,000 from 11,000.
Young Americans are making reading choices that show a distinct preference for a backdrop with a British accent. The "Potter" series, the "Narnia" books and "I Capture the Castle" are all set in Britain.
This month the American Booksellers Association and its Book Sense marketing staff polled independent booksellers on their recommendations for what they are calling Harry Potter Deprivation Clubs.
The top response from 400 stores was "The Golden Compass," a 416-page fantasy about an orphan named Lyra who grows up near Oxford University and, naturally, is caught in a life-and-death struggle against dark forces.
The group's Top 10 list also includes classics like "The Hobbit," Edward Eager's 50-year-old "Half Magic" and Madeleine L'Engle's "Wrinkle in Time."
"I've heard from hundreds of independent stores, and they're all producing lists and fliers or Harry Potter recommendations to meet the demand," said Carl Lennertz, a marketing consultant for the national Book Sense marketing campaign. "It's funny, I could have begged my daughter to read 'The Hobbit,' but she might not have ever read it if this hadn't happened. There's a little bit of peer pressure. You've got to keep up, but once they're in, they're hooked."
The burst in sales of juvenile novels follows a gloomy period in the late 1990's when the children's paperback market dipped by almost 20 percent, as fans started abandoning the popular "Goosebumps" horror series. Over a two-year period through 1998, customers were buying fewer copies of children's books, according to the Consumer Research Study on Book Purchasing, which has not yet released its 1999 study.
Last year consultants for the Association of American Publishers developed long-term projections that underestimated the percentage growth in children's hardcover sales by more than half because they had not factored in what Albert N. Greco, who helped develop the projections, calls the "titanic of book publishing: 'Harry Potter.' "
The trends involving younger readers are clearly at odds with those for younger adults, who according to surveys are devoting less money and time to books. (People over 49 remain loyal customers with increasing sales levels.)
At Books of Wonder on West 18th Street in Manhattan, the clerks are approached about four times a day by children and adults who are seeking post-Potter reading material, said Jennifer Lavonier, manager and buyer for the store. By now the response has a certain rhythm: employees hand a packet to customers that includes "Harry Potter" games and questions and a list of some 20 other children's novels to consider.
Ms. Lavonier said she suspected that adults were seeking children's novels for themselves because "there's a lot of imagination in children's books."
"There's a lot of scenery and detail that's not in some adult books," she said. "To be honest, I don't really even read adult books anymore."
That view has resulted in some odd role reversals. Eleven-year-old Logan Dill of Kentucky is currently rereading the three books in the "Harry Potter" series to her father while driving on errands with him in the family car.
She is the most dedicated member of Joseph-Beth's Harry Potter Withdrawal Club. Although attendance for club meetings has been up and down, Logan is already planning to read the club's choice for April, "The Golden Compass," and has voluntarily finished "The Black Cauldron," the second title in the Lloyd Alexander "Chronicles of Prydain."
"I'm still waiting for the fourth 'Harry Potter' book," she said. "But the books I've been reading have really helped. There's nothing that can compare to Harry, but these books have really helped fill the gap."
Since Logan has nearly finished reading the third "Harry Potter" to her father, she has found relief just in time. In a few days, she said, she will begin reading aloud "The Black Cauldron" series to her father.

HEADLINE: AIRLINES CUT SEATS TO ADD TO PROFITS

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
Passengers who fly economy class may soon find the back of the plane a little more comfortable -- if they can find seats.
In the first widespread change in the passenger cabin since the creation of business class two decades ago, several large airlines are now overhauling their coach sections. 
 The goal is to increase profits, but different carriers are trying far different routes to that end. British Airways and United Airlines are dividing their coach cabins into two classes -- premium and economy -- and charging passengers more for the extra legroom of premium. Only one other carrier, Virgin Atlantic, offers gradations within coach, having introduced them several years ago.
American Airlines, meanwhile, is removing two rows of seats in coach cabins to give all passengers three more inches at no extra charge. They hope to boost profits by selling seats that might otherwise be empty.
Some passengers are decidedly enthusiastic. "This extra room in coach will make a big difference for me," said Harry Dodge, a retired owner of an oil well services company, who is 6 foot 4. "I have taken some transcontinental flights and developed some painful cramps in my legs. I swore that I would never fly again."
But passengers paying rock-bottom fares -- whether keeping the same legroom, on British Air and United, or getting slightly more, on American -- will have fewer seats available to them. This will often lead to more crowded coach sections -- and more competition for coveted overhead luggage space.
The airlines are betting that in a booming economy, enough passengers will be willing to pay more for extra legroom -- 3 to 7 inches, depending on the airline. By creating premium economy service -- separate from existing business class -- the carriers can accommodate more business travelers, who buy only 20 percent of all airline tickets yet account for half the industry's profits. At the same time, the airlines can rely less on budget passengers, whose fares are sometimes so low that the carriers lose money on them.
How much more will travelers pay? That could vary widely. On a United flight from New York to Chicago, for example, an Economy Plus ticket sells for $1,094 (compared with $1,602 for first class), while the cheapest economy seat is priced at $324. On American from New York to Chicago, the lowest fare is $209. But with fewer coach seats available, that fare is likely to sell out faster, forcing economy passengers to pay at least 20 percent more for the next available discount fare.
British Airways said it had yet to finalize the fare structure for its premium economy cabin, to be called World Traveler Plus. Some seats will cost 20 percent more than the full-coach fare, although some discounts will be available.
In a sense, the changes will merely sort out some of the disparities that are already widespread among coach passengers, where a business traveler paying, say, $1,000 for a flight might be seated next to a vacationer paying $200. Often, airlines will give higher-paying ticket holders more elbow room, but there is no guarantee.
The new strategy is risky. If the economy turns sour and travelers cut back, the carriers will have to slash fares to tempt them back on board. The airlines making the changes will have fewer coach seats to sell to generate volume.
"American's move is a big win for consumers," said Samuel Buttrick, an airline analyst at PaineWebber. "But it's not a way to increase profitability. What's good for consumers is not always good for the airline industry."
But the changes could work against some travelers. They could prevent "backpackers," as airlines derisively call bargain hunters, from finding as many low-cost fares. And budget travelers may soon find less room for their carry-on luggage, since some airlines are increasing the baggage weight limit for higher-paying passengers.
The move to give coach passengers more legroom -- especially by American -- has also ignited a nasty spat among the world's largest carriers. Gordon M. Bethune, chairman and chief executive of Continental Airlines, said he was looking at the changes at United and American, but apparently not very seriously. In a recent interview, he dismissed both carriers' moves as "fads."
"We believe at Continental in giving people what they will pay for," Mr. Bethune said. "And at the end of the day, many passengers want to pay the cheapest airfare. There's more to a good product than a few inches of extra legroom. That's a dumb approach by a bunch of mediocre airlines."
Not surprisingly, United takes exception. "Every airline is different," said Matthew Triaca, a United spokesman. "During the past few years, we have captured a large share of the business traveler market. They have told us that they want a product that rewards them when they pay a full fare."
Not every airline is tinkering with its coach cabin. Delta Air Lines has said it is "evaluating various options" regarding its economy seats. But many industry consultants said they were unsure if the trend toward offering more legroom in coach would sweep the business.
Despite often hostile complaints about cramped seating, some travelers are not overly concerned. A recent internal Delta survey of its passengers suggested that most choose their carriers based on flight schedule, price and frequent flier miles. Few Delta passengers have asked for more legroom.
"Seat size and the quality of meals are way down the list," said David S. Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association, a Washington-based group for passengers. "A lack of privacy is an issue with some passengers. The extra space may help alleviate that. But some passengers will always go for the cheap fares."
Airline executives expect the roomier cabin space -- notably from United, British Air and Virgin Atlantic -- to attract many frequent travelers. But the biggest market for the seats is among business travelers, who often pay a full-coach fare and wind up sitting next to the restrooms.
"This class of cabin has worked well for us," said Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman. "Why should someone pay full-coach fare and get the same exact service as someone who paid $99 for a ticket? There's no other industry where that happens."
Stephen Presser, a New York investment banker, recently sat in United's Economy Plus cabin on a flight from New York to St. Louis and immediately became a fan.
"A week earlier, I had paid full-coach fare on a trip to Chicago, and I had to sit near the back of the plane," he said. "I hated it. But the Economy Plus was surprisingly good. I had enough room to pull down the tray table and work comfortably on my computer."
Carriers create extra space in premium economy by removing one row of seats and then redistributing the space.
American will remove two rows, each taking up 37 inches seatback to seatback. That is enough for at least three extra inches in each of the 21 rows of, say, a typical Boeing 737. The $70 million plan to increase the distance between seats gives economy passengers more legroom than they have had on any domestic carrier in 20 years.
"By having a better product throughout coach, we think that we will be the first call that discount travelers make," said Mike Gunn, American's executive vice president for marketing and planning. "We also expect to attract more business travelers who are willing to pay a higher-yielding fare."
Passengers may have to wait several months, though, before landing a coach seat with more legroom. American plans to convert half its planes -- including those serving the New York area -- by June, and the rest by year-end. British Airways will begin premium economy service between New York and London in August before expanding it to all its planes within the next 18 months. United said premium economy should be available on all domestic flights by mid-March.
When American's refurbishing is complete, it will have 6.4 percent fewer economy seats. United is removing coach seats on all its domestic fleet, including 5 percent of the economy seats on its 737's. Low fares from, say, New York to London's Heathrow Airport may also become more difficult to get.
"Getting a cheap seat is kind of a pastime among people who like to travel," said Martha Fay, a freelance writer in New York who frequently flies coach. "Not getting a low fare will make a difference. If I can't go to California for $250 but have to pay $400 instead, then I may not take my daughter. Or I may just not go."
Mr. Bethune, of Continental, concurred with the strategy of trying to reduce the number of low-fare passengers. He noted that such travelers tend to file more lost-luggage complaints than first-class travelers, who can carry on more and whose checked luggage is often treated more carefully. When an airline has already lost money on the fare, the last thing it wants is to lose money on the baggage, too.
Since carriers are fiercely competitive -- moving almost immediately to match fares and services -- some airline executives are concerned they may be forced to realign their coach seats if more carriers do so.
That possibility riles several industry executives, who are worried about frequent fliers and employees, who are allowed to fly free when seats are available.
One high-level executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that about 80 percent of frequent fliers on major carriers fail to get their first-choice flights when trying to redeem miles. What are the chances of that percentage increasing, the executive said, if the major carriers have fewer coach seats?
A roomier coach cabin may also be troublesome to airline employees, who have become accustomed to free air travel.
"You have to think about your employees' morale," Mr. Bethune said. "Those are your employees' seats that you're taking away. And if you don't have good employee morale in the airline business, you don't have anything."

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
After Help in Regaining Control of Life, She Now Helps Others

BYLINE: By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
Stephanie Lynn-Harrison, 41, was pregnant and unemployed. She recalls that she became increasingly worried about how she was going to provide for her children, and that the stress eventually became too much. She began to feel a depression that at its worst points was so deep it was as if "a complete fog" had moved in, she said.
"It was a disorientation of my surroundings," she said. "I really wasn't aware of who I was or what was going on around me." 
 About six months after her breakdown and the birth of her daughter, Ashley Lynn, she was evicted from her apartment in Brownsville, Brooklyn, she lost custody of her children and she thought that life had hit rock bottom.
In desperation, she moved with her three children, Ashley Lynn, Nadia Lynn, 6, and Damein Harrison, 16, to her mother's cramped one-bedroom apartment in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx.
But the apartment was just too small for the five of them. So Ms. Lynn-Harrison's mother promised to take care of the children, but asked her to leave, she said.
"I didn't know what to do," Ms. Lynn-Harrison said. "I started riding the train and hoping that something would come through. But I don't know what could have come to me on the New York City subway."
Finally, she dialed directory assistance, she said, and the quick-thinking operator referred her to the Brooklyn Women's Shelter, in the East New York section. But she said living in a shelter was not how she wanted to live her life, and she quickly tried to find ways to get out.
She came in contact with the social workers who run the Transitional Living Community.
It is a home for 30 mentally ill women that is attached to the Brooklyn shelter, which is run by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The Transitional Living Community is organized to get its residents back into society. Most of its residents stay about six months, said Jean Davis, its director. She said they often suffer from mood disorders and can have difficulty comprehending reality.
They are given medication for their mental illnesses and receive aid in finding a job and housing, Ms. Davis said.
After a year at the center, Ms. Lynn-Harrison moved to an apartment of her own, a three-bedroom apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and with the help of her mother began working on regaining custody of her children.
After moving into her own apartment in July 1996, she received vocational training and placement services from FEGS, formerly the Federation Employment and Guidance Service. It is a beneficiary of UJA-Federation of New York, another of the Neediest Cases Fund charities. She got a job photocopying legal documents at a graphics company on the East Side of Manhattan, and she finally began to feel that her life was on the right track again.
Now, not only is Ms. Lynn-Harrison reunited with her children, and working toward her high school equivalency diploma, but she has also volunteered to return to the Transitional Living Community to act as a mentor and example for the women who are living there now.
"I share some of the positive aspects of being here, and put them in touch with some of the services that are out there," she said.
She also answers questions about finding vocational training and housing. She said the women were most interested in how to attain the greatest achievement of all: getting an apartment provided by the New York City Housing Authority.
Ms. Davis said that the big sister program in which Ms. Lynn-Harrison participates, which is just beginning, provides help in motivating the women in ways that the program's staff could not.
"When you're dealing with people who have paranoid tendencies, it's really hard to make contact," she said. "Our clients are more willing to listen to someone who has already gone through what they're going through, and not just some social worker who will try to push them like all the other social workers they've come across in their lives."
Ms. Lynn-Harrison said that going back to her old program and helping those who are there now had given her a boost of energy and confidence. But most important to her confidence, she said, is her relationship with her children, now 5, 11 and 21.
Seeing them being so active, she said, has encouraged her to go to college. "They're really inspirational," she said. "They give me a lot of encouragement."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Knicks Contain Iverson, and Then Stop Him

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Chris Childs dutifully followed Allen Iverson around screens for most of the day, trying everything to disarm pro basketball's most potent offensive weapon. Lock and trail, coaches call this -- a strategy aimed more at containment than at prevention, aimed at letting the All-Star get his points with minimal damage.
But, with less than 17 seconds left yesterday afternoon, defending Iverson that way suddenly made no sense to Childs. The Knicks and their point guard had worked so hard to reclaim the lead, erasing a 10-point deficit in the final 15 minutes to take a 1-point lead. Madison Square Garden was percolating with noise. Lock and trail? The Philadelphia 76ers had locked them up for most of four quarters, and the Knicks had trailed nearly the entire game. 
 Too safe, too conservative.
"They had just called that same type of play and I got picked off by my own guy," Childs said of the 76ers' setting a screen for Iverson. "Instead of following the guy around the screen the last time, I just stayed with him and decided to shoot the gap. I didn't want to foul him, but I also didn't want him to beat us."
Clogging the passing lane, denying Iverson with outstretched arms and nimble feet, Childs refused to let the National Basketball Association's leading scorer touch the ball on the final possession -- a stingy and disruptive defensive play that illustrated how the Knicks came back and won, thrillingly, 89-88.
Instead of Iverson, point guard Eric Snow dribbled into the forest. Triple-teamed, his bank shot was too hard. Tyrone Hill tried to tip in the miss, but the Sixers forward mistimed his jump and barely got his left hand on the ball.
By the time Latrell Sprewell had cradled a long rebound and dribbled the clock away, the Knicks (34-20) had emerged with their second straight double-digit comeback and were headed to Miami for tonight's game only a half-game behind the Heat in the Atlantic Division standing.
Life at the Garden was very good, though you would not have known it through the first three quarters.
"They had us down most of the game," said an effusive Patrick Ewing, whose 18 points and 10 rebounds led his team and countered Iverson's 26 points.
Ewing was economical, taking only 14 shots, tying the score with 1 minute 15 seconds remaining on a strong inside layup and unselfishly giving the ball up to Childs on the Knicks' final possession. At 88-88, Childs passed to Ewing on the left side about 18 feet from the basket. Childs cut along the baseline, a routine play that usually begins with Ewing faking a pass to a guard before keeping it himself and trying to break down his defender.
Childs suddenly found himself free from Iverson and with the ball in his hands. He was fouled by Iverson with 16.9 seconds left, he made the first of two free throws to give the Knicks the eventual winning margin -- and their first lead since 8-7 in the first quarter.
"He was open," Ewing said. "He was wide open." He smiled before adding, "Should I have shot it?"
On a day when Sprewell (13 points) and Allan Houston (15 points) had trouble finding their rhythms offensively -- they shot a combined 9 of 24 from the field -- the Knicks received great complementary performances from Larry Johnson, Kurt Thomas and John Wallace.
It was Johnson (13 points) who tied the score with 46.8 seconds left, tipping in a missed put-back by Ewing. He knocked down consecutive 3-pointers as the Knicks fought back from a 12-point deficit with 9:11 left in the quarter. Wallace kept the Knicks in the game in the first half, scoring 13 of his 15 points on a brilliant array of dunks and jumpers. And Thomas (10 points, 7 rebounds) was his usual ornery self on defense, using his left forearm as effectively as Houston uses his right wrist.
Trying desperately to match Philadelphia's intensity, the Knicks finally found a way in the final minutes. They limited the 76ers to one field goal in the final 4:22.
Iverson needed 26 shots to get his 26 points. As awesome as he was at times, he had nowhere to go in the final seconds and was frustrated enough afterward to abstain from interviews.
Since they traded for Toni Kukoc, the 76ers (30-25) appeared to have shed that middle-of-the-pack label. They look potent enough to give the Knicks, Miami and Indiana trouble in late spring. But their lack of a true offensive threat to support Iverson was revealed. If that was not apparent, Kukoc's lax defense stood out.
Coach Larry Brown kept pulling him out of the game. Kukoc was burned repeatedly, but no worse than when Wallace shook him along the left baseline in the first half. In what will surely go down as a Knick highlight, Wallace dribbled the ball between his legs with his back to the basket; he then spun around Kukoc along the baseline and leapt high, dunking and drawing a foul for an eventual 3-point play -- a sequence shown several times on the overhead scoreboard.
"That was wild," Ewing said admiringly of the young forward's move. "That was a great move."
Ewing also called yesterday's victory "a great game," a kind of post-All-Star Game break gauge for a team with much hope and perhaps as much possibility, the difference between a team that wants to contend for the Eastern Conference title and another that has been there, done that, and now wants more.
 
REBOUNDS
LATRELL SPREWELL sprained his left thumb in the second half driving to the basket. KURT THOMAS twisted his left knee in the first half. Both were expected to play against Miami.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Divide Grows Wider In California

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., Feb. 26

 BODY:
As the presidential campaign moves to the biggest states, George W. Bush and John McCain are battling squarely for the biggest prize of all: California, whose once-mighty Republican Party propelled Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan to the White House but has languished and feuded for much of the 1990's as President Clinton and the Democrats came to dominate the state.
No Republican presidential nominee has won California since the elder George Bush in 1988, and the current Democratic governor, Gray Davis, swept into office with a 20-point margin two years ago. The Bush-McCain fight has opened new fault lines here that California Republicans can ill afford, and a major subtext of the candidates' struggle is who would be best equipped to regain the White House by preventing the Democrats from carrying what has become a must-win state for them in November. 
 For the reality is that both men are seeking the votes of a California Republican Party that is older and whiter, and more dominated at the grass-roots level by social conservatives, than it was in the 1980's, when a pragmatic fiscal conservatism reigned. At the same time, the state as a whole is younger, browner and more politically independent than it was a decade ago, and its striking economic recovery from the severe recession of the early 1990's has helped make Mr. Clinton more popular here than in almost any other state.
"The general electorate has gone exactly the other way from the party leadership in terms of positions on immigration, ethnicity, abortion, guns," said Stuart Spencer, the dean of Republican strategists here, who was one of Mr. Reagan's closest advisers from Sacramento to the White House. "Till they get their ship righted, and move back to a more centrist, moderate position, they're going to have trouble."
No place exemplifies that trend better than Pasadena, the once-rock-solid old-line Republican enclave just east of Los Angeles. In the mid-1990's, state assembly seats in the area that had been safely Republican since the 1940's went to Democrats instead, and this year, the incumbent Congressman, Representative James E. Rogan, is facing a stiff re-election challenge from a Democratic state senator, Adam Schiff, in one of the most expensive and widely watched races in the nation.
"I was very much for George Bush, but I think he's just waffled," said Dorie Hilton, a longtime Republican and the wife of a retired Navy captain who was shopping along Colorado Boulevard this weekend. But now Mrs. Hilton is for "John McCain without a doubt; he's such a contrast to Bill Clinton." She added: "If the far right takes over the Republican Party, we're all in trouble."
Mrs. Hilton is precisely the kind of voter Mr. McCain must target to win a state where only Republican votes will count in choosing delegates March 7.
She is Republican, female, moderate and likely to vote. And, on paper, Mr. McCain would seem an almost ideal California candidate: a Westerner, a proponent of campaign finance overhaul and government reform in a state that regularly passes ballot measures to rein in its elected officials, an opponent of tobacco in one of the nation's most strongly anti-smoking states, a Navy veteran in a state with legions of them.
But so far, Mr. Bush has consistently outpolled McCain by about two to one among Republican voters, nearly a third of whom identified themselves as strongly conservative in a recent statewide Field Poll, and nearly 40 percent of whom aligned themselves with the religious right. A Time-CNN poll released today had Mr. Bush leading among Republicans 49 percent to 23 percent.
Mr. McCain has begun running television advertisements here portraying himself as a "proud Reagan Republican," in an effort to rally the party's base. But even that strategy carries potential risks in a state where the abortion issue has routinely led moderate Republicans to support Democratic general election candidates in statewide contests in recent years. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain oppose abortion, and no anti-abortion Republican has won at the top of the statewide ticket since the elder Bush in 1988.
"In order for either one of them to grab the majority of the Republican vote here, they're both going to have to go to the right, and that poses problems for both" in a general election, said Garry South, a Democratic political consultant who is Governor Davis's chief adviser. "The Republicans that you see showing up to vote in the fall don't look a lot like the ones you see voting in the primary."
In fact, the state now has its unusual "blanket" primary system, in which the names of all candidates appear on the same ballot regardless of party, because a moderate Republican, Representative Tom Campbell, believed he could have won the 1992 primary for United States Senate that he lost to a more conservative candidate if crossover voters had been eligible to participate.
With financial backing from the computer magnate David Packard, Mr. Campbell sponsored the 1996 ballot initiative that created the new system.
That means the primary will provide the first real test of how Californians might vote in the general election, and so far surveys have shown a combined total of as many as 3 in 10 likely Democratic and independent voters crossing over to support Mr. McCain.
But because the rules of both national parties expressly forbid selecting delegates in a blanket primary, the parties cooperated here to pass a state law requiring that only the votes of party members be used to select that party's delegates. On the Republican side, all 162 delegates will be allocated to whoever gets the most Republican votes statewide.
For much of the 1990's, former Gov. Pete Wilson, a fiscal conservative whose support for abortion rights gave him a moderate tinge, managed to paper over internal differences with a grass-roots party organization that was moving to the right on social issues. But with the resounding defeat of State Attorney General Dan Lungren, who ran to succeed Mr. Wilson in 1998, and of all but two of the party's other candidates for statewide posts, the differences became all too apparent and the party was left hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.
Mr. Wilson's aggressive stands against illegal immigration and affirmative action had alienated the state's growing Latino population, which had once given both him and Mr. Reagan more than 40 percent of its votes. More than a year ago, virtually the entire statewide Republican elected establishment here lined up behind Mr. Bush because he was seen as a nonpolarizing figure whose successful outreach to Hispanic voters in Texas might translate well here, though some of the more conservative grass-roots groups held back, flirting with candidates like Steve Forbes or Dan Quayle.
In polls last year, Mr. Bush often ran about neck-and-neck with Vice President Al Gore here. Now, Mr. Gore is outpolling the Texas governor by double-digit margins, but running about even with Mr. McCain in hypothetical general election matchups. That is not great news for either Republican; Democrats hold about a nine-point edge in voter registration here, though both major parties have lost strength to independents.
"By definition, any nonincumbent Republican running statewide in California is the underdog" in a general election, said State Senator Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, who took over as the party's finance chairman last year and got it out of debt with Mr. Bush's help. "That's just the way things work. The explosive growth of the Latino population and the ever-increasing percentage of Asian voters in California is changing the dynamic, and it's important for Republicans to reach out to those communities. It's also important not to misread the results of the 1990's: Pete Wilson did get elected twice."
Even as Republicans make the primary choices on March 7, in several counties around the state there are also hot contests for the little-noticed posts of party central committees, with a statewide group that calls itself "mainstream" trying to regain control from more socially conservative groups.
"We're on fire, but in the mainstream, nothing moderate about us," said former State Assemblyman Brooks Firestone of Los Olivos, north of Santa Barbara in the Central Coast winemaking country. Mr. Firestone, a fiscal conservative who supports abortion rights and gun controls, lost a bitter 1998 primary for Congress to a more conservative candidate who had the support of Christian conservative groups, and since then has fought to reassert the party's more socially moderate wing.
Mr. Firestone is a strong Bush supporter, and he thinks "there's no question that Bush will win the Republicans.
"While a lot of Republicans like McCain for who he is and what he's meant for America," he adds, "they're becoming upset with his Democratic support as this becomes more and more obvious that Democrats are playing around in these open primaries."
Scott Jessup, 44, a banker who was strolling in Pasadena with his wife, Holly, is one Republican who finds no attraction to either of his party's candidates this year.
"There's no leadership at all in the California Republican Party," Mr. Jessup said. "There's no issue. Taxes just won't cut it anymore. When the economy's very strong, people don't feel like they need a tax cut." Of Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain, he said: "They don't grab me. At least McCain appears to have a little more fun."

HEADLINE: Early Skirmishes Defining New Jersey Senate Primary Race

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
In a season dominated by presidential politics, the Democratic rivals for the Senate from New Jersey have yet to take center stage. But former Gov. Jim Florio has been attacking Jon S. Corzine, his virtually unknown opponent, every day and from every angle, as if the June 6 primary were right around the corner.
One minute his campaign tries to portray Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, as a cutthroat Wall Street tycoon with a history of exploiting workers. The next, it paints Mr. Corzine as a bleeding-heart left-wing extremist who opposes the death penalty, mandatory criminal sentences and welfare reform. 
 Mr. Florio accuses Mr. Corzine, whose holdings in his old firm alone are worth more than $300 million, of cynically trying to buy the election by making or steering huge political donations to many powerful Democrats. And he belittles Mr. Corzine, who is so new to politics that even his supporters often mispronounce his last name (CORE-zyne), as hopelessly naive for thinking he could ever sell his expansive ideas in a general election, let alone in the Senate.
Mr. Corzine, meanwhile, has not exactly been stoic in response. His staff dutifully answers every public attack with a volley of aggressive countercharges about Mr. Florio's record. But until last week, Mr. Corzine himself had barely entered the fray.
Although these skirmishes have drawn little attention so far, they have revealed the essential dynamic of what is shaping up to be a grueling Democratic contest: Mr. Florio is desperately trying to define his opponent, while Mr. Corzine is merely hoping to define himself, betting that New Jersey voters already know enough about Mr. Florio to be seeking an alternative to him.
Both men have their work cut out for them. According to a Quinnipiac College Poll released on Wednesday, only about one in five registered Democrats has heard enough about Mr. Corzine to have any opinion of him, positive or negative.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Florio, a statewide fixture for a quarter-century, holds a commanding lead over his opponent, 57 percent to 22 percent in the latest survey.
But polls this early in a race typically reflect name recognition more than anything else. Indeed, the former governor, who pushed through a $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990 after campaigning on a promise not to raise taxes, remains unpopular with the public a decade later, the same survey found. More ominously for Mr. Florio, as many as 39 percent of Democrats still view him unfavorably.
In addition, Mr. Florio trails far behind the wealthy Mr. Corzine in amassing campaign money. And Mr. Corzine has locked up the endorsements of county organizations representing about two-thirds of the state's Democrats; on Saturday, for example, he thrashed Mr. Florio at the Mercer County party convention, receiving support from three out of four delegates.
Mr. Corzine will thus enjoy a preferred spot on primary ballots in those areas and a huge manpower advantage in the crucial area of get-out-the-vote efforts.
With Mr. Florio so far ahead in the polls, and Mr. Corzine clearly winning the political inside game, both candidates expect that their race will end up too close to call.
To Mr. Corzine and his advisers, the campaign will not begin in earnest until after the March 7 and 14 presidential primaries, when television advertisements introducing his face, voice and personality to voters will begin appearing in the New York and Philadelphia media markets. Almost every appearance Mr. Corzine makes is being videotaped, including his endorsement on Thursday night by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg.
State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democratic power broker from Elizabeth and one of Mr. Corzine's chief strategists, said it would take four to six weeks of television for rank-and-file Democratic voters to get to know Mr. Corzine. "It's virtually impossible to define anybody in New Jersey without going on TV," he said.
By contrast, Mr. Corzine's advisers think Mr. Florio will be able to afford no more than two weeks of television commercials, giving their candidate a potential head start of more than two months. "That's the kind of advantage that a politician would salivate over," said one of Mr. Corzine's most active supporters.
But W. Michael Murphy Jr., a co-chairman of Mr. Florio's campaign, said an aggressive, sustained and unanswered television campaign by Mr. Corzine would only turn off voters. "They're going to have to spend enormous amounts of money, and at some point people are going to look at him and say, 'Oh yeah, that's the rich guy trying to buy the election,' " said Mr. Murphy, a former prosecutor who was a candidate for governor in 1997.
He said Mr. Florio should have enough cash on hand to run television commercials beginning 15 to 18 days before primary day.
Mr. Murphy said that Mr. Corzine had unwisely ceded Mr. Florio the initiative in the early going, and that he was cheered by the limited coverage of the Senate race in the New Jersey newspapers so far.
"First impressions are always good," Mr. Murphy said. "The last two or three weeks, we've availed ourselves of the opportunity to define Jon Corzine on our terms before he can define himself."
The nature of Mr. Florio's freewheeling attack has surprised some observers. He has positioned himself to Mr. Corzine's right on criminal justice issues -- Mr. Florio supports the death penalty and mandatory sentences -- and on welfare reform. And he criticizes Mr. Corzine's stance on the minimum wage -- that it should be $8 an hour or more, enough to keep any person with a job from falling below the poverty line -- as utterly unrealistic.
"Progressive isn't bad, liberal isn't bad," Mr. Murphy said, "but an extreme, almost radical left doesn't play in a state that has historically elected moderate candidates."
But experts say Mr. Florio is defying political common sense by running to the right. "I don't know that you're going to get very far in a Democratic primary by saying a guy is too liberal," said Gerald M. Pomper, a professor at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics. "That's a Republican tack, and most voters aren't strategic, in the sense that you can tell them that he's too liberal to get elected in November."
Mr. Florio, however, believes that elderly and retired voters will make up more than half the primary electorate, his advisers say, and that they are less liberal than other core Democratic groups, like minorities, Jews and gays and lesbians.
For that reason, the advisers say, he has been pounding his opponent on the subject of Social Security, accusing Mr. Corzine of supporting a privatization of the Social Security trust fund that could threaten older Americans' retirement benefits. Mr. Corzine says he supports only a modest investment of the trust fund in stock index funds, and that individual benefits would remain guaranteed by the federal government.
While the combative Mr. Florio has conducted himself as if the race were weeks and not months away, Mr. Corzine has treated the last few weeks as a kind of spring training, refining his message, and particularly his delivery, in the relative obscurity and comfort of speeches to small groups and to gatherings of party regulars.
Speaking about education policy at Drew University on Feb. 15, for example, he almost seemed asleep on his feet, seldom looking up from his text and frequently mangling his words. But a week later in Newark, outlining his economic views, Mr. Corzine, now on more familiar ground, appeared more interested in what he was saying.
He told how at Goldman, Sachs he "oversaw a budget larger than many cities' and states' " and headed government advisory committees on federal budgeting and borrowing.
"I am the one Democratic candidate who has a proven record of success on economic issues," Mr. Corzine said in a dig at Mr. Florio. "These are not issues where I'll need on-the-job training."
Such jabs are still few and far between, however. And Mr. Florio has found Mr. Corzine's standoffishness particularly frustrating, Mr. Murphy said, likening it to a "cone of silence" around the candidate.
"I think they probably learned some lessons from Al Checchi and Michael Huffington and Steve Forbes," he said, mentioning three millionaire also-rans, the first two from California. "If you have a candidate who's not an effective communicator, then you substitute a personal message for a media message. But New Jersey voters expect candidates to engage in a public dialogue. They want to get to know their candidate."
Mr. Corzine's advisers say he is being wise to resist Mr. Florio's bait this early, when comparatively few voters are listening. But they promise that he will be ready soon enough.
They also warn that Mr. Florio's attacks early on have already justified what could be an avalanche of equally tough Corzine commercials dredging up bad memories of the former governor in the campaign's final days.
"People don't like negative campaigns," Senator Lesniak said. "But the idea of being sufficiently provoked is a good thing to have. Because Florio has been hitting so hard, so low, it creates the moral predicate for our having a strong counterattack."

An article yesterday about the Democratic contest for United States Senate from New Jersey misstated former Gov. Jim Florio's approval rating in a survey released last week. The 39 percent figure was his favorable rating among registered Democrats, according to the Quinnipiac College Poll -- not his unfavorable one, which was 17 percent.

Puerto Rican Presence Wanes in New York

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
A stretch of 116th Street in East Harlem -- increasingly marked by Mexican restaurants and Dominican bodegas -- nonetheless still bears the name "Luis Munoz Marin Boulevard" after the first native son governor of Puerto Rico. On the blocks around "El Barrio," Puerto Rican music still wafts out of certain storefronts.
And Maria Martinez, 62, hangs no fewer than three Puerto Rican flags from her apartment window and fence. "The truth is," she likes to say with a bit of Puerto Rican defiance, "we got here first." 
 These days, though, it is hard to resist the sense that Ms. Martinez is hanging her flags with as much a feeling of nostalgia as pride.
Being Hispanic in New York City used to mean being Puerto Rican. But over the last decade, the number of Puerto Rican New Yorkers decreased for the first time since they began arriving in the city in great numbers 60 years ago -- down by nearly 100,000, or 11 percent, according to data from the Department of City Planning. With the growing presence of Dominicans and Mexicans, Puerto Ricans now account for 37 percent of the city's Hispanic population. Experts say the decline is destined to continue.
In certain ways, city planners say, the trend reflects a traditional immigration pattern: the dispersion of groups from the city to the suburbs and other parts of the country as they make economic headway. But unlike most traditional immigrant groups who came to New York during the early part of the 1900's, more than a third of Puerto Ricans leaving the city have moved to Puerto Rico, including significant numbers of people born in the States.
For many Puerto Ricans, their diminishing presence has provided them with a moment to look back on, and assess, the Puerto Rican experience in New York.
Although there has been no shortage of success stories -- from political gains and lasting contributions to the arts to the less visible but more pervasive expansion of the middle and professional classes -- there is much about the fate of Puerto Ricans that remains puzzling. Why, for instance, are so many among the poorest of the city's poor?
In the 1990's, the percentage of Puerto Rican households in the city living at or below the poverty line increased despite a strong local economy, to a rate greater than that of any other group. According to the most recent data, about 40 percent of New York's Puerto Ricans qualified as poor, a figure considerably higher than that of African-Americans and worse than the average rate for all Hispanics.
Taking stock of the widely differing fortunes of Puerto Ricans in the city, Luis Garden Acosta, founder of the youth agency El Puente and a former member of the Young Lords Party, the militant Puerto Rican group of the 1960's, said, "It's been a period of exploration, of very strong community building, of coming to grips with American reality, with the wonderful promise of great opportunity starkly contrasted sometimes by the horrible aspects of our existence."
Many researchers say there is not enough scholarship to lay out a definitive explanation of why so many Puerto Ricans in the city continue to struggle. It is also difficult to track the poor: are Puerto Ricans -- who as American citizens came to New York as migrants -- mostly a static group, or a constantly changing group driven by the frequent back-and-forth movement between the States and the island?
But there have emerged some dominant theories on the progress of Puerto Ricans as a group, some involving a question of bad timing, others centering on the question of whether their American citizenship has been a mixed blessing in this country. Researchers note that because citizenship has meant no barriers to entry into the United States, the proportion of poor people among the Puerto Ricans coming to New York over the decades has been larger than for immigrant groups. This has made broad economic progress a more daunting challenge.
Many Puerto Ricans who arrived from 1940 to 1970 were especially vulnerable because they wound up concentrated in manufacturing jobs just as industry began its long and nearly complete decline in the city.
The depressed state of nearly half the city's Puerto Rican population is even more striking when set against the more general success of Puerto Ricans in other cities, like Tampa, Fla., and Los Angeles, where the income of Puerto Rican households has resembled that of the overall population.
"There's this almost structural poverty," said Gladys Carrion, a Bronx-born Puerto Rican who is executive director of Inwood House, an agency that serves pregnant teenagers. "They're still living in the poorest communities, segregated communities, with the worst schools, in the lowest-paying jobs. The question is, why do we continue to be on the hit parade for the pathology?"
 
The Exodus
Rediscovering The Homeland
The poverty levels may have something to do with the exodus from New York, some researchers say.
The number of Puerto Ricans in the United States has grown over the last decade or more, up from 2.7 million in 1990 to 3.1 million, according to the Census Bureau's latest count in 1997. But in New York City, the Puerto Rican population fell by more than 96,000 residents in roughly the same period, to 800,000 in 1998.
While Puerto Ricans have moved out, however, the city's broader Latinization has increased, its boroughs filling with Central Americans, South Americans, Dominicans and Mexicans. City planners estimate that in about 10 years, Puerto Ricans will be replaced by Dominicans as the city's largest ethnic group by place of origin.
This shift is mainly because of fewer births and because Puerto Ricans have spread out around the Northeast and beyond, with large numbers going elsewhere in New York State and to New Jersey and Florida.
But an analysis by city planners after the 1990 census also found something distinctly atypical: of those leaving between 1985 and 1990, the single largest group, 38 percent, was going to Puerto Rico. And close to 40 percent of them were born in the States.
For Puerto Ricans, of course, there has always been a great deal of migration back and forth between the island and New York in response to shifts in the economic climate. City researchers found, for instance, that many of those leaving for Puerto Rico tended to be less educated and poorer than the Puerto Ricans who stayed in the city or moved to other states.
Some researchers have blamed such circular migration for interruptions in the family life and schooling of many migrants and for slowing the development of local leadership and institutions. By now, however, many Puerto Ricans also migrate back and forth responding to family ties and better job and educational opportunities throughout the United States, said Jorge Duany, an anthropologist at the University of Puerto Rico.
Retirees and successful younger people have also been drawn back to Puerto Rico, where the unemployment rate of 12 percent today is half what it was in the 1980's. Hildamar Ortiz, a lawyer who left New York with her 14-year-old daughter in 1996, said she moved partly to honor her late father's dreams of retiring in Puerto Rico. But she said she had always wondered what it would be like to be Puerto Rican in Puerto Rico.
Born in the Bronx after her parents migrated north in the late 1930's, Ms. Ortiz, 52, who works for the Federal Housing and Urban Development Department in San Juan, said she grew up in a Puerto Rican neighborhood where the only non-Hispanic whites around were the teachers at school. "The only time we went to Fifth Avenue was for the Puerto Rican Day parade," she said.
Now, she said, she feels so at home that she has no plans to return to New York except to catch the occasional Broadway play.
"You belong here," she said, sitting in the living room of her 10th-floor beach-front condominium. "You feel it; nobody questions it. There's no hostility. I think you don't realize how much that takes a toll."
 
The Obstacles
Educational Lack Feeds Poverty
Back in the neighborhoods of Ms. Ortiz's childhood, more people have become poor.
Central to that stubborn poverty is the question of educational attainment, experts say. Barely 10 percent of Puerto Rican New Yorkers 25 and older have a college degree, said Francisco L. Rivera-Batiz, an associate professor of economics and education at the Teachers College of Columbia University.
The impact of the educational problems among Puerto Ricans in the city has only been deepened because the city's current economic expansion has increased the demand for more highly skilled workers, Mr. Rivera-Batiz said.
Census Bureau officials say the Puerto Rican experience mirrors somewhat that of Hispanics nationwide, who in the 1990's for the first time surpassed blacks in poverty and who have the lowest education rates among the major demographic groups.
But at Aspira, a youth services organization founded 38 years ago to combat high dropout rates among Puerto Rican students, officials say the lack of significant progress in educating Puerto Rican children can no longer be attributed to factors true for other Hispanic groups, like language problems. By now, most Puerto Ricans in the city have been born in the States and speak English.
For second- and third-generation Puerto Ricans, said Alex Betancourt, a director at Aspira, "the issue is schools that have been neglected for many, many years and poor family involvement in education." The problem is abetted by a pattern of residential segregation in New York City that researchers say has been almost as severe for Puerto Ricans as for blacks, historically the most segregated demographic group in the city.
Blacks and Puerto Ricans in the city have faced similar discrimination, researchers said, but the black population has generally done somewhat better for reasons beyond the language barrier and cultural adjustments that Puerto Ricans additionally faced.
One reason is that blacks counted on their autonomous churches as "an enormous laboratory of leadership development," said Andres Torres, director of a Latino public policy analysis institute at the University of Massachusetts and author of a book comparing the two groups. Another, he said, is that the attachment to the homeland among Puerto Ricans has divided their attention, making them less focused than blacks on dealing with problems in New York.
But perhaps more critically, experts say, blacks have had a more diversified labor base, and thus more economic mobility, and found a better niche in civil service jobs.
The poverty among Puerto Ricans is largely rooted in the low-wage manufacturing jobs that first lured migrants to New York City in great numbers during the post-World War II years -- many of them agricultural workers displaced by industrialization on the island, economists and researchers who have studied the Puerto Rican migration say.
But for many, that kind of employment was short-lived because manufacturing had begun its steep decline in the 1950's.
"Puerto Ricans had terrible timing," said Sonia M. Perez, a researcher with the National Council of La Raza, a national Latino civil rights organization. "There was this massive decline of jobs, and they weren't able to bounce back" because of low education levels.
In the 1970's and 80's, she said, "you started to see the breakdown of families, an increase of single-mother families, high unemployment. That's when you started to see indicators of high poverty."
Many believe that the poverty was compounded by the Puerto Rican experience with welfare. Arriving as American citizens, Puerto Ricans were entitled to the social services denied to many new immigrants. Among single mothers with young children, who often found welfare more attractive than a low-paying job with no benefits, public assistance kept many from job experience or started a cycle of poverty, sociologists say.
At 33, Mercedes Gerena, who was born in the Bronx to Puerto Rican migrants, remains a single parent on welfare, just as her mother was while raising her and nine siblings in Mott Haven. She said her fate was sealed when she became pregnant at 16 with the first of her two children.
Ms. Gerena is facing federal deadlines for ending her benefits. She recently found a job cleaning restaurants, and hopes to one day become a nurse's aide or a day care attendant. Although her 16-year-old son dropped out of school, Ms. Gerena has big hopes for her daughter, Jennifer, 13, a seventh grader at St. Jerome Church's parish school who wants to go to college to become a teacher.
"Puerto Ricans in the Bronx, they sometimes feel like quitting, but they hold on," Ms. Gerena said. "We've had our ups and downs. They all can tell you it's rough, but they've managed."
 
Two Worlds
Trying to Decide Where Home Is
For those trying to understand the idiosyncratic history of Puerto Ricans in New York, there has long been the belief that the experience has been complicated by their passionate nationalism. Both Americans and natives of a United States commonwealth with its own culture and sense of nationhood, many Puerto Ricans have resisted acculturation. Many blame American policies in Puerto Rico for the economic conditions that forced them to migrate in the first place.
New York City Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, who was born in Puerto Rico, said she has lived in the city for more than 20 years, but had to decide "to embrace this country."
"You have to make a conscious decision that you're part of this or not," Ms. Lopez, 49, said. "We're always taking the position of outsiders, outsiders that are not willing to give up the dream of going back to the island. You ask yourself, am I betraying who I am? When I answered no, then I was able to move forward. But it wasn't easy."
But other Puerto Ricans had no such doubts. "Why would I want to leave the vital electronic center of the world, the most interesting cultural capital of the world?" said Miguel Algarin, a poet who founded the Nuyorican Poets Cafe on the Lower East Side.
Mr. Algarin, who moved to New York when he was 9, said the Puerto Rican flight is a mistake. "They should have stayed on 116th Street, fixed up the apartments like whites are doing now and maintained their political base in the United States," he said.
After a half century, Puerto Ricans in New York have succeeded in carving out electoral districts and Latino studies programs in universities. They have won bilingual education and civil rights battles and congressional, state and municipal posts. They have created a wide array of organizations, from cultural institutions to nonprofit agencies that now increasingly serve other Latinos.
"Puerto Ricans have to be acknowledged as the front line that opened doors for every Latino that came after them," said Susana Torruella Leval, director of El Museo del Barrio, the Puerto Rican and Latin American art museum.
There are more than 20 Puerto Rican elected officials in New York. But political representation has not necessarily translated into advancement for many constituents.
One major limitation, said Juan Figueroa, president and general counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, is that the party system in the state is so machine-driven that it leaves little room for those who want "to march to a different beat in order to deal with the many endemic problems of our communities."
But Antonia Pantoja, 77, a pioneering Puerto Rican community organizer who founded Aspira, said the underlying problem is indifference by both government and the public, including economically comfortable Puerto Ricans, to "a society where children are not taught by the schools they attend, where families do not have decent housing to live in, where the color of your skin will keep you out of the services and resources all citizens are entitled to."
She added, "Not only are these facts distressing, they are the shameful reality of a country that professes commitment to a democratic society."
At the southern tip of the Bronx, Edwin Lorenzo is among those staying and refusing to remain indifferent.
Mr. Lorenzo grew up in the Mill Brook Houses in Mott Haven and went to West Virginia University in pursuit of an engineering career. Then, during one spring break in the Bronx, a friend was murdered over a drug deal. After that, he said, "every time I came here, a lot of things bothered me that didn't use to bother me. The streets were dirty. There was graffiti on the walls."
Mr. Lorenzo, the youngest of five children born to a Puerto Rican father and Salvadoran mother, switched majors to become a social worker. At 28, he is director of the East Side House Settlement Mott Haven Community Center, a multiservice agency whose after-school programs he attended as a child. He has a brother in California and another one in Florida, but he is raising his three children in the Bronx.
"For many years we judged success by whether or not we left the inner city," Mr. Lorenzo said. "All the successful people leave, and they have no connection to the community. All the people who stay are viewed as failures. That's a greater harm than the other one.
"You decide it has to stop someplace," he said.

An article on Monday about a decline in the number of Puerto Ricans in New York City referred incorrectly to the distinction borne by Luis Munoz Marin. He became the first native-born elected governor of Puerto Rico in 1948. The first native-born governor was Jesus T. Pinero, in 1946, but he was appointed.
A chart with the article mislabeled bars denoting percentages of Hispanics in New York City in 1999 who were 25 or older and had college degrees. For Puerto Ricans it was 10 percent, not 1 percent; for other Hispanics it was 12 percent.

HEADLINE: Confronting the Reality Of a Health Care Vision

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
It is show-me time for Healtheon/ WebMD.
The Internet-based company has riveted investors the last year, as its stock price rode a roller coaster while Healtheon announced a dizzying array of mergers and alliances. This month alone, Healtheon has used its stock in $5.7 billion worth of takeover deals for three companies. 
 And backers and partners like Microsoft, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and DuPont have lent credibility to Healtheon's ambitious talk of transforming the nation's unruly, fragmented health system into a digitally disciplined online universe. The vision is to link patients, doctors and insurers online with just about every player in the vast industry, promoting self-help for patients while saving time and money by eliminating paperwork and insurance company phone centers. But now comes the time when analysts say the company must deliver on its promises, before investors lose confidence.
Jeffrey T. Arnold, the 30-year-old Atlanta marketing entrepreneur who started WebMD in October 1998 and became chief executive of Healtheon/ WebMD after the companies agreed to merge the following May, has heard Wall Street's message -- that it is time demonstrate that Healtheon is more than an acquisitive holding company.
After more than 80 deals in 18 months, "we now have the assets in place to execute," Mr. Arnold said. "We will put everything we've got into making this work."
But Healtheon/WebMD's potentially volatile stock poses risks for investors, in the view of Dr. Bruce Hochstadt, a health care analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, a merchant bank based in San Francisco. The stock was above $100 last May, before the Healtheon-WebMD merger, then slipped to $30 last August. But the share price is up 60.8 percent since the beginning of the year. The shares closed at $60.3125, down $2.4375, Friday in Nasdaq trading.
"They are the 900-pound gorilla in Internet health care; there is not much room for error," Dr. Hochstadt said. "Once investors caught wind that things were moving slower than expected or were a little stalled, some wouldn't have the tolerance to stick around."
Certainly, Healtheon is not a stock play for the impatient, as it tackles a daunting task that analysts say may take years to accomplish. By most projections, the company will not become profitable until at least 2002.
"They need to slow down, take stock and actually execute some of the necessary integration of the purchases," said Mike Davis, a research director in Denver for the Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm. "They have to merge into a consolidated organization and culture. That's where most companies fail. It's not going to be easy."
In deals this month alone, Healtheon bought the Medical Manager Corporation, a profitable company that provides office management software for doctors; CareInsite, an Internet company that was Healtheon/WebMD's biggest competitor in the physician-to-insurer linkage field; and the OnHealth Network, a Web site that provides health care information for consumers.
It was the stock price that has made possible the many acquisitions and it was the shares that attracted a $930 million investment last month by Janus Capital. "Janus is considered to be very smart money," Dr. Hochstadt said.
Although the company has been spending about $250 million a year working capital should not be an immediate problem. Besides the $930 million from Janus, Healtheon/ WebMD says it has nearly $800 million in unspent commitments from stakeholders and partners.
Mr. Arnold, the chief executive, said that by June, Healtheon/ WebMD would make online connections available to 400,000 doctors, 900 insurance companies, 46,000 pharmacies and 4,500 hospitals. The Healtheon piece of the operation, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has close to 1,000 software programmers and computer engineers working full steam on producing the links under the supervision of Pavan Nigram.
Mr. Nigram is a computer wizard originally hired by Jim Clark, the Silicon Valley billionaire who founded Silicon Graphics and Netscape. Mr. Nigram was given the technical challenge of realizing Mr. Clark's dream, conceived four years ago, to somehow capitalize on the nation's health care economy.
Since Healtheon went public a year ago, Mr. Clark has moved on to less world-shaking Web-based ventures like helping rich people manage their money and consumers store family photos. He is still on the board, however, and still owns Healtheon shares worth $700 million. And one of his initial concepts remains central for Healtheon: playing a gatekeeper role in the daily transactions of the nation's medical money machine.
Ultimately, online transactions -- medical bills, drug prescriptions, lab results and so on -- may cost as little as 25 cents each, compared with $8 or $10 for transactions by paper, fax or phone. UnitedHealthcare, a unit of the UnitedHealth Group and a minority owner of Healtheon/WebMD, encourages the 300,000 doctors in its networks to submit bills and check patient coverage online. It says at least 100,000 are already doing so.
The potential market is a mind-boggling 30 billion health care transactions annually. They include hospital and doctor bills, insurance approvals, drug prescriptions, lab reports and referrals to specialists.
The first task, Mr. Arnold said, is to make the nation's myriad existing computer systems accessible with Web-browser software -- an effort likely to get a big push as new federal regulations take hold over the next two years. Under a 1996 law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, all external transactions between hospitals, doctors and insurers must be in standardized electronic language, with safeguards to protect patients' privacy and prevent unauthorized access.
"Every health care company says it needs a Web strategy," Mr. Arnold said. "We will provide them with the technology that meets the Hippa requirements," he said, referring to the 1996 law.
Healtheon acquired a crucial piece of this capability with a deal in January to buy the electronic billing company Envoy from the Quintiles Transnational Corporation for $2.5 billion in Healtheon stock. Envoy is a profitable business, dominating the small fraction of the country's medical bills that are delivered electronically, from computer to computer. But it is not the Web -- yet.
Some analysts say that electronic transactions, alone, are not sufficient to wring costs from the nation's medical system. As long as health care providers continue to do most business the old-fashioned way by using paper, fax and the phone, there are costly inefficiencies -- even if the information is subsequently converted to digital form, said Janice Young, another Gartner analyst.
And while Healtheon, as evidence of a trend, says it counted one million transactions online to insurance companies and laboratories in a single month last fall, some analysts have calculated that fewer than 100,000 of those actually originated as computerized transactions.
"We are waiting to see the number of doctors actually using the Internet," said William McKeever, a PaineWebber Securities analyst. "They run the gamut from just signing up to visiting a physician portal to using the Internet for transactions."
Martin J. Wygod, chief executive of Medical Manager and CareInsite, who will be co-chairman of Healtheon/WebMD when the sale of his companies is completed, is a big promoter of the online business model. "We can change the entire continuum of care and reduce not only the administrative expense but the actual cost of care by getting the right information to the doctor when he is seeing the patient," Mr. Wygod said.
Mr. Wygod said that health insurers like United, and several that signed on with CareInsite in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, would help overcome the reluctance of doctors to try new systems. He predicted the insurers themselves would be lured by the potential cost savings, which he said might allow them to eliminate thousands of employees who now deal with doctors by phone and fax.
Since most doctors deal with several health plans, they are likely to be more interested in going online if they can deal with more than one insurer on the same Web site. In New York, for example, CareInsite has contracts with Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, H.I.P., and Group Health, and Healtheon serves United.
But Gartner's Ms. Young said in some regions, dominant health insurers were developing their own online systems -- and thus might hesitate to share access to doctors with Healtheon/WebMD.
Besides transactions, which Mr. Arnold said would generate about half the revenue, the company is placing other bets. It has a big staff of writers and doctors producing up-to-date health care information for consumers and to attract physicians to its news and information Web site, WebMD.com. The site's producers also create broadcast material.
Mimicking the America Online model, the WebMD.com site can generate advertising revenue and fees from health care companies that doctors and consumers link to through the WebMD.com portal. For example, Medibuy, an online supplier of medical products and services, is paying $45.5 million for such a link. In addition, Healtheon/WebMD will get royalties from online sales by partners like CVS drugstores.
But for analysts, the big questions remain how quickly and how well Healtheon/WebMD will be able to integrate not only the nation's bewildering health care system but, first, the many pieces of its own far-flung, two-chairman empire.
Besides Mr. Wygod, the other co-chairman will be W. Michael Long. Mr. Long sold his financial technology consulting company, Continuum Inc., for $1.4 billion, in 1996 -- which is why he was available in 1997 when Healtheon's venture capital backer went looking for someone to bring focus Mr. Clark's hazy plans.
Besides seeking management cohesion, Healtheon/WebMD also has a geographic integration challenge. Mr. Arnold remains in Atlanta, where WebMD is based. Mr. Long lives in Austin, Tex., though he spends time at the Healtheon operations in Santa Clara. Mr. Wygod lives near San Diego, far from Medical Manager and CareInsite, which are in Elmwood Park, N.J.
Recognizing the huge the task before him, Healtheon/WebMD's Mr. Arnold tends to speak in measured tones about his prospects. When Jim Clark was wooing early investors, he used to talk about a revolution in health care. Mr. Arnold speaks more modestly about evolution.
Customers "can keep doing it by phone, paper and fax," he said. "We are just asking for access."
A foot in the door, in other words. A very big foot.

Eyes On the Prize

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
So China is now telling Taiwan: Marry me or I'll kill you. And Vice President Al Gore is now telling the unions: Vote for me and I'll get you a better deal with China next time, even though my own administration negotiated this deal. And together they are making a God-awful mess of what is a fundamental U.S. interest -- that Congress ratify China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
It's now going to be very tempting for Congress -- caught between the right-wingers who have been energized by the threats from Beijing against Taiwan and the left-wingers who have been energized by Mr. Gore's ambivalent support for his own trade negotiators -- to walk away from the Clinton deal for bringing China into the W.T.O. 
 Nothing could be more reckless. This is the time to keep our eyes on the prize, and the prize remains the stable, steady transformation of China into a responsible member of the world trading system and into a more free and open society. Few things are more important for world stability than that.
The best tool we have for advancing that -- not a foolproof tool, not the only tool, but the best tool -- is to Gulliverize China by globalizing China. And that's what this W.T.O. deal helps to do -- by requiring the Beijing government to permit more Chinese citizens to do business directly with the outside world and be less dependent on their own government, by requiring China to allow U.S. Internet companies to own 50 percent of Internet start-ups in China, and by requiring China to put in place trade rules where corrupt, arbitrary officials now hold sway.
The reason China's leaders cracked down this year is because they are terrified that the personal freedoms the Chinese people have gained in their lives and jobs during the last decade of openness will lead to demands for more political freedom. And they will -- especially with the W.T.O. deal.
That's why if ratifying this W.T.O. accord now means looking past China's bluster on Taiwan, then so be it. If ratifying this deal now means ignoring the pandering of the vice president -- who knows better, who actually understands globalization, and who should be, and could be, the administration's most articulate, in-your-face advocate of this deal, but who has bowed instead to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and its fatuous nonsense that you improve worker and environmental standards abroad by dictating them to others, not by free-trading with them -- then so be it.
Even if it means ignoring the self-interested lobbying of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which just wants W.T.O. passage because it's good for business -- then so be it. As the Council on Foreign Relations expert Michael Mandelbaum says: "Some things are in the national interest even though the Chamber of Commerce believes them."
Our choice with China is not between deterrence and engagement. You always need both. "China is not a threat to dominate Asia the way the Soviet Union was a threat to dominate Europe," notes Mr. Mandelbaum. "It lacks the power, the ideology and the will. The only place where China threatens U.S. interests is with Taiwan, and there U.S. military power is tacitly deterring the Chinese and must continue to do so."
But we keep this deterrence card hidden so as not to embolden the sometimes reckless Taiwanese into thinking that they can achieve independence and security without negotiating their relationship with Beijing. China is bellowing now precisely because it wants negotiations and is trying to strengthen its hand for these inevitable talks. China is so dependent on Taiwan and America today for investment and trade that it cannot afford to invade Taiwan without paying a devastating price. China still may invade. Countries do crazy things. But Beijing will think about it a lot longer than you imagine.
Strategy is about playing the odds. And since we are already deterring China militarily, the odds say that the best way to reinforce that is by bringing China into the W.T.O., increasing the costs for Beijing of any military adventure, and fostering the internal changes inside China that might one day make it more like Taiwan, and therefore better able to solve its differences with Taiwan peacefully.
The odds are in our favor, if we play our cards smart. That means understanding China's bluster for what it is, and it means understanding Mr. Gore's pandering for what it is, and looking beyond both with our eyes on the prize.

Bahamians Resent the Loss of Beaches to Luxury

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: NEW PROVIDENCE, Bahamas

 BODY:
The tourists who scuba dive among the reefs and tan themselves on the sandy shores have probably seen more of this island's coastline than Therell Bethell ever has. She cannot remember the last time she visited a decent stretch of beach, since the development boom over the last decade brought gated communities and exclusive resorts.
"Bahamians do not have access to the beach," said Ms. Bethel, a legal secretary in Nassau. "Bahamians have to have a puddle in our backyards to swim." 
 The long-simmering resentment over the loss of their beaches has crystallized in opposition to a proposed luxury community on the longest remaining stretch of undeveloped coastline in New Providence, the most heavily populated island.
The development, Clifton Cay, near Clifton Point at the western tip of the island, would take up nearly two miles of seaside land for 600 homes built around a marina and interspersed with amenities like a golf course and a beach club.
The government of Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham supports the development, in keeping with its policy of wooing newcomers who bring money and jobs.
But opponents contend that their battle is not only over access to the beach but also over access to their history. Their cause has been taken up both by environmentalists, who fear damage to delicate reefs, and by preservationists. The site is dotted with the ruins of 18th-century plantations, as well as the buried artifacts from two Lucayan Indian villages that date back 1,000 years.
International preservation and conservation groups have recently offered support, saying this is a rare resource of natural beauty and historical richness. The last week in February, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the environmental lawyer and son of the late senator, wrote to the project's main financial backer, a Bechtel family trust, on the opponents' behalf to urge that the environmental impact be studied in more detail.
The developers, who plan to begin construction in the next two or three months, say they will protect the ruins and not harm the environment. But opponents are skeptical.
"The biggest problem in the Bahamas today is that our government does not understand that money is not everything," said Keod Smith, a Nassau lawyer who has been fighting the development. "They feel if they show economic activity, capital injection and tax revenues increase, when you look at the books, it looks great. But do we sell our heritage just because we want some money?"
It is easy to see the site's appeal: turtles and dolphins glide through the water among the reefs, and conch shells, iridescently pink, are scattered on the sandy shore. Thick, elevated inland brush offers protection from winds and floods, and nearby wetlands are filled each winter with flocks of migrating kestrels, ospreys and warblers.
But treasures are also tucked among the trees or buried under the sand. A few years ago, Laurie Wilkie, an archaeologist from the University of California at Berkeley, began to study the remains of a major 18th-century plantation owned by William Wylly, who was known for trying to extend rights to slaves. Ms. Wilkie found bits of ceramic, tobacco pipes and bottles at one part of the site. At another spot, she examined the ruins of slave quarters and a kitchen.
Her most remarkable find came in the late 1990's, after preservationists expressed alarm that the proposed development might destroy remains of a Lucayan Indian village, and the government asked her to research its boundaries.
She said her findings led her to conclude that a luxury development should not be built there. She said that between the information about early Indian inhabitants and 18th century plantation life, the site is a veritable Rosetta Stone for understanding life on the island.
"This represents one of those rare arenas where you can study the whole extent of the human experience in a location, starting with the Lucayan villages," she said. "I can't think of another site that contains all of this."
She said the findings are especially valuable because the government kept good records about slavery during the plantation period. "This is so rare," she said. "To look at African history and talk about individuals, and tie that to archaeological remains is very unusual."
The descendant of one of those slaves has become one of the most outspoken opponents of the development. Vivian Whylly, a 38-year-old Nassau businessman, said he had traced his roots to Esther Whylly, his great-great-great-grandmother, who was a slave on the Wylly plantation. He filed a claim on the land -- unsuccessful so far, but he plans to appeal.
Mr. Whylly would like to see the land become a national park, where people could go to learn about the island's earliest settlers. Preservationists have started a fund to purchase the land, obtaining commitments of nearly $4 million.
Mr. Whylly said he often visits the area, to soak up the spirits that he feels still dwell among the ruins. "It keeps their spirit alive to know that this is where the people who would be my foreparents lived," he said. "Their spirit says don't let us become enslaved again."
The project's developers, Chaffin Light & Associates, said they were willing to protect the ruins and would create a fund financed by home and property sales to create a learning center accessible to the public. They also said they were working with the government to ensure that no environmental harm would come from the construction. The developers have also set aside a 500-foot stretch of public beach, but they contend that the shoreline access issue should be reviewed in a broader context.
"This is an issue we respect," said Jim Anthony, president of the Clifton Cay Co. Ltd. "But the debate is larger than Clifton Cay."
The debate goes even deeper than the vanishing public shoreline and is touching off passions about the island's identity and its future. Independent only since 1973, the Bahamas has had much new foreign development in recent years, thanks to Mr. Ingraham. Developments like Clifton Cay, officials say, create jobs -- a priority for the government.
"That is what our people needed for a better way of life and education," Said Earl Deveaux, the top environmental adviser to the prime minister. "What country is concerned about preserving artifacts when it is scraping by for a living or for food?"
But Sam Duncombe, an advocate here for environmental preservation, said the luxury developments cater too much to outsiders without regard to the needs of Bahamians like herself, who want to see the shoreline preserved for future generations.
"There is a certain ilk of American who believes the world is their oyster," Ms. Duncombe said. "We resent it. To them it's money. To us it's who we are. It's our peace of mind. It's our soul."
To allow the project to continue, she said, would revive one tradition -- that of the pirates that used to hide in the coves and inlets not too far from where the luxury homes are planned.
"The idea of pirates still exists," she said. "They no longer have beards and long coats." She said she sees some government officials as modern-day pirates. "They are selling us out," she said. "We need foreign development. But at what price?"

Senator Proposes Reduction In Fees S.E.C. Puts on Trading

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Day traders and lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission will each get a raise if Senator Phil Gramm has his way.
Mr. Gramm, the Texas Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, introduced legislation yesterday that would substantially cut the fees that companies and investors pay the S.E.C. to register and trade stock. The bill would also give many professionals at the S.E.C., including lawyers and accountants, raises of up to 40 percent to help stem the brain drain at the agency. 
 Over the next 10 years, the legislation would cut fees for companies and traders by almost $15 billion, Mr. Gramm predicted.
"Those taxes are paid by Americans who are trying to save and invest," Mr. Gramm said. "They are a tax on accumulation, thrift and retirement security."
In fact, the cost of the fees is hardly even a rounding error for investors, amounting to about $3 for a $100,000 trade. But securities firms argue that the fees, along with the somewhat larger fees that the S.E.C. charges companies to register their shares, amount to a hidden tax on investors. Nasdaq market makers, which must pay the fees on shares they buy and sell for their own account, are especially anxious to see the fees reduced.
The bill's chances are uncertain. The legislation has some strong Democratic supporters, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, of New York. Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., also spoke out strongly in its favor at a hearing yesterday in downtown New York.
But the White House, which is worried about the loss of a relatively painless revenue source, has not yet indicated if it will support the bill. At yesterday's hearing, Mr. Schumer said he was "getting vibes that the administration will not be supportive on this."
The fees are supposed to finance the commission's operations. But because they are tied to the dollar value of the shares that are registered or traded, the fees have soared along with the markets since 1995. They are now much larger than the S.E.C.'s budget, creating a windfall for the federal government. In 1999, the fees totaled almost $2 billion, more than five times the cost of running the S.E.C. The excess was spent on general government expenses.
Under Mr. Gramm's legislation, the fees would be cut to roughly the amount necessary to pay the S.E.C.'s budget. Charges for registering stock would immediately fall by about 75 percent, and trading fees would probably drop by about half, according to Mr. Levitt.
In addition to cutting fees, Mr. Gramm's bill would give the S.E.C. the chance to raise salaries for many of its lawyers and accountants to the levels already offered by the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. For example, a second-year lawyer with the S.E.C. makes about $66,000, while a member of the F.D.I.C. staff with similar experience can be paid as much as $91,000, or 39 percent more.
Mr. Levitt called raising salaries essential in light of soaring salaries for lawyers and accountants in private practice. Mr. Levitt said his agency had lost one-fourth of its top professionals in the last two years. "We are in the midst of a terribly serious staffing crisis," he said.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Leaving Hoop Dreams for the Boardroom

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN 

 BODY:
IF you're an enterprising type like Steve Mills, this is what you do with your life once you come to grips with a reality that snubs you, that regrets to inform you that you possess just enough game to play ball anywhere in the world except your dream destination, the National Basketball Association. You activate your backup plan.
Then you thank your social worker mom and teacher/ basketball coach dad that you have a plan worth activating. They're the nervous Nellies who made certain that you dropped the ball and left the playground back home in Roosevelt, N.Y., at homework time. 
 If the basketball gods won't allow you -- a 6-foot-1 inch guard who grew up "right around the corner from Dr. J" and like him learned to dribble the ball like a yo-yo -- to pound the boards downstairs with the players, you go upstairs and become a different kind of player. You make your moves behind the scenes and end up the highest-ranking African-American in something you call "the organization": first an express ascent at the N.B.A., now a 14th-floor office with a decent view at 2 Penn Plaza, headquarters of the Knicks.
Here's the little chat that Mr. Mills had with himself when he accepted his entry-level slot as an account executive with N.B.A. Properties in 1983: "O.K., so I wasn't good enough to make it to the N.B.A. and Magic Johnson was, but here he is playing and here I am working for the N.B.A., so we're still moving along the same path." Sort of.
Here's his reminder to himself when he joined the Knicks' front office last September: "There are guys out there that I, quote-unquote, came into the league with, and they played, and I'm doing this, and my N.B.A. career's going to be a lot longer than theirs is."
Here he is, whippet-slim at 40, the executive vice president for franchise operations of his favorite team from boyhood, sitting in a big black leather chair behind a bigger desk, balancing books that include a $70 million player payroll and helping make team policy. That includes last week's decision to cancel the traditional preplayoffs camp in Charleston, S.C., in response to the national debate over that state's tradition of flying the Confederate battle flag.
"As far as we're concerned, it wasn't a political statement and wasn't a public relations maneuver, although the result of it may in fact be a political statement," says Mr. Mills, who starts fiddling with his wedding ring when asked his gut response to the status of the battle flag in a state where he and his wife, Beverly, have often vacationed. "I don't think it would be fair to the organization for me to bring my personal feelings into this," he hedges.
Come on, doesn't he find the flag offensive? "Personally, yes. I think for most African-Americans it clearly represents some negative times for our race."
Clearly for the Knicks, whose roster contains just one white player, returning to South Carolina was not an option anyone favored. "The consensus was not to go back," Mr. Mills says of the feedback management received from the team. (Mr. Mills is a fan of player-management discussions. )
What sort of political climate will it take for them to go back? "That's one we're going to have to play by ear," he demurs, giving the wedding ring the same nervous twists it gets when the conversation veers toward Latrell Sprewell (Is he really reformed?) or management obligations to rule-breakers like Darryl Strawberry. ("I would say the N.B.A. is structured to provide second chances.")
In other words, next question, new subject. Mr. Mills does not court controversy gladly, particularly now that his career is doing what the Knicks haven't done since 1973: peaking. Today the Knicks; tomorrow, who knows?
Mr. Mills calls the N.B.A. "the most colorblind" of all the major sports leagues -- he spent 15 years there, ascending to senior vice president, without noticing any slammed doors -- and he's hopeful that basketball, whenever David Stern's expert tenure ends, might install its first black commissioner. It might be him.
How does an N.B.A. draft-reject like him get here?
You trade the locker room for the corporate boardroom, put on a suit and a rep tie instead of short pants, and let your sociology degree from Princeton, a degree backed by an aptitude for economics, smooth your segue from a bizarre season playing pro ball in Ecuador to a job as an investment banker at a Manhattan megafirm now known as Chase but then called Chemical.
IT helps that your bank recruiter played some ball at Brown back in his day. When you are torn between entering the bank's trainee program or saying yes to playing in South America for $2,500 a month, he utters the magic words: "Go chase your dream." He gives you a rain check on the job, a Princeton political science professor assures you that Ecuador appears to be coup-free, and off you go.

HEADLINE: Solution on Vieques Takes a Step Forward

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Despite growing protests at home, the governor of Puerto Rico met with White House officials today and reaffirmed his support for President Clinton's plan to resume Navy exercises, which will be at least initially limited, on the island of Vieques.
The governor, Pedro J. Rossello, also took possession of 110 acres of land on the western end of Vieques that the Navy transferred to local control. The transfer was part of a deal to allow the renewed training before residents of the island decide whether to bar the exercises permanently. 
 "The first step in the overall resolution of the issue was taken today," the White House press secretary, Joe Lockhart, said after a meeting between Mr. Rossello and the White House chief of staff, John D. Podesta. "There's obviously a number of other steps that will have to be taken, including a referendum where the people of Vieques will decide their future."
Exercises on Vieques, where the Navy maintains a bombing range that it considers essential to the training of its Atlantic fleet, were suspended last spring after a wayward bomb killed a civilian security guard, an accident that intensified longtime protests against the service's presence.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Rossello agreed last month that the Navy would be allowed to resume training using inert bombs. The pact calls for a referendum, likely to be held in 2001, that will allow Vieques residents to choose between the unfettered resumption of training, with live bombs, and exercises with dummy bombs until a Navy withdrawal in May 2003.
In San Juan last week, some 85,000 people demonstrated against the agreement. But Mr. Rossello said today that the administration's proposal was the best solution to the standoff between Vieques islanders and the Navy.
He said that as details of the proposal became more widely known, "it will allow much more support for all aspects of that presidential order."
The Navy has not announced a date for resuming training, but Mr. Rossello pledged the Puerto Rican government's full cooperation in clearing the test range of protesters.
"We will take any steps that are appropriate to make sure that the range is available," he said.
The Clinton administration is seeking $40 million to address the health and environmental concerns raised by the training on Vieques.
"The people of Vieques have placed on the table concerns as to what has happened to their health, to their environment, to their opportunity for economic development," Mr. Rossello said today. "The funds that are requested are precisely to respond to those very valid concerns."
The 110 acres transferred today are to be used to extend an airport on Vieques, allowing larger aircraft and so stimulating growth.
A deed for the land was drawn up and signed by Mr. Rossello and Adm. Kevin Green, commander of Naval Forces South, in a small ceremony, said Maria Echaveste, deputy White House chief of staff.
"The governor believes that actually taking steps to implement the president's directives would be helpful in helping reduce the level of opposition down in Puerto Rico," Ms. Echaveste said.

HEADLINE: Couple With Computer Riches Give M.I.T. a Record $350 Million for Study of the Brain

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 28

 BODY:
A computer publishing billionaire and his wife pledged today to give the Massachusetts Institute of Technology the largest single donation yet to a university -- $350 million over the next 20 years -- to finance research on the brain.
The money, from Patrick J. and Lore Harp McGovern, will create the McGovern Institute for Brain Research, a center with a staff of 300, including computer scientists, psychologists and molecular biologists. The donation comes at a moment when neuroscience is making great advances, powered by recent progress in imaging technology, cell biology and genomics. 
 "We both have a great interest and fascination with this last frontier of discovery," Mr. McGovern said today at the signing of an initial agreement on the institute.
Mr. McGovern, 62, is founder and chairman of International Data Group, a company known for publishing Computerworld, putting out the "For Dummies" book series and organizing huge computer industry conferences.
Back in the 1950's, when he was a mere M.I.T. undergraduate, Mr. McGovern majored in life sciences and studied the human nervous system. And even before that, he said, when he was a teenager visiting the public library in Philadelphia, he came upon a book called "Giant Minds, or Machines that Think" that changed his life, infecting him with ideas about how computers could enhance human reasoning.
Mrs. McGovern, a 55-year-old high-tech entrepreneur, said that she also traced her interest in the brain back some 50 years, to a visit to a science museum when she was 5 years old. Her parents showed her a brain in formaldehyde at a science museum and she asked, "Can you touch thought? Does it have physical presence?"
"And so maybe now we can figure that out," she said. "So let the journey begin."
The first thing the McGoverns had to figure out, they said, was where to put the institute they had decided to create about three years ago. They put together an advisory committee and considered seven universities: Columbia; University of California campuses in San Francisco, Berkeley and San Diego; the California Institute of Technology; Stanford; and M.I.T. Mr. McGovern acknowledged that his emotional ties to M.I.T. had played a role in the decision, but said that more objective factors also came into play, including its neuroscience programs and its "willingness to be very collaborative."
In the style of many Internet-age benefactors, the McGoverns plan to keep a close eye on the institute and will sit on its board, along with directors from M.I.T. and outside neuroscientists.
The money will begin to flow as yearly gifts of about $5 million, Mr. McGovern said. The amounts will slowly scale up until, at the end of 20 years, the McGoverns donate the rest of the $350 million to endow the institute in perpetuity.
The gift beats by $50 million the record for a single donation to a university, according to a list published by the Chronicle of Higher Education. The former record-setting donation was $300 million in stock from the Ingram Charitable Fund to Vanderbilt University, announced in 1998. Last year, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave $1 billion to create the Gates Millennium Scholars program, but the money, intended to encourage minority students in science and technology, is to be spread among many institutions.
The McGoverns' donation comes at an opportune time, said Phillip A. Sharp, a Nobel-laureate molecular biologist who will serve as the institute's founding director. Among other factors, scientists seeking to unravel the workings of the brain now have at their disposal new knowledge about how nerve cells work, he said, and the soon-to-be-completed mapping of the human genome is expected to contribute insights as well.
"All of this is a basis upon which, not in the next year, not even in 10 years, but perhaps in 20 years, we'll be able to draw out the general and specific functions of the brain in complex phenomena, like learning behavior, those sorts of processes," he said. "And it's terribly exciting."
Mr. McGovern, asked if he had one pet neuroscience problem he would like to see solved, said it would probably be the causes of misperception: why the brain takes in or remembers things incorrectly.
Mrs. McGovern said she was most interested in attacking learning disabilities.
"If we can tap into the intellectual potential and bring everyone up to par," she said, "we can create a so much better society."

HEADLINE: Tijuana Governor Says Slaying Shows Drug Traffickers' Power

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 28

 BODY:
A day after gunmen killed the police chief in Tijuana, the sprawling city that borders California, the state governor said drug traffickers were out of control there partly because many federal authorities were in their pay.
"The drugs are coming in by land, sea and air," Gov. Alejandro Gonzalez Alcocer of Baja California said in a telephone interview. "The federal authorities have jurisdiction. But frankly we don't have much confidence in them. We worry that if we try to coordinate operations with them, our plans will be communicated to the traffickers." 
 On a visit to Baja on Friday by President Ernesto Zedillo, Mr. Gonzalez urged the president to speak out against the traffickers, who have been blamed for the killings of 60 people in Tijuana in eight weeks. In a speech, the president said, "We have to make these criminals understand that they're not welcome in Baja California, that the only home they deserve are the prisons."
On Sunday, gunmen in cars ambushed and killed Chief Alfredo de la Torre Marquez as he drove on a highway. Dozens of bullets hit him, the police said.
One reasonable hypothesis, Mr. Gonzalez said, is that the traffickers had ordered the assassination as a response to the president. Mr. Zedillo, an economist who was trained at Yale and who has rarely displayed personal interest in the narcotics problems, did not refer today to Chief de la Torre's killing in his speech to a government audience. A spokesman said the president would have no comment on the situation in Tijuana. "Its just a police matter," a presidential aide said.
Mr. Gonzalez, who is in the center-right National Action Party, said he realized on Mr. Zedillo's visit that he had no plans to mention the narcotics violence in Baja. As the two drove to the speaking engagement, in Mexicali, east of Tijuana, Mr. Gonzalez recalled, he asked Mr. Zedillo to address the problem. In his speech, Mr. Zedillo vowed to send to high officials to Tijuana to review federal efforts.

HEADLINE: Incomes Rose Faster Than Spending In January

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Americans' incomes rose in January at the fastest pace in three months, government figures showed today, suggesting that consumers could be poised to increase spending.
An increase in cost-of-living payments for Social Security and other programs and raises for federal employees helped drive up personal incomes 0.7 percent in January, the Commerce Department reported. Incomes rose 0.3 percent in December. 
 "Lots of money means lots of spending, and the slowdown is still nowhere in sight," said Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pa. "Families had tons of money to spend, and that is exactly what they did."
Spending increased 0.5 percent in January after rising 1.1 percent in December, the largest jump since spending grew by that amount in May 1998. January spending was up 8.2 percent when compared with January 1998, the biggest increase in more than a decade.
It was the first time since October, when farm payments caused a 1.2 percent surge, that incomes rose faster than spending. If that trend continues, it could ease concern over the rising level of consumer debt. Personal debt, as measured by the Federal Reserve, surged $27 billion in the last two months of the year, more than double the pace of the previous four months.
The faster rate of incomes compared with spending also pushed the savings rate to 1.4 percent in January from a record low of 1 percent in December. Disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased 0.9 percent in January after rising 0.1 percent during December.
A spending surge late last year helped push growth in fourth-quarter gross domestic product to 6.9 percent at an annual rate, the fastest pace in three and a half years. Today's report suggests higher borrowing costs have done little to cool demand for goods and services. Consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the nation's output of goods and services and helped push the economy to a record 107th month of expansion in February.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Surges Above 10,000 Again on a Blue-Chip Rally

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average rebounded above 10,000 yesterday as investors, at least temporarily, moved back into blue-chip stocks, which have been battered in recent weeks.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also gained ground, helped in part by the Goldman, Sachs market strategist Abby Joseph Cohen, who said yesterday that the slide in the index had left it undervalued. 
 But technology stocks, which have continued to rise in the face of a broad-based decline this year, edged lower yesterday.
With the economy continuing to power ahead and the Federal Reserve showing no sign it is finished in its efforts to slow it down by raising short-term interest rates, most analysts and traders said yesterday's moves were little more than a temporary bounce from what has been a sharp sell-off.
"I am happy the market is up, but it would be nice if I had some reason to think it is sustainable," said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed, a firm in Overland Park, Kan., that has $40 billion under management. "We are due for a bounce, and we are getting it."
Led by financial and retail stocks like Citigroup, American Express and Procter & Gamble, the Dow rose 176.53 points, or 1.8 percent, to 10,038.65. It was the biggest point gain in the Dow in nearly two weeks and came after a 2.3 percent decline on Friday.
The S.& P. 500 gained 14.69 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,348.05. Exxon Mobil, Qualcomm and American International Group helped to lift the index.
But investors took some profits in technology stocks. By the close, the Nasdaq composite index was down 12.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,577.85. At one point in the session, the index had fallen as much as 2.7 percent.
Prices of small-company shares were little changed. The Russell 2000 index gained 0.94, or 0.2 percent, to 557.68.
In her comments yesterday, Ms. Cohen said the recent slide in the S.& P. 500 had left the index about 5 percent undervalued. She maintained her target of 1,525 for the S.& P. 500 by the end of the year because of continued vigor in the economy and robust corporate profits.
In reference to interest rate fears, Ms. Cohen said recent and expected interest rate increases by the Fed were aimed "at slowing and elongating, not stopping, economic growth."
Andrew M. Brooks, head of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates, said, "Abby's mildly positive comments were a help."
Volume was heavy, but not frantic. On the New York Stock Exchange, just more than a billion shares changed hands. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market was 1.78 billion shares.
Financial stocks, which have been severely battered as interest rates have risen, did better yesterday.
Citigroup, a Dow component, gained 1 1/2, to 49 3/8, after the company, the nation's biggest financial services company said John S. Reed, its co-chief executive, would retire in April.
Chase Manhattan gained 2 1/16, to 77 15/16. Wells Fargo rose 1 7/16, to 34 1/8. Mellon Financial was up 1 1/2, to 30 7/8. Bank of New York closed at 34 3/4, up 1 3/4.
Cisco Systems, EMC and Oracle were among the technology losers yesterday. Cisco fell 2 3/16, to 130 9/16. EMC shed 5, to 118. Oracle fell 2, to 68 5/8.
And reports that Yahoo was in talks to take a minority stake in a company that News Corporation is creating to hold its satellite television assets sent the stock down 3 1/4, to 161 15/16.

Treasury Prices Fall
 
By Reuters
Bond prices dropped yesterday as blue-chip stocks bounced back from sharp losses last week and robust economic data fanned concerns that the Federal Reserve would keep driving interest rates higher.
Sharp losses by United States stocks late last week sent investors scurrying for a safe haven in the bond market.
But market players scampered back out of Treasuries yesterday, as the Dow Jones industrial average surged nearly 2 percent, climbing above 10,000 after closing below that important psychological level on Friday for the first time in 10 months.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond declined 22/32, to 100 28/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.19 percent from 6.14 percent on Friday.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 3-month and 6-month bills:

HEADLINE: Internet Spurs Huge Job Growth in the New York Area

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Internet-related jobs in the New York area are growing at an explosive rate, to 250,000 now from 106,000 in 1997, and are responsible for an $8.3 billion payroll that has tripled during that period, according to an industry-sponsored survey released yesterday.
In New York City, the growth in new-media jobs is outpacing traditional media companies and other key industries, the survey showed. It was commissioned by the New York New Media Association, a trade group, and conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm. 
 The survey defined New York's $9.2 billion new-media business as a broad category encompassing Internet-related jobs in publishing, advertising, telecommunications and software design as well as newer dot-com companies. In more than half of the 8,534 companies included in the survey, the core business did not involve the Internet.
As the home to more than a third of these companies (3,148, up from 2,128), Manhattan remains dominant in this industry. But these businesses are proliferating at a faster rate in New Jersey -- to 2,398 today from 974 three years ago, the survey said. Nearly half operate in more than one location. About 1,700 companies in the survey had moved to New York during the last three years.
In perhaps the survey's most surprising finding, 60 percent of the companies said they showed a profit in 1998. These tended to be smaller companies that design Web sites and provide other services to high-profile companies that are spending heavily to develop a brand, said Brian Horey, the president of Equity Growth Management, a venture capital company, and a founder of the New York New Media Association. Indeed, more than half of the companies reporting profits said they made less than $1 million.
The creation of new jobs has not closed the racial and gender gap, however, even in this tight labor market. The Internet work force in New York is overwhelmingly white (74 percent) and male (62 percent), but not as young as it is in the popular imagination. According to the survey, the average age is 35, with 33 percent younger than 30 and 29 percent older than 40. Of the 249,639 jobs identified in the survey, 185,617 were full-time positions, a big increase from 1997.
Another change since then, said Alice Rodd O'Rourke, the executive director of the New York New Media Association, is that the industry no longer feels it is being ignored. "People are more optimistic, more positive, about the role that government has played," she said. As one example, she cited Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposal to repeal the commercial rent tax.
Although the survey does not compare geographical regions -- or make special claims for New York -- Mr. Horey said the region leads the nation in creating material for the Web.
"I think there's no question that we're the primary hub for content," he said. "The West Coast is the hub for infrastructure and technology."
But in a more skeptical report issued in October 1998, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that it might be premature to declare that New York is a new-media hub.
The phenomenal expansion may just represent a shift in the way traditional media companies are operating. "Accordingly," that report said, "one could argue that New York City's new-media boom essentially reflects an Internet-technology-driven boom in the city's traditional media industries -- industries that represent a large share of the city's economy."
Jason Bram, an economist and one of the authors of the Federal Reserve Bank's report, said New York's Internet role should not be overstated. "For years and years, New York City has traditionally been behind the nation in new media, but we're sort of catching up," he said. "Maybe we are ahead, in the overall scheme of things, but we're not Silicon Valley."

HEADLINE: Program of Drug-Testing Pregnant Women Draws a Review by the Supreme Court

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether a South Carolina public hospital conducted unconstitutional searches when it tested pregnant women's urine for drugs so it could report illegal drug use to the police.
The case is an appeal on behalf of 10 women who were arrested as a result of the policy, some while they were still weak and bleeding from childbirth, and who later sued. It presents the Supreme Court a narrow but important aspect of a legal and public policy debate that began in the peak years of the crack epidemic of the 1980's: the extent to which a state may intervene to protect fetal health, and the circumstances under which pregnant women may be held criminally responsible for behavior that endangers their fetuses. 
 A federal appeals court ruled last year that while the urinalysis was a search, it was not unconstitutional because it was justified by "a special need beyond normal law-enforcement goals," namely protecting the health and safety of fetuses and newborn babies.
In their appeal, lawyers for the women are arguing that this conclusion amounts to a drastic expansion of what the Supreme Court has previously treated as a "special-needs exception" to the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches.
"Nearly every application of the criminal law serves some health or safety purpose" and so could be placed outside the protection of the Fourth Amendment under this approach, the women's brief said.
The appeal is supported by a coalition of public health groups, which told the justices that women who need prenatal care the most will be deterred from seeking it if their drug abuse is treated not as a medical problem but as a criminal one.
None of the women who filed the lawsuit were actually prosecuted, and the particular program they are challenging ended in the mid-1990's, after suits were filed and the United States Department of Health and Human Services began an investigation.
However, Lynn Paltrow, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers and director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, a program of the Women's Law Project in Philadelphia, said today that drug testing of pregnant women remained widespread in South Carolina under the State Supreme Court's interpretation of the state child endangerment law as applying not only to children but also to viable fetuses. The United States Supreme Court refused two years ago to review that state court interpretation.
"No other state has gone as far as South Carolina," Ms. Paltrow said in an interview, adding: "No other state has made it a crime to be pregnant and addicted. These women had a health problem and needed medical care, but they were taken to jail."
The lead plaintiff in the case, Crystal M. Ferguson, tested positive for cocaine during a prenatal visit to the hospital at the Medical University of South Carolina, in Charleston, in June 1991. She agreed to attend a drug abuse counseling program, but tested positive again when she gave birth in August. She was arrested three days later.
According to the city's statistics, 30 women were arrested under the program. Charges against all but two were dropped when the women entered treatment. Some of the women were taken from their hospital rooms in handcuffs or leg shackles. The plaintiffs are seeking damages and an injunction against future drug testing.
Analytically, the case is quite similar to a Fourth Amendment case the Supreme Court accepted for review last week, on whether police checkpoints that subject motorists to drug-detecting dogs are constitutional. The lower court in that case, Indianapolis v. Edmond, rejected the government's argument that the need to detect and deter drug trafficking was a "special need" that justified the warrantless searches.
In the new case, Ferguson v. City of Charleston, No. 99-936, the city asserts that the hospital adopted its policy, in cooperation with the police and the local prosecutor's office, in 1989 in the face of "an epidemic of cocaine use" among its maternity patients.
"The clinical necessity for the drug screens, the health problems associated with maternal cocaine use and the astronomical economic costs of caring for infants suffering from the effects of cocaine use by their mothers all created special needs beyond normal law-enforcement goals," the city maintains.
That was the analysis endorsed in a 2-to-1 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, which affirmed a jury's verdict in favor of the hospital.
The hospital did not test all its patients, instead singling out those it regarded as most likely to be using drugs. The criteria included having received no prenatal care, or care that was late or incomplete; displaying certain physical symptoms; unexplained preterm labor, and known drug or alcohol abuse in the past. Many of the public hospital's patients are poor and black; of the 10 plaintiffs, nine are black and one is white.
As the crack epidemic hit its peak, states adopted varying approaches to the issue of drug use by pregnant women. Because a number of state courts ruled, unlike the South Carolina Supreme Court, that a fetus could not be considered a child for purposes of prosecuting pregnant women under child abuse laws, some prosecutors argued that mothers delivered illegal drugs to their newborn babies through the umbilical cord during the brief moments between birth and the cutting of the cord.
A woman was convicted in Florida under this theory in 1989, but the Florida Supreme Court overturned the conviction three years later, ruling unanimously that when the State Legislature made "delivery" of illegal drugs a crime, it did not contemplate a prosecution of this sort.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
U.S. Stiffens Its Opposition To European I.M.F. Choice

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
President Clinton has vowed to block the man Europe wants to head the International Monetary Fund, setting off a possibly protracted contest for control of the financial institution and most likely casting the United States in the role of kingmaker.
Mr. Clinton's rejection of the candidate, Caio Koch-Weser, a German finance ministry official, makes the succession at the I.M.F. the biggest battle for leadership of a major international institution since the United States fought to oust United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and replace him with Kofi Annan in 1996. 
 The Clinton administration says that in an era when financial crises can spread at Internet speed from country to country, the German candidate does not have what it takes to be the world's chief financial firefighter.
The decision, relayed by Mr. Clinton in a phone call to Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany on Saturday and made public today, challenges the automatic European prerogative to choose the leader of the I.M.F., a tradition that began when the fund was created just after World War II.
But the Clinton administration has so far declined to rub it in by backing the sole American contender for the job, leaving open the possibility that Europe could still hold onto the position by putting forth another candidate of greater stature to succeed Michel Camdessus as managing director of the fund.
The American, Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the fund, was nominated by an unusual coalition of African and Arab countries and has demonstrated the skill to head the fund, backers say. But the Clinton administration seems likely to withhold support from him, at least initially, fearing that Europe might cripple the fund rather than see leadership pass to an American.
So far, Europe is standing by Mr. Koch-Weser, who has benefited from an aggressive German lobbying campaign over the last three months. Though Mr. Clinton told Mr. Schroder of firm United States opposition on Saturday, European finance ministers, meeting in Brussels today, announced the formal backing for Mr. Koch-Weser. Some officials there indicated that the common cause of preventing an American takeover helped them to unite behind Mr. Koch-Weser, overcoming France's reluctance to back him. And some European officials think his candidacy could succeed despite United States objections.
The dance over I.M.F. succession shows how complex it is to select leaders for world institutions at a time when globalization is racing ahead -- and when resistance to the spread of American-style capitalism and Western ideas appears to be mounting in tandem.
Since the monetary fund intervened in many of the largest developing countries in the late 1990's to help them grapple with the spread of financial panic that began in Asia, its power to influence how nations manage their economies and their currencies is by some measures at a record high.
Yet the process of selecting a leader for the fund is stuck in a global mindset of a half-century ago, when Europe and the United States controlled nearly every important international position and, in the case of the I.M.F. and the World Bank, simply divided the posts between them like members of a gentleman's club.
The Clinton administration's rejection of Mr. Koch-Weser and its decision not to throw support behind Mr. Fischer -- a combination one observer called a "half-pregnant" assertion of American power -- shook that tradition but did not shatter it.
The United States has signaled that it wants Europe to select someone more senior and experienced than Mr. Koch-Weser but has made clear to European officials that it does not intend to deny them the right to choose.
"On the one hand America is saying that we should find a better candidate," says C. Fred Bergsten, who heads the Institute of International Economics and has studied ways of changing the I.M.F. "On the other hand, we are passing up a golden opportunity to end this anachronism and really open up the process."
The American position leaves the selection process in limbo, raising the prospect that none of the three candidates nominated for the job will ultimately get it. The Japanese have nominated Eisuke Sakakibara, a former high-level Finance Ministry official known by the nickname Mr. Yen for his role in signaling Japan's position on managing its currency.
I.M.F. board members may begin informal voting later this week, taking a straw poll to determine whether any of the three candidates have strong support. It is still possible that one of the candidates could gather enough support to force a formal vote. Supporters of both Mr. Fischer and Mr. Koch-Weser are working to line up support from developing countries and generate momentum.
Voting power at the I.M.F. is determined primarily by the amount of money donor nations contribute. The United States has a 19 percent share, more than any other single nation. The European Union has 37 percent of the votes if the 15 nations that make up that bloc vote together. In practice, I.M.F. leaders have been chosen more by general acclamation than by a simple majority of the votes.
Mr. Koch-Weser, a 25-year veteran of the World Bank and an expert in development policies, still vows to win the post. With Europe's firm backing now in hand, he said he intended to recruit support from developing countries. He counts China and Brazil among his early backers.
"The endorsement from all the ministers came late, but it was encouraging," Mr. Koch-Weser said in a telephone interview. "Now we have to go out and mobilize support from the member governments, and I am quite confident that we can do that."
Supporters of Mr. Fischer, the deputy managing director, argue that he has a good shot as well.
Though he is Jewish and American, his candidacy was first broached by Angola and backed by nearly two dozen developing countries, including Iraq and Syria. Because the fund focuses on helping poor countries cope with capitalism, support from a diverse array of developing nations is seen as vital.
Mr. Fischer, a soft-spoken technocrat who ran the fund day to day under Mr. Camdessus, also has had a long and close relationship with Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. Mr. Fischer once taught Mr. Summers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Some Europeans think that the United States secretly supports Mr. Fischer, a view Clinton administration officials dismiss as a conspiracy theory with no grounding in reality.
Some administration officials do seem partial to Mr. Fischer but fear that the I.M.F. would become a political football if they sought to install an American in the top post. European nations put up most of the money for the fund, meaning that they could hobble its activities if they felt it had become an American protectorate. The Clinton administration also feels it does not lack for influence at the fund as things stand.
With the United States withholding its imprimatur on any of the current candidates, the most likely outcome is for the first round of jockeying to end in stalemate. Clinton administration officials say that they hope that that will prompt Europe to withdraw Mr. Koch-Weser from contention and produce a new candidate.
Publicly, there are no other European contenders for the job. But were European officials to withdraw Mr. Koch-Weser's nominaton, the speculation is that they would be inclined to nominate someone of significantly higher political stature, in part to save German face.
Among the long list of possible replacement candidates are Gordon Brown, Britain's current chancellor of the exchequer; Giuliano Amato, the Italian treasury secretary; Mario Draghi, the Italian treasury director; and Andrew Crockett, who heads the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.

HEADLINE: Return Passage to India: Emigres Pay Back

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: BOMBAY

 BODY:
During the past generation, tens of thousands of Indian engineers left home for America and many got rich -- some fabulously rich -- in the technology boom. Along the way, they became symbols of a brain drain that scholars believed was sucking the best and brightest minds out of third world countries.
But an increasing though still modest number of India's biggest American success stories, whose lives are now firmly rooted in the United States, are beginning to come home to India, too, and not just to visit relatives, but also to start companies, invest their capital and indulge in philanthropy. Some of them say they should no longer be seen as proof of the brain drain, but as signs of a brain trust -- a view economists say is still overly optimistic. 
 Even so, in an era when airplanes, telephones, e-mail and fax machines have transformed the lives of prosperous emigrants, economists say that the linear idea of a one-way brain drain is giving way to a different paradigm of brains that circulate between native and adopted countries.
That pattern is now emerging in India, which watched as perhaps 25,000 of its top graduates left for the United States since the late 1960's. In the years when the technology explosion hit America, these Indians emerged as major players and now run more than 750 technology companies in California's Silicon Valley alone.
One of those who got away was Kanwal S. Rekhi, 54, who now periodically comes back for what he calls his "missionary work in India."
He said he went to America so his brain wouldn't go down the drain in socialist India, made $300 million as an entrepreneur, executive and private investor in Silicon Valley, and retired five years ago.
Now, at the request of the prime minister's office in an India that is more market-driven, he is among those trying to raise $1 billion for the six Indian Institutes of Technology, elite public universities that produced the thousands of graduates who left for the United States.
Some of those who left say they are getting involved in India now because they have succeeded as entrepreneurs and have money to spare, because there are economic opportunities in India and because the Hindu nationalist-led government is more open to their participation in the country's affairs.
The government has, for example, challenged them to raise the billion dollars for the institutes that educated them at India's expense before they went to the United States, where they enriched the American economy.
"We're credible, successful people," Mr. Rekhi said. "Many of us are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. We're available to the Indian government and we provide a bridge to the United States. I do fund-raisers at my house for congressmen all the time."
Examples of these to-and-fro millionaires abound.
There's Desh Deshpande, 49, philanthropist. His telecommunications company, Sycamore Networks, was listed on the Nasdaq in October. His net worth has since skyrocketed to between $4 billion and $6 billion -- depending, he said, on the stock market and which day the money gets counted. He and his wife plan to give $100 million over 20 years to their alma mater, the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras.
"There is that emotional tie," he said.
Pradeep Singh, 42, a graduate of the New Delhi institute, said his "lottery ticket came through" during eight years as a manager earning stock options at Microsoft.
He quit in the mid-1990's to start his own company, Aditi, which provides customer service via e-mail from India for corporations abroad. He now has two companies, lives four months a year in Bangalore and eight in Seattle, and employs 600 people -- 350 of them in India.
"My Dad died recently," he said. "He was proud of what I did overseas, but that was nothing like what he felt about what I've done here. He clipped all the stories."
And there's Rakesh Mathur, 43, a graduate of the Bombay technology institute. He and three other Indians founded a Silicon Valley company, Junglee.com -- an early comparison-shopping engine on the Web. It was sold in 1998 to Amazon.com in a stock deal that has made Mr. Mathur $90 million richer.
He still has homes in Mountain View, Calif., and Seattle, but last year he also bought one in Pune. He has given $1 million to his alma mater and started a new company, Purpleyogi.com, with offices in Bangalore and Mountain View.
On a recent visit to Bombay, he ventured back to the technology institute's 500-acre campus, driving down a grand main road lined by towering bottle palms and past the new Kanwal Rekhi School of Information Technology now under construction, named for the American-made Indian philanthropist.
For Mr. Mathur, who has the casual style of a Californian, it was a double homecoming. He went to college here and grew up on the campus because his father was a professor. He was back to visit a troika of ambitious students who are determined to get rich off the Internet -- and who had succeeded in making him their mentor.
Over 10-cent cups of coffee at a little outdoor cafe on campus, these young men had hatched their ideas, then pursued Mr. Mathur whenever he visited the campus and skipped a week of classes once to meet with him when he was in Delhi.
"We're different than our classmates because we realized there's opportunity here in India," said Kashyap Deorah, 20.
Graduates of the institutes -- which are harder to get into than Harvard -- have formed a transcontinental good-old-boy network (most of the students are still male) thatconnects Bombay, Bangalore and Hyderabad to Silicon Valley, Seattle and Boston.
The institutes themselves are among the few entities in India that are still seen as meritocracies, unsullied by political influence. Admission is based solely on a grueling national entrance exam. Last year, of the 98,000 students who took it, only 3,000 won admission.
And the United States continues to exert a magnetic pull on Indian students and other Indian professionals. Last year, a third of the 115,000 visas the United States issued to skilled workers went to Indians.
"Can I be frank?" asked Suman Kar, a 20-year-old senior at the Bombay institute, as he explained why he has accepted a job in Silicon Valley. "It's the money."
He said his new job will pay about $60,000 a year, seven times what he would have earned here.
Graduates of the institutes have been the most sought-after Indians in Silicon Valley -- and Indians there have done very well, indeed. AnnaLee Saxenian, an economist at Berkeley, documented in an analysis of a Dun & Bradstreet database that 750 companies there are run by Indians.
Those companies produce more than $3.5 billion in sales and employ more than 16,000 people.
And as Indians have risen to positions of influence in corporate suites throughout the American economy, they have played a crucial role in giving credibility to business people based in India who are selling software services to American companies.
"When the Indian guy comes knocking at your door, selling something, the first thought on your mind isn't snakes and elephants," said Mr. Singh, formerly of Microsoft.
Software exports from India grew by more than 50 percent a year in the 1990's as businesses here found a niche in employing high-skilled, low-wage computer engineers in India to write computer code for businesses abroad. The industry now employs 280,000 people and is expected to have $4 billion in revenues this year, a majority from sales to American companies, according to the New Delhi-based National Association of Software and Service Companies.
Professor Saxenian had once thought that few of them would take their money or themselves back to India, but a recent visit to Bangalore changed her view.
She ran into an Indian entrepreneur from the valley, Sanjay Anandaram, and learned that he had returned to help start a new company that will develop and finance Indian technology ventures -- and he was not exceptional.
"Change is happening fast," she said. "At every level, you see personal and business connections to India that were not there even two years ago."
The declining financial situation of the institutes is one of the factors drawing them back. In 1993, the government cut its funding of the institutes and for the first time allowed individuals to donate money directly to them. The alumni in the United States have given most of the millions raised so far for the Bombay institute. The Indus Entrepreneurs, a group founded by Indians in Silicon Valley, has been instrumental in raising the money.
Economists who had once seen the brain drain as harmful, now see the diaspora it has spawned as a source of strength to developing countries.
"The emigres often work as a Trojan horse, lobbying on your behalf," said the Columbia University economics professor Jagdish Bhagwati, himself a native of India. "They use external opportunities to succeed prodigiously in different occupations. And they can bring their skills and funds home to assist the country in its economic takeoff."
Mr. Mathur, the Web entrepreneur, is such a person.
The three students he advises came up with an idea that caught his imagination. On his recent visit, they formally presented their proposal for a Web site called iportia.com -- the site is up and running, but their company's exact product is still undisclosed -- in a conference room in a downtown Bombay hotel.
Mr. Mathur and another prominent graduate, Nandan M. Nilekani, chief operating officer of Infosys Technologies, and Deepak B. Phatak, head of the computer science department at the institute in Bombay, listened attentively.
When the students finished, the older men asked them to leave the room, then considered whether to make this the university's first attempt to incubate a student business that it would partly own.
The students stood outside waiting nervously. Would Mr. Mathur put up the $250,000 on the university's behalf that would let them make their dream real?
After a half hour, the students were summoned back. The grownups had decided that the young men had a great idea.
The grinning students took turns shaking hands with Mr. Mathur, who turned to the professor, and exclaimed, "Phatak, Sahib, they have to make at least $100 million for you!"

HEADLINE: U.S. Takes Aim At Tax Shelters For Companies

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The government issued new rules today to discourage abusive corporate tax shelters. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said the proliferation of such shelters "may be the most serious compliance issue threatening the American tax system today."
The regulations are aimed at forcing the disclosure of new kinds of tax shelters as soon as they are created so that they can be reviewed by the I.R.S. and, if found improper, can be banned before they become widespread. This would replace the current practice of uncovering abuses through audits, often years later, and trying to undo them in court, one case at a time. 
 The new regulations, effective immediately, are intended to curb the use of accounting methods that have no legitimate business purpose and are intended solely to lower a company's taxes.
As an example, Mr. Summers cited one newly uncovered arrangement that is apparently spreading quickly. A company makes two loans of equal amounts at equal interest rates to a partner. Later the interest rate on one loan is dropped to zero, while the interest rate on the other loan is doubled. The loan on which no interest is being paid can be counted as a loss on the company's tax return, while the loan at the doubled interest rate is placed on the books of an overseas affiliate not taxed in the United States.
Mr. Summers said such transactions "are devoid of economic substance" and serve no purpose except avoiding taxes.
The new regulations would require corporations to disclose shelters on their tax returns if any two of six conditions are met. One of those conditions would be that a fee of more than $100,000 was paid to an outside firm for help in creating the shelter. Many accounting, law and Wall Street firms arrange shelters for a fee. Another condition would be an agreement that the technique would be confidential.
The regulations would also require that the firms that arrange such shelters disclose the deals to the I.R.S. as soon as they begin offering them. The firms would be required to keep records for seven years of who bought these shelters, and details of how they work, and to make these files available to the I.R.S. on request.
To dissuade lawyers and accountants from recommending dubious tax shelters, the rules that govern the conduct of professionals representing clients before the I.R.S. will be tightened in the next six months. Both professionals and their firms will be subject to suspension and "in extreme cases" may be barred from all I.R.S. proceedings.
In addition, Mr. Summers said, a special squad of I.R.S. auditors will analyze tax shelters and help those who examine corporate tax returns identify abusive transactions.
He also said meetings will be held to encourage business leaders to support the attack on tax shelters. This may include calling on the chief executives of companies that engage in questionable shelters, and the heads of firms that promote them, to tell them that their conduct is out of line, said Jonathan Talisman, the acting assistant secretary for tax policy.
Abusive tax shelters cost the government $10 billion annually, according to the official Treasury estimate, but Mr. Summers said in a speech today that this "is just the tip of the iceberg" and the actual figure may be many times larger.
The speech, to the Federal Bar Association, an organization of lawyers who practice before federal agencies, was to have been delivered by an aide. But Mr. Summers decided to deliver it personally.
Earlier this month an article in The New York Times reported that the tax burden on individuals rose in recent years while the burden on companies fell, and a major reason cited was the proliferation of tax shelters.
The article included I.R.S. data showing that had companies paid taxes in 1997 at the same rate as in 1990 they would have paid $60 billion more in 1997 alone, while if individuals had paid in 1997 at the same rate as in 1990 they would have paid $80 billion less.
Mr. Summers began his address by declaring that "our aim is to curb illegitimate tax avoidance." He added, "We have no quarrel with the natural desire of companies and individuals to minimize their tax burden by legitimate means."
He quoted Judge Learned Hand's observation: "There is nothing sinister in arranging one's affairs to keep taxes as low as possible. Everybody does so."
Mr. Summers said he agreed with that both as a matter of law and morality, but added that "we must draw the line at the pursuit of engineered transactions that are devoid of economic substance."
Mr. Summers also renewed a call for Congress to pass legislation to help deter abusive shelters, including a 25 percent excise tax on fees collected by firms arranging such shelters and a doubling, to 40 percent from 20 percent, of the penalty on taxes improperly avoided.
He also repeated his call for Congress to enact the "doctrine of economic substance." That doctrine, created by judges in tax cases, holds that transactions with a primary benefit of tax avoidance are not legitimate. Mr. Summers said enacting that doctrine would help "fight abusive tax shelters on a universal rather than case-by-case basis."
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, criticized the Treasury for not issuing regulations sooner, noting that Congress passed an abusive tax shelter law three years ago.
"We must stop abuses and shut down illegal tax shelters," he said.
But Tara Bradshaw, a spokeswoman for Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the senator would not comment on the proposals until he had studied them. She said the committee would hold hearings within a month on corporate tax shelters.
Charles O. Rossotti, the I.R.S. commissioner, said early disclosure of tax shelters "will give us better information to focus our resources" and will speed up "a pretty slow and indirect process" of hunting for abusive shelters one at a time.
The requirement that tax shelter promoters keep lists of clients will allow the I.R.S., when it finds one tax shelter, to identify all such shelters.
The call by Mr. Summers to crack down on illegal tax shelters was praised by Mike Murphy, executive director of the Tax Executives Institute, which represents top tax officials at 2,800 companies. But Mr. Murphy said the institute did not agree with each of the techniques Treasury proposed. For example, Mr. Murphy said doubling the penalty for abusive shelters might not be effective and might result in more litigation.
Some institute members, Mr. Murphy said, are eager for the government to attack abusive shelters because they are feeling pressure from their superiors to match the tax avoidance strategies of competitors, even if they must engage in shams.
Mr. Summers noted that while individual income tax revenues surged 6.2 percent last year, corporate income tax payments fell 2 percent.
He said that the Treasury was also considering allowing companies to notify the I.R.S. in advance of tax avoidance transactions and obtain a ruling on their validity.

Firm Outlines Plan To Advance Airport

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
A study of Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn., has concluded that the growing airport could be a catalyst for economic growth, but that the state lacked the expertise to make it one.
The study, which cost the state $400,000, said that Connecticut's Department of Transportation, which runs the airport, should create a board of directors made up of business leaders to develop long-range plans. 
 The Schiphol Group, the consulting firm that conducted the study, stopped short of recommending privatization of Bradley's operations. But the recommendations still chafed some transportation officials, who said a record number of travelers and a $156 million improvement project were evidence that the current management was adequate.
State transportation officials got high marks for Bradley's day-to-day operations, but the study said the airport lacked a focus on customers and had a weak presence in the state's tourism industry.
Under the report's recommendations, the board of directors would work to make Bradley a factor in all economic development initiatives and would create marketing and financial plans.

The Two Worlds of Teenage Pregnancy

BYLINE: By ERIC NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
The United States may be at the top by most economic measures, but for an important measure of social health -- teenage pregnancy and childbearing -- it moves among the poorest.
American teenagers are best compared to those in the Russian federation or in depressed Eastern European countries like Bulgaria, a new study finds. Teenage pregnancy and childbearing rates here are at least four times those in France, Germany and Japan, said researchers from Alan Guttmacher Institute, which researches reproductive health. 
 The institute's president, Sara Reims, said the problem was in part the result of poverty and inequity, but also the reflection of insufficient sex education and low-cost, easily obtainable contraception. "Our young people deserve better," she said in a statement, adding that Americans had much to learn from Western Europeans.
Still, in the 1990's, the report said, Americans saw a 17 percent decline in adolescent pregnancy and childbirth. This mirrored a larger trend over the last 25 years among industrialized nations, as well as an overall decline in childbearing among women of all ages.
Researchers suggest that the decline was a result of several factors, including greater emphasis on education and employment, more motivation to delay sexual intercourse among teenagers, and whatever their limits, improved sex education and contraception.
The researcher said the most recent birthrate among girls 15 to 19 was 54 per 1,000 in the United States, 49.6 in Bulgaria, 10 in France and 3.9 in Japan.

HEADLINE: High Infant Mortality Rates In Brooklyn Mystify Experts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
In central Brooklyn -- where storefronts are boarded, housing projects stand in defiant opposition to the boom times, and the hospitals are more or less broke -- babies are dying at rates that the city as a whole has not seen in nearly two decades. And they die, in some cases, at a rate double what the federal government has set as the infant mortality goal for the nation.
Often, they die months before they were meant to be born, their bodies a tangle of minute bones and skin, weighed in grams rather than pounds. Some never see their mother's faces; they are gone right after birth. Others leave the hospital with a shopping bag of drugs and a mother overwhelmed by her own myriad problems, and do not make it to their first birthday. 
 While the infant mortality rate in New York City has fallen steadily in the last decade, it has fallen much more slowly in neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville, neighborhoods with considerable populations of new immigrants.
In New York City in 1998, babies less than a year old died at a rate of 6.8 per 1,000, which is slightly better than the national average, 7.2. Bedford-Stuyvesant, however, has one of the highest rates in the country, 14 per 1,000, a 20 percent increase over 1997. The last time the average rate of infant mortality was that high in New York City over all was 1983.
That the number is on the rise at all is startling. It stands against the national trend even in cities with severe social problems, like Washington, where the rate is 12.5 per 1,000.
In Brownsville, the story is much the same; the rate slides up and down each year, averaging about 10 deaths per 1,000 babies in the last five years. While the disparity between children of black and white mothers has always been stark, there is evidence that the gap is closing elsewhere in the city. The infant mortality rate in the Tremont section of the Bronx, for example, is 8.1, a 54 percent decrease from 1988.
The figures have so concerned the city's health commissioner, Dr. Neal L. Cohen, that he has made reducing infant mortality one of his top priorities for this year.
There seems to be no clear answer to why the same neighborhoods stand out year after year, and why some would buck the downward trends. Experts seem to agree that even when the resources exist -- prenatal care at low cost, hospitals willing to deliver babies, government-subsidized infant formula and food -- it is still profoundly difficult to get many pregnant women through the doors.
"It is a perplexing question," said Dr. Katherine La Guardia, who runs the ambulatory obstetrics and gynecology clinic at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in Brownsville. "A huge amount of effort has gone into improving prenatal care, but we still don't know how one reaches the most unreachable."
Those are the mothers who are addicted to drugs, who are H.I.V. positive, unemployed or living in New York as illegal immigrants. Women who fit those descriptions often avoid going to see doctors before they give birth out of fear, experts said, that their babies will be taken from them or that they will be deported.
Others are discouraged by family members, who do not believe in prenatal care or are suspicious of the entire medical system.
"The question is, how do we make women less afraid to get care," Dr. La Guardia said.
Other mothers want prenatal care but cannot get it because they live too far from a health clinic or hospital, or have small children and no one at home to care for them while they make the trek to the doctor.
There are also anomalies that cannot be readily explained. For instance, neighborhoods with a high concentration of immigrants from the Caribbean seem to report the highest infant mortality figures. "What is interesting about Bedford is that 42.1 percent of the women are foreign-born," said Dr. Tanya Pagan Paggio, an associate professor of medicine at the City University of New York.
"This is important because when you look at other places in the city where there is a high level of foreign-born, infant mortality rates are closer to 6 percent," Dr. Paggio said. "In Bedford, there are a lot of Caribbean people. And we know that Jamaican women have a 9.4 per 1,000 rate, Haitian women have about 11 per 1,000 and rates among women from Trinidad and Tobago are also high. You have to wonder if these women have access to services they need."
Robin Bennett is desperate not to let her baby become another sad statistic. At 23, she is pregnant with her fourth child, a baby with a heart condition. One son is in foster care, and the other lives with her mother. Her daughter, who is 18 months old, lives with Ms. Bennett in a government-subsidized apartment for crime victims in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Her problems are as complicated as they are numerous: her apartment is full of bugs that bite her baby, she said, adding that one of her children was a result of a rape. Her mother, who has AIDS, is her main line of support.
"Sometimes I cry at night because I wonder if the stress in my life gave this baby her hole in her heart," Ms. Bennett said. She finds herself gravitating to Brooklyn Perinatal Network, an organization that tries to keep babies like Ms. Bennett's from dying by shepherding women into prenatal care, advocating for them on housing issues and giving other social support.
In fact, a lack of access to housing, nutritious food and adult support may contribute to infant mortality as much as poor medical care, many experts say.
"Prenatal care has probably been overstated," said Dawn Misra, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and an expert on infant mortality. "If you look at a program like Healthy Start, you see it is a broader initiative with resources like food, social support and other things like smoking cessation clinics, which is important because smoking may lead to low-birth-weight babies, and low birth weight is the leading cause of infant mortality."
When Bedford-Stuyvesant lost a majority of its financing in 1997 for Healthy Start, a federal program intended to help poor women have healthy babies, the infant mortality rate shot up, said Ngosi Moses, who runs the Brooklyn Perinatal Network.
"When resources became scarce, those rates rose," Ms. Ngosi said. "This shows you when money is put into the community, good things happen, and when the money is pulled out, they go out."
The $6.8 million that was spread over 22 programs in the early 1990's now has to cover 94 programs.
Brownsville is a neighborhood that a decade of economic expansion seems to have left untouched, where Healthy Start does not even exist and where a Starbucks is not coming. Rows of private homes are boarded up, big gray housing projects towering bleakly nearby. Stores are scarce, save for a few of the dollar-bin variety. There are overpriced delis and a smattering of Caribbean food stands.
Young women walk briskly though the streets, perhaps to avoid the corners where young men often congregate. The number of people, especially women, who are infected with the AIDS virus is "astonishing," Dr. La Guardia said.
In most hospitals in the city, it is almost a given that a mother will leave the maternity ward with a healthy baby in her arms. In Brownsville, it is often just short of a victory.
Dr. La Guardia and her boss, Dr. Martin Gimovsky, who heads the obstetrics department at Brookdale, spend their days trying to unravel the complicated histories and medical problems of the poor women who come through its clinics and labor and delivery floor each day. Many have never had a day of prenatal care, or are woefully misguided about childbirth.
On a recent Wednesday afternoon, during Dr. Gimovsky's clinic for women with high-risk pregnancies, dozens of women crammed into a waiting room. Almost all of them had had children before, including the recently homeless woman with AIDS who did not know her due date and had had virtually no prenatal care.
"You've gained weight," the resident said reassuringly.
"Well, I'm living somewhere now, so I am much more relaxed," said the woman, who would not give her name.
Cynthia Martinez, who has three children and is pregnant with a fourth, still calls her first baby, the one who was stillborn, by her name, Cynthia Michelle. "She is 10 now," she said. The baby stopped moving at 7 months, and by the time Ms. Martinez delivered her, the doctors told her she was dead.
Distraught, Ms. Martinez said that she grabbed the baby of the woman she shared a room with when it was brought in for a feeding and refused to let her go. "I just kept saying, 'You can't take this baby from me," Ms. Martinez, 24, said. "I guess I thought she was mine. My mother told me that God had taken one from me but would give me more."
Few patients at Brookdale, one of the city's most financially strained hospitals, pay the full price of their care, if they pay at all. Many are covered by the Prenatal Care Assistance Program, a state-financed program for poor pregnant women.
"We work with the patients no one wants," said Dr. Gimovsky, a plump and congenial doctor, who jokes easily with the teenage girls who fill the cramped clinic space. He recruited Dr. La Guardia by likening her work to that of the Peace Corps. "You don't make any money at this," he said cheerfully, "but this is what I want to do with my life."
Although the infant mortality rates in Brownsville are historically lower than in Bedford-Stuyvesant, the March of Dimes earmarked the neighborhood for a $152,000 program to try to get more services to women. It is also pushing legislators in Albany to raise the maximum income women may earn and still qualify for the state's prenatal care program.
Dr. La Guardia has been at Brookdale for only a few months. Unlike Dr. Gimovsky, she is businesslike, almost stern, and deeply weary over the hospital's dire fiscal situation.
"I am still in shock," she said. Money would permit the hiring of more doctors and nurses. Ultrasound machines, standard equipment in any Manhattan obstetrics office, are scarce. A portable ultrasound, the latest in technology, is unheard of.
"Clearly, there are more dollars that need to be funneled into this area," Dr. La Guardia said. "You wonder if there is any hope."
