HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Canada Is Called the Best Place to Do Business

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: After the last three years, do you still have waste to remove and efficiencies to gain? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Economy 1: A Rare Consensus
Paul Kedrosky provides a great historical analysis of small-business complaints by presidential term. Short sales rise the most since 2006. The bond market indicator, which has predicted every recession since 1970, shows that the economy has about a 60 percent chance of contracting within 12 months. Kash Mansori says we are currently going through "a deeply unfortunate and harmful bout of fiscal contraction... right when we should be doing exactly the opposite." But Lou Basense offers two charts to dispel recessionfears. A rare bipartisan consensus: all parties agree that the deficit panel is doing too much of its work in secret. Robert Reich lists the seven biggest economic lies. David Leonhardt concludes that annual data may be less reliable in some ways than monthly data.
The Economy 2: Jobs
The jobs council tells the president we need more jobs. President Obama's $447 billion jobs plan is blocked by the Senate. We continue to struggle to attract critical-skill employees. Hale Stewart explains where jobs are being created. American manufacturing payrolls surpass $500 billion. A new report says that four out of five small-businessowners will maintain or reduce their number of full-time employees over the next six months. Some feel that the decision to add even one person to the payroll is a huge leap of faith for a small company. Dana Blankenhorn explains why unemployment is not here to stay: "Let's start with the economy. It's going to grow. Global demand continues rocketing upward, and that rising tide is going to lift a lot of boats." Weekly unemployment claims are at 404,000.
The Data: No Pulse?
Small-business confidenceimproves. Existing-home inventory continues to decline. The Cass Freight Index shows strong gains. Household income declined more in the two years after the recession ended than it did during the recession. The pulse of commerce is deemed "alarming" (but a new Superman may save the day). Orders for machine tools and equipment are up significantly. Our trade deficit is unchanged. September retail sales are up thanks to the auto industry. 
Marketing: Ignoring Customers on Twitter
Chris Newton suggests four things to do immediately when sales start drying up. Corbett Barr says there is a question you have to answer to get people to visit your blog. Some highly trafficked Web sites promise that they won't, but they still reveal personal data. Lauren Fisher gives 10 examples of companies that have succeededwith social media. A lot of companies ignore customer complaints on Twitter. Diana Pohly offers five powerful questions for customer-satisfaction research. A new service helps consumers create free QR codes so that businesses can link customers to social media pages, coupons or store information. Thursday Bram explains why connections are the most powerful asset in a freelancer's business.
Around the World: The Best Country to Do Business In Is ...
Canada is No. 1. A mountain biker gets blindsided in Africa. Italy may weigh drug tests for stock traders. China's small firms face a grim outlook. And talk about a tough credit market for small businesses. The tomato market in India offers a great example of a number of economic concepts. Here's where to apply to Startup Chile. And to our friends in Britain, I know things look bleak, but with kids like Sophia Grace your future is bright!
Around the Country: At Least There's One Winner in Boston
North Dakota sets more oil records. Mikal E. Belicove says he believes that cities should market their problems to entrepreneurs. Thirty-nine percent of the workers in Orange County, Calif., make more than $100,000. Geoff Williams asks if the N.B.A. lockout will hurt small businesses. America's favorite small business wins a $75,000 prize package. Little Sprouts is Boston's Small Business of the Year. San Diego is the luckiest town in America.
Red Tape Update: The S.B.A. Through History
The House approves trade deals with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. Federal Reserve oversight of nonbank financial companies is weighed. Only eight of the Forbes 400 say they are willing to pay more taxes. Here's a new infographic history of the Small Business Administration. Congressman Graves says that the proposed interference of a critical GPS signal will cost American small businesses.
Start-Up: Don't Occupy Wall Street
Carol Tice says don't occupy Wall Street, just start a business. Four buddies start a business to show what love is all about. A new company says it can energize egg cells to improve fertility. Mark Evans lists the 10 realities of working for a start-up, including, "Don't expect a big piece of the pie. Unless you're a founder or an early, early employee, you will, at best, get a minuscule piece of the equity pie." A new biotech company lands $42 million to create new cancer drugs. A start-up claims it can make fuel out of thin air. Joe Chung explains how not to starta start-up: "Don't do something you know 20 other start-ups are already doing. This is just simple math." A start-up tries to extract the financial pain of dental visits.
Finance: Big Businesses Helping Little Businesses
The Startup America Partnership introduces its Startup-Corporate Connection Program. Joshua Kurlantzick gives examples of how big businesses helpsmall businesses. Google and Twitter join the Small Business Saturday movement. Anne Lowrey explains why President Obama's $30 billion small-business loan program flopped. Gary Honig explains what a signature loan is (and how to get one). Venture capital takes a dive to an eight-year low (and this guy takes an even scarier dive). Here are 15 venture capitalists worth knowing. Celebrity investors can be risky for small businesses.
Ideas: Deadster
An upcoming "trend school" explains why Gen Y types are inspiring the rise of "intelligent taste" (well, not all of themare intelligent). Opportunities in oil and natural gas have rarely been so bountiful. Swallowable perfume emits fragrance from the skin. Qwikster is now deadster and the Allbusiness.com gang shares lessons learned from the Netflix disaster. Edward Hess identifies nine challenges growing businesses face and offers tips on how to tackle them. Tara "Missrogue" Hunt shares 10 mistakes she's made so you don't have to. David Butcher shares best practices for parcel shipping. A pub on wheels starts a trend. And would someone feed these cats
Technology: BlackBerry Has a Tough Week
More headaches for BlackBerry. Box.net closes a financing round worth $81 million. Is Facebook's iPad app a flop? More small businesses are using mobile devicesto streamline operations. Airlinesrush to add Wi-Fi. A new company combines document management, faxing and e-signatures. PayPal wants to become the Web payment system to rule them all. IBM introduces anew portfolio of cloud offerings. Apple's iCloud has its debut. Lemon.com lets you store and organize your receipts in the cloud. A new electric car gets good mileage. Microsoft reports a large drop in e-mail spam. Facebook acquires a Q&A service. In any 48-hour period in 2010, more data was created than had been created by all of humanity in the previous 30,000 years (but do we need all of this data?) Here are 11 tech tools for your start-up. Abu Dhabi has developed alife-size robot that could take the place of human workers.
The Week Ahead: Inflation and Housing
New data on consumer and producer prices will tell us where inflation is heading. The New York and Philadelphia Feds give us their takes on the local economies. In real estate: look for the latest in building permits and existing-home sales. Also, it's National Save for Retirement Week.
The Week's Bests
Hiring Strategy: Cezary Pietrzak explains how to find talent for your start-up, including choosing people who are comfortable doing anything: "In a small company, there are too many roles and too few people to fill them, so someone has to step in and get the job done. We like people who are well rounded and can excel in more ways than one, even if it means doing grunt work. As one famous angel investor put it, hire for talent, not skill, and make sure that this talent can be generalized across a wide range of initiatives."
Way to Woo an Audience: Jessica Levco says you should woo an audience like Rahm Emanuel: "Watch your body language. He was poised and relaxed throughout the event. Whether leaning forward in his chair or tilting his head toward the person speaking, he didn't fidget or fiddle. Watching him shake hands with the panelists after the event was equally impressive. He might send you a dead fish, but you'll never catch 'Rahmbo' giving a person a dead-fish handshake."
Move Beyond The Budget: Brad Power says stop budgeting, start improving: "The typical approaches of budget cuts and layoffs usually don't result in sustained changes to their cost structure - the costs creep back. Instead, companies must make fundamental changes to the way they work - how they market and sell, handle orders, bill for those orders, manufacture and distribute their goods, and serve customers after the sale. If they remove waste, errors, and time from these processes, they will get cost efficiency as a byproduct."
This Week's Question: After the last three years, do you still have waste to remove and efficiencies to gain?

HEADLINE: The Top 1%: Executives, Doctors and Bankers

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A study finds that about a third Americans in that top 1 percent are executives, managers and supervisors who work outside of finance. 

 BODY:
The "99-percenters" protesting at Occupy Wall Street should think about occupying the C-suites across America as well, at least if their primary complaint is about income inequality.
That is one implication of this fascinating paperon the occupations of the top 1 percent of Americans, which I came across via Mike Konczal. The paper is by Jon Bakija of Williams College, Adam Cole of the Treasury Department and Bradley T. Heim of Indiana University, and is based on tax data from 2005 (so, before the financial crisis).
It finds that about a third of Americans in that top percentile were executives, managers and supervisors who work outside of finance. The next biggest share, at 15.7 percent, went to medical professionals, followed by those in financial services with 13.9 percent.

As we've writtenmanytimesover, the total share of income going to the top 1 percent has increased in recent decades. In 2005, the top 1 percent of earners received 16.97 percent of total income distributed to all households across the United States.
The C-suiters accounted for about a third of that chunk received by the top percentile. Put another way, the nonfinance executives, managers and supervisors at the very top of the income distribution received 6.35 percent of income received by all Americans in 2005.

HEADLINE: He Made It on Wall St. and Used It to Help Start the Protests

BYLINE: J. DAVID GOODMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A man who became wealthy working on Wall Street contributed money that helped mobilize the Occupy Wall Street movement. 

 BODY:
Robert S. Halper, a retired Wall Street trader, spends time each day in Zuccotti Park talking to protesters about politics and their thoughts on reforming the banking system.
But Mr. Halper, a 52-year-old Brooklyn native, never reveals two facts about himself: he is a former vice chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange and the largest single donor to the nonprofit magazine that ignited the Occupy Wall Street movement.
"The whole thing is very surreal to me - the fact that I spent my whole career right across the street," he said in an interview last week on a marble bench near the park. "It makes me a little anxious, to tell you the truth. It could go anywhere. I just pray that it ends peaceful."
Mr. Halper said he first heard about the plan for protests in June when he visited Kalle Lasn, the editor in chief of Adbusters, a Canadian anticorporate magazine, in Vancouver. Over a steak dinner, the two longtime friends discussed Mr. Lasn's project, a plan to fill Wall Street with protesters as a way to galvanize anger on the political left into a revolutionary movement resembling the Arab Spring.
"I rolled my eyes," he said. "I was more interested in talking about health care."
But Mr. Halper, who lives on the Upper West Side, had long been a supporter of the magazine, donating by his estimate $50,000 to $75,000 over the last 20 years since he was first attracted by the magazine's spoofs on corporate logos and advertisements. So he wrote a check for $20,000 and returned to his life in New York.
A month later, the magazine sent an e-mail blitz to 90,000 readers and advocates calling for the occupation of Wall Street and setting the date for the first protesters to camp in downtown Manhattan.
"We sparked it," said Mr. Lasn, 69, but "what they've done up until now - with a leaderless movement that is all-inclusive - that's given them a kind of mystique that has launched a national conversation."
The text of that initial call can still be found on the magazine's Web site, which has been filled with photos and videos from the Occupy Wall Street protests. Mr. Lasn said the magazine's circulation, now roughly 120,000, had expanded in the weeks since protesters took over Zuccotti Park on the Adbusters-selected date, Sept. 17.
The protest quickly grew beyond the influence of the magazine's followers, as independent calls for similar protests in other cities began proliferating. The leaderless movement soon gained a measure of cohesion online from another unlikely place: Nebraska.
Two days after the start of the Occupy Wall Street protests, a pair of young Web designers, unable to travel to New York to take part in the demonstration, created a simple digital hub for the growing number of Facebook and Twitter pages dedicated to spreading the protest to new places.
"I thought, 'Wow, it would be really great if there was a Web site that collected information about all of these,' " one of the designers, Ella, 25, said. (She spoke on the condition that she be referred to only by her first name to minimize the harassment she receives via e-mail.)
She and her fiance threw together a page in "a few hours" and called it Occupy Together, and the design appears to have been emulated by others trying to organize in dozens of cities, including Boston, Seattle and Portland, Ore.
Mr. Halper, the Wall Street supporter of Adbusters, said he felt swept up in something larger but remained ambivalent about the protests. He does not claim any role in starting the movement, though he calls Zuccotti Park "the coolest place in New York."
Mr. Halper was raised in East New York, Brooklyn, and Woodmere on Long Island, and his parents owned a liquor store on the Lower East Side. He began his career as a floor trader in 1983, swapping oil futures and living in Manhattan. Since retiring in 2007, he has focused on philanthropy, donating roughly $100,000 a year to a variety of causes, mostly related to health care and the arts.
He recently gave $2,500 to Mitt Romney's campaign for president, after meeting him at a neighbor's fund-raiser. "My giving is a little A.D.D. - like me," he said, referring to what he described as his hyperactivity and wandering attention.
He readily admits to being a member of the so-called One Percent - the top slice of American earners, who have been vilified by the protesters. "The fact that I made a lot of money, things just worked out for me," he said. "There's some issues where we're all in it together."
Mr. Halper said his conversations with protesters had made him think a lot about what should be done. "If there's pain, it should be shared," he said. "The people who have money - they should pay something more, whether that's in taxes or somewhere else."

HEADLINE: Energy Deals See an Upswing as Bargains Abound

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: With commodity prices falling, big domestic and international players in oil and gas like Statoil, Sinopec, Kinder Morgan and Energy Transfer are tapping their vast cash reserves to buy companies. 

 BODY:
Global energy giants are capitalizing on the country's economic woes.
With commodity prices falling, big domestic and international players are tapping their vast cash reserves to buy oil and gas companies, whose stocks have been decimated by the downturn.
On Monday, Statoil of Norway agreed to buy Brigham Exploration Company for $4.4 billion to gain control of potentially lucrative oil fields across North Dakota and Montana. At $36.50 a share, the price tag is nearly 4 percent below Brigham's high in April.
"Companies spent the first half of the year pocketing a lot of cash from high prices," said Justin Jacobs, an oil and gas analyst at the research firm Business Monitor International. "Now, they're taking advantage of the downturn to hunt for bargains."
The industry stalwarts are targeting North America. Amid a glut in production, natural gas prices have dropped by almost 50 percent since 2009. With energy prices depressed, independent players are struggling to find financing for their projects, prompting larger competitors with deep pockets to make a move.
So far this year, oil and gas companies have announced $149 billion worth of acquisitions on the continent, roughly 64 percent of the worldwide total of $235 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. In one of the largest deals, Kinder Morgan on Sunday agreed to buy El Paso Corporation for $21.1 billion.
At the current rate, the industry is on track to surpass last year's global volume of $311 billion in acquisitions, Thomson Reuters said.
"The amount of capital needed in the oil and gas industry always means there are opportunities for deals," says Jim Dillavou, head of Deloitte & Touche's energy transaction services practice.
Investors are betting the consolidation will continue.
Shares of Range Resources, a shale gas company that the research firm Morningstar considers a takeover target, have risen by nearly 20 percent since Thursday; Whiting Petroleum, with oil assets in Montana and the Dakotas, is up more than 9 percent in same period; and SandRidge Energy's stock has gained nearly the same amount.
Small energy companies are particularly vulnerable to takeovers. While such players control highly attractive assets, many businesses are still struggling to turn a profit.
Last week, Sinopec of China agreed to buy Daylight Energy, a Canadian oil and natural gas producer, for about $2.1 billion in cash. Daylight, which lost $45.1 million last year, owns more than 320,000 acres in the resource-rich region of western Canada.
Despite the weakness, companies are betting on a boom in energy production. Natural gas production - mostly from unconventional sources like shale - is expected to increase by 25 percent over the next two decades, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Such prospects have spurred deals for infrastructure assets.
Through its purchase of El Paso, Kinder Morgan will own 67,000 miles of pipelines, moving more than 1.9 million barrels of fuels a day. If successful in its $5.9 billion bid for Southern Union, Energy Transfer Equities will oversee 44,000 miles of pipelines, with about 30.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas capacity.
With their dominant share of the market, Morgan Kinder and Equity Transfer are well placed to potentially charge high fees for use of their pipelines.
"The companies are positioning themselves to reap long-term benefits," said Claudia Mahn, North American energy analyst at research group IHS Global Insight. "There are huge opportunities for growth when the economy starts to recover."

HEADLINE: Australians Assess Their Greenhouse Plan

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A closer look at Australia's move to put a price on CO2. 

 BODY:
In the wake of Australia's move to add a price to carbon dioxide emissions -- which is particularly notable considering the country is one of the world's big exporters of coal (and related CO2 emissions) -- I sent a query to some Australian analysts of climate and energy policy to see if this holds lessons for the United States.
Here are the questions I sent (with some e-mail shorthand fixed), followed by the analysis:
1) Some Australians working on climate policy (visiting Baruch College through a fellowship program) told me the tax reforms integrated into the plan made the political difference, as summarized by the government this way: 

The government's public outreach has really stressed the economic win for many families under the plan. Does this hold up to scrutiny?
2) Another question that came up in chatting with the visiting fellows was whether Australia's carbon exports would in any way be affected/curtailed by this plan. It seems the answer is no? If that's correct how does this square with the stated goal of limiting risks attending unabated greenhouse-gas emissions?
3) Is the plan too skewed toward renewables as opposed to a broader suite of lower- or no-carbon alternatives (e.g., natural gas)?
4) A pattern in efforts to pass U.S. climate legislation was the shift from hard caps to all kinds of add-ons that, in essence, served as escape clauses or safety valves. Has that happened there? what are the biggest "out clauses" in the package?
Frank Jotzo, director of the Center for Climate Economics and Policy at The Australian National University Crawford School of Economics and Government (he's written on the implications for United States policy):
This could be a step in the direction of sensible long-term climate policy. The fact that the world's highest per capita emitter and largest coal exporter puts a price on carbon sends a signal internationally. It's also the chance for a more cost effective policy framework domestically, and that could have a demonstration effect internationally.
The scheme has some notable features that I think are all positives: price management, half of the revenue to households, independent institutions. It's not perfect by any means, but it has to be seen in context of the political constraints.
The price management aspect is of particular note, and perhaps a model for some future US regime: starting out with a fixed price (which is now well above the current EU price...) and a price collar for three years from 2015. The floor price could well kick in, on current market expectations given EU troubles. See papers here and here. Warwick [McKibbin] has of course been arguing for a price collar.
The public discussion in Australia about this right now is consumed with the question whether an Abbott government, if and when in power, would actually rescind the legislation. Tony Abbott has committed to do so, in fact he is now defining his leadership through that issue. But it would probably carry big political costs to do so - a special 'double dissolution' election; business by then will have gotten used to carbon pricing and won't want more policy uncertainty; would need to find money to continue paying for the income tax cuts.
About your specific questions.
1. Yes the income tax cuts for low and lower middle income earners are an important feature of the scheme, along with the higher tax threshold which means that ~1m people don't need to file tax returns. It'll also make it harder for a possible future Abbott government to roll back the scheme. I'm not sure though whether this has allayed fears about price rises, I think people will need to see that no catastrophes eventuate on the day the carbon price comes in.
2. Correct, there will be practically no impact on coal exports from the policy. Contribution to a global outcome is simply that Australia is trying to do domestically what may be its part toward global action, thereby encouraging others. The question of fossil fuel exports is much bigger than this policy.
3. Switch from coal to gas will be the key effect of the emissions price itself. The package gives some new money for renewables, but in annual budgetary terms that is probably not going to be that much "new" money. For fundamental transformation in the energy system, Australia will need some breakthroughs in technologies such as solar thermal, geothermal, and perhaps biosequestration or [carbon capture and storage]. I think the jury is out on whether government support towards these is sufficient, and there are always questions over policy design.
4. Australia's safety valve is access to international permits and offset credits. Prices are likely to be low, and rules for access can be changed in future years. There's also a price cap as part of the price collar, but on current expected prices that is very unlikely to apply, Australia would be buying EU permits well before the price cap comes in - which raises its own set of questions of course.
Roger N. Jones, professorial research fellow, Center for Strategic Economic Studies, Victoria University:
To add to some the things that Frank said, the current package is a product of the political situation to a large degree. Climate policy had an impact on changes to the leadership of both parties in 2010 but was not the only reason. It led to the Liberal Party reducing their commitment to climate policy through new leader Tony Abbott, and the then opposition leader Julia Gillard promising not to bring in a carbon tax during her term of government, because the word tax was being used as a political point of difference. The subsequent election led to a minority agreement with climate policy as a central part. The agreement forged to get the current legislation involved negotiations between three independents, the Greens (represented in 1 lower seat and the majority in Senate) and the Labor Party. A fixed price entry to that plan is being labelled as a tax. The broken promise is being used as a central focus for public outrage.
The independents (two at least) are in conservative country areas. They have decided that long-term climate policy is more important than their own electoral survival, so have not blinked in the negotiation process. The government likewise is committed to this legislation as part of their agreement to govern.
Which comes to the legislation. I agree with Frank's description of its level of efficacy. It has not been communicated that well. It is facing opposition at the editorial and opinion level of Australia's national broadsheet, most state-based tabloids, and "shock-jock" radio. The government does not have control of the public narrative - similar to the case in the US (also similar media ownership influencing the narrative). This opposition is hinging on the broken tax promise, but is actually far more complex.
For the general public, we have a similar issue to that in the US. You'd be aware of Lieserowitz's work where at the general level, a majority favor some form of legislation, but when it gets to the personal level (e.g., tax) that support is soft. It's generally agreed amongst academics that the benefits need to be communicated more personally, where people need to get a better idea of what they are paying for. Furthermore, utilities have risen in cost by 40% over the past three years, largely through added system security of power infrastructure implemented at very generous terms for the industry. Water has risen from a very cheap base in a transition to a user-pays system.
Australia's history of tax reform has left the country in pretty good shape, so it doesn't have such a bad taste in the community. Treasury has been on about strategic tax reform for a while, they also have been seriously modelling climate policy options since 2007 (I provided background on science and benefits of avoided damages). The combination of the changes to the income tax threshold in the compensation mechanisms is there. Many people who would be benefited are still under impression they will be out of pocket.
The government is hanging tough until the legislation is effected (2012) and are hoping that when the world doesn't end, acceptance of the package amongst the community will increase.
One thing that the public aren't widely aware of - even though emissions in China are anticipated to rise rapidly, their current plans lead to 1 gigaton [billion metric tons] of carbon less being emitted by about 2030 than under the previous high growth path. The myth of Australia acting on its own has high currency in the public debate, yet it isn't supported by the facts. Doing too little may expose Australia to ongoing changes elsewhere, yet this strategic repositioning to the rest of the world gains only marginal interest in the public and political debate.
Here are some points on the benefits of avoided damages, temperature effects and China's actions;and onselling the policy message.
, professor and co-director of the Climate Change Research Center, University of New South Wales:
Any expertise behind my comments comes more from having lived in both places and watched the debates, I am not a policy expert.
In my view the carbon plan was kept alive here by much stronger genuine interest among the electorate than in the US, certainly not by the political skills of the hapless Labor party or features of the legislation. I find Australians are better informed than Americans generally, and high-school graduates are widely believed to be at least a year ahead of their US counterparts. Australia is also more immediately vulnerable to climate changes, both natural and human-caused; every major city has introduced some kind of water rationing or restriction at some point in the last decade (in some cases temporarily) and agriculture has suffered. While there is a strong coal industry here, it is distant from most Australians, and a much higher percentage of them live in cities than in the US. The mining industry in Australia also hasn't been massive for all that long a time, and the real cultural hero here is the "Aussie battler" out on the farm or sheep station; they don't have the kind of industrial heroes that capture the imagination of the US. Many Australians are already a bit anxious about their country's economic reliance on mining becoming excessive.
While as you note the new emissions plan includes generous assistance and most of the money raised is returned to the people, most Australians either don't get this or don't trust it. It was not well sold. News of the assistance only came out long after the tax was announced and opposition to it had metastasized, and when finally revealed, did not raise the popularity by very much according to polls. Tony Abbot's effort to paint it as a crushing new tax increase has been successful and the government popularity now abysmal (though this is partly from other debacles unrelated to climate). The "green jobs" argument is frequently heard on the other side but is simply not as strong.
You might wonder why it went ahead in that case. Labor had to go through with it no matter how unpopular only because of the drubbing they received at the last election over their failure to follow through with their first plan they ballyhooed at the 2007 election that initially brought them in. I think Labor's strategy is to get this plan passed by hook or by crook and then let people see that the sky does not fall as the opposition has been saying, revealing the scaremongering of the latter by the time of the next election in two years. The opposition knows this too, which is why they pulled out all the stops to prevent this from passing and are now actively trying to sabotage it by telling businesses not to comply. I am sure that down the road they will try to find some way to claim credit for preventing the scheme from ruining the country.
On your question (3), even with this legislation mining will continue to boom, it just won't grow as fast as it would have. Many people realize this and it makes the plan easier to swallow than if it were going to lead to real mine closures and mass unemployment. Obviously this legislation is not strong enough to weak the nation off carbon emissions, it is just a first step in that direction. But that is largely true of other efforts around the world, so far. The plan was also not designed to reduce Australian exports of coal to Asia, only to reduce domestic emissions. Asia has to reduce Asian coal consumption, the supplier nation is never going to do that.
If I were trying to pass a carbon price, I would absolutely make it revenue-neutral and sell it from the get-go as a tax reform (replacing an existing tax with a more beneficial carbon-based tax of the same size). This nips in the bud the "big new tax" argument that would otherwise kill any carbon price plan in the US as it so nearly has even here. I would fund new energy development programs, if any, by separate legislation.

HEADLINE: Live Discussion of 'This Beautiful Life'

BYLINE: GINIA BELLAFANTE


HIGHLIGHT: Join us to discuss Helen Schulman's latest book, "This Beautiful Life,'' which imagines a worst-case scenario between two New York City teenagers who encounter each other at a party. 

 BODY:
Today, we are discussing Helen Schulman's latest book, "This Beautiful Life,'' which imagines a worst-case scenario between two New York City teenagers - one affluent, and the other unspeakably wealthy - who encounter each other at a party. Social media is a major player in the narrative but so, too, is the familiar territory of moneyed New York - a place where the culture of "helicopter parenting" both thrives and disappears, where the phenomenally rich often choose to leave their children to take care of themselves. The book offers a powerful sense of collision between these two worlds. It is a sociological effort that reads as though it were a thriller.
Recently, I sat down to talk with Ms. Schulman, a novelist and professor of creative writing at the New School, about her choice of subject. (Ms. Schulman later added to some of her answers via e-mail.) I'd like to hear your response to the themes of the books and to Ms. Schulman's points here. What do people fear most about bringing up teenagers in New York? How do the vast class disparities in New York affect our psyches? Is the world Ms. Schulman describes spot-on? Exaggerated? So, we begin: 
 Your novel is, to a great extent, about the mess and muck of privilege in New York City. Tell me how you came to choose this topic for you book.
 There was a moment of real grace in New York right after 9/11. I was extremely moved by the displays of generosity in the city. People did amazing things for one another. If you went to another part of the world, you were proud to be a New Yorker. We showed ourselves to be a city capable of an enormous compassion. So much of that was squandered during the Bush years. We became a culture in pursuit of greed and materialism. We lost sight, as a country, of our moral principles. While I see "This Beautiful Life" as a book about many things - the earthquake of the Internet; the end of forgetting; a sometimes disquieting embrace of older sex roles; the earlier and earlier sexualization of girls - it is also, I hope, a bit of a time capsule regarding the post 9/11, pre-recession years, in America and in New York (ground zero again) and the vibrato of what came after.
 The story revolves around two private-school teenagers -- Daisy and Jake -- who fall, rather haplessly into an Internet porn scandal. This could happen anywhere of course. What did you imagine was different about this sort of thing happening in Manhattan?
 I was interested in the way that the Internet has so dramatically eroded our privacy. This is happening everywhere obviously, all over the country, in towns large and small. But in the old days what happens to the two teenage characters in the book - a girl gifting a sexual image of herself to a boy - would have had more containable consequences. Girls' reputations have been ruined since the beginning of time, it seems, but families might have worked things out between themselves, or moved away, or two dads could have beaten each other up at the local bar. 
Certainly, a scandal like this could have resulted in some violence. But now with the click of a button and social media and all the rest, that image can go viral and have an audience around the world practically instantaneously. I wanted to explore this kind of scenario in New York, at the nexus of power and media and money and parents willing and able to pull out the big guns. What happens to Daisy and Jake is far bigger than either one of them, or their teenage missteps - the punishment being totally out of scale with the "crime." 
 The patriarch of the family in your novel is a bigwig administrator at a university that is explicitly modeled after Columbia. He is embarking on an initiative to develop Manhattanville. Columbia has been expanding throughout Harlem. What does this expansion say to you about the life of the city now and what did you see as novelistic (for lack of a better term) about it?
 I am very interested in urban planning - perhaps because my sister-in-law, Susan Handy, is a professor of environmental science and policy, and in discussion over the years she has alerted me to those issues. There was a tremendous amount of growth in Manhattan at the turn of this century, and much of it was filled with missed opportunities (the Trump buildings on the West Side are a perfect example; all those apartments filled with families and no new public school was part of the deal). 
I love the area of Manhattanville - we used to park our car up there - the winds sweeping off the river, the old warehouse buildings, the elevated subway line. I think it is very beautiful. It was smart of Columbia to target the area, a bridge between their two campuses and a chance to develop and enrich not only their own programs but the city at large. The trick for them, and shaded differently for my own fictive university, is in developing this area correctly - historically, not Columbia's strong suit, but far from an impossible endeavor. And yet there are so many obvious pitfalls in terms of the surrounding community, including issues of eminent domain. It seemed like a good project for Richard, the father in my book, to be part of, because of his good intentions and his hunger for success and interest in power. It provided him a very interesting academic and real-world exercise, all while walking a moral tightrope.
 Most of your novels have been set in New York and you are a native. What do you experience as the most significant change in the city from the time of your own adolescent years?
 I am 50 years old and I grew up on the East Side and live now on the West Side, so I am a lifer, and I guess New York as both subject and weather does play a big role in some of my books - the last two being books that I view in some ways as historical fiction - "A Day at the Beach" which takes place in the 24 hours following 9/11 and "This Beautiful Life," which at some point got so zeitgeisty I had to fix it in 2003 just to get a handle on my material, which was changing shape all the time. Recently while riding the subway I have had nostalgic blasts from my youth when I see how many homeless and mentally ill people have returned to the subterranean life and when I wait endlessly on the platform for a train. The '70s in New York City have been well documented, and we clearly did not have the goods and services then that we've had in the past two decades. 
Growing up, I was afraid to walk in Riverside Park, for example. Now it is so beautiful I try to walk there several days a week just to breathe some fresh air. In many ways the city is cleaner and is much safer than when I was young. But it has also become far more expensive - pushing out many of the citizens who make it great - and more heartless. While there are still vibrant pockets of middle-class life in the outer boroughs, Manhattan's middle-class bastions have shrunk. Every year for economic reasons my grad students have to move farther and farther away.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo Earnings Rise 21%, to $4.1 Billion

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Wells Fargo, the nation's largest consumer lender, said its third-quarter earnings rose 21 percent, even as a drop in revenue indicated a disappointing sign for the bank. 

 BODY:
Wells Fargo, the nation's largest consumer lender, reported Monday that its third-quarter earnings rose 21 percent, even as a drop in revenue indicated a disappointing sign for the San Francisco-based bank.
The bank turned a $4.1 billion profit in the third quarter, or 72 cents a share, bolstered by gains in its lending and deposit division and its lack of exposure to the volatile investment banking business. That compared with a profit of $3.3 billion, or 60 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The figures, also aided by an $800 million release in reserves amid easing loan losses, fell just below the analysts' consensus estimate of 73 cents a share.
The bottom line improvement was somewhat overshadowed by the lack of top-line growth. The bank's revenue fell to $19.6 billion, from $20.9 billion, reflecting the banking industry's broader struggles generating growth as the economic recovery stalls and the markets wildly fluctuate. Investors frowned on the report, sending the bank's shares down more than 3 percent to roughly $25.60.
"The economic recovery has been more sluggish and uneven than anyone anticipated," the bank's chairman and chief executive, John Stumpf, said in a statement. "We can't change the economic environment, yet we have worked hard to control the variables we can - making our products and services more relevant to individuals and businesses, focusing on the customer, making as many loans as possible and growing new relationships - as well as fostering longtime ones."
The strong profit numbers at Wells Fargo bucked the generally grim outlook facing the industry, as big banks struggle to shed the legacy of the mortgage crisis and cope with poor investment banking figures. JPMorgan Chase last week kicked off bank earnings season by reporting a 4 percent drop in profit. Bank of America, which will announce its earnings on Tuesday, has racked up billions of dollars in losses over the last few quarters. And some analysts expect Goldman Sachs, once appearing immune from the industry's woes, to report a quarterly loss, only the second since the company went public 12 years ago.
While competitors have struggled, Wells Fargo has remained relatively healthy. Profit has grown quarter after quarter. Following the takeover of the Wachovia Corporation at the height of the financial crisis, it established a network of retail branches along both coasts.
Still, Wells is not immune from the industry's turmoil. The bank reported disappointing revenue numbers across its operation. The community banking division, which includes Wells Fargo's branches and mortgage business, experienced a 7 percent drop in revenue, while revenue declined slightly in the bank's retail brokerage unit.
While it is no secret the banking industry is struggling, investment banking results have been especially hard hit. Trading revenue, in particular, is hurting from the unnerving volatility in the markets.
Wells Fargo does not break out its investment banking results, but the wholesale banking unit, which includes the sales and trading business along with the corporate lending division, had a 4 percent decline in revenue. The bank attributed the drop to weak fixed-income sales and trading.
But it could have been worse. Wells Fargo features a far smaller investment bank than most of its big rivals, so it is less exposed to the difficult market conditions that, for instance, caused JPMorgan's third-quarter investment banking profit to tumble 20 percent.
"Investment banking is a boom and bust business, and right now it's bust," said Brian Foran, a senior analyst at Nomura Securities International. He noted that it "helps" banks like Wells that are not deeply entrenched in the business.
Wells Fargo's biggest unit by far is its community-banking arm, which reported a 7 percent drop in revenue, as mortgage banking income slowed and the bank battled the choppy markets.
But earnings at the unit leapt 20 percent compared with the third quarter of 2010. Unlike competitors that had a heavy hand in the mortgage business during the toxic subprime boom, Wells Fargo enforced tougher standards for borrowers and only revved up its lending following the 2008 takeover of Wachovia. Wells Fargo has since quietly emerged from the mortgage mess as one of the nation's largest and strongest lenders.
On Monday, the bank reported that its overall loan portfolio jumped to $760 billion, up $8.2 billion from the prior quarter. The bank's deposits soared, too, up 8 percent from a year ago to nearly $837 billion. The bank also saw an improvement in credit quality, as nonperforming assets declined $7.6 billion from the prior year and net loan charge-offs dropped $1.5 billion. It also recorded the $800 million release in reserves, a nod to the improving loan portfolio. 
"There are winners and losers in the mortgage market right now," Mr. Foran said. "Wells has won this equation."

HEADLINE: MF Global Ordered to Increase Capital

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Regulators were worried that should the value of European debt backing MF Global's repurchase transactions collapse, the firm would need to post more money quickly to cover the trade. 

 BODY:
MF Global, the commodities and derivatives brokerage house headed by Jon S. Corzine, the former Goldman Sachs chief and former Democratic governor and senator from New Jersey, was forced to set aside additional capital in August after regulators grew concerned about the firm's exposure to European sovereign debt.
In a filing last month, MF Global told investors that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority was requiring it to "modify its capital treatment." Regulators worried that should the value of that debt backing MF Global's repurchase transactions collapse, the firm would need to post more money quickly to cover the trade. 
In its filings, MF Global said it had "increased its net capital." A spokeswoman for the firm said that as soon as it became clear that Finra would raise its capital requirements, MF Global reallocated capital to cover the transactions quickly. The move by Finra was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. 
The worry about a default or restructuring of the debt of these countries and the potential turmoil it could inflict on the global economy has led to wild market swings and sell-offs in recent months. And as the markets gyrate, a fear has been pervasive on Wall Street: Who is exposed to European debt and how much of it do they hold? French banks have been hammered for their holdings in the debt of Greece and other fragile European economies. 
According to company filings, MF Global holds the debt of Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal -- countries facing debt troubles. In a filing made early August, MF Global said it had about $6 billion in exposure to the countries' debt, a little more than 10 percent of its overall asset base. 
By allocating more money to the broker dealer division, where the trades backed by the European debt are housed, MF Global would be able to cover any losses incurred should the trade wind up a bad one. MF Global also said that the increase capital requirement would not harm its business. Additionally, the firm said that the sovereign debt it held was short term and would mature by the end of 2012, meaning that the increased capital requirement could decrease as the debt was paid off. 
As of last month, the firm held $167 million in net capital above what regulators require, according to filings with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
Under Mr. Corzine, MF Global has pushed to diversify its revenue streams beyond its traditional commodity and futures business by delving into investment banking and money management.

HEADLINE: Sandra Lee Opens Up on Life With Cuomo and Offers Career Advice

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: The de facto first lady of New York, appearing on a panel about women's economic empowerment, directed her attention not to "glass ceilings" but to the advantages of being a woman in the marketplace. 

 BODY:
In a rare appearance at a political event, New York's de facto first lady, Sandra Lee, on Monday offered a glimpse into the household she shares with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and gave young women some candid career advice.
Appearing on a panel about women's economic empowerment organized by Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand and held at New York University, Ms. Lee remarked that, just as women have more job opportunities today, men are expected to do more at home - including raising children, cooking dinner "and doing dishes - if you're in my house."
As the audience giggled at the image of a governor up to his elbows in soap suds, and another panelist asked, "Really?" Ms. Lee nodded in response. "And using the slow cooker," she said. "It's the new favorite thing, because it's only one" dish to wash.
Ms. Lee, an on-screen chef who has built a media empire around her concept of "semi-homemade" cooking - that is, preparing packaged foods with a twist that makes them feel homemade - has not played the part of a typical first lady, generally avoiding political events and preferring to keep her public persona separate and distinct from Mr. Cuomo's.
But there are signs that she is becoming more comfortable talking about her unusual status as a celebrity in her own right and also as the girlfriend of the governor. In an interview in the current issue of Harper's Bazaar, she discusses her relationships with Mr. Cuomo, and with his daughters, and deftly fields a question about whether he might run for president. ("I haven't even thought about anything like that," she said.)
On Monday's panel, Ms. Lee played the part of a big sister or highly successful aunt to the young women in the room, offering not her usual cooking tips but counsel about navigating the business world. Ms. Lee's perspective was in contrast to the other women on the panel - Senator Gillibrand; the personal finance expert Carmen Wong Ulrich; and the environmental advocate Majora Carter. Ms. Lee grew up poor and didn't graduate from college, but now runs a multimillion-dollar business; she seemed to have little interest in talk of "glass ceilings" or of women being disadvantaged.
This "needs to not be about being put down or at a disadvantage, because you're not," she told the audience. "The women are at an advantage - we represent the buying power in this country." 
Arguing that female entrepreneurs were in a better position to create products for women, she said: "We can market to her; we can support her; we can insulate her.''
Her advice was generally no-nonsense. After Ms. Gillibrand observed that only 7 percent of women negotiate for their first salary, compared with 57 percent of men, the moderator, the "Today" show host Savannah Guthrie, asked the members of the panel how each would advise women to be more assertive.
Ms. Ulrich, the finance expert, suggested that they should simply say, "I want more."
Ms. Lee seemed a bit skeptical of this approach.
"It's really important to be educated, to know what the market value is, and to ask for it," she said. But, she added: "I think that you can't be so aggressive and so assertive and so adamant about getting it. You're going to have to give somewhere, a little - men do, too."
She said that unlike many people in television, she negotiated all her own deals, and counseled women: "Don't underestimate the power of you picking up the phone yourself."
She predicted that now that women have so many opportunities they would quickly rise to the top of professions.
"But you have to want it," she said. "You have to have the eye of the tiger, and you have to do it every single day."
The only world in which she acknowledged encountering sexism was that of high cuisine.
Saying at one point that she had never felt there was a "glass ceiling," she paused and then added, with a grin, "Though if you've attended the Cordon Bleu, you would know that no woman is supposed to be a chef - only men." 
At the same conference on Monday, Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Obama, was interviewed by the WABC-TV news anchor Diana Williams.
Ms. Williams asked Ms. Jarrett what it was like to be a woman in the Obama White House - an issue that has gotten some attention lately, with the publication of Ron Suskind's book about the Obama administration, "Confidence Men." The book includes quotes from two former officials describing the atmosphere as hostile to women.
"Oh, it's terrific," Ms. Jarrett said, without missing a beat. 
She said that Mr. Obama, having watched his mother, grandmother, and even his wife struggle with gender barriers, "comes to this job with an acute awareness of how hard it is for women, and he values their perspective." And "he has been extraordinary, really," she added, "if you compare him to any other president, he has gone off the charts, in terms of having women at the highest levels both within the White House as well as within his cabinet."

HEADLINE: An Investor Creates a Tempest in a Coffee Cup

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The hedge fund manager David Einhorn's withering assessment of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sent the stock plunging on Monday. 

 BODY:
When shares of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters began trading on Monday morning, they held the distinction of being the best-performing stock on a major exchange over the last five years.
Better than Apple. Better than Google. Better than Starbucks.
 Then David Einhorn began speaking.
Mr. Einhorn, who became famous after making big and vocal bets against Lehman Brothers before that firm's collapse, took the podium at an investor conference in Manhattan and denounced Green Mountain as an overhyped and overvalued stock. He unveiled a 110-page slide presentation called "GAAP-uccino" - a wonky pun referencing generally accepted accounting principles - that detailed his negative view.
Within minutes, the company's shares began to sink. Green Mountain stock dropped more than 13 percent during Mr. Einhorn's hour-long talk before closing at $82.50, down 10.4 percent on the day.
A spokeswoman for Green Mountain declined to comment, citing the Vermont company's so-called quiet period before its earnings release later this month.
Since October 2006, Green Mountain's shares have increased more than thirtyfold. Put another way, $1,000 invested in Green Mountain five years ago is today worth about $30,000, according to data provided by Thomson Reuters. After Monday's swoon, its shares' five-year performance now ranks second, just slightly behind Questcor Pharmaceuticals.
Still, Green Mountain has a market value of $12.6 billion, making it worth more than large food conglomerates like Sara Lee and ConAgra. It has made Robert Stiller, the founder of Green Mountain, a billionaire and the richest man in Vermont. It has been one of the best-performing stocks for a number of large hedge funds, including JAT Capital and SAC Capital Advisors.
But it has also brought out the short-sellers. As Green Mountain shares have risen ever higher, a group of skeptical investors have bet against Green Mountain. Many of the short-sellers absorbed large losses as the stock continued to spike in value.
Mr. Einhorn, who runs the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, criticized Green Mountain for "poor transparency." He attacked the company's financials, accusing it of "shenanigans" in how it accounts for acquisitions. The company had previously disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into its accounting practices. Mr. Einhorn also decried what he called out-of-control capital spending that he said was growing much faster than the company's business.
The battleground over Green Mountain stock centers on the "K-Cup." In 2006, Green Mountain, a company perhaps best known for delivering a decent cup of coffee at the local gas station, acquired Keurig, a business that manufactured single-cup brewing systems. The Keurig machine brews individual cups in less than a minute from coffee packed into single-use, plastic K-Cup pods.
Last year, more than 85 percent of Green Mountain's $1.36 billion in revenue came from sales of single-use pods and their brewing systems.
The coffee giants Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks have recently joined Green Mountain's Keurig craze. Each has agreed to sell its own branded K-Cups manufactured by Green Mountain. Dunkin' Donuts has already begun selling its K-Cups in its stores; Starbucks is expected to start later this year.
Mr. Einhorn pooh-poohed the idea that K-Cups have revolutionized the way Americans drink coffee. He noted that drinking single-serve cups is "the expensive way to drink coffee at home."
"This is a luxury item that is priced outside the range of many households," he said.
What is more, Mr. Einhorn said, Green Mountain's patent on K-Cup technology will expire in about a year, which will open the business to competitors.
Several Wall Street analysts who follow the company disagreed with Mr. Einhorn, whose Greenlight fund is down about 5 percent this year.
"There is not a single argument that Einhorn presented today that couldn't have been made or wasn't made a year ago when the stock was at $30 per share," said Mitchell B. Pinheiro, an analyst with Janney Capital Markets, who has followed the company since 1997 and has a $125 price target on Green Mountain shares.
"This is a real trend and you can prefer to stick your head in the sand and ignore it, but Keurig growth remains strong and will continue."
Regardless of where the company's shares end up, Green Mountain's growth over the last decade has been a bright spot in a weak economy.
The company was founded in 1981 by Mr. Stiller, who made his first fortune a decade before by starting E-Z Wider, a maker of cigarette rolling papers. He tried a cup of coffee at a Vermont ski resort and liked it so much that he bought the roastery and began Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.
He based the company in Waterbury, Vt., the same town where Ben & Jerry's ice cream built its first corporate headquarters. Today, Green Mountain employs nearly 5,000 and pushes a corporate social responsibility platform. The company donates 5 percent of its pretax profits to social and environmental causes.
The stunning price appreciation of Green Mountain's stock has made Mr. Stiller a billionaire. He appeared this year for the first time on Forbes magazine's list of the richest Americans. At Monday's closing price, he and his family own shares worth $1.9 billion. Earlier this year, Mr. Stiller, now a Florida resident, bought a pied-a-terre in Manhattan, purchasing the Upper West Side apartment of Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, for $17.5 million.
Other longtime senior officers have also become very rich. Frances G. Rathke, the company's chief financial officer and former C.F.O. at Ben & Jerry's, cashed out about $32 million worth of Green Mountain shares for which she had paid $500,000.
Yet around Burlington, which suffered severe damage as a result of Hurricane Irene, there are few signs of conspicuous consumption. Old Subaru wagons crowd the Green Mountain company parking lot, many of them sporting tattered "Obama '08" and "Howard Dean" bumper stickers.
Chad Fry, the general manager of the Reservoir restaurant and taproom, a favorite haunt of Green Mountain employees, said that his customers did not seem to focus on the stock price.
"Let's put it this way," said Mr. Fry, pointing toward a television playing college football highlights. "No one's ever asked me to change the channel to CNBC."

 Herman Cain, still new to his status among the front-runners for the Republican presidential nomination, is having his candidacy tested for the first time. His lack of experience is beginning to show in the form of missteps or as he confronts more pointed questions about his tax plan, Susan Saulny writes.
        
 President Obama is bankrolling a vast grass-roots organization and information technology apparatus, spending more on payroll than several Republican candidates have even raised, Nicholas Confessore and Griff Palmer report. Although he has low approval ratings, he also has unmatched financial resources for the campaign trail, and a team with a well-honed sense of where and how to deploy money, people and technology.

HEADLINE: 10 Questions for William Daley

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Bill Daley, the White House chief of staff, sat down for an interview with John Harwood of The Times. What follows is a condensed, edited transcript of their conversation. 

 BODY:
William M. Daley, the former commerce secretary and JPMorgan executive, became White House chief of staff earlier this year with the hope of repairing relations with business and striking deals with Republicans. He's met with considerable frustration, though agreement with Congressional Republicans on new trade deals this week provided a rare note of economic cooperation. He sat down for an interview with John Harwood of The Times and CNBC. What follows is a condensed, edited transcript of their conversation. 
Read Mr. Harwood's column on Mr. Daley.
Q.
 This is a sour time in Washington, but you got the trade deals done. Tell the average struggling business owner, or person looking for a job, how's this going to affect their life? 
A.
Well, in addition to the three trade deals for Korea, Panama and Colombia we got trade adjustment assistance, which really is going to people who are negatively affected by trade deals. And there are negatives to them. But over all, you're creating jobs in the U.S. because of lowering barriers in foreign countries, especially in Korea. The other thing it does, John, is it sends the message to the rest of the world that in these economic times the U.S. will continue to be aggressive about doing trade deals. Our economy is very open to the world.
Q.
 There's this huge Occupy Wall Street movement that's in New York and elsewhere. For a lot of the people there trade deals like this, like NAFTA which you helped negotiate under President Clinton, are part of the reason why middle-income families are struggling -- even if they're good for big corporations and corporate executives. Why are they wrong? 
A.
You have a tremendous reservoir of smaller and medium-sized businesses that have done well by having chances to sell their products around the rest of the world. Some people would like the world to go back to the 1950s. I understand the frustration of a lot of people with this new world we're in, which is a difficult, competitive, global world. But that's created also opportunities for other people and parts of the world to rise from poverty. Sixty years ago the Korean national average [income] was $80 a year and they have a vibrant economy now. And that's good for them, it's good for American businesses. Over all I think it helps the world come together. 
Q.
 Before you joined the administration you made a comment in an interview that the Obama administration had miscalculated, gone too far left on health care. Did the administration go too far left on financial regulation, Dodd-Frank? 
A.
I don't think so at all. There are honest disagreements with many in the financial sector. It was a long process fought out on the Hill and it passed by narrow margins. So there was a very open public debate. Most of the laws that regulated the financial service sector were enacted at a period that was closer to the Civil War than to this period. And I think if you look at many parts of the financial sector, many of the leaders in the financial sector would admit right up front that the controls weren't there. 
Q.
You worked for JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon is your friend. He recently met with Mitt Romney, went to a Mitt Romney fund-raiser. What does that tell you? 
A.
He's interested in meeting Mitt Romney. Other than that, I don't know.
Q.
But what does that tell you about your level of Wall Street support? You had a lot in 2008. 
A.
 There are many people in the financial sector -- which isn't just in Wall Street -- who are appreciative of the fact that this administration has fought to save this economy and has fought to get a better and more aggressive structure of regulation. But the bottom line is, yes, there will be people who will talk to other candidates and maybe have a different opinion this cycle from the last time. The president's been out there fighting for the American people. 
Q.
Explain the disconnect: How is it that at the same time you think and the president thinks he's adopted a reasonable approach to reform, they think you're really coming at them on regulations, on taxing the wealthy?
A.
I think there's a super sensitivity of some people in the financial sector to criticism. And you know what? A lot of people in the financial sector have done quite well, I being one of them. And the influence that the financial sector has on our economy is way beyond what it ever had. And there's a bad side to that. 
Q.
Is it that they're living in some cocoon and just don't understand? 
A.
 There is a disconnect in some parts of the financial sector with what really is going on out there in America and the pain that's out there. Someone who's making $125,000 is in the top 5 percent of income-earners in America. So most of the assistants to the leaders of Wall Street or other major businesses probably are in the top 5 percent of the earners in America. They probably wouldn't consider themselves the wealthiest of Americans, but that's the change that's happened. And the effect of that is a lot of uncertainty for those who are not that fortunate.
Q.
Yesterday at a press conference one of my colleagues asked the president to respond to something Mitt Romney said. The president said, "I didn't realize you were a spokesman for Mitt Romney." Is the president feeling under siege? 
A.
I don't think it was a colleague from your network, but a colleague from another network. I know it may surprise people, there are certain people in the media who do seem at times to carry the water for certain piece of the political spectrum.
Q.
 You came here thinking that you were going to build bridges with business, make deals with Republicans. Is it now clear in this environment that that simply can't happen until after 2012 election on the big things -- tax reform, a grand bargain on deficit reduction? 
A.
The president tried mightily to get a long-term economic plan agreed to with the speaker and with the House leadership, and it didn't work. Most people who talk about either entitlement cuts or revenue -- when you have to put pen to paper it is much more difficult. But I'm eternally an optimist. 
Q.
There's a lot of speculation about when you're going to leave the job. What are your plans -- back to Chicago after the election? 
A.
 Yep, back home. When the president asked me to do this I said I'd love to do it for two years through the re-elect. That's always been my plan.

Kinder Morgan to Buy El Paso for $21.1 Billion | Kinder Morgan agreed on Sunday to buy the El Paso Corporation for about $21.1 billion in cash and stock, striking one of the biggest energy deals in history and tapping into a boom in natural gas drilling and production. 
Through the deal, Kinder Morgan will become the biggest of North America's midstream energy companies, which are entities that process oil and gas products before transporting them to production facilities. Kinder Morgan will own or operate about 67,000 miles of pipelines stretching across the continent.
The combined company, which will keep the Kinder Morgan name, is expected to move more than 1.9 million barrels of fuels a day. It will also operate the only oil sands pipeline that services the West Coast.

HEADLINE: Banks Start to Make More Loans

BYLINE: ERIC DASH and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Banks' lending numbers suggest that while the economy remains extremely fragile, the confidence of consumers and businesses may be more resilient than many experts had believed. 

 BODY:
Despite all the bleak economic news, a funny thing has been happening in the financial industry over the last few months: the banks have quietly turned on the lending spigot.
Loan growth is still modest. And it remains heavily weighted toward the strongest corporate and consumer borrowers. But after several quarters of having their loan balances plunge or flatten out, several of the nation's biggest banks are reporting increases.
On Monday, Citigroup officials said the bank recorded loan growth, compared with a year ago, in almost every one of its businesses during the third quarter, and in almost every corner of the globe. Wells Fargo executives said new loan commitments to small businesses were up 8 percent, while lending to bigger companies has been growing for 14 months in a row. Across the industry, analysts expect credit card loan balances will start increasing before the end of the year.
"The narrative that banks aren't lending is incorrect," Timothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo's chief financial officer, said in an interview. "Lending is strong, and based on what we're seeing," he added, it will "continue to grow."
Still, the stocks of both banks, and the sector as a whole, dropped on Monday as the sluggish economy and revenue figures pointed to broad drags on the banks, including low returns on making loans and exposure to the European debt crisis.
But the new lending numbers suggest that while the economy remains extremely fragile, the confidence of consumers and businesses may be more resilient than many experts had believed. "It hasn't really strengthened, but it looks like the recovery is still here," Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chairman and chief executive, said after heralding his bank's lending data last week.
There are myriad explanations behind the uptick in loan growth, including more customers taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates and borrowers in need of cash drawing on their credit lines. Others believe the downbeat headlines in recent weeks have been overblown. If the confidence clouds hanging over Europe and the United States were removed, the lending figures would be even stronger, analysts and bankers say.
Housing remains the banking industry's Achilles' heel. Mortgage and home equity loans have fallen more than 6.2 percent since their peak in late 2007 and early 2008, according to weekly data from the Federal Reserve. Most banks have ratcheted up the underwriting criteria so that fewer new borrowers qualify for a loan, especially in the housing markets along the coasts that were hit hard by the recession. As existing loans end, they are less likely to replace them with a new one.
But there has been a modest increase in lending elsewhere. Over all, corporate lending has rebounded 7.2 percent after bottoming out in October 2010. Consumer lending, with the exception of housing-related loans, turned positive during the second quarter and has been gradually increasing since then, the data show. All told, total loan balances are near where they stood in mid-2007.
"The banks want to lend," said Gerard Cassidy, a longtime banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. After all, he said, more than 70 percent of their income is tied to that activity. And the Federal Reserve survey of loan officers shows that banks have been gradually relaxing their underwriting requirements.
Others, however, say the banks are still clinging to their purse strings. For a broader recovery, they will need to make loans more available to more consumer borrowers with blemished credit histories and a broader array of small businesses, the critics say.
"I don't think the lending window is open near enough to what you need to see to get the economy growing, businesses expanding, and to bring the unemployment rate down," said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, a forecasting firm.
So far, the revival in lending has not been strong enough to significantly move the revenue needle for the nation's biggest banks, either. The poor performance of their Wall Street-related businesses and the elimination of once-lucrative overdraft and credit card penalty fees have weighed on their results. Meanwhile, the rise in new loan volume has not been enough to offset the lower profit margins on new loans as a result of the Fed's decision to keep interest rates close to zero until at least 2013.
On Monday, Citigroup reported that its core revenue fell 8 percent, even as it squeezed out a $3.8 billion profit with some favorable accounting. It booked a $1.9 billion paper gain since the cost of retiring its debt had, theoretically, declined because of concerns over its financial condition. It also delivered about $1.4 billion to its bottom line, using money it had previously set aside to cover credit card and other loan losses. Together, those moves accounted for more than 60 percent of its pretax earnings.
Wells Fargo also reported a 6 percent drop in revenue, as several major divisions, like its vast mortgage operations and its investment banking businesses, reported a decline from last year.
But the bank still managed a record $4.1 billion profit, thanks in part to a sharp reduction in charge-offs and the release of $800 million in loan loss reserves.
But buried in the numbers of both big banks were signs that loan growth was modestly improving. Citigroup pointed to healthy demand in emerging markets, which have only recently started to feel the impact of the global slowdown.
In Asia, for example, corporate loans grew 22 percent, while card lending increased by about 4 percent, excluding the impact of the exchange rate. Citi's Latin American operations showed similar resilience, while even the North American business showed a slight increase in lending, with the exception of mortgages.
Much of it is not "forced lending" as borrowers tap credit lines because they are in desperate need of money to pay their bills, Citi executives said. Small-business customers are "drawing them down because they have real needs and we are extending additional commitments," said John C. Gerspach, Citigroup's chief financial officer. "Absent the continued uncertainty, you would likely have loans growing and the economy growing at a faster rate."
Executives at Wells Fargo, whose giant lending operations are largely focused on consumer and corporate borrowers in the United States, said that "customer sentiment is good" even though some of the economic data worsened during the third quarter. "It's not just energy or commercial real estate; it's really across the board," said Mr. Sloan, the chief financial officer at Wells Fargo.
Some of the growth was due to foreign lenders ceding some ground to Wells and other large American banks, rather than an overall increase in demand. The uptick in Wells Fargo's commercial lending business was aided, in part, by a $1.1 billion commercial real estate portfolio it bought from the Bank of Ireland. Even its mortgage business, which reported more than a 50 percent jump in home loan applications, owed some of the lending growth to consumers refinancing existing loans - not people obtaining new ones.
On Thursday, Mr. Dimon was keen to highlight JPMorgan's lending numbers in an otherwise sobering quarter. Lending to small businesses with less than $50 million in revenue was up 70 percent through this year compared with the same period in 2010, while lending to middle-market customers was up 18 percent.
"These are pretty powerful numbers," Mr. Dimon said on a conference call with journalists. "We look at loan growth translating to jobs."

HEADLINE: Trump Joins Bachmann on Call With Supporters

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Donald Trump took questions from listeners in a conference call with Michele Bachmann that she said drew 200,000 people. 

 BODY:
He has had pizza in Times Square with Sarah Palin. He has dined at the swank Jean Georges restaurant on Central Park with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. And on Monday night, Donald Trump joined Representative Michele Bachmann on a telephone conference call, the latest evidence for his strange king-making role in the Republican nominating race. 
"He is not on the call because he's endorsing my candidacy,'' Mrs. Bachmann made clear to what she said were 200,000 listeners across the country. "He's on the call because he's admired.''
When Ralph from California asked Mr. Trump, the real estate mogul and reality-TV star, "Would you consider a Trump-Bachmann ticket or vice versa," he demurred. "I don't think that's why we're here tonight,'' he said, adding, "I've gotten to know Michele very well'' and she is "a far cry from what we have in the White House.''
Boasting of hundreds of real estate deals he has made, Mr. Trump said President Obama had made just "one deal,'' for his house in Chicago, which he suggested was "very shaky" and ought to be investigated. 
Earlier in the year, when Mr. Trump waged a high-profile tease over running for the Republican nomination, he raised the discredited issue of Mr. Obama's birth certificate so often that the White House finally released the long-form version of the document. An exasperated Mr. Obama said at the time he wanted to end the country's distraction from "sideshows and carnival barkers."
On the joint call, whose questions were screened by Mrs. Bachmann's campaign, most cued up her familiar talking points: on the need to repeal Mr. Obama's health care and banking reform laws; on America's loss of economic supremacy to China; on Mr. Obama's weakness in foreign affairs because he apologizes for America. 
Alice from New Hampshire asked why Republican leaders were not speaking out against "what appears to be Marxist groups down there on Wall Street,'' a reference to the growing but unfocused protests. Mr. Trump said he had witnessed a weekend march down Broadway, and "it was not a pleasant sight.'' 
Mrs. Bachmann had a more nuanced view. On the one hand, she said, "People are looking at this and trying to figure out, is this a George Soros-inspired protest?'' 
But she expressed sympathy with people angry that Wall Street bankers were bailed out during the financial crisis. 
After an hour of talk, Mr. Trump had to hang up, and Mrs. Bachmann said: "I want to thank Mr. Trump. He's offered an incredible voice to this selection process.''
She asked listeners to press *-0 to donate to her campaign. 
One question still hanging in the air, unanswered: Why do so many Republican presidential candidates ardently seek the imprimatur of Mr. Trump?

HEADLINE: G.E.'s Immelt: 'We Can Win'

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: At a conference, Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, did not despair over stagnant domestic growth and increased competition from China and other foreign producers. 

 BODY:
Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, is not despairing over stagnant domestic growth and increased competition from China and other foreign producers.
"We can win," Mr. Immelt said, repeatedly, during a Thomson Reuters Newsmaker event on Monday.
Mr. Immelt has a unique perch from which to view the nation's position in the global economy. He oversees a sprawling conglomerate with exposure to finance, manufacturing, aerospace and others. A longtime Republican, he also heads President Obama's jobs council. That has drawn him, at times, into bipartisan crossfire.
 "You go through days where you're being criticized by Dennis Kucinich and Fox News in the same day," he said.
A report recently submitted by the jobs council to the Obama administration outlining strategies for growth could result in "millions of jobs," Mr. Immelt said. He added that the council, which he has headed since January, was treating the effort to spur domestic growth and reduce unemployment "like a turnaround at a company."
Mr. Immelt, whose pay package last year totaled $15.2 million, said he sympathized with the Occupy Wall Street movement, which has taken aim at what it sees as excessive compensation at Wall Street banks and other large corporations.
"It is natural to assume people are going to be angry," in the economy's weakened state, Mr. Immelt said, citing the current unemployment figure of 9.1 percent. He added that rising executive compensation had been "part of the problem that is creating this mood," but said that he did not know if it would placate protesters to bring together the chief executives of America's largest corporations on an agreement to forgo some of their compensation.
"If unemployment is 12 percent, that will mean nothing," he said. "If unemployment goes down, it won't matter."
When talking about American's position in the global economy, Mr. Immelt's remarks took on the tone of a halftime pep talk. He said that with a clearer regulatory structure, an increased export base and an "all-in" business climate, the United States would be able to compete on a global front.
"I just got back from China, and I am completely convinced that we can compete and win," he said. G.E., he added, would "fight for our market share in every corner of the world."
Mr. Immelt defended claims that G.E. had avoided paying federal taxes in 2010, saying that the company had paid about $1 billion in taxes to various municipalities, and that its tax rate for 2011 would be more than 30 percent. 
He told the audience of reporters and business executives that although "the rest of the world plays harder than we do," he welcomed the challenge of strong foreign rivals. 
"This focus on competitiveness that globalization brings - that makes us better," he said.

HEADLINE: What Main Street Thinks About 'Occupy Wall Street'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''In Private, Wall St. Bankers Dismiss Protesters as Unsophisticated'' (Business Day, Oct. 15), the views of ''one longtime money manager'' are summarized as follows: 
''He added that he was disappointed that members of Congress from New York, especially Senator Charles E. Schumer and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, had not come out swinging for an industry that donates heavily to their campaigns. 'They need to understand who their constituency is,' he said.''
And that, ladies and gentlemen, tells you everything you need to know about why I, and so many other people on Main Street, strongly support the Occupy Wall Street movement.
We want our elected officials to belong to us, not to wealthy campaign donors. We want economic and regulatory policies to be determined by what's good for the country, not by those who can spend the most obscene quantities of cash to buy the politicians and the media.
GRANT PETTY Fitchburg, Wis., Oct. 15, 2011
To the Editor:
I disagree with a bank executive's assertion that ''it's not a middle-class uprising.'' Who's unsophisticated here?
I am an upper-middle-class health professional with a master's degree, and I fully support Occupy Wall Street. Currently I have to work more than 60 hours a week, but if I had greater availability I would certainly be pounding the pavement with the protesters.
I strongly feel that the majority of the American middle class supports the ideals and goals of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
DAVID ILSON Rockville Centre, N.Y., Oct. 15, 2011
To the Editor:
In lucidly explaining the plethora of reasons people are joining the Occupy Wall Street protests, Nicholas D. Kristof goes on to say there's a ''dollop of envy'' in those who are protesting (''America's 'Primal Scream,' '' column, Oct. 16).
Envy of the high compensation of others is not the reason behind the protests. Rather, it is outrage, weariness and frustration toward those with the financial and political means who persistently manipulate the system in their favor, at the expense of and on the backs of the majority.
The majority simply wants a fair, level, democratic playing field rather than an unjust plutocracy.

HEADLINE: Studies Clash On the Impact Of Shuttering Indian Point

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
In a case of dueling studies, research commissioned by opponents of nuclear power indicates that electricity in New York State would remain reliable and reasonably priced if the Indian Point nuclear reactors were permanently shut down. The findings directly contradict those of experts hired by the Bloomberg administration. 
The opponents, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Riverkeeper, released their report in advance of hearings that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will conduct beginning next spring on whether the licenses for the two reactors, Indian Point 2 and 3, in Westchester County, should be extended for 20 more years.
The groups, which favor retiring the reactors, contend that an accident there could be 10 times worse than what happened at the Fukushima reactors in Japan after an earthquake last March. But the Bloomberg administration argued that without Indian Point, air quality would suffer and so would power reliability.
New York State, which used to own Indian Point 3, is trying to shutter the plants.
''There is a belief out there that if Indian Point is shut down, the lights will go out,'' Ashok Gupta, the New York State energy director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said.
But a study his group helped commission, performed by Synapse Energy Economics, of Cambridge, Mass., said that to maintain reliability, the state would not need new capacity until 2020. The plants' initial 40-year licenses expire in 2013 and 2015, and a study commissioned by New York City and done by Charles River Associates of Boston, predicted that the area would face a capacity shortage that would increase the risk of blackout by 2016 if they are shut.
The two studies used differing assumptions about the extent to which new generators could be built or existing ones upgraded; how much efficiency improvements could reduce power demand; and how fast renewable energy sources, and especially the power lines that would bring those resources to the New York area, could be built.
The groups that oppose the plant say that if the reactors' retirements were firmly scheduled, developers would build transmission and generating stations in time to compensate for the loss.
Indian Point's opponents are planning to take advantage of the events at Fukushima to help make their case.
Because the Indian Point reactors are larger than the individual Fukushima units and because they are close to New York City, they could have an impact 10 to 100 times as large as the four meltdowns in Japan, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The group did not give a detailed explanation of how this would happen, but asserted that there is a strong likelihood of an earthquake stronger than what Indian Point was designed for.

HEADLINE: Bank Says East Europe Will Grow More Slowly

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- A major development bank sharply reduced its growth forecast for Eastern Europe on Tuesday and warned of risks to the region's banks, another example of how the sovereign debt crisis is radiating outside the euro zone.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which lends to businesses and governments in the former Soviet bloc and is underwritten by Europe and the United States, cut its growth estimate for Central Europe and the Baltics to 1.7 percent for 2012. 
In July, the bank predicted an expansion of 3.4 percent for the eight countries in the region, which stretches from Croatia to Estonia.
Southeastern Europe, which includes Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and four other countries, will grow 1.6 percent next year, the bank said, down from a forecast of 3.7 percent in July. Those countries are suffering from their ties to Greece, the euro zone country with the gravest debt and economic problems.
Even the revised predictions may be optimistic, because they are based on the assumption that Western Europe will slow to a standstill but avoid recession, and that policy makers will manage to contain the debt crisis. In recent weeks many economists have started predicting that Europe is headed for recession. Whether European leaders manage to tame the debt crisis is an open question.
''For next year there is an exceptional uncertainty about the course of developments in the euro zone, and the ramifications for Central Europe,'' the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development wrote in its report on prospects for the region, which was released Tuesday.
Eastern Europe has been hit harder by the financial crisis and recession that began in 2008 than any other part of the world, with output plunging more than 5 percent in many countries. The bank's report highlighted the region's continued vulnerability to its richer neighbors.
Countries like Hungary and Slovakia depend heavily on the euro zone for trade and capital. In addition, most banks are foreign-owned, and there is a risk that West European institutions could starve their eastern subsidiaries of credit.
In 2009, only an emergency accord among lenders, known as the Vienna Initiative, prevented wholesale capital flight and the collapse of local banks.
While the region is less susceptible to banking woes than during the previous crisis, the bank said, the number of bad loans is still high and many consumers and businesses continue to have loans denominated in euros or Swiss francs. Foreign currency loans can become ruinously expensive for borrowers when local currencies plunge in value, as happened in 2009.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development did not forecast that any of the countries in which it is active would fall into recession, but said that even star performers like Poland would experience markedly slower growth. The bank cut its growth forecast for Poland to 2.2 percent for 2012. In July, the bank had forecast a 3.5 percent expansion for Poland next year.
The development bank, which is underwritten by 61 countries, also predicted a sharp slowdown in Turkey, to 2.5 percent in 2012 from 7.5 percent growth this year. The Turkish economy is suffering from excess borrowing and has become overheated, the bank said.
Growth in Russia will accelerate slightly next year to 4.2 percent, from 4 percent in 2011, the bank said, because of strong commodity prices. But it cautioned that the outlook for Russia was vulnerable to volatile oil prices.
If euro zone leaders tame the sovereign debt crisis, the development bank said its predictions could prove overly pessimistic. But it also warned that a failure to control the crisis could have dire effects on Eastern Europe. ''The potential for worsening of the current situation in the euro zone beyond the baseline scenario poses significant risks even to the lowered outlook,'' the bank said.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Freshman's Fiscal Message Clashes With His Finances

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and STEVEN YACCINO; Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- There is Representative Joe Walsh, a freshman from Illinois, deriding his colleagues once again for their poor stewardship of the economy. During the debt ceiling debate, Mr. Walsh took to the airwaves to call President Obama a liar for suggesting that the nation might default. Just the other day, Mr. Walsh held court at a Tea Party rally, complaining that Republican leaders in Congress had ''been there too long'' to understand how best to deal with the nation's daunting fiscal issues.
Among the 87 Republican House freshmen, Mr. Walsh is perhaps the most visible when it comes to televised economic exposition, refracted through the lens of the Tea Party that helped him eke out a win last year in a suburban Chicago district. Although his district is among the least conservative of any won by a Republican, Mr. Walsh has among the most conservative voting records; he was one of 22 Republicans to vote against the debt-ceiling agreement last summer and among the 24 Republicans to reject a short-term spending agreement passed in September, arguing that its cuts were not deep enough. 
But Mr. Walsh's own finances are not quite in step with the tight-ship budgeting he calls for in Washington. According to a lawsuit filed by his ex-wife, he owes more than $100,000 in child support, an accusation he denies.
There have been other financial setbacks. Mr. Walsh lost a condominium to foreclosure before he ran for office. He has had a run-in with the Internal Revenue Service. He has no savings accounts, no investment accounts and has $3,000 in his only I.R.A., according to court documents filed by his lawyer last week.
He missed a filing deadline for his personal financial disclosures and his campaign was sent a cautionary letter by the Federal Election Commission for failing to include some campaign debts in its quarterly reports, later amended. His driver's license has been suspended twice, in 2008 for failing to show up for a court appearance, and this year, when he did not pay his auto insurance premium on time.
Mr. Walsh's decision to repeatedly bang the drum of strict fiscal responsibility appears to reflect his belief that the Tea Party support that swept him into office by roughly 300 votes will keep him there despite his own financial problems. ''What we need to do is elect fighters in every single level of government,'' he said in his Capitol Hill office, where, with no apartment in Washington, he sleeps on an air mattress when Congress is in session. ''When it comes to the issues that this Congress has been immersed in the past nine months, I have taken the leading role.''
But the history of unlikely wave candidates suggests that this theory could work against him. ''When the wave is large enough in elections, weaker candidates can get elected,'' said Nathan L. Gonzales, an editor at The Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan political newsletter. ''Part of the struggle for these freshmen is what lesson did they learn from their initial election. Do they think voters voted for them or against their opponent? They can struggle if they don't understand the initial dynamics of their win.''
Of the 73 Republican freshmen who came into office in the Republican sweep of 1994 -- the last one before 2010 -- 12 were swept out in the next election, including Representative Jim Bunn of Oregon, who divorced his wife while in office and married his chief of staff, which did not help his re-election effort.
A wave put many unlikely Democrats into House seats in 2008, and a whopping 23 of them were voted out in 2010, including Representative Alan Grayson of Florida, Mr. Walsh's corollary on the left chatterwise.
Mr. Walsh, a self-employed consultant whose income fluctuated in the years leading up to his election, shrugs off his financial history, calling it part of why voters related to him during last year's campaign. ''I talked openly about every aspect of my life,'' he said. ''The fact that I lost a home a few years ago, the fact that I struggled financially. I told people, 'If you want a building full of millionaires who all have perfect credit scores, then Joe Walsh is not your guy.' ''
Nor, he contends, do his financial troubles matter much to the job he was sent to do. ''I didn't go to Washington to manage anybody's money,'' he said. ''What I want to do is limit what they take from you, so you can manage your money.''
But Mr. Walsh's outspokenness -- especially when he criticizes other Republicans -- combined with his troubles -- have annoyed House Republican leaders, who use ''toxic'' and other unflattering terms to refer to him, as they try to maintain Republican seats in hard-fought districts.
His most high-profile issue is the one he discusses least. His former wife, Laura Walsh, is seeking what she says is more than $100,000 in unpaid support for their three children as well as his half their medical expenses and extracurricular activities, according to court documents and her lawyer, Jack Coladarci.
Papers filed last December by Ms. Walsh's legal team assert that Mr. Walsh paid only half of the $2,134 per month he owed her after their divorce in 2004 and only during 2005, 2006 and 2007. She says the congressman stopped paying entirely in March 2008.
''It is an issue I am going to fight quietly and legally and clear my name,'' Mr. Walsh said in the interview.
In a court filing last week, Mr. Walsh's lawyer called the lawsuit ''a misguided attempt to exploit Joe's new position'' in Congress. The filing included photocopies of checks Mr. Walsh says prove he made the full payments until three years ago, when he claims Ms. Walsh agreed to stop child support after his income dipped. Both sides agree that since he took office in January, he has paid child support for his son Patrick, the only child who still qualifies. Both sides are due in court in November.
Then, there are Mr. Walsh's political problems. Democrats in charge of the Illinois redistricting process have redrawn his district with boundaries overlapping that of Representative Randy Hultgren, a fellow Tea Party Republican. While the new map is being challenged in court, Mr. Walsh said that he was prepared to force Mr. Hultgren into a primary -- and that he would be the clear favorite because Mr. Hultgren voted too often with party leaders.
''As a freshman you pick your poison,'' Mr. Walsh said, ''and maybe leadership is going to help him raise money or open some doors for him and in exchange for that he's going to give them his vote.''
Mr. Hultgren, who has more than 15 years' experience in state and local government, brushes off the accusations. ''Using a leadership style that emulates Rod Blagojevich or Barack Obama, Joe likes to govern ineffectively though press releases, sound bites, political grandstanding, and name calling,'' said his campaign spokesman, Andrew Flach. ''He certainly does not lead by example.''
If the boundary challenge fails and the two freshmen lawmakers do face off, it will be in a district where much of the territory comes from Mr. Hultgren's current district.
Mr. Walsh appeared to be a popular figure at a recent Tea Party convention in Schaumburg, part of his current district. When he stepped to the dais to deliver his luncheon address, the first thing he did was remove his suit jacket. ''What's unique with Joe Walsh is this,'' he said, nearing the end of his speech. ''You did nothing fancier, you did nothing more complicated, you did nothing more sophisticated than elect one of your own.''

HEADLINE: Trying to Lift the Gloom Over Housing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''How to Stop the Drop in Home Values,'' by Martin S. Feldstein (Op-Ed, Oct. 13):
House prices are falling not primarily because homeowners are defaulting on their mortgages, as Mr. Feldstein writes, but because homeowners paid too much for their houses and banks lent too much money to buyers who couldn't repay. The housing debt problem lies between those buyers and lenders; they need to negotiate a solution.
It may be that the continued expectation of more bailout money is keeping buyers and lenders from seriously dealing with their issue. More bailout money only supports earlier bad decisions and unsustainable prices. 
In essence, why should the rest of us ''buy the bubble''?
KEN SENIOR Islesboro, Me., Oct. 14, 2011
To the Editor:
Martin S. Feldstein is correct that reinvigorating the housing market is crucial for the economy, but his solution is costly and unfair. Spending up to $350 billion to subsidize homeowners who owe more than their home's value unfairly treats taxpayers who avoided mortgages they could not afford.
A far less expensive strategy to boost demand for owner-occupied dwellings and help the neediest families is to create one to two million homeownership vouchers patterned after the rent voucher system.
Recipients would pay 30 percent of their income in return for a homeownership voucher. The voucher's value would be the carrying costs (mortgage, taxes and insurance) of homes at the 25th percentile of area home prices. In nearly all localities, current rent vouchers are worth more than these homeownership costs.
Most of the costs could be offset by phasing out the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, an inefficient subsidy to expand housing supply at a time when demand is the problem.
ROBERT I. LERMAN Washington, Oct. 14, 2011
The writer is an institute fellow at the Urban Institute and a professor of economics at American University.
To the Editor:
Martin S. Feldstein suggests that the decline in home values could be stopped if the federal government agreed to write down the principal that homeowners owe on their mortgage. Mr. Feldstein's suggestion is not without precedent in American history.
In 1933, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation solved a similar crisis by refinancing one million mortgages, about 20 percent of owner-occupied residences in the United States. The H.O.L.C. also took over the servicing responsibilities, enabling the agency to cut out the middleman and work with homeowners to stay in their homes during difficult economic times.
The H.O.L.C. and its refinancing policy stabilized home prices, encouraged homeowners to stay in their homes and earned the federal government a small profit.
MARK CASSELL Kent, Ohio, Oct. 13, 2011
The writer is an associate professor at Kent State University and co-author of the report ''Managing a $700 Billion Bailout: Lessons From the Home Owners' Loan Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation.''
To the Editor:
What part of ''moral hazard'' does the good professor not understand?
My wife and I did not buy a home at the top of the market during Boston's huge and irrational real estate boom. In fact, we have been renting for years.
If the goal is to help those ''underwater,'' then we have student loan debt that, given the current job market, we are underwater on. Can we get a check, too?

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Beats Forecasts and Raises Profit Estimate for Year

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. reported solid quarterly profits on Monday, showing that despite the shaky economy, corporations continued to spend on information technology. But the company's stock dropped as sales fell short of expectations.
The giant company provides a gauge of business investment trends because it is the largest supplier of computing technology -- hardware, software and services -- to corporations. I.B.M.'s performance echoes the reassuring results in recent weeks from a handful of corporate technology companies, like Oracle and Salesforce.com, whose quarters end in July or August instead of September.
Corporations, analysts note, are holding ample cash reserves and continue to spend on technology to cut costs and lift productivity, despite uncertain economic prospects in many countries. 
Still, the profit outlook for technology companies -- and most other companies -- is dimming somewhat as growth slows, especially in Europe and the United States.
I.B.M. reported net earnings of $3.84 billion, a 7 percent increase from the year-earlier quarter. Its earnings per share from continuing operations -- the number most closely watched on Wall Street -- rose 15 percent, to $3.28.
The average estimate of analysts was $3.22 a share, according to FactSet.
In a conference call with analysts, Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, singled out major sources of strength. First, he said, was the continuing rapid growth of markets abroad, including China, India, Brazil and a few dozen other emerging nations, which grew 19 percent and now account for 23 percent of I.B.M.'s revenue.
Mr. Loughridge also pointed to newer products and services like business analytics, which helps companies sift through data to spot sales opportunities and streamline operations.
''We're on track for a great year,'' Mr. Loughridge said.
Based on the third quarter and outlook, I.B.M. raised its estimate slightly for full-year profits to ''at least $13.35 a share,'' up from the previous guidance of ''at least $13.25 a share.''
But investors were apparently looking for more. In after-hours trading, the stock fell 4 percent. In regular trading, it dropped 2 percent, or $3.94, to $186.59, in a down day for the market.
I.B.M.'s sales, analysts noted, were a little less than estimates, and the company's earnings benefited from a lower tax rate than in the first half of the year. That contributed to the pullback in after-hours trading, they said, as did profit-taking; I.B.M.'s shares had run up 27 percent so far this year.
''It was still very solid,'' said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, ''but it didn't have the breathing room that I.B.M. quarters have typically had recently.''
Revenue for the quarter increased 8 percent, to $26.2 billion, slightly less than analysts' estimates. Excluding gains from currency translation, revenue rose 3 percent. With the dollar strengthening recently against the euro, currency-related gains will most likely decline in the current quarter, analysts say.
I.B.M. is more stable than most technology companies regardless of the economic conditions. Analysts point to its global reach, skilled management and the fact that so much of its business comes from steady revenue from software licenses and services contracts instead of sales of new hardware products.
I.B.M. said it had seen a slowdown in government business in developed nations amid a budget squeeze. The other notable weak market, Mr. Loughridge said, was Japan, which continues to struggle to recover after the tsunami and earthquake disaster earlier this year.
In the United States, I.B.M.'s business grew by 4 percent, and it grew 7 percent in Canada.
I.B.M.'s software business worldwide grew 13 percent in the quarter, to $5.8 billion, with the biggest growth coming from its Internet-based commerce software and its data management and analysis software.
The company's big services business grew 8 percent, to $15.2 billion. Hardware sales rose 4 percent, to $4.5 billion. Mainframe sales fell 5 percent from a year ago, though I.B.M. attributed that mainly to the comparison with the strong 2010 third quarter, when new mainframe lines were introduced.

HEADLINE: Chimp to Human To History Books: The Path of AIDS

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
Our story begins sometime close to 1921, somewhere between the Sanaga River in Cameroon and the Congo River in the former Belgian Congo. It involves chimps and monkeys, hunters and butchers, ''free women'' and prostitutes, syringes and plasma-sellers, evil colonial lawmakers and decent colonial doctors with the best of intentions. And a virus that, against all odds, appears to have made it from one ape in the central African jungle to one Haitian bureaucrat leaving Zaire for home and then to a few dozen men in California gay bars before it was even noticed -- about 60 years after its journey began.
Most books about AIDS begin in 1981, when gay American men began dying of a rare pneumonia. In ''The Origins of AIDS,'' published last week by Cambridge University Press, Dr. Jacques Pepin, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec, performs a remarkable feat.
Dr. Pepin sifts the blizzard of scientific papers written about AIDS, adds his own training in epidemiology, his own observations from treating patients in a bush hospital, his studies of the blood of elderly Africans, and years of digging in the archives of the European colonial powers, and works out the most likely path the virus took during the years it left almost no tracks. 
Working slowly forward from 1900, he explains how Belgian and French colonial policies led to an incredibly unlikely event: a fragile virus infecting a small minority of chimpanzees slipped into the blood of a handful of hunters, one of whom must have sent it down a chain of ''amplifiers'' -- disease eradication campaigns, red-light districts, a Haitian plasma center and gay sex tourism. Without those amplifiers, the virus would not be what it now is: a grim pilgrim atop a mountain of 62 million victims, living and dead.
In the early 1980s, Dr. Pepin was a young doctor fighting a sleeping sickness epidemic at a hospital in Nioki, in what was formerly the Belgian Congo, then Zaire, and is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. The virus was then unknown in Africa, but his work gave him clues that would later help him on its trail.
In retrospect, he says in his book, he may have inadvertently infected some of his patients. Ideally, the glass syringes used in Nioki were sterilized in the hospital's autoclave. But with the electricity often out, nurses boiled them instead. ''And I did not pay too much attention to how long they were boiled,'' he said in an interview.
Later, he worked in Guinea-Bissau on H.I.V.-2, which is related to H.I.V.-1 but causes a milder and harder-to-transmit form of AIDS that some victims live with for decades. Noting that cases were more common among older people, he concluded that it was dying out. If sexual transmission among young people was not keeping it alive, he reasoned, some other route must have first made it so widespread among the elderly. He suspected the aggressive campaigns that colonial doctors waged against syphilis, yaws, leprosy, tuberculosis and other ills until independence arrived in the 1960s. They all used injections, since pill versions of many antibiotics did not exist or were costly.
In 2005, Dr. Pepin began field studies. By sampling the blood of Africans 55 and over, he showed that those who had many injections in their youth or had undergone ritual circumcision, in which many boys were cut with the same blade, often had antibodies to hepatitis C or HTLV, a little-known virus that, like H.I.V.-1, comes from chimps and infects the CD4 cells of the immune system, but is harmless.
That was hard evidence that blood and syringes had spread other viruses.
Blood and tissue samples stored in freezers in Africa and in European hospitals that treat Africans -- a few going back to the 1950s -- form a map of AIDS viral subtypes, which is surprisingly complex. For example, white and black South Africans have different subtypes. ''Few homosexual Afrikaners have sex with heterosexual Zulus,'' Dr. Pepin notes. The whites' subtype is common among gay European and American men; the one most common among blacks moved south through Zambia.
Simian immunodeficiency virus, which infects monkeys and apes, is similarly mapped; it was first found in zoo animals, but now is tracked by jungle teams who extract DNA from feces.
The ancestor to AIDS is in one chimpanzee subspecies, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, which in nature lives only between the Sanaga and Congo Rivers. (Chimpanzees can't swim.) It is a blend of simian viruses from red-capped mangabeys and mustached guenons, small monkeys that chimps hunt and eat.
From colonial archives in Paris, Marseilles, Brussels, Lisbon and London, Dr. Pepin dug out old records of clinics where, as early as 1909, African prostitutes were required to have venereal disease inspections. He went through stacks of newspapers, like the Voix du Congolais, which wrote extensively about polygamy and prostitution, and pored over studies by European ethnographers.
(His own fluency in French was crucial, of course.)
In brief, his recounting of the epic journey is this:
In nature, only about 6 percent of troglodytes chimps are ever infected. Within a troop, each female mates with many males, but mating with outsiders is rare, so most troops are untouched while a few are heavily infected.
H.I.V.-1's four genetic groups, M, N, O and P, show that it made the chimp-human jump at least four times in history. But group M accounts for more than 99 percent of all cases.
Why did only one spread?
Molecular clock dating shows that M reached humans somewhere near 1921. Chimpanzees are too big and agile to be hunted with anything but guns, which until the 20th century were almost entirely in white hands.
Using colonial census data, surveys of how modern bush-meat hunters butcher kills, and infection rates among nurses stuck by dirty needles, Dr. Pepin calculates that, in the early 1920s, a maximum of 1,350 hunters might have had blood-to-blood contact with troglodytes chimps. Only 6 percent of the chimps -- about 80 -- would have been infected, and fewer than 4 percent of the scratched hunters probably could have caught it. That would suggest only three infected hunters at most.
Given how inefficient most sexual spread is -- in some cases, a husband and wife can have sex for months without passing H.I.V. -- sex alone would not have let three hunters, or even a dozen, pass on their virus to today's millions, he argues. There must have been an amplifier.
Studies among heroin addicts -- he cites examples from Italy, New York, Edinburgh and Bangkok -- show that blood transmission is 10 times as efficient.
In the 1920s, machine-made glass syringes replaced expensive hand-blown ones, and the Belgians and French attacked many diseases in their colonies, both out of paternalism and to create herd immunity to protect whites. Patients might get up to 300 shots in a lifetime. Other diseases have spread this way; an Egyptian campaign against schistosomiasis ended in 1980 after giving more than half its ''beneficiaries'' hepatitis C.
Thus, one hunter's group M infection could have become dozens. Then Dr. Pepin's focus shifts to the twin cities facing each other across the Congo: Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) on the Belgian side, Brazzaville on the French.
They are the epidemic's cradle; viral diversity is highest there, and the earliest positive blood sample, from 1959, was found there.
From 1900, both grew from tiny river outposts into cities, but only black men with colonial work permits were allowed to live in them legally. Naturally, women followed. But until 1960, brothels were rare. Most of the women were ''femmes libres'' -- escapees from rural polygamy who typically had only three or four clients for whom they also cooked and did laundry.
Colonial authorities tolerated and taxed this. At one point, the ''unmarried woman tax'' was 20 percent of the budget of Stanleyville.
Since femmes libres had few partners, viral spread was probably sluggish, although occasional hepatitis outbreaks were noted at clinics where prostitutes got penicillin shots for syphilis -- suggesting amplification by needle there, too.
In the 1960s, everything changed. World War II had swollen the twin cities, which supplied raw materials the Allies lost when Japan conquered Asian colonies. Then, when whites fled the chaos of independence, economies collapsed. Poverty was rampant.
Dozens of bar-brothels called ''flamingoes'' sprang up, competition forced desperate women to have sex with up to 1,000 clients a year, and venereal disease treatment dried up. There must have been a viral explosion like the one that happened 20 years later in a closely studied band of prostitutes in Nairobi: In 1981, 5 percent of them had the virus; three years later, 82 percent did.
The next link was Haiti. Because white Belgians never trained an African elite, only about 30 Congolese outside the priesthood had university degrees at independence.
To fill the gap, the United Nations hired bureaucrats and teachers from abroad. About 4,500 Haitians answered the call; they were black, well educated, French-speaking and eager to earn more than they could at home.
Now Dr. Pepin's calculations get slightly more speculative.
Group M of H.I.V.-1 is, in turn, broken into subgroups A through K.
Haiti's epidemic, like that of North America and Western Europe, is nearly all subgroup B. But subgroup B is so rare in central Africa that it causes less than 1 percent of cases.
That suggests AIDS crossed the Atlantic in just one Haitian. Molecular clock dating indicates it reached Haiti roughly in 1966.
Once again, Dr. Pepin argues that rapid expansion through sex alone is mathematically impossible and that there must have been an amplifier. He believes the culprit was a Port-au-Prince plasma center called Hemo-Caribbean that operated only from 1971 to 1972 and was known to have low hygiene standards.
Plasma centers take blood, spin it and return the red cells. If new tubing isn't used for each patient, infections spread. Sloppy plasma operations caused later H.I.V. outbreaks in Mexico, Spain and India and, most famously, in rural China, where 250,000 sellers were infected.
Hemo-Caribbean's co-owner was Luckner Cambronne, leader of the feared Tontons Macoutes secret police. Nicknamed the ''Vampire of the Caribbean,'' Mr. Cambronne, who died in 2006, bled 6,000 sellers who were paid as little as $3 a day and exported 1,600 gallons of plasma to the United States each month, according to an article in The New York Times.
Haiti was also a prime destination for gay American sex tourists; the Spartacus travel guides described how much young men expected to be paid. By the early 1980s, subgroup B was killing both American homosexuals and hemophiliacs, suggesting it arrived via both routes. The modern history of AIDS had begun.
Along the way, Dr. Pepin debunks other origin myths.
The most grotesque was what he called the ''surgical Viagra'' fad of the 1920s. About 2,000 American and European men -- mostly rich, old and impotent -- had chimpanzees' testicles implanted in their scrota. The fad died after the word of tissue rejection spread, and after a few women had chimp ovary implants, which scandalized editorial writers who suggested they would give birth to ape-human hybrids.
A better-known myth stems from a 1999 book called ''The River,'' which argued that the virus was in an experimental polio vaccine said to have been grown in chimpanzee cells.
Last year, when his publisher sent Dr. Pepin's draft manuscript to Dr. Max Essex, chairman of the AIDS Initiative at the Harvard School of Public Health, Dr. Essex was ''biased against the idea,'' he said in an interview, because he was still upset at what he considered the ''distorted nonsense'' of the polio hypothesis.
''But I was unexpectedly surprised,'' Dr. Essex said. ''This is very scientifically hard, objective scholarship.''
Dr. Allan Ronald, a University of Manitoba AIDS expert who began the Nairobi prostitute study, also read an early version and called Dr. Pepin ''one of the unsung heroes of AIDS research.''
While others had speculated that syringes amplified the virus, he said, ''Jacques did the studies among elderly people that were needed.''
Dr. Pepin also found tantalizing evidence of what might have been early AIDS outbreaks.
Dr. Leon Pales, a French military doctor, investigated soaring death rates among men building the Congo-Ocean Railway in the 1930s. In 26 autopsies, he found a wasting condition he called ''Mayombe cachexia,'' after the stretch of jungle where the men died; the men had atrophied brains, swollen bowel lymph nodes and other telltale AIDS symptoms.
And, in one of his own studies of elderly Africans, Dr. Pepin was told that many of those injected against sleeping sickness in the 1940s had died in the 1950s. Since many of the survivors were infected with HTLV, another chimp virus, he surmised that their long-dead friends might have been among the first victims of AIDS.

HEADLINE: In an Earlier Time of Boom and Bust, Rentals Also Gained Favor

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
During the boom years in Manhattan real estate, credit was easy, speculators developed building after building to meet rising demand for apartments, and values kept climbing, fed by a flurry of resales. But then Wall Street plummeted and the housing market followed suit, as values deflated and apartment sales came to a standstill.
''Many people had expected cooperatives to be affected by the recent slump in Wall Street, as indicated by the number of calls from bargain hunters looking for so-called distress sales,'' an industry analyst at the time said. ''We found that less than half a dozen apartments were offered for resale as a result of the market break.'' 
The analyst could have been describing the panicked freeze that settled over Manhattan after the credit crisis and the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008, but he was not.
The year was 1929, just months after the crash. What followed was a rarity in New York real estate: a decade in which the residential property market, measured in purchase price per square foot, declined, according to an analysis of the last 100 years of Manhattan values by Jonathan Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Mr. Miller looked at a representative sampling of available sales and rental data from news and market reports for Prudential Douglas Elliman, which is celebrating its centennial this year.
''People think that Wall Street is a new phenomenon and that 100 years ago it was all manufacturing, but financial services played such an important role in the economy, and especially in real estate,'' Mr. Miller said, adding that analysts in the 1930s predicted that the market would recover quickly, just as many did when the most recent real estate bubble popped.
''You have this long run-up and then catastrophe strikes and everybody says, 'Oh, it will just be a short period of time and then it will be business as usual,' '' he said. ''But it was a decade after the crash before you start to see a pickup of activity.''
According to Mr. Miller's analysis, sales prices dropped during the 1930s to $15 per square foot, down from $46 during the boom of the 1920s and $25 in the 1910s, adjusted for inflation. Toward the end of the decade, foreclosures slowed and mortgages became more available, with banks beginning to offer 90 percent financing. Although property values have increased significantly over the years since then -- reaching a high of $1,531 per square foot in the last decade -- they dipped sharply again at the beginning of this one, declining to $1,070.
Dorothy Herman, president and chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said she was struck by the parallels between the boom-and-bust cycle then and now, and the role of credit.
''In that era of the Roaring '20s, Wall Street was going great, there was easy credit and there was an emergence of creative financing instruments, to say the least, and all of those factors together created that boom,'' she said. ''We would never have had our boom if we hadn't had easy credit.''
It would take nearly two decades for purchase prices to recover to their pre-Depression levels. But much like now, with banks hesitant to lend and some buildings forced to lease what they could not sell, rentals became more appealing, even to those with the means to buy. Famous tenants of that time included John D. Rockefeller Jr., who rented a 15-room apartment at 740 Park Avenue in 1936, and Walter Chrysler Jr., who took a furnished penthouse at 720 Park in 1934.
For those of more modest means, there were buildings like 230 Riverside Drive, which began offering one- to four-and-a-half room suites for rent in September 1931, according to a brochure from the era. ''With ''a magnificent view up, down and across the Hudson,'' proximity to buses, an express subway station at 96th Street and trolleys on Broadway and ''more than ample'' closet space, the building, like many in that era, was marketed as offering both access to the city's center and an escape from it.
At 25 East 83rd Street, one of the first apartment buildings in New York to have central air-conditioning -- still mentioned as an enticement in a recent listing on Streeteasy.com -- the appeal was an apartment building with the most up-to-date amenities. The brochure explains, in a section titled ''What Air-Conditioning Means to You,'' that families would have fewer colds and that housekeepers could claim victory in ''the everlasting battle against New York's dirt and grime,'' adding, ''The curtains you hang in October will be spandy clean in May.'' At root, though, air-conditioning would provide a bulwark against the vicissitudes of city life: ''If New York gets on your nerves, it means that the peace and quiet of this ultra modern apartment house will help you to relax.''
It was not just grime and noise from which apartments were meant to protect their residents; it was also the wrong kinds of people. At the Mount Vernon, an apartment complex in Queens with inset gardens, the marketing materials from that time mentioned the proximity to shopping areas, churches, schools and transit, but also that it was in ''restricted Jackson Heights,'' a neighborhood that barred blacks and Jews. Amid the details that occupants could expect to find, like Venetian blinds and a waterproof scenic wall covering above the bathroom tile, was the promise that ''great care is taken in the choice of tenants so as to maintain the splendid character of the Mount Vernon.''
And then there were the most exclusive properties of all, like 1020 Fifth Avenue, whose penthouse was still in the hands of the family of its original buyer when it went on the market for $46.5 million the day before Lehman collapsed. It sold this summer for $26.75 million. A sales brochure that appears to be from the 1930s lists that apartment as the most costly, at $150,000; a New York Times article from 1925 reported its sale at that price to Samuel H. Kress.
But there was still something for the budget-minded: a duplex apartment with its own entrance on 83rd Street was priced at $40,000 because of its relatively small salon and second-floor space. ''Here again, however,'' the brochure read, ''the cost as compared to equivalent space and location in a private house is amazingly low.''

HEADLINE: An Investor Creates a Tempest in a Coffee Cup

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
When shares of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters began trading on Monday morning, they held the distinction of being the best-performing stock on a major exchange over the last five years.
Better than Apple. Better than Google. Better than Starbucks.
Then David Einhorn began speaking.
Mr. Einhorn, who became famous after making big and vocal bets against Lehman Brothers before that firm's collapse, took the podium at an investor conference in Manhattan and denounced Green Mountain as an overhyped and overvalued stock. He unveiled a 110-page slide presentation called ''GAAP-uccino'' -- a wonky pun referencing generally accepted accounting principles -- that detailed his negative view.
Within minutes, the company's shares began to sink. Green Mountain stock dropped more than 13 percent during Mr. Einhorn's talk before closing at $82.50, down 10.4 percent on the day.
A spokeswoman for Green Mountain declined to comment, citing the Vermont company's so-called quiet period before its earnings release later this month. 
Since October 2006, Green Mountain's shares have increased more than thirtyfold. Put another way, $1,000 invested in Green Mountain five years ago is today worth about $30,000, according to data provided by Thomson Reuters. After Monday's swoon, its shares' five-year performance now ranks second, just slightly behind Questcor Pharmaceuticals.
Still, Green Mountain has a market value of $12.6 billion, making it worth more than large food conglomerates like Sara Lee and ConAgra. It has made Robert Stiller, the founder of Green Mountain, a billionaire and the richest man in Vermont. It has been one of the best-performing stocks for a number of large hedge funds, including JAT Capital and SAC Capital Advisors.
But it has also brought out the short-sellers. As Green Mountain shares have risen ever higher, a group of skeptical investors have bet against Green Mountain. Many of the short-sellers absorbed large losses as the stock continued to spike in value.
Mr. Einhorn, who runs the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, criticized Green Mountain for ''poor transparency.'' He attacked the company's financials, accusing it of ''shenanigans'' in how it accounts for acquisitions. The company had previously disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into its accounting practices. Mr. Einhorn also decried what he called out-of-control capital spending that he said was growing much faster than the company's business.
The battleground over Green Mountain stock centers on the ''K-Cup.'' In 2006, Green Mountain, a company perhaps best known for delivering a decent cup of coffee at the local gas station, acquired Keurig, a business that manufactured single-cup brewing systems. The Keurig machine brews individual cups in less than a minute from coffee packed into single-use, plastic K-Cup pods.
Last year, more than 85 percent of Green Mountain's $1.36 billion in revenue came from sales of single-use pods and their brewing systems.
The coffee giants Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks have recently joined Green Mountain's Keurig craze. Each has agreed to sell its own branded K-Cups manufactured by Green Mountain. Dunkin' Donuts has already begun selling its K-Cups in its stores; Starbucks is expected to start later this year.
Mr. Einhorn pooh-poohed the idea that K-Cups have revolutionized the way Americans drink coffee. He noted that drinking single-serve cups is ''the expensive way to drink coffee at home.''
''This is a luxury item that is priced outside the range of many households,'' he said.
What is more, Mr. Einhorn said, Green Mountain's patent on K-Cup technology will expire in about a year, which will open the business to competitors.
Several Wall Street analysts who follow the company disagreed with Mr. Einhorn, whose Greenlight fund is down about 5 percent this year.
''There is not a single argument that Einhorn presented today that couldn't have been made or wasn't made a year ago when the stock was at $30 per share,'' said Mitchell B. Pinheiro, an analyst with Janney Capital Markets, who has followed the company since 1997 and has a $125 price target on Green Mountain shares.
''This is a real trend and you can prefer to stick your head in the sand and ignore it, but Keurig growth remains strong and will continue.''
Regardless of where the company's shares end up, Green Mountain's growth over the last decade has been a bright spot in a weak economy.
The company was founded in 1981 by Mr. Stiller, who made his first fortune a decade before by starting E-Z Wider, a maker of cigarette rolling papers. He tried a cup of coffee at a Vermont ski resort and liked it so much that he bought the roastery and began Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.
He based the company in Waterbury, Vt. Today, Green Mountain employs nearly 5,000 and pushes a corporate social responsibility platform. The company donates 5 percent of its pretax profits to social and environmental causes.
The stunning price appreciation of Green Mountain's stock has made Mr. Stiller a billionaire. He appeared this year for the first time on Forbes magazine's list of the richest Americans. At Monday's closing price, he and his family own shares worth $1.9 billion. Earlier this year, Mr. Stiller, now a Florida resident, bought a pied-a-terre in Manhattan, purchasing the Upper West Side apartment of Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, for $17.5 million.
Other longtime senior officers have also become very rich. Frances G. Rathke, the company's chief financial officer and former C.F.O. at Ben & Jerry's, cashed out about $32 million worth of Green Mountain shares for which she had paid $500,000.
Yet around Waterbury, which suffered severe damage as a result of Hurricane Irene, there are few signs of conspicuous consumption. Old Subaru wagons crowd the Green Mountain company parking lot, many of them sporting tattered ''Obama '08'' and ''Howard Dean'' bumper stickers.
Chad Fry, the general manager of the Reservoir restaurant and taproom, a favorite haunt of Green Mountain employees, said that his customers did not seem to focus on the stock price.
''Let's put it this way,'' said Mr. Fry, pointing toward a television playing college football highlights. ''No one's asked me to change the channel to CNBC.''

HEADLINE: A Salute to the Spenders

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Airlines have been making changes in their frequent flier programs, increasingly giving their best rewards not just to passengers who fly the most but who also pay the highest fares.
United Airlines, for instance, has downgraded benefits offered to the lowest tier of its elite frequent fliers. Last March, Southwest made an even more fundamental change in its loyalty program, moving from a system that awarded participants credits for flights, regardless of distance flown or fare paid, to one that gives participants points based on the types of fares they purchase. So someone who paid $349 for a Business Select fare on a flight from Chicago to Denver would earn 4,188 points, while a traveler buying a $195 Wanna Get Away fare on the same flight would earn just 1,170 points.
JetBlue and Virgin America, too, reward passengers who spend more. 
Loyalty programs today are ''all about the airlines' bottom line,'' said Henry Harteveldt, co-founder of the Atmosphere Research Group, a market research company. ''Business travelers have to understand that the benefits of the past three decades probably will not be part of the game going forward. Airlines want to make sure the financial benefits they offer elite travelers are commensurate with the revenues and profitability that traveler generates.''
Last month, United Airlines revealed details of its new loyalty program, which goes into effect next year when its system is merged with that of Continental Airlines. The new program will offer four tiers to what it calls ''premier,'' or elite, participants -- 1K (for travelers with 100,000 qualifying miles), platinum (75,000 miles), gold (50,000 miles) and silver (25,000 miles) -- rather than the three elite tiers the two airlines' programs had before. But the silver elite travelers will lose some of their perks.
Silver participants, for instance, will no longer be able to reserve seats with extra legroom, in Economy Plus, when they book their flights. Instead, they will be able to reserve those seats only when they check in 24 hours before departure. United officials said they expected the silver elite fliers would still generally be able to get this upgrade. But the other levels of elite participants will get access to the seats first, because they can still reserve them when they book.
In addition, free baggage checks for the silver participants have been made more restrictive. No longer will they be able to check two free bags, each weighing up to 50 pounds. Under the new system, they can check only one free bag weighing up to 50 pounds. The three higher levels of elite frequent fliers will be able to check three free bags weighing up to 70 pounds each.
Of course, these levels of ''premier'' fliers leave out the most elite travelers -- both United and Continental have invitation-only programs for their very top fliers. That program will continue.
Southwest does not reveal how many participants it has in its Rapid Rewards program, which will absorb AirTran's program sometime in the future. (AirTran became a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest in May.) United says it has 58 million members in its MileagePlus program, while Continental says it has 41 million members of its OnePass program. Randy Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer, a magazine on travel loyalty programs, estimated that there was a 15 percent overlap in the two programs' memberships.
Mr. Harteveldt said that when American Airlines introduced its AAdvantage frequent-flier program -- the industry's first -- in 1981, 26 airlines that flew jets operated in the United States. That number has now shrunk to four network carriers -- American, Delta, United and USAirways -- which, he said, controlled 56 percent of domestic capacity; four large, low-cost airlines -- Frontier, JetBlue, Virgin America and Southwest -- which together control another 24 percent; and a handful of niche airlines and regional carriers.
In a report Mr. Harteveldt wrote last month for Forrester Research, when he was still its travel analyst, he said that the business model employed by the airline industry when frequent-flier programs were in their infancy used ''a then-relevant approach: The longer the flight, the more expensive the fare.'' He added, ''But just like with hairstyles, what worked in 1981 isn't necessarily relevant in 2011.''
Among the biggest changes in the industry since 1981, he wrote, are consolidation and globalization of airlines and the carriers' decision to increasingly put ''their marketing focus on price ahead of the customer relationship.''
One other factor in the programs' evolution, he said, is the growing influence of the issuers of carriers' co-branded credit cards. The issuers pay carriers for miles awarded to cardholders, making them an increasingly significant source of airlines' income.
Tim Winship, publisher of Frequentflier.com, a Web site devoted to travel loyalty programs, predicted that in the short term, ''what you're going to see from other airlines with mileage-based programs is more tweaking like United's,'' adding, ''None for now will be willing to go as far as Southwest went with its wholesale changes.''
Mr. Petersen predicted the next big change in airline programs would come if and when the United States government liberalized its regulation of overseas investment in American carriers, which puts a 25 percent cap on foreign ownership of voting stock. A merger of a carrier based in the United States with a foreign airline -- American with British Airways, for instance -- could give the combined company a ''perfect setup'' to replace a mileage-based program with a revenue-based program, he said.
Mr. Harteveldt said that United, with its new program, was the first airline to require its frequent fliers to take four flight segments, or legs, on its own planes or Continental's to qualify for elite status.
Mr. Harteveldt said he also expected that airlines would impose a modest annual fee on passengers who want their frequent-flier miles to count toward elite-level participation. And he said that passengers seeking to earn elite status might be required to meet mileage levels and certain spending thresholds, based on ticket purchases and use of co-branded credit cards. An airline, for instance, might require a traveler to spend $1,500 on the airline operating the program and to fly 25,000 miles annually on it.
''The risk an airline has to factor in,'' he said, ''is if they change their programs too dramatically, travelers might defect to low-cost carriers' programs or switch their membership to the airline's alliance partner.''

HEADLINE: Shares Retreat on Concerns About Europe

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Eric Dash, Ben Protess, Stephen Castle and Liz Alderman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Despite strong gains in the previous week, stocks on Wall Street retreated on Monday, following European markets lower as the outlook for a broad solution to the European debt crisis appeared to wane.
It was a quiet start after Friday's upswing, which pushed the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq indexes above their levels from the start of the year. The broader market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, rallied nearly 6 percent last week.
By the end of Monday, though, the three indexes foundered with declines of about 2 percent. The Dow and the Nasdaq were once again down for the year, and the S.& P. pressed deeper into negative territory for the year. Analysts noted that some of the drivers of market sentiment in recent weeks -- including economic data and the prospect for some form of decisive action in Europe -- were uninspiring. Stocks that traded in the sectors most vulnerable to economic stress took hits, with industrials, materials and financials more than 2 percent lower near the end of the trading session on Monday. 
But they also attributed the declines on Monday to technical reasons, as important levels in the indexes proved resistant to breakthrough.
''The market was heavily oversold,'' said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial. ''Whenever that happens you are due for a bounce. It moved up too far, too fast.''
Ms. Krosby added that last week's gains were not accompanied by strong volumes, which suggested that the rally was not solid enough to extend the gains.
''It means that new buyers are not coming in,'' she said. ''The conviction is not there. Volume is always the conviction of the bulls.''
The gains from last week, which were in part helped by improved retail data in the United States, happened just ahead of a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20. Analysts had said that they believed fear about Europe's debt crisis had faded somewhat in the last few days.
But on Monday, Germany sought to play down expectations of a decisive breakthrough at another meeting of European leaders scheduled for this weekend.
At a news conference, Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, said that ''these are important working steps on a long path. This is a path that with certainty runs far into next year and also additional working steps will have to follow.''
Ms. Krosby said: ''Part of the reason the market was able to move up was on the hopes and prayers that the Europeans would craft a credible plan in time for the meeting. They just threw cold water on that.''
The comments helped push up bond prices in the United States. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 27/32, to 99 24/32. The yield fell to 2.16 percent, from 2.25 percent late Friday.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 2.13 percent at 11,397.00. The S.& P. 500-stock index was 1.9 percent lower, or down 23.72 points, at 1,200.86. The Nasdaq composite index was down 1.98 percent, to 2,614.92.
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 closed down 1.68 percent.
''Optimism is fading,'' said Frank M. Pavilonis, MF Global's senior market strategist, referring to Europe.
Economic data from the United States on regional manufacturing and another report on industrial production were weak, or ''market neutral,'' said Jonathan E. Lewis at Samson Capital Advisors.
''We are really operating in a twilight zone for markets,'' Mr. Lewis said, referring to what he described as a lack of clarity from the economic data and the euro zone situation.
In the United States, economic data has been mixed.
On Monday, a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on regional manufacturing showed no improvement in its index for overall business conditions in October. In a research note, economists from Goldman Sachs said the report suggested ''generally downbeat'' views of the current economic situation, but noted that some components of the index had stabilized.
Industrial production as reported by the Federal Reserve showed a month-on-month 0.2 percent rise for September, just as analysts had forecast. Manufacturing production firmed 0.4 percent in that period, which economists said reflected some recovery from the disruptions related to the Middle East turmoil and the earthquake in Japan earlier in the year.
''With a mixed performance in September, the U.S. manufacturing sector now seems to have fully recovered from the supply chain shocks caused by the Japanese tsunami,'' Cliff Waldman, economist for the Manufacturers Alliance, said in a statement.
Analysts said that as financial results trickled in, stocks would continue to weather the outlook for the United States economy. Financial stocks were hardest hit, falling about 3.3 percent as a sector, on a day when more banks weighed in with quarterly results.
Wells Fargo, the largest consumer lender in the United States, was down 8.4 percent at $24.42. It reported Monday that its third-quarter earnings rose 21 percent, even as a drop in revenue indicated a disappointing sign for the bank.
Citigroup announced a profit of $3.8 billion, or $1.23 a share, beating analyst consensus estimates of 81 cents a share. It fell 1.7 percent, to $27.93.
Shares in companies in the materials sector declined 3 percent, with Alcoa down 6.6 percent, to $9.58, and U.S. Steel more than 6 percent at $22.98.

HEADLINE: Energy Deals On Upswing As Bargains Abound

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
Global energy giants are capitalizing on the country's economic woes.
With commodity prices falling, big domestic and international players are tapping their vast cash reserves to buy oil and gas companies, whose stocks have been decimated by the downturn.
On Monday, Statoil of Norway agreed to buy Brigham Exploration Company for $4.4 billion to gain control of potentially lucrative oil fields across North Dakota and Montana. At $36.50 a share, the price tag is nearly 4 percent below Brigham's high in April. 
''Companies spent the first half of the year pocketing a lot of cash from high prices,'' said Justin Jacobs, an oil and gas analyst at the research firm Business Monitor International. ''Now, they're taking advantage of the downturn to hunt for bargains.''
The industry stalwarts are targeting North America. Amid a glut in production, natural gas prices have dropped by almost 50 percent since 2009. With energy prices depressed, independent players are struggling to find financing for their projects, prompting larger competitors with deep pockets to make a move.
So far this year, oil and gas companies have announced $149 billion worth of acquisitions on the continent, roughly 64 percent of the worldwide total of $235 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. In one of the largest deals, Kinder Morgan on Sunday agreed to buy El Paso Corporation for $21.1 billion.
At the current rate, the industry is on track to surpass last year's global volume of $311 billion in acquisitions, Thomson Reuters said.
''The amount of capital needed in the oil and gas industry always means there are opportunities for deals,'' says Jim Dillavou, head of Deloitte & Touche's energy transaction services practice.
Investors are betting the consolidation will continue.
Shares of Range Resources, a shale gas company that the research firm Morningstar considers a takeover target, have risen by nearly 20 percent since Thursday; Whiting Petroleum, with oil assets in Montana and the Dakotas, is up more than 9 percent in same period; and SandRidge Energy's stock has gained nearly the same amount.
Small energy companies are particularly vulnerable to takeovers. While such players control highly attractive assets, many businesses are still struggling to turn a profit.
Last week, Sinopec of China agreed to buy Daylight Energy, a Canadian oil and natural gas producer, for about $2.1 billion in cash. Daylight, which lost $45.1 million last year, owns more than 320,000 acres in the resource-rich region of western Canada.
Despite the weakness, companies are betting on a boom in energy production. Natural gas production - mostly from unconventional sources like shale - is expected to increase by 25 percent over the next two decades, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Such prospects have spurred deals for infrastructure assets.
Through its purchase of El Paso, Kinder Morgan will own 67,000 miles of pipelines, moving more than 1.9 million barrels of fuels a day. If successful in its $5.9 billion bid for Southern Union, Energy Transfer Equities will oversee 44,000 miles of pipelines, with about 30.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas capacity.
With their dominant share of the market, Morgan Kinder and Equity Transfer are well placed to potentially charge high fees for use of their pipelines.
''The companies are positioning themselves to reap long-term benefits,'' said Claudia Mahn, North American energy analyst at research group IHS Global Insight. ''There are huge opportunities for growth when the economy starts to recover.''

HEADLINE: Sandra Lee Shares Tips, But Subject Is Not Food

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
In a rare appearance at an event that was not about food, New York's de facto first lady, Sandra Lee, on Monday offered a glimpse into the household she shares with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and gave young women some blunt career advice.
Appearing on a panel about women's economic empowerment organized by Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand and held at New York University, Ms. Lee remarked that, just as women have more job opportunities today, men are expected to do more at home - including raising children, cooking dinner ''and doing dishes - if you're in my house.'' 
As the audience giggled at the image of a governor up to his elbows in soap suds, and another panelist asked, ''Really?'' Ms. Lee nodded in response. ''And using the slow cooker,'' she said. ''It's the new favorite thing, because it's only one'' dish to wash.
Ms. Lee, an on-screen chef who has built a media empire around her concept of ''semi-homemade'' cooking - that is, preparing packaged foods with a twist that makes them feel homemade - has not played the part of a typical first lady, generally avoiding political events and preferring to keep her public persona separate and distinct from Mr. Cuomo's.
But there are signs that she is becoming more comfortable talking about her unusual status as a celebrity in her own right and also as the girlfriend of the governor. In an interview in the current issue of Harper's Bazaar, she discusses her relationships with Mr. Cuomo and his daughters, and deftly fields a question about whether he might run for president. (''I haven't even thought about anything like that,'' she said.)
On Monday's panel, Ms. Lee played the part of a big sister or highly successful aunt to the young women in the room, offering not her usual cooking tips but rather counsel about navigating the business world. Ms. Lee's perspective was in contrast to the other women on the panel - Senator Gillibrand; the personal finance expert Carmen Wong Ulrich; and the environmental advocate Majora Carter. Ms. Lee grew up poor and did not graduate from college, but now runs a multimillion-dollar business; she seemed to have little interest in talk of ''glass ceilings'' or of women being disadvantaged.
This ''needs to not be about being put down or at a disadvantage, because you're not,'' she told the audience. ''The women are at an advantage - we represent the buying power in this country.''
Arguing that female entrepreneurs were in a better position to create products for women, she said: ''We can market to her; we can support her; we can insulate her.''
Her advice was generally no-nonsense. After Ms. Gillibrand observed that only 7 percent of women negotiate for their first salary, compared with 57 percent of men, the moderator, the ''Today'' television host Savannah Guthrie, asked the panelists how each would advise women to be more assertive.
Ms. Ulrich, the finance expert, suggested that they should simply say, ''I want more.'' Ms. Lee seemed a bit skeptical of this approach.
''It's really important to be educated, to know what the market value is, and to ask for it,'' she said. But, she added: ''I think that you can't be so aggressive and so assertive and so adamant about getting it. You're going to have to give somewhere, a little - men do, too.''
She said that unlike many people in television, she negotiated all her own deals, and she counseled women: ''Don't underestimate the power of you picking up the phone yourself.'' Ms. Lee predicted that now that women had so many opportunities they would quickly rise to the top of professions.
''But you have to want it,'' she said. ''You have to have the eye of the tiger, and you have to do it every single day.''
The only world in which she acknowledged encountering sexism was that of high cuisine. Saying at one point that she had never felt there was a ''glass ceiling,'' she paused and then added, with a grin, ''Though if you've attended the Cordon Bleu, you would know that no woman is supposed to be a chef - only men.''
At the same conference on Monday, Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Obama, was interviewed by Diana Williams, the WABC-TV news anchor.
Ms. Williams asked Ms. Jarrett what it was like to be a woman in the Obama White House - an issue that has gotten some attention lately, with the publication of Ron Suskind's book about the Obama administration, ''Confidence Men.'' The book includes quotations from two former officials describing the atmosphere as hostile to women.
''Oh, it's terrific,'' Ms. Jarrett said, without missing a beat.
She said Mr. Obama, having watched his mother, grandmother and even his wife struggle with gender barriers, ''comes to this job with an acute awareness of how hard it is for women, and he values their perspective.'' And ''he has been extraordinary, really,'' she added, ''if you compare him to any other president, he has gone off the charts, in terms of having women at the highest levels both within the White House as well as within his cabinet.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Putin Defends Decision to Seek a Return to the Presidency

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin confronted criticism over his decision to seek a return to the presidency next year, warning in a television interview shown on Monday of a return to the volatility of previous decades should Russia swerve from its current course.
''They say that things cannot get any worse,'' Mr. Putin said, referring to his critics. ''But I would be wary. It is enough to take two or three incorrect steps and all that came before could overcome us before we know it.'' 
He continued: ''We lived through the collapse of the country. We lived through a very difficult period in the 1990s. Only in the 2000s did we begin to get to our feet. We are stabilizing the situation, and of course we need stable development ahead.''
The session, which was shown on Russia's three major government-connected television channels, followed a similar interview last month by Dmitri A. Medvedev, Russia's current president, in which he tried to allay frustrations, particularly in liberal circles, over his decision announced in September to cede the presidency to Mr. Putin.
Supporters credit Mr. Putin, who has been in power for 12 years, with pulling Russia from the chaos that enveloped the country after the Soviet collapse. But there are fears that his return to the presidency, possibly for another 12 years, could mire the country in stagnation, or worse, lead to further limitations on political and human rights.
In the interview, Mr. Putin acknowledged such sentiments, but dismissed his critics, saying they offered no alternatives.
''Our opponents need to propose their own program,'' he said. ''And more importantly, they need to show through practical work what they can do better.''
Since coming to power, Mr. Putin has eliminated most legitimate opposition, leaving Russia with a smattering of parties loyal to the Kremlin and little in the way of civil society. Few doubt that he will win elections next year, though he took issue with critics who said Russians would have no choice in the matter.
In explaining his decision to seek the presidency again, Mr. Putin admitted that he had not wanted the position when it was offered to him by his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, in 1999, but would ''take it to a logical conclusion.'' He likened himself to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected to four terms.
''He ruled the country during the most difficult years of economic depression and the Second World War,'' he said. ''He was elected four times because he was effective. The number of terms or years was not important.''
Asked about foreign policy, and the so-called reset in relations with the United States and Western Europe, Mr. Putin said that Russia would continue to protect its national interests but was ''not interested in confrontation.''
During Mr. Putin's first term as president, relations with the West dropped to their lowest point since the cold war. Relations improved under Mr. Medvedev, but some experts predict that Mr. Putin will have to continue along the current course, given Russia's need to keep open Western markets for its energy resources amid deepening economic problems.
But when one interviewer asked what he thought of a perception in the West that he is a foreign policy hawk, he said, ''A hawk is a very nice bird.''

HEADLINE: Looking Toward 2012, Obama Finds North Carolina Less Receptive

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
BOONE, N.C. -- Loading up on Halloween candy at a store in this friendly college town on Monday, President Obama could probably imagine winning North Carolina in 2012, as he did in 2008, when he became the first Democrat since Jimmy Carter to do so.
But hours earlier and a hundred miles away, Mr. Obama got a less warm and fuzzy reception from a lunch crowd at Countryside Barbeque in Marion. Only a few diners rose to shake his hand, while others were vocal in their complaints. 
A lawyer, Dan Kuehnert, urged Mr. Obama to roll back regulations on business, which the president said he was willing to do -- up to a point. Bob Ritter, a pastor at a Baptist church, told Mr. Obama he was praying for him. But he later groused about bank bailouts, saying they amounted to ''picking winners and losers.''
The divergent receptions attest to the steep challenge Mr. Obama will face in holding on to North Carolina, where he kicked off a three-day bus tour ostensibly focused on promoting his jobs bill but equally intended to shore up a crucial segment of his electoral map.
''Look, I appreciate the 'four more years,' '' Mr. Obama said to a friendly crowd early in the day at Asheville's regional airport after it burst into a familiar chant about a second term. ''But right now, I'm thinking about the next 13 months.''
Mr. Obama landed on the aging airstrip here and traded Air Force One for his black armored bus to begin his second trip to the state in a little more than a month. His itinerary also includes Virginia, another state where he won in 2008 but where his approval ratings have sagged.
Using the runway behind him as a symbol of America's dilapidated public infrastructure, Mr. Obama assailed the Senate for voting last week to block his $447 billion bill, which he said would have supplied money to repair and widen that runway.
''They said no to putting teachers and construction workers back on the job,'' Mr. Obama said to a spirited crowd of several hundred gathered on the tarmac under a giant American flag. ''They said no to rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our airports.''
''Essentially,'' he declared, ''they said no to you.''
Now, Mr. Obama said, his administration was breaking the jobs bill into individual measures on spending and tax cuts -- ''bite-sized pieces,'' as he called them -- saying that maybe the Republicans ''couldn't understand the whole thing at once.''
Congress will be asked to vote on each of those measures, and each vote will be a test, Mr. Obama said, of whether Republicans are willing to take the necessary action to help revive the job market.
''If they vote against taking steps that we know will put Americans back to work right now,'' Mr. Obama said, ''then they're not going to have to answer to me, they're going to have to answer to you.''
On Monday evening, Mr. Obama spoke to a boisterous crowd at West Wilkes High School in Millers Creek, where he pushed for new spending to help avoid teacher layoffs.
The West Wilkes school district has lost 121 teaching and administrative jobs in the last four years because of budget cuts. Under the jobs bill, it could receive $6.9 million in federal money
The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said he expected the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, to schedule a vote on $35 billion in aid to states and local jurisdictions as the first component of the jobs bill to come up for a vote.
For Mr. Obama, this road trip amplifies the more partisan style he has adopted since hitting an impasse with Republicans on budget issues over the summer.
In 2008, the president carried North Carolina and Virginia, both longtime Republican strongholds, by capitalizing on demographic changes. The Obama campaign's aggressive field operation also turned out large numbers of younger and black voters.
The challenge Mr. Obama faces now is that both states have high unemployment and disenchanted voters. A recent poll by Elon University gives the president an approval rating of 42 percent in North Carolina, while in Virginia, a Quinnipiac University poll from last month put his approval rating at 45 percent.
In North Carolina, Mr. Obama faces an uphill struggle. He carried the state by three-tenths of a percentage point in 2008, surprising Republican analysts who did not view it as vulnerable.
Mr. Obama conceded that parts of North Carolina were still politically unfriendly. He told students that a local reporter had asked why he bothered to travel to the staunchly Republican Millers Creek. ''It's the American Jobs Act,'' he replied, to wild cheers.
There were moments of levity on Monday that illustrated why Mr. Obama likes these bus trips. In Boone, he said the first lady would forgive him, as he shoveled maple-nut clusters, macaroons and York peppermint patties into a bucket.
But as his intimidating bus, dubbed Ground Force One, snaked through the Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina's ambivalence could be summed up in a cardboard sign held by a woman along the road: ''We Believed, We Voted. Now What.''

HEADLINE: Dinner and Derangement

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
During thousands of elaborate restaurant meals over dozens of piggy years, I've received many exacting, even loopy, instructions.
I've been prodded to dab a special scent on my wrist before savoring my salad. To proceed through the five microscopic canapes before me from left to right, as if they were words in a sentence that would lose all meaning if scrambled. To exhale a particular way as I chewed an avant-garde popcorn cluster so that the smoke inside it billowed from my nostrils.
Romera New York is the first restaurant where I was told to ''make a memory'' of my water. 
Romera is Manhattan's newest culinary oddity, an elegant hideaway whose conceits include the pairing of each dish in an 11-course meal with a lukewarm flavored water in a lidded grappa glass. One water might be infused with leek and radish, another with jasmine and dried seaweed. Most taste like indecisive teas, commitment-phobic broths or pond runoff.
''Feel free to smell them,'' said a server, as if I might otherwise feel jailed. ''And to taste them.'' He paused. ''Make a memory of them.''
While blazers are optional at Romera, straitjackets would be a fine idea.
It's the craziest example I've encountered of the way our culture's food madness tips into food psychosis, at least among those with keen appetites and the means to indulge them.
But it's hardly the only illustration. Surf the cable channels and clock the time before you spy a spatula, a strainer, someone chewing, someone oohing or Gordon Ramsay. I bet it's less than 11 seconds.
Diners at the latest hot bistro or trattoria snap loving pictures of everything they eat, seeming to forget that it's dinner, not ''America's Next Top Chicken Breast.'' In New York, even the meatballs have paparazzi.
Steaks come with discourses on breed, feed and dry versus wet aging; coffee with soliloquies about growing regions, grinding methods and the optimal pour-over technique; beer with overwrought tasting notes.
We've tumbled far, far down the organic rabbit hole. And with Romera, which opened a month ago in Chelsea, we may have finally hit bottom.
It's not just that this restaurant, which serves a single tasting menu for $245 a person before drinks or tip, seems wildly out of sync with the economic times. Many restaurants do, and some of them are necessary and praiseworthy.
Romera demands notice mostly because it's such a florid demonstration of just how much culinary vanity we've encouraged and pretension we've unleashed.
Its chef, Miguel Sanchez Romera, is a doctor who worked for years as a neurologist. He has coined a whole new genre for his cooking, which favors squishy textures, kaleidoscopic mosaics of vegetable powders, and a wedding's worth of edible flowers.
He calls it neurogastronomy, which ''embodies a holistic approach to food by means of a thoughtful study of the organoleptic properties of each ingredient,'' or so says the restaurant's Web site. Organoleptic means ''perceived by a sense organ.'' I looked it up.
My server explained that each dish's palette and aroma, as well as its flavor, were supposed to prompt a ''sense memory.'' He said that the tuna tartare with coconut, jasmine and orange blossom had brought him ''straight back to Cape Cod when I was 8 years old and I tasted my first virgin pina colada.''
All of that from the tiny, six-bite portion? I must be a sense-memory slacker. I was brought back only to other, more voluminous tuna tartares, which I suddenly and sorely missed.
That tuna dish is called Cloris, after a Greek goddess of flowers. A subsequent dish of 12 kinds of grains encircling a black olive jam is called Omnium, a Latin term for the whole of something.
Euterpes is the name for the foie gras with white chocolate, referring to a muse of lyric poetry. Before you compliment me on my classical chops, I should confess that this education came from the gorgeous matte flashcards, one per dish, that guide a diner through the Romera phantasmagoria.
The cards, with a butterfly illustration on one side and text on the other, delve verbosely into etymology, ecology, horticulture, philosophy. ''The objective of any pre-appetizer,'' says one, is to ''prepare the guest for the degustation that will follow.'' Another: ''By looking at nature with eyes of solidarity we will see that it is always expressing something to us.''
I looked at my companion, Tom, with eyes of solidarity, expressing my support for his attempts to wave down the woman with the breadbasket. The bread didn't have a flashcard. It was just bread.
Purple basil, marjoram, geranium leaves and such grew in tidy clusters around the restaurant's dining room, which was ringed by white mesh cloth. I felt like a cheese. An herbed, flowered, pampered, bamboozled cheese.
What kind of water goes best with that? Tap. Cold, if possible.

HEADLINE: Banks Start To Make More Loans

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Despite all the bleak economic news, a funny thing has been happening in the financial industry over the last few months: the banks have quietly turned on the lending spigot.
Loan growth is still modest. And it remains heavily weighted toward the strongest corporate and consumer borrowers. But after several quarters of having their loan balances plunge or flatten out, several of the nation's biggest banks are reporting increases.
On Monday, Citigroup officials said the bank recorded loan growth, compared with a year ago, in almost every one of its businesses during the third quarter, and in almost every corner of the globe. Wells Fargo executives said new loan commitments to small businesses were up 8 percent, while lending to bigger companies has been growing for 14 months in a row. Across the industry, analysts expect credit card loan balances will start increasing before the end of the year.
''The narrative that banks aren't lending is incorrect,'' Timothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo's chief financial officer, said in an interview. ''Lending is strong, and based on what we're seeing,'' he added, it will ''continue to grow.'' 
Still, the stocks of both banks, and the sector as a whole, dropped on Monday as the sluggish economy and revenue figures pointed to broad drags on the banks, including low returns on making loans and exposure to the European debt crisis.
But the new lending numbers suggest that while the economy remains extremely fragile, the confidence of consumers and businesses may be more resilient than many experts had believed. ''It hasn't really strengthened, but it looks like the recovery is still here,'' Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chairman and chief executive, said after heralding his bank's lending data last week.
There are myriad explanations behind the uptick in loan growth, including more customers taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates and borrowers in need of cash drawing on their credit lines. Others believe the downbeat headlines in recent weeks have been overblown. If the confidence clouds hanging over Europe and the United States were removed, the lending figures would be even stronger, analysts and bankers say.
Housing remains the banking industry's Achilles' heel. Mortgage and home equity loans have fallen more than 6.2 percent since their peak in late 2007 and early 2008, according to weekly data from the Federal Reserve. Most banks have ratcheted up the underwriting criteria so that fewer new borrowers qualify for a loan, especially in the housing markets along the coasts that were hit hard by the recession. As existing loans end, they are less likely to replace them with a new one.
But there has been a modest increase in lending elsewhere. Over all, corporate lending has rebounded 7.2 percent after bottoming out in October 2010. Consumer lending, with the exception of housing-related loans, turned positive during the second quarter and has been gradually increasing since then, the data show. All told, total loan balances are near where they stood in mid-2007.
''The banks want to lend,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a longtime banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. After all, he said, more than 70 percent of their income is tied to that activity. And the Federal Reserve survey of loan officers shows that banks have been gradually relaxing their underwriting requirements.
Others, however, say the banks are still clinging to their purse strings. For a broader recovery, they will need to make loans more available to more consumer borrowers with blemished credit histories and a broader array of small businesses, the critics say.
''I don't think the lending window is open near enough to what you need to see to get the economy growing, businesses expanding, and to bring the unemployment rate down,'' said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, a forecasting firm.
So far, the revival in lending has not been strong enough to significantly move the revenue needle for the nation's biggest banks, either. The poor performance of their Wall Street-related businesses and the elimination of once-lucrative overdraft and credit card penalty fees have weighed on their results. Meanwhile, the rise in new loan volume has not been enough to offset the lower profit margins on new loans as a result of the Fed's decision to keep interest rates close to zero until at least 2013.
On Monday, Citigroup reported that its core revenue fell 8 percent, even as it squeezed out a $3.8 billion profit with some favorable accounting. It booked a $1.9 billion paper gain since the cost of retiring its debt had, theoretically, declined because of concerns over its financial condition. It also delivered about $1.4 billion to its bottom line, using money it had previously set aside to cover credit card and other loan losses. Together, those moves accounted for more than 60 percent of its pretax earnings.
Wells Fargo also reported a 6 percent drop in revenue, as several major divisions, like its vast mortgage operations and its investment banking businesses, reported a decline from last year.
But the bank still managed a record $4.1 billion profit, thanks in part to a sharp reduction in charge-offs and the release of $800 million in loan loss reserves.
But buried in the numbers of both big banks were signs that loan growth was modestly improving. Citigroup pointed to healthy demand in emerging markets, which have only recently started to feel the impact of the global slowdown.
In Asia, for example, corporate loans grew 22 percent, while card lending increased by about 4 percent, excluding the impact of the exchange rate. Citi's Latin American operations showed similar resilience, while even the North American business showed a slight increase in lending, with the exception of mortgages.
Much of it is not ''forced lending'' as borrowers tap credit lines because they are in desperate need of money to pay their bills, Citi executives said. Small-business customers are ''drawing them down because they have real needs and we are extending additional commitments,'' said John C. Gerspach, Citigroup's chief financial officer. ''Absent the continued uncertainty, you would likely have loans growing and the economy growing at a faster rate.''
Executives at Wells Fargo, whose giant lending operations are largely focused on consumer and corporate borrowers in the United States, said that ''customer sentiment is good'' even though some of the economic data worsened during the third quarter. ''It's not just energy or commercial real estate; it's really across the board,'' said Mr. Sloan, the chief financial officer at Wells Fargo.
Some of the growth was due to foreign lenders ceding some ground to Wells and other large American banks, rather than an overall increase in demand. The uptick in Wells Fargo's commercial lending business was aided, in part, by a $1.1 billion commercial real estate portfolio it bought from the Bank of Ireland. Even its mortgage business, which reported more than a 50 percent jump in home loan applications, owed some of the lending growth to consumers refinancing existing loans - not people obtaining new ones.
On Thursday, Mr. Dimon was keen to highlight JPMorgan's lending numbers in an otherwise sobering quarter. Lending to small businesses with less than $50 million in revenue was up 70 percent through this year compared with the same period in 2010, while lending to middle-market customers was up 18 percent.
''These are pretty powerful numbers,'' Mr. Dimon said on a conference call with journalists. ''We look at loan growth translating to jobs.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Worries Circled Las Vegas Track Before a Pileup

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT; Dave Caldwell contributed reporting. Viv Bernstein contributed reporting from Concord, N.C.

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- The recipe for disaster in auto racing is hardly a secret. Start with a problematic racing layout, mix in a field of expert drivers with rookies and rusty ones, put millions of dollars on the line and then add speed. Lots of speed.
On Sunday, the recipe produced one of the worst crashes in the history of Indy-car racing: a 15-car smashup that left the British driver Dan Wheldon, a two-time winner of the Indianapolis 500, dead at 33.
The problematic track was Las Vegas Motor Speedway, a steeply banked mile-and-a-half oval more suited to stock car racing. The first Indy car race run there in 1996 was plagued by crashes, and the two subsequent races there proved no safer.
''There's zero margin for error,'' James Hinchcliffe, the driver who said his car started the deadly crash, said in its aftermath. ''Zero time to react.'' 
The influence of money came in the form of a $2.5 million bonus Wheldon would have won if he had pulled off what many drivers regarded as little more than a dangerous stunt: agree to start at the back of the pack and see if he could thread his way through slower, less-experienced drivers to win.
Wheldon, who was wildly talented but who had barely raced in 2011, acknowledged beforehand that the money was why he risked racing rusty.
And then there was speed. Practice runs had yielded high speeds and at least one serious crash -- James Jakes, a rookie driver, hit a wall Friday at more than 220 miles per hour. Wheldon -- ''I'm hitting 221 miles per hour on the backstretch,'' he said after a practice session Friday -- told others that he felt a bit overwhelmed at those speeds, in a largely unfamiliar car.
''You could feel the fear,'' the driver Adrian Fernandez said of time he spent with Wheldon in his motor home before the start of the race.
On Monday, IndyCar Series officials responsible for the race had not spoken publicly about any issues the fatal crash had raised. But prominent drivers were quick in calling for rethinking all or parts of IndyCar.
Jimmie Johnson, a five-time Nascar champion, said flatly, ''Indy cars should only be racing on road courses -- not ovals.''
Danica Patrick, who is leaving the sport to concentrate on stock cars next year, said she would not miss IndyCar's zero-margin-for-error style. She lamented worrying about looking ''like a wimp,'' if she erred on the side of safety -- taking her foot off the gas pedal so as to avoid winding up in a crash like Sunday's.
''But you know what?'' she admitted, ''I lifted a little.''
The Las Vegas track, which opened in 1995, was built for a reported cost of $72 million. The track was purchased for $215 million in 1998 by Speedway Motorsports Inc., which owns other tracks in Charlotte, N.C.; Atlanta; and Fort Worth.
The layout had a basic problem: its oval had been constructed with rather illogical angles and degrees of banking, requiring continual adjustments by drivers accustomed to setting the steering wheel at a given angle and maintaining an expected trajectory. Drivers complained of not being able to find a smooth, safe racing line.
A race for Indy cars there in 1996 was called a crash-filled bore, in which the safety car led more laps than the winner.
Two subsequent races by the open-wheel cars produced no more satisfying results. The cars stopped racing there in 2000.
''I don't know what I'd suggest to fix it,'' Nascar's Dale Earnhardt Jr. said at the time, ''other than to dig it up and start over.''
Over the years, and the course of many changes, costing untold millions of dollars, that is essentially what Speedway Motorsports did. The most recent change, five years ago, increased the angle of the banking from 12 to 20 degrees. Average lap speeds jumped by more than 10 m.p.h. Sturdier stock cars seemed better suited to handle the increased danger that came with the increased speed.
''I hate to, so close to a tragedy, talk about a cause and effect,'' the Nascar driver Jeff Burton said, ''but when you're running the speeds that they're running, running in packs the way they're running, you're going to have spectacular wrecks and hopefully you don't have catastrophic injuries and those kind of things. There's no way to avoid it.''
Against that backdrop of concern, Wheldon agreed to return to racing after a long layoff. He had been fired from his regular full-time ride in the series after the 2010 season. He had snagged a one-off engagement with a part-time team for the Indianapolis 500 in May, and he managed to hang on for a hard-earned second place until the rookie driver J. R. Hildebrand crashed while leading; in the last 100 yards, Wheldon passed Hildebrand for an improbable victory.
But Wheldon could not parlay even a triumph of that magnitude into another full-time ride in the series, which has suffered a loss of sponsorship opportunities in a tepid economy. So Wheldon went home to England and waited. The phone finally rang just as the season was winding down to its conclusion in Las Vegas. IndyCar officials offered him the chance to drive the final two 2011 races for Sam Schmidt Motorsports, and to go for the chance to win the $2.5 million bonus.
The IndyCar president, Randy Bernard, defended bringing back a rusty driver because, in this instance, Wheldon's experience and skill level were beyond question.
Wheldon finished in the middle of the pack in his warm-up effort at Kentucky earlier this month, and came to Vegas promising to improve his performance. But he qualified only 28th, despite exceeding 220 m.p.h. in practice.
Then he agreed to start at the back of a pack of 34 cars -- a large field exceeding even the Indianapolis 500's grid of 33 -- on a track that is a mile shorter than the Brickyard.
Other drivers understood the risk Wheldon was taking.
Jakes, who had hit the wall Friday after an unnerving suspension failure, said Sunday that he ''was having second thoughts about going ahead'' with the race.
''We had a bad feeling about this place,'' the driver Oriol Servia said later.
For his part, Wheldon wrote a Twitter message the day of the race: ''Big day today, $5,000,000.00 at stake!!!'' He preferred to write the amount out in long form, because, he said, ''It seems more like real money that way.'' (He was to share the purse with a fan chosen at random.)
Once the race started, cars were racing as many as four abreast at speeds exceeding 220 m.p.h. Touching wheels at those speeds can launch cars into uncontrolled pirouettes.
''Within five laps, people were starting to do crazy stuff,'' said Dario Franchitti, who won the 2011 driver's championship. ''One small mistake from somebody, and there's a massive thing.''
Franchitti, who has driven stock cars and Indy cars here, said flatly, ''Indy cars shouldn't be racing here.''
Still, concerns that may seem evident and obvious after tragedy strikes went unheeded. Wheldon, experienced but rusty, was unable to react in time to avoid being the 15th and final car into the pileup that had unfolded in front of him. It is unclear whether anyone could have.
Questions remain as to what can be done to improve the margin of safety -- the cushion of reaction time that might save a driver's life. IndyCar racing is done for 2011 -- its championship gala scheduled for Monday was canceled -- and racing is not scheduled to resume until next March in Florida. For now, however, officials in charge of the sport are loath to talk about what shape those changes might take.
''That is a topic for another time,'' Bernard said Sunday after announcing Wheldon's death. A spokeswoman, Amy Konrath, said Monday, ''We will be in touch when we are ready to comment.'' Speedway Motorsports and Las Vegas Motor Speedway likewise declined to comment.
It is open to question whether the cars will return to Las Vegas. It is tentatively listed as a stop on the calendar for next Oct. 14.
''Racing can be a bitter sport, but life in the racing community is so exhilarating that, year after year, incident after incident, drivers choose to race,'' Bobby Rahal, a former Indianapolis 500 winner said Monday in a statement. The community will grieve -- ''racing isn't heartless,'' Rahal said -- and then it will do what it always does in the aftermath of tragedy: ''We will do what Dan would have done; we will go racing again.''

HEADLINE: The Great Restoration

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
If, in the 1960s, you had tried to judge America by looking at the sit-ins and Woodstock, you would have had a very distorted picture of where the country was heading. You wouldn't have been able to predict that Richard Nixon would win the youth vote in 1972, which he did. You wouldn't have been able to predict that Republicans would go on to win four out of the next five presidential elections, a streak only interrupted by Jimmy Carter, who ran as a conservative Democrat.
Similarly, if you look only at the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements that have been getting so much coverage in the news media, you know very little about the wider America. Most Americans seem to understand this. According to data from the Pew Research Center, they are paying less attention to the Occupy Wall Street movement than any other major story -- less than Afghanistan, Amanda Knox, the 2012 election, the death of Steve Jobs and far, far less than news about the economy. 
While the cameras surround the flamboyant fringes, the rest of the country is on a different mission. Quietly and untelegenically, Americans are trying to repair their economic values.
This project begins with the pessimism and anger you see in the protest movements. Seventy percent of Americans now say their country is in decline, according to various polls. When people are gloomy they have fewer babies, and, sure enough, fertility rates have dropped sharply, with the most dramatic plunges occurring in the hardest hit states, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
But that doesn't mean people are just shrinking back. Quietly but decisively, Americans are trying to restore the moral norms that undergird our economic system.
The first norm is that you shouldn't spend more than you take in. After an explosion of debt over the past few decades, Americans are now reacting strongly against the debt culture. According to the latest Allstate/National Journal Heartland Monitor poll, three-quarters of Americans said they'd be better off if they carried no debt whatsoever. Not long ago, most people saw debt as a useful tool for consumption and enjoyment. Now they see it as a seduction and an obstacle.
By choice or necessity, eight million Americans have stopped using bank-issued credit cards, according to The National Journal. The average credit card balance has fallen 10 percent this year from 2010. Banks, households and businesses are all reducing their debt levels.
Second, Americans are trying to re-establish the link between effort and reward. This was the link that was severed on Wall Street, where so many made so much for work that served no productive purpose. This was the link that was frayed by the bailouts, when people who broke the rules still got rewarded.
In sphere after sphere, strong majorities want to see a balance between what you produce and what you get. The bank bailouts worked and barely cost the government anything, but they are ferociously unpopular because the unjust got rewarded. The auto bailouts mostly worked, but they are unpopular even in the Midwestern states that directly benefited because those who failed in the market still got the gold. Public sector unions are unpopular because of the perception that benefit packages are out of balance.
The third norm is that loyalty matters. A few years ago there was a celebration of Free Agent Nation. But now most people, even most young people, would rather work long-term for one company than move around in search of freedom and opportunity.
This values restoration is reshaping the way Americans see the world around them. Many economists say the cutback in consumption will hurt the economy in the short run. But, according to the Heartland Monitor poll, 61 percent of Americans said the decline in consumption would ''help the economy as it would create more savings that could be invested to create or expand business.''
Some economists say the government should be spending more now to stimulate a recovery. Thirty-eight percent of Americans seem to agree with that. But 56 percent have said ''government spending when the government is already running a deficit is the wrong approach during an economic downturn because it is only a temporary solution that increases long-term debt.''
These majorities are focused on the fundamentals. They say that repairing the economic moral fabric is the essential national task right now. They are suspicious of government action in general, saying that government often undermines this fabric. But they support specific federal policies that nurture industriousness, responsibility and delayed gratification, like spending on infrastructure, education and research. They distinguish between the deserving and undeserving rich.
America went through a similar values restoration in the 1820s. Then, too, people sensed that the country had grown soft and decadent. Then, too, Americans rebalanced. They did it quietly and in private.

HEADLINE: Farmers Facing Loss of Subsidy May Get New One

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
It seems a rare act of civic sacrifice: in the name of deficit reduction, lawmakers from both parties are calling for the end of a longstanding agricultural subsidy that puts about $5 billion a year in the pockets of their farmer constituents. Even major farm groups are accepting the move, saying that with farmers poised to reap bumper profits, they must do their part.
But in the same breath, the lawmakers and their farm lobby allies are seeking to send most of that money -- under a new name -- straight back to the same farmers, with most of the benefits going to large farms that grow commodity crops like corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton. In essence, lawmakers would replace one subsidy with a new one.
''We are very much aware of the budgetary constraints of the federal government,'' said Garry Niemeyer, an Illinois farmer who is president of the National Corn Growers Association. ''We want to do our part as corn growers to help resolve those issues, but we only want to do our proportional part. We don't want to have everything taken out on us.'' 
But Vincent H. Smith, a professor of farm economics at Montana State University, called the maneuver a bait and switch.
''There's a persistent story that farming is on the edge of catastrophe in America and that's why they need safety nets that other people don't get,'' he said. ''And the reality is that it's really a very healthy industry.''
The subsidy swap is gaining momentum as lawmakers seek to influence the cuts in farm programs that are expected to be made by a special Congressional panel charged with slashing $1.2 trillion from future budgets.
On Monday, leaders of the House and Senate agriculture committees said they were preparing recommendations for $23 billion in unspecified cuts over 10 years, far less than some other proposals.
Lawmakers' reluctance to simply eliminate a subsidy without adding another in its place demonstrates how difficult it is for Washington to trim the federal largess that flows to any powerful interest group. Indeed, the $5 billion program that lawmakers are willing to throw under the tractor, known as the direct payment program, was created in 1996 as a way to wean farmers off all such supports -- and instead was made permanent a few years later.
The new subsidy is being championed by Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota.
Mr. Thune, a leading voice in favor of deficit reduction, received at least $80,000 in campaign contributions since 2007 from political action committees associated with commodity agriculture, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending. Mr. Brown has received $5,500 in PAC contributions from such groups in that period.
It is unclear how much support a new subsidy would garner, since many lawmakers view farm programs as a likely source of budget savings.
Critics say that farm subsidies today have little to do with helping struggling family farmers. Instead, they go predominantly to well-financed operations with large landholdings. All told, the subsidies amount to about $18 billion a year -- about half of 1 percent of the federal budget.
An analysis of federal data by the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that tracks farm subsidies, showed that the top 10 percent of direct-payment recipients in 2010 received 59 percent of the money under the program. Those 88,000 people, including farmers, their spouses and absentee landowners, got an average of $29,598.
In lean times, such support might seem vital, but in recent years commodity farmers have done well.
The Agriculture Department forecasts that farm profits this year, measured on a cash basis, will total $115 billion, 24 percent higher than last year, thanks to soaring crop prices. Adjusted for inflation, profits are expected to be at their highest level since 1974.
The average income for farm households has been higher than general household incomes every year since 1996. The average household income was $87,780 for all farms in 2010, and $201,465 for families living on large farms.
''How do you justify this kind of money going to a sector of the economy that's booming while other folks in the country are suffering?'' Craig Cox, a senior vice president of the Environmental Working Group, said of the subsidies.
Lobbyists and farm-state lawmakers have long argued that farmers face risks, like bad weather, pests and volatile markets, that merit special treatment.
Direct payments have come under fire, however, because farmers get them whether markets are high or low. The new subsidy, called shallow-loss protection, would act as a free insurance policy to cover commodity farmers against small drops in revenue.
Most commodity farmers already buy crop insurance to protect themselves against major losses caused by large drops in prices or damage to crops. Those policies typically guarantee 75 to 85 percent of a farmer's revenue, with the federal government spending $6 billion a year to pay more than half the cost of farmers' premiums.
The proposed new subsidy would add another layer of protection to guarantee 10 to 15 percent of a farmer's revenue, paying out not only in years of heavy losses, but also when revenue dipped less severely.
The shallow-loss plan getting the most attention is in a bill introduced last month by Senators Brown and Thune that would simplify and expand an existing program.
Gary D. Schnitkey, a professor of farm management at the University of Illinois, said the Brown-Thune plan would help protect farmers during longer periods of depressed prices. Without such a program, he said, ''we would see financial stress and we would see farmers go out of business.''
It is unclear how much the proposal would cost taxpayers. Dr. Schnitkey said the plan could pay farmers $40 billion over 10 years. That would be $20 billion less than the programs it replaced, including direct payments and some smaller subsidies.
But Dr. Smith, the Montana State economist, said the cost could be much greater because the plan used recent high crop prices as its benchmark.
''If farm prices move back towards what are widely viewed as more normal levels than their current levels, farmers will be compensated for going back to business as usual,'' he said.
In a statement Senator Thune said the proposal in the bill ''corrects inefficiencies in several farm programs with a streamlined and cheaper approach.''
Representative Marlin A. Stutzman, an Indiana Republican, said that a shallow-loss plan would give farmers more flexibility in managing risk. ''Farmers shouldn't have to pay the brunt of the deficit problem,'' he said.
Mr. Stutzman and Senator Richard Lugar, also an Indiana Republican, included the Brown-Thune plan in matching farm bills they introduced this month.
Congress is due to write a new five-year farm bill next year, but some lawmakers want to use the deficit-cutting process to revamp farm spending. President Obama has proposed cutting $33 billion from farm programs over 10 years, including ending direct payments without adding a shallow-loss program. Mr. Stutzman's bill would slice $40 billion, with more than half coming from programs like food stamps and soil and water conservation.

HEADLINE: Countless Grievances, One Thread: We're Angry

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY; Reporting was contributed by Ford Burkhart, Michelle A. Monroe and Kellie Mejdrich from Tucson; Jess Bidgood from Boston; Steven Yaccino from Chicago; Ian Lovett from Los Angeles; Isolde Raftery from Seattle; Dan Frosch from Denver; Robbie Brown from Atlanta; Ravi Somaiya from London; and Cara Buckley from New York.

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- Ken Alandt's guitar, which he covered with bumper stickers and waved in the air at the Occupy Phoenix protest on Monday, is a symbol of the movement itself -- a melange of disparate causes, all of which prompt his blood to boil.
Mr. Alandt, 53, an out-of-work stagehand and one of hundreds participating in Phoenix's version of Occupy Wall Street, is furious that people are dying in foreign wars. He is angry that medical marijuana was still considered illegal despite Arizona voters' approval of it. He is livid about his lot in life.
''Bro, I have been lied to so many times that I don't know who to believe,'' Mr. Alandt said. ''All the world's problems run downhill, and I'm at the bottom.''
Protesters have taken to the streets and parks in cities across America, and in foreign capitals to boot, all under the banner of the Occupy movement. But not every group that has embraced the name, nor every individual who answers its call, necessarily marches in the same contentious lockstep. 
While the protesters seem united in feeling that the system is stacked against them, with the rules written to benefit the rich and the connected, they are also just as often angry about issues closer to home, like education and the local environment. Each gathering bubbles up from its own particular city's stew of circumstances and grievances, and the protesters bring along their pantheons of saints and villains.
''Peace activists, indigenous rights activists, immigrant activists -- they're all here,'' said Liz Hourican, 40, who belongs to the antiwar group Code Pink and was scrawling a message in pink chalk on a sidewalk in downtown Phoenix, calling on American troops to come home. ''It may sound different to you, but it's all the same. We're all stepping up and saying something's wrong.''
There may be no common manifesto or list of goals -- something that has drawn criticism from both inside and outside the movement -- but there is one common thread: anger. Some have looked for jobs for months; others have lost their homes to foreclosure. Angry, they all are.
''What brings me out here? Outrage -- outrage with what's going on in this country,'' said Lucy Horwitz, 79, who participated in Occupy Los Angeles. ''Right now, the first issue on my mind is that corporations can buy congressmen.''
In Lower Manhattan on Monday afternoon, protesters were drawn by a vast array of concerns: stark income inequality in the city, their family's suffering from salary cuts, the embarrassment of resorting to food stamps despite working 40 hours a week.
Kay Merryweather, 34, an artist on the Lower East Side, volunteers at Trinity Church, giving out food. She said that during the financial crisis, when banks were receiving bailouts and financial executives were receiving multimillion-dollar bonuses, the church often ran out before the long lines of working poor were fed. ''The bankers were getting all of these millions,'' Ms. Merryweather said. ''And we didn't have enough food.''
But not far away, Benny Zable, 66, a longtime activist, was protesting while wearing a gas mask and a suit that read ''Work Consume Be Silent Die.'' He said his outrage came from the heedlessness of economic growth. ''It's the greed factor,'' Mr. Zable said.
In Chicago, where 175 protesters were arrested over the weekend for curfew violations, a crowd outside the Federal Reserve Bank marched to the beat of improvised drums. ''Education is a part of it; housing is a part of it; jobs are a part of it,'' said Maryem Alyhabib, 34, who left her three children with her mother to protest for an hour and a half on Monday for the first time.
Without the symbolic power of a Wall Street, many local activists have improvised by occupying parks, street corners, always someplace with a link to the power structure they denounce. The many arrests that have taken place across the country have linked protesters in spirit.
''Just because you're not on Wall Street doesn't mean you're not affected by what they do and the decisions that they make,'' said Daniel Saltzman, 23, who was cited on a charge of criminal trespass over the weekend at Occupy Tucson. ''Unfortunately, we don't have the money to fly to New York, but we still can make a difference in our community.''
Some protesters in Phoenix shifted on Monday from a park near downtown to the State Capitol, where Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a Republican presidential candidate, was meeting with local politicians who favor building more border fences.
Russell Pearce, the president of the Arizona State Senate, the Republican who has led the state's immigration crackdown, dismissed the protesters. ''Even the anarchists have a right to march down the street and hate America,'' he said in an interview.
In Boston, a hub of colleges and universities, a higher education theme emerged among protesters. ''What did I spend the last four years doing?'' asked Becky De Freitas, a recent graduate of Gordon College in Wenham, Mass. ''Fluent in Mandarin and French and no one wants to go for that? And it's like, now what?''
In Atlanta, protesters marched to the intersection of Peachtree and Mitchell Streets, where many businesses have closed. ''That block of businesses is a microcosm of everywhere,'' said Sara Amis, 42, a writing instructor at the University of Georgia. ''These problems are everywhere. What happened at Peachtree and Mitchell is happening all over the state, all over the country, and all over the world.''
In London, where thousands of protesters occupy a space under the soaring dome of St. Paul's Cathedral in the city's financial district, a bearded man in a Greenpeace jacket, George Barda, 35, engaged in a heated debate with a passer-by, Naveed Somani, 24, who works in development for the Commonwealth Secretariat, an intergovernmental organization.
Mr. Somani had stopped to express skepticism that such a nebulous movement could succeed. Mr. Barda said he hoped that all the Occupy protests around the world would unite, in time, to lay out concrete aims. ''What we need to do is come up with demands that are common sense, inevitable,'' Mr. Barda said.
Mr. Somani countered, ''It's nice to have a romantic fantasy.''
The ad hoc nature of the protests led to some discord.
Jean Marie Simpson, an actor and peace activist, objected when her fellow demonstrators at Occupy Tucson surrounded a man who had assailed the movement, shouting at him and thrusting signs in his face. ''I left disappointed and disillusioned,'' she said of her fellow occupiers.
But the inclusive nature of the movement, many said, gave it its strength. In Occupy Los Angeles, mothers from Malibu gathered outside City Hall with homeless people who took advantage of the free food offered in a tent city that is growing by the day.
''Everyone is here for very separate reasons, and that's one of the reasons that this movement works,'' said Sam Agger, an Occupy Tucson participant.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Tries to Rein In Its Health Cost

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH and KEVIN SACK; Abby Goodnough reported from Boston, and Kevin Sack from Atlanta.

 BODY:
BOSTON -- On the Republican campaign trail, the health care debate has focused on the mandatory coverage that Mitt Romney signed into law as governor in 2006. But back in Massachusetts the conversation has moved on, and lawmakers are now confronting the problem that Mr. Romney left unaddressed: the state's spiraling health care costs.
After three years of study, the state's legislative leaders appear close to producing bills that would make Massachusetts the first state -- again -- to radically revamp the way doctors, hospitals and other health providers are paid.
Although important details remain to be negotiated, the legislative leaders and Gov. Deval Patrick, all Democrats, are working toward a plan that would encourage flat ''global payments'' to networks of providers for keeping patients well, replacing the fee-for-service system that creates incentives for excessive care by paying for each visit and procedure. 
''We have shown the nation how to extend care to everybody,'' Mr. Patrick said in an interview, ''and we'll be the place to crack the code on costs.''
Those who led the 2006 effort to expand coverage readily acknowledge that they deferred the more daunting task of cost control for another day. It was assumed then that the politics would pit doctors, hospitals, insurers, employers and consumers against one another, and obliterate the fragile coalition behind the groundbreaking coverage law.
Predictably, the plan did little to slow the growth of health costs that already were among the highest in the nation. A state report last year found that per capita health spending in Massachusetts was 15 percent above the national average. And from 2007 to 2009, private health insurance premiums rose between 5 and 10 percent annually, according to another state study.
Yet the plan, which generated fresh attacks on Mr. Romney in a recent New Hampshire debate and a blistering Internet ad by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, has largely succeeded in providing nearly universal coverage. Only 2 percent of residents and a fraction of 1 percent of children in Massachusetts are uninsured. The law's popularity has given state leaders added incentive to make it financially sustainable.
But the process has been painstakingly slow. It started in 2008, when the Legislature appointed a commission to study changes in the medical payment system. A year later, the commission recommended the broad outlines of a global payment plan that essentially calls for teams of providers to be put on a budget for each patient's care.
The networks would receive an annual fee for the care of each patient, with higher payments for patients deemed to be greater health risks and with bonuses for high-quality care. In theory, the healthier these so-called accountable care organizations can keep their patients, the more reimbursement they can pocket as profit. Insurers are already required to accept all applicants in Massachusetts, as will be the case nationally, in 2014, if the new federal health care law survives its legal and political challenges.
In February, three months after Mr. Patrick's re-election, he submitted a bill that would impose a global payment system for most state employees, Medicaid recipients and others with state-subsidized health insurance -- roughly one in four residents.
His plan would set parameters to help private insurers and providers follow suit, in the hope that they would gradually gravitate to global payments, without coercive legislation. And it would give the state's insurance commissioner broader authority to reject premium increases deemed excessive, with an added goal of holding down hospital costs.
Lawmakers in each chamber have struggled to draft their own proposals, which they hope to bring to a vote by early next year. In the House, one idea is to move health care providers to a global payment system within three years, with a goal of keeping health care spending increases to about 3.9 percent a year after that -- roughly the typical growth in the state's gross domestic product.
But State Representative Steven Walsh, House chairman of the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing, said it would be crucial to move slowly, adding that it could take 15 years ''to squeeze all the inequities out of the system.''
Because medical spending is driven not just by volume but also by pricing, a major question has been whether global payments alone will have much effect. It may be equally important, Mr. Patrick and others argue, to rein in the ability of the state's most prestigious teaching hospitals and physicians' groups to negotiate high rates of reimbursement.
A series of news media and government investigations have revealed that large, high-status providers, like Partners HealthCare System, which owns the Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General and Brigham & Women's hospitals, command substantially higher reimbursement from insurers than other entities.
In reports the last two years, Attorney General Martha Coakley, a Democrat, has concluded that differences in payments to hospitals cannot be explained by variations in their quality, the mix of their patients or the costs of academic medicine. Last month, the House majority leader, Representative Ronald Mariano, introduced a bill that would force insurers to narrow the inequities in payments.
Mr. Patrick said the state needed to help struggling hospitals by raising Medicaid reimbursement rates. But he also cited his insurance commissioner's recent denials of premium increases as the kind of pressure needed to keep prices down. ''I think having the authority that we have in respect to the insurers has been a very, very important tool,'' Mr. Patrick said, ''and we need similar authority with the hospitals.''
Massachusetts has had a model for global payments since 2009, when Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the state's biggest health insurer, began experimenting with an ''alternative quality contract'' that pays groups of doctors and hospitals a set fee to work as a team in caring for patients. The plans cover about 613,000 people, or roughly two-thirds of Blue Cross members in health maintenance organizations, but none of those in preferred provider organizations.
This month, in an important advance, Partners HealthCare joined the program, with incentives to keep cost growth below the Blue Cross average.
''It's a big deal,'' said Stuart Altman, a health economist at Brandeis, ''because they're the biggest player in town and it sort of solidifies that this will be one of the major changes in the system and that it's likely to be around for a while.''
Under market and political pressure, Partners also agreed to renegotiate its contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield and accept lower reimbursements, which is expected to save $240 million over three years. Andrew Dreyfus, president of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, said payments to Partners would increase at about 2 percent a year rather than the previously anticipated 5 percent to 6 percent.
The politically powerful hospitals clearly hope to persuade lawmakers that price controls are not needed. ''This contract is evidence that at Partners, we think the market is working to address affordability,'' said a company spokesman, Rich Copp.
Mr. Patrick said such experiments were important, but did not go far enough. ''We still need a bill because we've got to have scale,'' he said. ''It can't be one-offs.''
Initial resistance is also expected from doctors. The most recent annual work force study by the Massachusetts Medical Society found that nearly 60 percent of physicians -- and higher rates of specialists -- said they were not likely to join a voluntary global payment system.
But Mr. Walsh said that doctors and other stakeholders were becoming more comfortable with the idea. ''It's not seen as a foreign approach anymore,'' he said.

HEADLINE: We Can All Become Job Creators

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Howard Schultz. God bless him.
When last we left the chairman and chief executive of Starbucks, in mid-August, he had written a widely publicized e-mail lamenting the poisonous state of our nation's politics. That led him to his first big idea: a call for a boycott of political contributions until Democrats and Republicans began to act in a nonpartisan way for the good of the country.
The idea had undeniable appeal. But it was also -- let's face it -- pretty quixotic, fun to dream about but impossible to turn into reality. 
Here we are two months later, and Schultz is back with Big Idea No. 2. It is every bit as idealistic as his first big idea, but far more practical. Starbucks is going to create a mechanism that will allow us citizens to do what the government and the banks won't: lend money to small businesses. This mechanism is scheduled to be rolled out on Nov. 1. This time, Schultz is not tilting at windmills.
From the start, Schultz's crusade has been focused on the need for jobs, or, as he likes to say, ''the jobs emergency.'' Should the government finance a sustained infrastructure program to create jobs? Of course. Should it give tax breaks to companies that hire the unemployed? Yes again. But with an election coming up, nothing of the sort is likely.
With the government a nonfactor, Schultz began mulling other ideas. He knew that small businesses created most new jobs, but that many small businesspeople couldn't hire because they had lost access to credit after the financial crisis. He thought about Starbucks's involvement in microlending programs in some of the countries where it bought coffee. He wondered if there was some way that that could be applied to small business lending in this country. Finally, he thought about the nearly 7,000 Starbucks stores in the United States, and its tens of millions of customers. Surely, he mused, there must be some way to take advantage of Starbucks's sheer size.
In late August, Schultz invited a handful of employees to his home. He told them that they were not there to discuss Starbucks business. ''Let's try to take a big swing at job creation that will be unprecedented and unorthodox,'' he said. The meeting went well into the evening. Schultz served pizza.
Here's the idea they came up with: Americans themselves would start lending to small businesses, with Starbucks serving as the middleman. Starbucks would find financial institutions willing to loan to small businesses. Starbucks customers would be able to donate money to the effort when they bought their coffee. Those who gave $5 or more would get a red-white-and-blue wristband, which Schultz labeled ''Indivisible.'' ''We are hoping it will bring back pride in the American dream,'' he says. The tag line will read: ''Americans Helping Americans.''
It didn't take long for Starbucks to find the perfect financial partner: Community Development Financial Institutions, or CDFIs. These are lenders, mostly under the radar, that specialize in underserved communities. Most, but not all, CDFIs are nonprofit, and their loan default rates are extremely low. ''We specialize in expending credit, getting paid back, and paying back our investors,'' says Mark Pinsky, whose organization, Opportunity Finance Network, acts as an umbrella group to the best of them.
Pinsky served on a board with a Starbucks executive. Schultz didn't know that -- indeed, he said he had never heard of a CDFI. But the young Starbucks executives charged with turning the idea into a reality soon found Pinsky -- and realized that his organization was tailor-made for their project. Within a matter of days, he had met Schultz, and they had struck a deal.
Starbucks and the Starbucks Foundation will pay for the marketing costs, the wristbands and every other cost associated with the new program -- which will be called Create Jobs for USA -- out of its own coffers.
Here is the most beautiful part about the whole arrangement. The donations to Create Jobs for USA will not be loaned to the CDFIs. They will be turned into capital -- equity that can be leveraged. Pinsky and others told me that that equity can be leveraged 7 to 1, meaning that if 10 million Starbucks customers donate $5, that will support $350 million worth of lending. That's real money.
The Starbucks Foundation is starting things off with a $5 million donation. Schultz is hoping to convince other national retail chains to participate as well -- so that Starbucks isn't the only place people can join in the effort. And, of course, he is hoping that Starbucks customers will flock to it in droves.
So am I. With the government and banks unwilling or unable, it's time we took matters into our own hands. At this point, who else can we count on?

HEADLINE: Republicans and Foreign Policy

 BODY:
For a while, we were concerned that the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination were not saying much about national security and foreign affairs. Now that a few have started, maybe they were better off before.
Certainly, the Republican hopefuls have put to rest any lingering notion that their party is the one to trust with the nation's security. The United States is involved in two wars with more than 100,000 troops overseas. China is rising, relations with Pakistan are plummeting, Iran and North Korea are advancing their nuclear programs. The Middle East is in turmoil. Yet the candidates offer largely bad analysis and worse solutions, nothing that suggests real understanding or new ideas.
Some made weak attempts to resurrect Reagan-era ideas about American leadership that make no sense today. Accusing President Obama of being weak or refusing to lead is ludicrous when you consider all he has done to repair the damage his predecessor did to America's standing in the world. Then there was that small matter of assassinating Osama bin Laden. The Republican hopefuls seem to know that their main talking point is to criticize Mr. Obama, but, when it comes to global affairs, they are not quite sure how or why. 
How else to describe the answer from Gov. Rick Perry of Texas at a recent debate when asked what he would do if the Taliban took control of Pakistan's nuclear weapons? He jumbled up names and facts and ended up accusing Washington of refusing to sell F-16s to India, which actually had declined to buy the combat planes.
But even that was better than Herman Cain announcing that ''a leader'' does not need to know the names of people who run places like ''Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan.'' Mr. Cain should know President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan. He is an autocrat with an appalling human rights record, and Uzbekistan is an important supply route for American forces in Afghanistan.
Recently, Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman Jr. have delivered foreign policy speeches and issued white papers. But they are pretty thin, with few new ideas and many unanswered questions. Among Mr. Romney's more specific proposals: increase defense spending to 4 percent of gross domestic product. Even if that were good policy, we'd like to know where Mr. Romney plans to get the money to pay for it.
Mr. Huntsman wants the troops out of Afghanistan quickly, and former Senator Rick Santorum advocates an aggressive push to win -- whatever that means. Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry are somewhere in the muddled middle, with ambiguous statements that, so far, make it impossible to know when or even if they might withdraw troops.
Mr. Romney said proudly that he would consult the military commanders on Afghanistan -- which is exactly what Mr. Obama did. Most Republican candidates support Israel and oppose Iran getting a nuclear weapon -- without any good ideas for how to save the first and prevent the second. As for the use of military force, in a speech in August, Mr. Perry called for ''taking the fight to the enemy, wherever they are, before they strike at home.'' He also rejected ''military adventurism.'' So when exactly would he use military force? No one knows.
Would these candidates work with China or confront it? What must the United States do to ensure the Arab Spring leads to democratic change? Can relations with Pakistan be made productive? American voters deserve thoughtful answers. They're not getting them.

HEADLINE: Adventures In Credibility

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Ah, Heritage. 

 BODY:
Menzie Chinn takes us through the "Real American Jobs Act", which is every bit as ludicrous as one might imagine. What caught my eye, however, is who the GOP is leaning on for economic validation: namely the Heritage Foundation.
Yep, the people who released an analysis claiming that the Ryan plan would drive unemployment down to 2.8, that's right, 2.8 percent; and who then tried to flush that analysis down the memory hole, but weren't quick enough to forestall others from keeping cached copies.
And the GOP is relying on Heritage not once but twice -- for the claim that the Affordable Care Act has somehow cost vast numbers of jobs already, even though the thing hasn't even gone into effect yet, and for the claim that the GOP bill would create 1.6 million jobs.
Here's a suggestion for the GOP: why not rely instead on diviners who examine the entrails of sacrificed rams? It would improve your credibility.

HEADLINE: Before the World Series, a Refresher on Ticket Scams

BYLINE: MIKE TANIER


HIGHLIGHT: Mike Tanier's less-than-important developments during the baseball playoffs. 

 BODY:
Consumer Confidence: Here is some common sense advice about ticket scams from the St. Peters Patch. It serves as a remedial course in ticket scalping and counterfeiting techniques, and while some of the tips are for people who look up "gullible" in the dictionary (it's in there), even the most devious-minded among us cannot stay ahead of modern high-tech scalpers, so a refresher is worth checking out.
Some advice not mentioned in the article:
No matter what the guy in the freeway underpass tells you, there is no such thing as "dugout seating."
If there is a picture of Dane Iorg on the ticket, it is probably left over from the 1982 World Series.
StubHub is a Web site, not a person. If someone pitches a tent in a parking lot and declares himself, "Irving Q. StubHub," he is messing with you.
There is a chance someone will try to sell you a ticket to a seat that does not exist at all, give you an endless runaround when you try to extract a refund, and come up with some crazy scheme like charging you to watch a game from the parking lot. Oh wait, Jerry Jones is not involved in the World Series at all. Never mind. You are safe.
But Do They Have the Express, Written Consent of Major League Baseball? If you want the excitement of watching sports on a giant screen in an outdoor setting, you don't have to pay Jerry Jones to stand in the Cowboys Stadium lot. Just get an L.C.D. projector, a giant screen (a king-size bed sheet also works) and a neighborhood 12-year-old to hook everything up properly. Then add lawn chairs, beverages, and some buddies, and your backyard is transformed into the town-ordinance-shattering equivalent of the friendly confines.
That's what the Missourians in this article did. Note that the first guy who is interviewed appears to be eight feet tall. It helps to have a really tall person around to help erect the screen.
The article said the projection system did not work at the start of the party, forcing the homeowner Bill Hulsey and his friends to huddle around a radio. In radio broadcasts, Lance Berkman is referred to as Ducky Medwick. Imagine the flop sweat you must experience when inviting the whole town over for a playoff party, only to be forced to go audio only. Especially when one of those neighbors is eight feet tall. "Thirty-nine percent, 40 percent. C'mon, satellite, find the signal! Mombo is ready to start eating teenagers. And Albert Pujols is up! Buffering? How long does it take to buffer?"
Eventually, someone hit Alt-F1, the projector and satellite got on speaking terms, and the local news had a fine little feature. Well, several fine features. Really, people have been doing this for over a decade. There is no reason to broadcast the entire newscast from this fellow's backyard. Unless the eight-foot guy wants to be a weatherman.
As for the express written consent of Major League Baseball, it does not apply to private parties in backyards. As Bart Simpson once said, it is O.K. to have implied oral consent.
He Doubles as a Mayan Calendar: As a sports owner in the Dallas area, Nolan Ryan has an enormous reputation to live up to. Jerry Jones and Mark Cuban set the bar well over eight feet high for self-aggrandizing shenanigans, and Ryan is too straight an arrow to compete with the Batman and Robin of owner's suite egomania.
(Yes, Jerry Jones casts a looming, ominous shadow over this blog entry, making this the Jason Garrett of Bats.)
The best Ryan can do is make gentle prognostications about his own team. Ryan told ESPN Radio in Dallas that he believes the Rangers will beat the Cardinals in six games. Richard Durrett of ESPNDallas notes that Ryan has made semiaccurate predictions before: "Ryan has a knack for predicting Rangers wins. He set the goal of 92 wins in 2010, and the club got to 90 wins. He said 90 to 95 wins in 2011, and the Rangers set a club record with 96 wins."
Well, 96 is not between 90 and 95, and 92 does not equal 90. And your typical playoff-caliber baseball team is going to win 90 to 95 games, so as predictions go, picking a 90- to 95-win season is like using a psychic connection to the spirit world to learn that Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez will break up in 2012. Otherwise, this is eerie stuff.
Does Ryan get his predictive powers from dreams? If so, he has a leg up on Tony La Russa because everyone knows that androids only dream of electric sheep. If Ryan's astral guide told him that the Rangers will win only 70 to 75 games, would he fire Jon Daniels or Ron Washington, thereby causing the very future he was trying to avert? And if the Rangers won 77 games, would that count as an accurate prediction?
At any rate, Ryan has been accurate enough that when he says, "Rangers in six," you can count on either the Rangers winning or coming in second, in four to seven games.

HEADLINE: Views of the '99 Percent': Corporate Power Is Up While Living Standards are Down

BYLINE: LORI MOORE


HIGHLIGHT: Americans who identify with Occupy Wall Street say income inequality, eroding standards of living and corporate greed drive their support. 

 BODY:
Offshoots of the Occupy Wall Street movement have spread across the United States with organized protests coming to life in dozens of cities throughout the country. But are the demonstrations resonating with the general public?
The Times collaborated with the Public Insight Network from American Public Media to gather stories from readers about the Occupy Together movement and found that respondents who support the movement are frustrated by income inequality, eroding standards of living and corporate greed. 
The notion that corporations held a disproportionate amount of power and curried too much political favor is driving many who say they identify with the demonstrators.
Scott Soden, a business owner from Redwood City, Calif., said:
Banks have socialized losses and privatized the gains. They are still too big to fail and are lobbying like crazy right now for the repeal of quite timid regulations passed. The middle class has been squeezed almost out of existence. I am a successful small businessman still making a decent living raising two kids, but the world and country my kids are being brought into does not in any way look like the country I was raised in.
Philip Giacalone of Salinas, Calif. said money should not buy representation:
Running for any national office should not result in representatives indebted to their deep-pocket donors. Yet this is the American political reality today regardless of party. The recent decision by the Supreme Court (Citizens United v. FEC), which allows special interests (corporations, unions, etc.) to make unlimited, anonymous political contributions, looks like another nail in democracy's coffin to many.
Many respondents, such as Heather Haskins of Chicago, said that the life they worked to build has been eroded by national financial woes.
We have worked hard all of our lives only to find ourselves with less financial security and fewer hopes for a secure future with every passing year. My husband, who holds a B.S. in Economics, has lost two jobs in the last four years - the most recent because a bank cut off the commercial line of credit to his otherwise financially solvent company, forcing its bankruptcy and closure. Massive corporate reform is needed in order to salvage a future for this country.
Burt McCormick of Jamesville, N.Y. said he feels that the corporations have shifted the blame for the financial meltdown by refusing to refinance mortgages:
I've taken a huge cut in income since retiring from the Army after 25 years of service. I have been paying a mortgage on time for close to 20 years, 5 since my retirement. After the men who run these institutions, who pushed for eliminating oversight so they could play fast and loose with the money they were entrusted with, speculating on anything that might make a quick buck, and putting the country at the brink of ruin, NOW they want to appear responsible by holding me to a higher standard of risk aversion?
Linda Mrosko of Mabank, Texas fears her age might be a roadblock for employment.
I'm almost 60 years old; I have no savings because what little I had was used up when I lost a job I held for 13 years. The job I found paid $17,000 less a year than what I had been making. I can't save - food costs too much, all my bills have gone up - it's all too much! I've been a paralegal most of my working life, but attorneys want young folks to work for them. So, is Wal-Mart the only option I may have some day?
Marc Kundmann of Truro, Mass., said his health insurance has gone up while his salary has gone down.
In the 90's I was part of a rising middle class. I was making a good salary and was able to buy a home when I was 28 years old. I had a simple car, health issuance was not an issue (gold standard insurance as a benefit from my employer), work was easy to find and people felt empowered to follow their dreams. Fourteen years later, while my life is not bad, everything is a struggle. Health insurance went from $0 to the cost of a mortgage. My pay is about half of what it was.
The cost of offering benefits to employees has those running businesses, like Cathleen Towey, the executive director of a public library, feeling pinched too.
The mess the banks left behind is having a direct impact on my staff and the community. What was once a reasonable budget situation has become nearly impossible. Health care costs have gone up 13 percent in the last year and have more then doubled in 10 years. I can't hire full timers because I can't afford the benefits. Pension contributions have skyrocketed, but at least my staff will retire with pensions. I fight to keep tax increases to zero to watch out for the community but outside forces make it impossible to do so while running an effective library.
Not all who identified with the movement did so because of their own dire straits.
Jake Weil of Taos, N.M., said he is contributing to protests in his town.
I'm pretty well off but I see the middle class getting crushed. All I have to do is turn on any news station in the country for 10 minutes. Nobody is looking out for the little guy anymore. If you're not a Fortune 500 company, you are no longer represented.
For some, like Cynthia Berryman-Fink, a retired college professor from Asheville N.C., fearing what awaits future generations makes them identify with the movement.
I spent 32 years preparing college students for a bright future in their careers and as citizens. But now it appears to have been in vain. My future was bright. As a parent of two and mentor to thousands of young people, I wish only the same or better for our nation's youth.
Catherine Adamson of Carrboro N.C., said of the protesters:
A lot of them are young people who are hitting the wall as they try to enter the workforce. They are realizing that their potential for success and their future quality of life is melting away. They are learning that when a corporation has bad debt, it gets a taxpayer bailout. But when they have student loan debt they cannot repay, not only can they not get a bailout, they can't even get out from under it through bankruptcy
Many offered their opinion on what the movement's goals should be:
Mary Denton of Larkspur, Calif., suggested a platform for demands:
1) Corporate taxes should be globally competitive as we cannot really influence tax rates in other countries, and companies are mobile. 2) Personal income taxes should be progressive. Listen to Warren Buffett. People are mobile too, but if they want to move to tax havens let them. Regressive taxes such as sales taxes should be minimized. 3) Regulations need to be streamlined and smart, and they should be able to actually impact what they are trying to regulate. Things like risk-based capital requirements. Harder said than done (see moral hazard issue). These smart regulations (environmental, financial, consumer protection) should actually be enforced. 4) Corporations should not have the same rights as human beings.
Marta Adams, a government lawyer from Carson City, Nev., said the movement needs leaders:
It is inspiring to see folks coming together and taking to the streets, but the need for articulate leaders is needed to help define the messages. The 1% needs to come forward and volunteer to right America's ship by paying its dues to the nation that allowed them to amass such a disproportionate amount of wealth in the first place.
Not all responders supported the protesters, and several spoke out against them.
Donielle Wolfe of Portland, Texas said of the protesters:
I wonder about what these people have against capitalism. I wonder how many of them own Macs, or PC's, or iPhones, or iPads. I believe many of these young people to be miseducated and brainwashed. I am only 26 myself, but believe myself to be much more informed.
Emily Thomas of New York said:
This group is all about demanding things for free and getting things they feel were "promised" to them. I have no problem with people's right to protest. I do have a problem with protester's rights usurping the rights of tax-paying New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: More On Climate and Energy Procrastination

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: More views on what impedes big transformations, and why humans have a habit of waiting too long to make them. 

 BODY:
Here are three reactions to my post about Machiavelli's view of the impediments to making big changes in societies -- as in the asymmetrical nature of the battle to take the carbon out of energy systems in the face of both societal inertia and intensive efforts by entrenched interests to maintain the status quo. The first two remarks came in a group e-mail exchange and so relate to each other.
Eugene Linden, a seasoned explorer of environmental change and author, most recently, of "The Ragged Edge of the World" :
A long departed cousin, a neurologist, coined the term "ignostic" to describe the mindset that ignores the evidence of disaster until calamity is unavoidable. Dating back to Hammurabi (who reportedly instituted the death penalty for cutting cedars when the impact of deforestation had become irreversible), societies have been slamming shut barn doors long after the cows have fled.
You'd think we'd be different, but we're not. Targeted vested interests have sway over the levers of power, and, demonstrably, an emotionally powerful message that taps into American resentments and fears.
Riley Dunlap, whose sociological analysis of environmental policy disputes was recently explored here: 
Agreed. Keep in mind that the innovators have to overcome all kinds of inertia, and this includes the three forms of power we mention in our "anti-reflexivity" article that are available to defenders of the status quo. The hegemonic third face, which we didn't go into, is perhaps the most crucial -- e.g., the total unquestioning of neo-liberal economic thinking by most members of society, including those grossly disadvantaged by it, that makes it impossible to even conceive of radical changes.
I see Dunlap's last thought relating to the "bounded reality" described here awhile back by Bob Doppelt, executive director of the Resource Innovation Group, and a question this prompted me to pose: "Can Humans Move from Tweaks to Leaps?"
Harold Fethe of Half Moon Bay, Calif., posted a comment that I thought well worth highlighting here (it was originally posted anonymously but Fethe agreed to "uncloak" when I invited him to do so to get "Your Dot" prominence):
As the Great Recession meets the Green Revolution, two big factors get clearer:
1) Global warming doesn't make a very good emergency, and doesn't go to the top of the triage list for most people; and,
2) The whole progress of the last millennium is tied up in energy-per-capita numbers, leaving the movement with an immobilizing lack of focus: "focus on everything!" Those marching orders are very hard for scared, busy, overloaded, underemployed people to integrate into their daily struggle to maintain their lifetime socioeconomic progress and pay their bills.
Everything in our world that isn't rocks, dirt, or indigenous plants and animals was created as a result of energy expenditure by man -- the vast majority of that, via fossil fuels.
The dumbest fossil fuel advocates are easy to satirize, but Al Gore's credibility isn't exactly knocking it out of the park either. This will be a long, tedious series of pesky compromises over decades, not a glorious revolution where we rejoin some imaginary noble savage past of low energy consumption. The vast populations of developing countries aren't thrilled about the elite West's new cries of "move the goalposts," either, just as they're starting to see middle-class lifestyles percolate through their historically subsistence-level populations.
It's the scope and complexity of the task, Mr Revkin, not the bad character of those living comfortable lives. Looking to Machiavelli for a way to put some martial arts move on the West, and flip it into dense urban housing, bicycle commuting, and radical decreases in energy consumption may allow the green elite to feel superior. But the worldwide greening of industrial processes is more like a gentle fog creeping in to cool things off a bit than a revolutionary tsunami of raised consciousness and voluntarily changed lifestyles. Sorry about that.

This week's grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.
In a piece focused on Hitchens's illness and reflections on death, an obvious question was unanswered: how old is he?

In a straight-news context, we should avoid this colloquial use of "plus" as a conjunction.
Theme, of course. We need to be smarter than spelling checkers and read all the words.
We didn't need to modify "crucial" (meaning "of supreme importance"). It either is, or it isn't.
Avoid the colloquialism; make it "unemployment benefits."
We should resist this retail jargon. One reader observed, "If I call or go to a Web site and enter my information, plus payment data, don't you think I'm actually placing an order? ... Just a prethought." In this case, the phones were shipping a week later, so these orders were barely distinguishable from any other type of online purchase.
[Caption] American soldiers at Observation Post Twins, in Paktika Province. Insurgent attacks on the post dropped during the recent pine nut season.
One could argue about whether a hyphen is needed for clarity, but in any case, we should be consistent.
"Advocate" is a transitive verb and should take a direct object. Avoid constructions like "advocate for" or "advocate on behalf of."
When used as a modifier, this expression seems to need hyphens.
The past participle is "shaken," of course.

HEADLINE: Prophecy of Machines

BYLINE: FREDERIC RZEWSKI


HIGHLIGHT: Technology has surpassed art, not only in its power to influence public imagination, but also in prophetic vision. 

 BODY:
Is music technology?
Max Weber, in his last book, "The Rational and Social Foundations of Music, " published in 1921, a year after his death, says, basically, yes. Like every other aspect of civilization, music is subject to a relentless and irreversible process of rationalization, culminating (for him) in the organization of the symphony orchestra. This was at a time when the recording industry was in its infancy, and radio had only just launched the new technique of broadcasting. Weber could not have foreseen the effect of these two things on the art of music, but he might well have imagined it.
It was a revolutionary time, full of explosions: you can hear them in the recordings of Marinetti reciting his poetry; you can see them in Tatlin's designs for enormous skyscrapers. It reeked of the future. Artists (like Schoenberg) thought of themselves as prophets. They imagined things that one could do with technology, liberating people from older forms. Some of these visions became reality decades later.
Whatever prophetic aspirations artists may have had 100 years ago, however, today they belong to the past. This world has been abandoned by its gods- among them the notion of the artist as a kind of shaman or wise man. Today artists are proletarians with privileges: workers in the culture industry, like the writers in Fitzgerald's "The Last Tycoon," well paid sometimes, but servants nonetheless.
Recording, like electricity, has been around for little more than a century. Radio as a public medium for less than that. Computers have only become widely available since the 1980's. Edison did not grasp (at first) the consequences of his gramophone for music; he thought of it as an office machine. Why wasn't it invented 100 years earlier? It was a fairly simple mechanical device. Mozart might have liked it. There is no technical reason why we couldn't hear recordings of Beethoven's improvisations. But the time was not ripe. It didn't take long for Edison to realize the commercial potential of his machine, nor for the machine to have an effect on the art of music itself.
One of the most obvious effects of recording was to replace musicians with machines.
For Mahler's audiences, for dance halls where the big bands played in the 1930's, and for people who went to the Community Concerts in the '40's (when the United States was the center of classical music), music was an activity, a social event. Today for most people "music" is a piece of plastic that you buy in a store, or a magic pod around your neck.
In the 1950s, when the first electronic music studios were created, it was still possible to imagine that a new form of music was being created that was ideally suited to electronic media. What survived, however, were not the masterpieces of Varese, Stockhausen and other experimenters of the time, but the techniques they developed, which then became a part of the standard vocabulary of industrially produced music.
For better or for worse, technology has surpassed art, not only in its power to reach and influence public imagination, but also in prophetic vision. The technology of music lays the ground for the further evolution of music itself, and of other technologies as well.
(Whether the progressive rationalization of music, however, is a process which must expand indefinitely, or on the contrary must reach a limit, depends largely on the fate of capitalism. If the primary form in which music is consumed is increasingly that of electronic media, this process is part of the expansion of monopoly capitalism in the late 20th century. The reduction of music to data accelerates the circulation of capital.)
Technological innovations come about, independently of the consciousness and will of their creators, because they are objectively necessary. At the time Weber was writing his book, artists, musicians, and poets were full of prophetic visions, largely based on the glorification of machines. In the meantime, this prophecy has become a reality. What has become of the vision?
In the century that separates us from the futurists, a subtle change has come over the relation of art and technology: if the "avant-garde" (a military term first used with reference to culture and society around 1820 by the French socialist writer Saint-Simon) was once prophetic, it now occupies a subaltern position. Technology is now dominant, art an appendage, a marketing tool.
Or is it? Is there something left of the visionary avant-garde, or is it a thing of the past?
Can art still have something of the prophetic function assumed by the avant-garde of the late 19th and early 20th century, or has it been irrevocably absorbed by industry? Can art still be a harbinger of technological progress, even to the extent of forecasting its demise, along with the capitalist system of which it is a part?
Music notation, which is at least as old as writing itself and possibly older, is nonetheless in its modern form a technology which has evolved over the last thousand years, and which has had a profound effect on the art. It makes counterpoint possible, as well as the coordination of disparate elements in an orchestra. Everything from instrument design and construction to the machines used for recording and transmission has affected the art itself. So yes, Western music is very much technology.
In the 18th-century innovations in instrument design greatly expanded the dynamic range of many instruments: a development reflected in Beethoven's chiaroscuro techniques and in the massive orchestral effects of 19th-century symphonic composers like Berlioz and Wagner. Such effects are still to be found in the early electronic music of half a century ago. Now that most music is heard through one or another form of electronic reproduction, the dynamic range has been reduced to zero. There is only one dynamic: loud. As a result composers (as if in imitation of Beethoven) become deaf.
The explosive expansion of technological resources has led, paradoxically, to an impoverishment of the language of music. This process- consisting in a return to basic tonality, harmonic simplification, disappearance of counterpoint, replacement of developmental variation by hypnotic repetition, mindless re-juggling (sampling) of pre-existing historical models rather than genuine innovation, general dumbing-down of the vocabulary - corresponds historically with what has been called the "Great Regression" (1980 to the present): a period characterized by the crumbling of the great guiding models of the past (without any viable new ones), and an ensuing cultural, economic, and political stagnation.
(Some 20 years ago I attended a concert of Elliott Carter's music followed by a discussion with the composer. Someone asked why he had not done any electronic music. He replied that electronic music was primarily concerned with sound, whereas he was interested in writing; and in this context electronics, far from being an advance, was a regression to the stage of hieroglyphics.)
Technology has no doubt conditioned art from its very beginnings. But for most of its history art has nonetheless been master of the relation. In the course of the 20th century a subtle reversal has taken place. Art has become a tool of the machine it has helped to create. The art which half a century ago set out to change the world has become a passive instrument of that world's malfunction.
 (Holderlin). Technology has undeniably had a positive effect on music as well: The technical level of young musicians today is astonishingly high; instantaneous access via the Internet to the great masterpieces could lead to an increase in musical literacy; and the mutual confrontation and merging of different musical cultures could result in a quantum leap to a new stage of the art. This would depend, however, on a major breakthrough in public consciousness, something theoretically possible for which there is little evidence at present.
Music is more than just technique. It must have what Arthur Rubinstein called "soul," or it is not worth the paper on which it is written - just as a technically perfect performance without understanding is no more than the sum of its inert mechanical parts. If the "avant-garde" has no soul - if it is simply a branch of the market - then it has given up its historical claim to leadership. It is dead. But the questions that gave birth to it in the first place remain. The new materials, the new channels of communication dictate the content. But they also cry out, like the locomotives and steamships in Mayakovsky's poem, for "new forms". We need, more than ever, a new art that will "drag the republic out of the mud."

HEADLINE: Q. and A.: Ry Cooder on Woody Guthrie, Politics and a New Album

BYLINE: JAMES C. MCKINLEY JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Ry Cooder spoke by telephone recently from his home in Santa Monica, Calif., about his new album and how it came about. Here are edited excerpts of the conversation. 

 BODY:
Ry Cooder's been called a lot of things: A "musician's musician" and a "musical archeologist;" a virtuoso of rock and blues guitar; and an explorer of international styles. But no one has ever labeled Mr. Cooder, 64, a folksinger. No one has accused him of singing protest songs and serving up social commentaries in the tradition of Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Phil Ochs or Bob Dylan. Mr. Cooder's most recent album, "Pull Up Some Dust And Sit Down" (Nonesuch), may change that perception.
It is an overtly political work rooted in his anger over the country's financial collapse, the bailout of America's big banks and what Mr. Cooder feels are senseless wars. Employing everything from Mexican country music to rock licks, he has written a series of scathing protest songs aimed at Wall Street bankers, Republican politicians, former President George W. Bush, anti-immigrant vigilantes and war profiteers.
The first track, "No Banker Left Behind" -- a stomping old-time, jug-band tune -- paints an image of bankers fleeing the country after "they robbed the nation blind." Then Mr. Cooder sings a Mexican waltz-time ballad about Jesse James, in which the Missouri outlaw asks God for his gun back so he return to earth from heaven and take revenge on the bankers. "You lined your pockets well but I'll see you all in hell," Jesse James says before opening fire. Other tracks are political satire: in one growling blues tune, the devil is working as a political consultant for the Republican Party.
Mr. Cooder spoke by telephone recently from his home in Santa Monica, Calif., about his new album and how it came about. Here are edited excerpts of the conversation:
Q.
Why do you think more musicians aren't writing protest songs these days?
A.
I myself am not in touch with anybody, you know. I'm a hermit. I stay in my home pretty much you know and I sit in my chair and I do this because it's what I like to do. There are a lot of people out there, playing instruments, more than ever before for sure, and they've got to be saying something. They must be. We may not get to hear them.
Q.
Is it risky for artists to take on such material? 
A.
I don't know what risk it would be honestly. Risk of what? They can't keep you off the radio because you're not on the radio. You're not going to be on the radio.
Q.
This album plays with some themes you developed in "Chavez Ravine" and "My Name Is Buddy." But those were concept albums about times past, and this one is about current events.
Q.
What changed?
A.
If you look at the Buddy record, the Buddy record could be about now. It was in the style of then, a more archaic style I suppose. Modest because it's a cat speaking. We all know how cats think.
Q.
That album recalled the labor songs of the 1930s. Do you see parallels between the 1930s and today?
A.
Well, sure. It's only obvious, isn't it? You can't find solidarity in this country anymore and that was the saddest thing. It was what I had in that mind when I made that record. Especially with this voting business, about how they want to restrict voting and go back to Jim Crow time. That's the most appalling thing of all. What else can you do but respond to this? Otherwise they paint you in the corner, you get angry and it's very bad for your mental health.
Q.
There has been a nod to social justice in your work, going back to your 1970 debut album, when you covered Guthrie's "Do Re Mi." Does this sort of music hold a special place in your heart?
A.
I always loved those songs. Woody Guthrie - I probably first heard him when I was 5. And those records and those photographs - the Farm Security Administration photographs - they made a big impact. I was intrigued by his voice. Of course, the guitar interested me. I was trying to learn them when I was a little kid. Somebody gave me a guitar. Gave me the Woody Guthrie records too. It was quite a package.
Q.
What do you hope people will take away from this album?
A.
I've always said I'm just a guitar player from Santa Monica. I really believe that's true. But I think that music has a contribution to make and if you ever saw Pete Seeger take a whole room and transform it into a collective mind, you know, where he could produce solidarity by making people sing with him, in four minutes, and it was a tremendous thing to witness. If you want to say do I think this is going to make an impact? I have no idea. I just do this because I like to do it.

HEADLINE: Q. and A.: Tom Morello Offers 'a Record of Rousing Hopelessness'

BYLINE: JAMES C. MCKINLEY JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Tom Morello, of Rage Against the Machine and The Nightwatchman, has always written protest music. It is his aesthetic, his raison d'etre his trademark. 

 BODY:
Tom Morello has always written protest music. It is his aesthetic, his raison d'etre, his trademark. His politics are famously far left and incendiary. In the 1990s, he was the guitarist and one of the ideological forces behind Rage Against the Machine, the hard rock band that did social commentary during a period in American history when few were protesting. 
A decade ago, he began appearing at coffeehouses and union rallies, doing acoustic sets of labor songs and protest music under the moniker the Nightwatchman. Since then he has appeared at scores of labor rallies and demonstrations, and started a yearly tour with other politically inclined singers. In February, he traveled to Madison, Wis., to support union members who had occupied the capital to fight the governor's attempt to roll back collective bargaining rights. A few weeks later, he put out an extended-play album of labor songs to raise money for union causes. 
Last month, Mr. Morello, 47, released his fourth full-length Nightwatchman album, "World Wide Rebel Songs" (New West). He has abandoned the acoustic approach of his previous solo albums, turning to his electric guitars and employing a hard-rocking backup band. Though the title tune is a hopeful song meant to be sung at political rallies, much of the album has an apocalyptic tone. "Politics, apocalypse/Start to look the same/The price of my redemption/will mean the end of many things," he sings on "Save the Hammer for the Man."
In an interview, Mr. Morello talked about why so few contemporary musicians are writing political songs and why he has chosen that path for himself. Here are edited excerpts. 
Q.
 There aren't many established artists writing about politics and the economic downturn. Do you feel you are swimming against the tide?
A.
 Frankly, I've never paid much attention to the tide. It doesn't really matter to me what the ebb and flow of protest music is; I am more concerned with the ebb and flow of protest.
Q.
 Do you think musicians during the current economic crisis have been unwilling to take a stand in songs?
A.
 I think there is this confused malaise. A lot of liberals and progressives hitched their dreams to this administration. I did not. It was a lot easier during the Bush administration. Darth Vader-like presidents make a great target for song writing. But the north star of my music has always been standing up for the oppressed and standing up for the underdog, and in this era, where the gulf between rich and poor continues to broaden, there are a lot of songs that need singing. 
Q.
 In many of the songs on your new album, the allusions to politics and current events are oblique. Why do you take that approach?
A.
 I found when music speaks truth to the reptilian brain, it's that magical combination of chords, melody and poetry that feels true, in a way. I find if I sit down and write a didactic screed about Guatemalan labor unions or something, it doesn't feel right; it doesn't feel artistic. And so my starting point is always taking the divining rod out to the emotional backyard and digging around in the filth of my own experience and psyche and seeing what comes up. 
A.
 There seems to be an apocalyptic tone to this album. Are you frustrated with the state of things?
A.
 When I do poke around in the filth of my feelings about personal and world affairs, sometimes it comes across as a rallying cry of hope, and other times, its like with a blank vision of a gunman up in a tower. This is a record that could be described as a record of rousing hopelessness.
Q.
 Times are different than they were in the 1930s or even the 1960s. The Okies didn't have Social Security or Medicaid. There is no draft today, so the soldiers are being drawn from the working class, not from college campuses. Are those reasons there isn't more of protest music being written?
A.
 It's interesting, both with regards to music and with regards to action in the street: austerity measures across Europe caused violence to erupt in Greece, in Spain and the U.K. We just witnessed this Arab Spring, which is morphing into Arab summer and Arab fall, where tyrants are falling right and left. And here in the United States we have this horrendous economic malaise and this growing gulf between rich and poor, and aside from a February flare-up in Madison, it's almost a shoulder shrug. What's wrong with us?

HEADLINE: Q. and A.: Everlast Sees the 'Ungrateful Living' All Around Him

BYLINE: JAMES C. MCKINLEY JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Everlast, whose real name is Erik Schrody, has a new album that presents an angry, bleak view of America on the brink of a crisis. 

 BODY:
Some events change a man's perspective. In the last three years, Everlast says, he toured Iraq to play for the troops and watched with increasing rage as old friends and family members struggled financially after the mortgage crisis and stock market crash. He also married, and he and his wife had a daughter who they learned has cystic fibrosis. 
All these events show up in the lyrics on Everlast's new album, "Songs of the Ungrateful Living," which was released by Martyr on Tuesday. It is an angry album that presents a bleak view of America on the brink of a crisis.
The single "I Get By" focuses on the economic trap many working-class people find themselves in today. "Little Miss America" talks about the realities of soldiers returning from war to a culture obsessed with celebrity and wealth. In another track, "65 Roses," he confronts the pain of raising a child with a congenital disease.
In an interview, Everlast, whose real name is Erik Schrody, said for years he was a "spoiled rotten" person, concerned with material needs. Recently he has begun to see "a greater good that we are all responsible for." 
Everlast, 42, started his career as a Los Angeles rapper and rose to fame as member of the rap group House of Pain in the early 1990s. Then in 1998, he reinvented himself with a solo album, "Whitey Ford Sings the Blues," a largely acoustic set of songs that braided rap, rock and country blues into a musical hybrid. He has released four albums since then, the last two on his own label.
In the interview, he talked about his worry that America was on the brink of violent political upheaval, about the insensitivity of rap artists who chop up luxury automobiles in videos and about his daughter's illness. Here are edited excerpts of that conversation. 
Q.
 Who are the Ungrateful Living? 
A.
 The quickest answer is all of us.
Q.
 How are the current economic problems reflected in these songs?
A.
 I make a pretty good living compared to most Americans, but I don't hang out with a lot of people who aren't blue collar. Most of the people around me are suffering. I see what they are all going through, how they are struggling to make ends meet. So it's just me trying to confront what's really going on. That subprime loan is still eating a hole in somebody's life. Americas about to be lost, man. There's going to be rich people and debt slaves. That's it.
Q.
 What do you think about the Occupy Wall Street protest
A.
 I think it's a step in the right direction. Every time I see cats buck up in Europe and have a mass protest, even riots, I'm like, at least their young people are motivated to try something. I've been waiting for the Americans. If I was 25 years old right now and just got out of college, I'd be scared to death right now. 
Q.
 Do you think it's hard for musicians to write protest songs given the state of the music industry?
A.
 Most of them are scared. Nobody wants to rock the boat. Well, the boat's full, man. And someone's going to fall out soon anyway. Let's at least rock it and knock the right people off the boat. There are cats helping to move the boat forward and there are cats making the boat sink. 
Q.
 Is there a track on the album that you particularly like?
A.
 There is a song called "65 Roses." My daughter was born with a genetic condition called cystic fibrosis. As we did research we found there was this organization called 65 Roses, and we were trying to figure out why and it was like because that's how kids who have cystic fibrosis end up pronouncing it: 65 Roses. The song isn't about the disease, but it's about the path of coping with and accepting this thing that has been brought into your life that you didn't ask for. If you don't get the right mental state as a couple and get yourselves together, it will break you and grind you into dog meat, sitting around waiting for the hammer to drop.

HEADLINE: Sentence of the Weeks, Oregon Edition

BYLINE: SAM ANDERSON


HIGHLIGHT: I could fill a whole separate Twitter account with things I read on fliers during the five days I spent recently in Oregon. 

 BODY:
A. What we know from the physics of morphogenetic fields is that each family is beholden to one governing energy field. (A flier on a college campus in Oregon)
B. There was a palpable "soul climate." (A testimonial on that flier)
C. Individually, I love you all with affection unspeakable; but collectively, I look upon you with a disgust that amounts to absolute detestation. (W.S. Gilbert, ''The Pirates of Penzance")
D. Pitching stories on the American Dream is what writers do when their hearts are empty, their minds blank. (Zach Baron)
E. The primary visual cortex takes up more blood when imagining something than when actually seeing it (Skoyles & Sagan, quoted by Richard Powers)
I could fill a whole separate Twitter account with things I read on fliers during the five days I spent recently in Oregon. But this flier was my favorite. I love its confidence ("What we know") and the way that it breezily redefines our understanding of one of the humanity's most inscrutable social formations: the family unit. Or as Tolstoy would have put it in "Anna Karenina," if he'd had the benefit of taking this seminar: "Morphogenetically balanced families are all alike in their governing energy fields; morphogenetically unbalanced families, however, have governing energy fields that radiate on decidedly unique wavelengths."

Our finalists, however, are C and E: the delightful Victorian wit of W.S. Gilbert versus a counterintuitive neurological factoid. (The latter comes from an essay in which Richard Powers whips himself into an ecstatic froth about mirror neurons and the work of Haruki Murakami.) And the winner is E: "The primary visual cortex takes up more blood when imagining something than when actually seeing it." That's fascinating: that the brain spends more of its energy on fantasy, or empathy, than it does on reality. Congratulations: the prize is more sentences, right away.
WEEK TWO:
F. There's a long American tradition of mixing economic populism with cephalopods. (Dave Gilson, Mother Jones)
G. I'm not a great journalist, and I can't interview anybody, but what I can do is kind of, I will slice open my head for you. (David Foster Wallace)
H. As soon as you stepped out onto the street, the heat sat on your chest like a Mannerist gargoyle. (Elif Batuman in Florence, Harper's)
I. ... and Vivien calling her husband, of all things, "Wonkypenky." (William Logan on baby talk in the T.S. Eliot household)
J. Kennedy himself is represented as godlike, with occasional endearing peccadilloes like the fact that he changed into his pajamas to take naps. (Paula Marantz Cohen on Jacqueline Kennedy)
K. Once upon a time there were people who weren't very good at thinking, but who were better at biting than we are today. (E.H. Gombrich, "A Little History of the World")
Our finalists here are H and K. The former comes from a characteristically charming Elif Batuman essay about participating in a citywide reading of Dante's "Divine Comedy" in Florence. The latter is from the art historian E.H. Gombrich's hypnotic "A Little History of the World" - a history of the entire world, written over six weeks when Gombrich was in his mid-20s, intended for intelligent and curious children. It is written, fittingly, in a tone of innocent wonder. ("If you want to know exactly where Egypt is, I suggest you ask a swallow.") The sentence above, K, is Gombrich's hilariously simplistic explanation of the shape of a prehistoric skull (shallow forehead, big jaw): "once upon a time there were people who weren't very good at thinking, but who were better at biting than we are today." And that's our winner for week two of October. The prize is a temporary cessation of sentences.

HEADLINE: Is 'Choice' Less Accepted for Mothers?

BYLINE: JUDITH WARNER


HIGHLIGHT: Since the Great Recession started, 72 percent of women seeking abortion services were moms. 

 BODY:
The subset of women in America who most frequently make use of abortion services, writes Lauren Sandler in Slate this week, are mothers. In 2008, according to the Guttmacher Institute, 61 percent of women who terminated their pregnancies already had at least one child. And in the period since the economic woes of the Great Recession started hitting families, the National Abortion Federation reported to Ms. Sandler, fully 72 percent of clients who came seeking abortion services were moms.
Mothers seek abortions, most times, out of economic distress: they're stretched to the limit and fear that one more baby will push them over the edge, making it impossible for them to properly care for any of their children. That's a situation with which an increasingly large part of the population can easily relate.
Yet, Ms. Sandler argues, mothers never figure prominently in the stories of women's struggles invoked by the campaigns both for and against abortion rights. Why is this? She smartly ticks off a few interesting reasons: Anti-abortion activists have done a good job of painting women who seek abortions as bad girls. Pro-choice groups, looking to marshal the public's limited stores of sympathy, have focused on the plight of pregnant teens and rape victims.
Most disturbing, however, is what Gloria Felt, the former president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told Ms. Sandler about what post polling has revealed about the public's attitudes toward women's "choices": all mothers are not equal. Those in anything less than desperate straits who nonetheless seek to terminate a pregnancy are generally not deemed worthy of empathetic concern.
"The less in control of a woman's life she is, the more the public supports her right to make that choice [to have an abortion]," Ms. Felt told Ms. Sandler. "The more she is in control of her life, saying this is the life I choose, the less people support it."
This fascinating insight cast some light for me on a phenomenon I've long puzzled over: the enduring, not well-acknowledged, insidious and quite endemic hostility toward well-educated professional women that exists in our culture. It's a very real prejudice that flies in the face of our general espousal of support for women's progress. It can come out in odd ways, as in a case I wrote about in Domestic Disturbances, the online column I wrote for The Times, a few years back when a Montana prosecutor sought jail time for a professor who'd left her children in a mall - three small children in the care of two 12-year-olds - because, the prosecutor said then, "even individuals with major educations" need to be taught lessons in responsibility.
Many well-educated professional women wrote in after that piece saying that they too often witnessed or sensed that almost epidemic sort of hostility coming their way - or toward other women like them. None of us could quite puzzle out its source. I wonder now if it does, to some extent, boil down to matters of perceived "control."
At a time when so many people, including increasing numbers of men, feel they have so very little control in their lives, a person who does (or is believed to) have choices - some modicum of control over her fate - is perhaps a prime target for resentment and vitriol. Which makes me wonder further: if "choice" is now perceived as the purview of the privileged few, the abortion rights movement may need to find itself a new slogan.

HEADLINE: After Igniting Wall St. Protests, Magazine Proposes One Clear Demand

BYLINE: J. DAVID GOODMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Adbusters, which lighted the fire that became Occupy Wall Street, is organizing a worldwide protest on Oct. 29 with a goal: a "Robin Hood" tax of 1 percent of all financial transactions. 

 BODY:
Three months ago, the Canadian magazine Adbusters called for a protest on Wall Street, providing the spark that began a wildfire of protest across the country and, over the weekend, in an increasing number of cities around the world.
That first call included a poster of a ballerina on the Wall Street bull, and a question: "What is our one demand?"
At the time, the answer was simple: gather in downtown Manhattan.
Now the magazine is attempting to push the protesters who have since heeded that call in New York and elsewhere -- and have so far been united in little more than a shared anger -- toward a more concrete, lasting and political set of demands. It is, in part, a reaction to the charge that the protesters lack any common ideas, and a fear that without one, the movement may fizzle. 
"As the movement matures, let's consider a response to our critics," the magazine's editors write in their latest "tactical briefing," sent in a blast e-mail to 90,000 activists and readers on Monday. "Let's occupy the core of our global system. Let's dethrone the greed that defines this new century. Let's work to define our one great demand."
The e-mail, which was also posted on the magazine's Web site, goes on:
On October 29, on the eve of the G20 Leaders Summit in France, let's the people of the world rise up and demand that our G20 leaders immediately impose a 1% #ROBINHOOD tax on all financial transactions and currency trades. Let's send them a clear message: We want you to slow down some of that $1.3-trillion easy money that's sloshing around the global casino each day - enough cash to fund every social program and environmental initiative in the world.
The magazine then asks readers to take the idea for this "Robin Hood" tax on financial trades -- and a global march on Saturday, Oct. 29 -- to the so-called general assemblies that have been at the center of many of the Occupy protests and sit-ins. 
Nancy Folbre, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, wrote in The Times's Economix blog last year that such a tax on financial transactions could lead to less price volatility but would very likely hurt the frequent traders on Wall Street:
It is variously called a "transactions tax," a "financial transactions tax," a "security transaction excise tax" or a Tobin tax (after the Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin, who famously argued for its application to foreign exchange purchases in the late 1970s).
By any name, Wall Street hates it, because it would cut into trading profits. But proponents like Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research assert that it would primarily affect short-term "noise traders" and discourage speculation rather than productive investment.
She calculated last year that a sales tax on Wall Street of about 0.5 percent "could raise up to $175 billion in tax revenue a year." The revenue from a 1 percent tax, extended to markets around the world, would certainly be far higher.
Whether the magazine still holds enough sway among those protesting to get people into the streets again on a specific date is an open question. As with the first call, in which the magazine created an #OccupyWallStreet hashtag for Twitter, Adbusters has suggested using the tag #RobinHoodin order to spread word of its proposed tax.
The magazine has been planning this month to make Oct. 29 a date for global protests. But, independently, activists organizing online since the summer created a day of global protests last Saturday. Members of one of the groups behind the organizing of the global protests, Take the Square, said they simply took the Adbusters idea and expanded it.
"We don't have any formal connection with them," said Alice Khatib, a spokeswoman for Take the Square. "After the calling of 17 September (entirely planned by them as far as we know), we just liked the idea and decided to make it global."
She said that her group supported the Oct. 29 protest call and that the Web page from Saturday's protest has already been updated to October29.net, where the new Adbusters message was reposted. It was a small sign that the magazine's latest call was gaining traction, at least online.

HEADLINE: Where Do You Rank Among the 99 (or 1) Percent?

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A tool from Kiplinger lets you see how your income and tax burden compare with other Americans. 

 BODY:
The persistent Occupy Wall Street movement has taken on the debate over rising income inequality, with its notion of 99 percent of the population being exploited by a wealthy 1 percent.
Doesn't that make you a little bit curious, about where your income -- and tax burden -- places you, in comparison to the rest of your fellow citizens?
Kiplinger has a calculator feature that lets you enter your adjusted gross income (that's Line 37 from your Form 1040 tax return, or Line 4 on the 1040EZ), and shows you where you fall.
To find out where you rank, try the tool.
I plugged in a hypothetical income of $50,000, and got this report:
Your $50,000 adjusted gross income (AGI) puts you in the top 50% of earners.The top-earning 50% of taxpayers reported 86.52% of all AGI and paid 97.75% of total income taxes.Together, you and the other 68.9 million taxpayers with incomes of $32,396 or more paid a total of $846.4 trillion in federal income taxes.
So where do you rank, and were you surprised by the number?

HEADLINE: Which Americans Are Most Generous, and to Whom

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The richest Americans give a greater share of their income to charities than low- and middle-income Americans, but the mix of beneficiaries is different. 

 BODY:
The richest Americans give a greater share of their income to charities than low- and middle-income Americans do, but the mix of beneficiaries is decidedly different, according to congressional testimony from Frank J. Sammartino, the assistant director for tax analysis from the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Sammartino's testimony includes some interesting statistics on the history and distribution of charitable giving, as well as estimates for how various changes in the deductibility of donations might affect giving rates. I've pulled out some of the more interesting tidbits.
First, here's a look at charitable giving by income class. As you can see, the wealthiest Americans - those making over $500,000 annually, which is less than 1 percent of all tax filers - gave away 3.4 percent of their income in 2008. That is significantly higher than Americans at lower income levels:
 Source: Congressional Budget Office based on data from Internal Revenue Service, Statistics of Income Division, Individual Income Tax Returns 2008 (revised July 2010); the Federal Reserve Board's 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances; and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2002 Consumer Expenditure Survey. Note: Includes C.B.O.'s estimates of charitable contributions by people who filed income tax returns in 2008 but did not itemize deductions.
In total, giving by this top income class accounted for 24 percent of charitable donations from all taxpayers in 2008.
The destinations for those donated funds varied tremendously by income class, however. The most noticeable trend is that as income rises, proportional giving to religious organizations falls:
 Source: Congressional Budget Office based on data from the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, Patterns of Household Charitable Giving by Income Group, 2005 (Indianapolis: Indiana University-Purdue University, 2007). Note a.: Combined purpose funds, such as the United Way, receive contributions and allocate them to many different types of charities.
In 2005, households with an adjusted gross income below $100,000 annually allotted 67 percent of their charitable giving to religious organizations, whereas households earning at least $1 million annually gave just 17 percent of their donations to religious organizations. The biggest recipients of this highest income group's donations were instead educational and health organizations.
The federal government subsidizes charitable giving by making it mostly tax deductible. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this total subsidy in forgone tax revenues amounted to about $40.9 billion in 2006.
The taxpayers who receive the biggest chunk of this subsidy are upper-income earners, both because they are most likely to itemize their taxes (and so take a deduction for charitable giving) and because their marginal tax rates are higher. In other words, if a donor has a higher tax rate, the government has more potential tax revenue to lose by letting him or her write off donations.
Exactly how this subsidy affects people's willingness to donate is hotly debated. Two studies cited by Mr. Sammartino's testimony suggested that a 1 percent increase in the price of giving would reduce giving 0.5 percent to 1.3 percent.
That suggests that various proposals to reduce (or eliminate) the charitable giving subsidy would probably decrease donations at least a little bit. You can see the details for some of those proposals in Mr. Sammartino'sfull testimony.

HEADLINE: Mary Meeker on the State of the Net

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: For technology entrepreneurs chasing opportunity, the Wall Street analyst turned venture capitalist, is still the bull: "Wow! Unprecedented times!" 

 BODY:
Mary Meeker, a Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers partner, released her latest report on "Internet Trends" on Tuesday.
The 66-page report, distributed in conjunction with her appearance at a technology conference in San Francisco, touched on the rise of China, the vast potential of the smartphone market, the migration of ad dollars to the Web and the empowerment of communities through mobile devices. 
Yet, for all the promise of the Web, Ms. Meeker, a former Morgan Stanley analyst turned venture capitalist, also outlined a sobering picture for the United States economy. Describing the economy as fraught with uncertainty, she highlighted the huge debt load; the volatility of the equity markets, which are trading two times above the historical average; and feeble consumer confidence. In her closing slides, Ms. Meeker said there was an upside: America's economic problems are at least known.
However, a fix will require sacrifice "across board."
But what about all the technology entrepreneurs chasing opportunity? For them, Ms. Meeker is still the bull: "Wow! Unprecedented times!"
That is, she says (citing Rudyard Kipling) "If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs."

HEADLINE: Bank of America Loses Title as Biggest in U.S.

BYLINE: NELSON D. SCHWARTZ


HIGHLIGHT: After reporting its earnings, the Bank of America gives up its place as the biggest bank in the United States by assets to JPMorgan Chase. 

 BODY:
For Bank of America, it is the end of an era.
With the bank shrinking its balance sheet and selling off assets, the company, based in Charlotte, N.C., surrendered its title as the country's biggest bank Tuesday, another sign of how a money-losing giant assembled over decades is being reshaped into a smaller and, investors hope, more profitable institution.
Bank of America, with $2.22 trillion in assets reported Tuesday in its third-quarter earnings, is now second to JPMorgan Chase, which has $2.29 trillion assets. It also ranks second to JPMorgan Chase in terms of branches and total deposits.
Analysts said it was more evidence of how Bank of America's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, is reversing the legacy of his controversial predecessor, Ken Lewis, an empire builder who craved being the biggest in United States banking and whose creation ultimately needed two federal bailouts to survive the financial crisis.
"There's been a huge philosophical change in who they want to be," said Mike Mayo, a veteran bank analyst with Credit Agricole Securities. "This is a milestone that marks the end of a two-decade-long period during which they aspired and eventually became the largest bank."
In today's slow-growth economy, though, bigger is not necessarily better. And the challenges Bank of America still faces were evident in the numbers it released Tuesday.
Buoyed by one-time gains from accounting changes and asset sales, Bank of America reported a $6.23 billion profit for the third quarter, but the headline number camouflaged weak results in many of its businesses. Still, investors cheered the news, pushing the bank's shares up 10 percent to $6.64 a share.
Although its investment bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, has been a crucial source of profit recently as other businesses like mortgage lending hemorrhaged money, the slow trading environment and financial uncertainty in Europe caused trading revenue to drop. The company's global banking and markets revenue fell to $5.2 billion from $7 billion, and the unit reported a $302 million loss in the third quarter, a sharp contrast to the $1.46 billion gain a year ago.
Mr. Mayo estimated that the bank's underlying core revenues dropped 17 percent, as other businesses like global commercial banking, card services and consumer real estate services also posted declines from a year ago. One exception was the company's wealth management business, where revenue and net income both rose.
Still, the story behind the $6.23 billion profit was mostly a tale of one-time gains from accounting changes and asset sales, including $4.5 billion from positive adjustments to the value of its outstanding debt, a $1.7 billion accounting gain on the perceived riskiness of its debt and a pretax gain of $3.6 billion from the sale of half its stake in China Construction Bank.
"It's not like 2007 or 2008 where there are losses that threaten the bank's capital's position," said Christopher Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer. "But nothing was particularly great and trading was very weak."
Without the special items, Bank of America would have earned about $2.7 billion, which included pulling back $1.7 billion it had set aside, largely for borrowers who fail to pay their consumer and credit card loans.
Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays Capital, counted 15 special items in the quarter, down from 16 in the second quarter but more than the 12 in the first quarter. "It's a big company undergoing a transformation."
The bank reported net income of 56 cents a share, compared with a loss of $7.3 billion or 77 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Analysts had been expecting the bank to earn 28 cents a share in the third quarter. Revenue rose to $28.7 billion from $26.9 billion, although that too was pumped by one-time gains.
For investors, the red ink flowing from Bank of America's disastrous 2008 acquisition of Countrywide Financial, the subprime mortgage giant, remains the biggest worry. Both the federal government and private investors are seeking compensation for tens of billions of dollars in losses on securities backed by subprime mortgages.
Part of the reason investors breathed a sigh of relief Tuesday was that the red ink from subprime mortgages eased in the last quarter. Provisions for so-called put-backs, in which investors try to force the bank to buy back soured mortgages by arguing they were improperly originated and bundled into securities, fell to $278 million. In the second quarter, these provisions totaled a whopping $14 billion, including an $8 deal billion with investors that include the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Litigation costs fell to $290 million from $1.5 billion in the second quarter.
In 2006, Bank of America surpassed Citigroup to become the biggest bank by market capitalization, an event that can be seen as a high-water mark of Mr. Lewis's era. Today, its $67 billion market value lags Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.
Bruce R. Thompson, the company's chief financial officer, said he expected assets to keep shrinking in the coming months, as some loans come due and are not renewed and the company's Canadian credit card business is sold in the fourth quarter.
"We're not focused on the size of the balance sheet, what we're focused on is getting the balance sheet that's best for our customers and best for us," he said.
In fact, while JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup showed slight growth in terms of total loans in the third quarter, Bank of America's overall loan portfolio declined by about 0.9 percent compared with the second quarter, Mr. Goldberg noted.
The company's headcount is also set to drop sharply from the 290,509 recorded during the third quarter. Roughly 2,000 employees were told last quarter their jobs were being eliminated, and 30,000 more are set to go over the next three years as part of Project New BAC, an efficiency initiative aimed at cutting $5 billion in expenses in its first phase.
Mr. Moynihan defended Bank of America's controversial new $5-a-month debit card fee Tuesday, arguing that customers who bring more of their banking business to the company will be able to avoid it.

HEADLINE: Getting Right to Work, New Sixers Owners Fire Stefanski

BYLINE: JOANNE C. GERSTNER


HIGHLIGHT: The Philadelphia 76ers are under new ownership, and the change is coming in a hurry with the firing of Ed Stefanski as general manager and lower ticket prices announced. 

 BODY:
The old economic adage says it's smart to buy in a down market.
So maybe the new owners of the Philadelphia 76ers, a partnership group led by the buyout financier Joshua Harris, are banking on the distressed economy and the ongoing N.B.A. lockout makes this a good time to buy distressed property. The deal, which started in April, with Comcast-Spectator, was approved by the N.B.A. board of governors and completed Monday. The terms of the sale were not disclosed.
The new ownership group, which includes minority partners like the rapper/actor Will Smith and his wife and the actress Jada Pinkett-Smith, is not wasting time making changes during their first day in charge: General Manager Ed Stefanski has been fired, ticket prices have been slashed and a new team slogan was unveiled at a Tuesday news conference in Philadelphia.
Harris announced Rod Thorn would remain team president and Doug Collins would continue to be the coach.

"We were lucky enough when we bought the team to have two fantastic people doing one job," Harris said. "We are going to stay with Rod. There are no current plans to replace Ed."
The new ownership team, which Harris said will be very hands-on, has the experience of the former N.B.A. agent and Sacramento Kings executive Jason Levien to lean on for personnel decisions.
"You can be assured that we are interested owners," Harris said to The Daily News. "We will be very focused, with lots of debate about what we do with players. At the end of the day, Rod is the captain of that ship. He will run that part of our organization. We will speak with you through one voice, Rod and Doug, when it comes to players."
The other announced moves include: cutting the price of 9,000 tickets per game by at least 50 percent; publishing an open letter to fans Wednesday, via an ad in Philadelphia's daily newspapers, to outline their management goals and philosophies; launching a not-yet-live Web site, newsixersowners.com, for fan feedback; and working to improve the in-game experience, 
The Sixers finished 17th on Forbes'sranking of the value of N.B.A. franchises in 2011, which estimated their worth at $330 million.
The team, mired in mediocrity, has struggled on and off the court. The Sixers finished thirdin the Atlantic Division last season with a 41-41 record. Attendance has been low, with the Sixers near the bottom of the league with an average of 14,751 fans per game at Wells Fargo Center last season.
The changes, plus the new marketing slogan, "Philadelphia 76ers: Passionate, Intense, Proud," are meant to create some goodwill and buzz in hopes of turning the franchise around.
"This is not a sale or promotion -- these are our new ticket prices. Period. Full stop," Adam Aron, theSixers' new chief executive, said. "Simply stated, price will not be an obstacle in preventing Philadelphia sports fans from enjoying N.B.A. basketball in person. On game nights, come to our arena, guys and girls. Bring your friends; parents bring your kids. Our house is now your house."

HEADLINE: The Tax Reform Act of 1986: Should We Do It Again?

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Ambitious attempts to overhaul the entire tax code often founder on small exceptions made, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
This Saturday is the 25th anniversary of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, signed into law by Ronald Reagan on Oct. 22, 1986. He called it a "revolution" and "the most sweeping overhaul of our tax code in our nation's history." 
Reagan was especially pleased that "millions of the working poor will be dropped from the tax rolls altogether" and that rich people and big corporations would "pay their fair share." The law was indeed a major accomplishment, one that Reagan had every right to be proud of. 
But with the passage of time, it appears far less consequential than it did at the time. Although some aspects of the law remain part of our tax system, others were jettisoned with unseemly haste. The experience raises serious questions about the long-term effects of tax reform that those favoring an overhaul today would do well to learn from.
At least on the Republican side of the political spectrum, there is a widespread belief that tax reform is the key to growth. The Republican leadership also contends that the only reform that really matters is cutting the top tax rate for individuals and corporations. It is practically impossible to find a Republican willing to put a specific tax preference -- exclusion, deduction, credit or loophole -- on the table for elimination.

Of course, many Republicans will proclaim a willingness to wipe the slate clean and abolish all tax preferences. But they always seem to find a couple of exceptions. Herman Cain, for example, whose 9-9-9 plan I discussed last week, would continue to allow a deduction for charitable contributions. In the Cain plan there is no personal exemption, no child credit, no earned income tax credit or any other provision aiding families or the poor -- but museums of modern art, Ivy League universities and public television stations would still be able to receive contributions that were tax deductible.
Historically, wipe-the-slate-clean plans have always foundered when squeaky wheels insisted on one little exception. Mortgage interest is a common one. Homeowners are a major Republican constituency, and even if they might be willing to give up the mortgage interest deduction in return for lower rates, few want to see the value of their principal asset fall further in value. 
This would almost certainly happen if the mortgage interest deduction were abolished, because its value is capitalized into home prices -- people are willing to pay higher prices and can afford larger mortgage payments due to interest deductibility. If the deduction were withdrawn, many homeowners would find renting to be more attractive.
But once one makes an exception for mortgage interest or charitable contributions in a radical tax reform plan, how does a politician say no to those who fear they will lose medical insurance if its tax exclusion is abolished, or those who live in high-tax states like New York where the deduction for state and local taxes is critical? 
Once politicians make any exceptions to wiping the slate clean, they are on a slippery slope, because those benefiting from the next most popular deduction will be standing in line demanding an exception, too.
For these reasons, all tax reform plans premised on completely throwing out the tax code and starting from scratch are hopelessly utopian, with not the remotest possibility that any of them will ever be enacted. And support for them is not costless. Because so much political energy is channeled into the Fair Tax, the flat tax, the 9-9-9 plan and other proposals, very little is left over for changes that fall short of tearing the tax code out by its roots but are still needed.
The 1986 law was never about starting from scratch. It was about making progress, improving the tax code and accomplishing something at the end of the day that was worth doing. Yet despite the relative modesty of the goal, it was still extraordinarily difficult to accomplish and could easily have fallen apart on many occasions during the process. It succeeded, in large part, because of factors no longer present in our political system.
First, there was a tradition of tax reform, as was accomplished in the tax reform acts of 1969 and 1976, which concentrated on eliminating tax loopholes that only benefited special interests. This was considered a good idea per se, even if tax rates were not cut in the process. Today, such reforms would be viewed as tax increases and impermissible under the "tax pledge" that Republicans are dogmatically committed to.
Second, Republican tax reformers of the 1980s, such as Representative Jack Kemp of New York and Senator Bob Kasten of Wisconsin, were willing to put specific tax preferences on the table for elimination and take the heat for doing so. 
Reagan built on their efforts and put forward a very detailed plan for tax reform in May 1985, based on several years of work by the Treasury Department, that identified a long list of tax provisions needing pruning from the tax code, along with supporting analysis and documentation. 
Today, Republicans like Mr. Cain put most of their efforts into devising catchy slogans and almost none into providing details of their tax proposals.
Third, bipartisanship wasn't a dirty word in the 1980s. The 1986 law would have been impossible if the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Bob Packwood of Oregon, and the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, weren't committed to the effort and willing to work closely, compromising, making deals and splitting differences in a way that Congressional Republicans and Democrats are incapable of doing today.
In the end, the key compromise that made the 1986 law work was Reagan's willingness to raise the capital gains tax to 28 percent from 20 percent in return for dropping the top income tax rate to 28 percent from 50 percent. 
Today, Republicans like Mr. Cain make abolition of the capital gains tax a key element of their tax reform efforts. It's hard to imagine that they would ever support a deal like the one Reagan took such pride in.
Even so, critical elements of the 1986 law fell apart almost immediately. The top rate was raised to 31 percent in 1990, while the capital gains rate stayed at 28 percent. Thus both liberals and conservatives lost out, and the dream of treating all income the same and taxing it at a low flat rate went up in smoke. According to the Tax Policy Center, the aggregate size of tax expendituresbegan rising almost as soon as the ink was dry on the 1986 law.
Nevertheless, the fact that the weeds will grow back is no reason to never prune a garden. One has to take a stab at it once in a while or eventually be surrounded by a jungle of ugly plants. That there is no once-and-for-all solution to it, or to the problems of the tax code, is a poor reason not to at least try to clean up from time to time.
Based on the experience of the 1986 law, the essential prerequisite for doing another tax reform like it is for President Obama to put a detailed plan on the table, as Reagan did, backed by extensive research and analysis from the Treasury Department. Reagan kicked off his effort in the 1984 State of the Union address. Obama's 2012 address would be an appropriate occasion for him to do the same.

HEADLINE: What's Behind the Lack of Confidence

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A study finds people who are most glum about the economy are the ones who say that they or someone close to them have "lost a lot of money in the real estate market." 

 BODY:
Economists are scrambling to understand why Americans are so pessimistic about the economy. As I describe in an article in Wednesday's paper, a leading theory blames the funk on the collapse in housing prices, which has erased a vast amount of wealth and convinced many Americans that they will never recover financially.
A new paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston makes an important refinement in this theory. The authors report that even in areas like Orlando, where housing prices have fallen most sharply, the loss of confidence is not pervasive.
The people who are most glum are the ones who say that they or someone close to them have "lost a lot of money in the real estate market." Those people, hit hardest by the crisis, have lost faith in the value of home ownership.
But the rest of the population has not. They still want to own homes.
And there's another wrinkle. Even among those who lost of a lot of money, the reaction varies. Younger people reported a loss of confidence, but the effect diminished with age. Respondents older than 58 said that they now viewed housing as an even better investment in the aftermath of the crash.
The authors, Anat Bracha and Julian Jamison, both are researchers at the Boston Fed's Center for Behavioral Economics. They conducted the study by adding questions to the July and August editions of the Michigan consumer survey, which is based on interviews with 2,000 Americans each month.
Restricted in the number of questions they could pose, the authors did not differentiate between people who lost a lot of money and those who were affected by such a loss by someone close to them. Nor did they attempt to quantify the extent of losses, relying instead on the judgment of the respondents.
The result shows at a minimum that for people who considered the crisis a big deal, a frequent consequence is a loss of faith in home ownership.
Why are older homeowners more likely to retain their confidence? The authors speculate that their long-held beliefs may be less malleable. Another possibility is that they are less interested in the investment potential of their homes, and more inclined to evaluate their homes primarily as places to live.

HEADLINE: Goldman Loss Offers a Bad Omen for Wall Street

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: The first loss at Goldman Sachs since the financial crisis points to what could be a more lasting shift in the financial industry, which has been steadily retrenching. 

 BODY:
Goldman Sachs, once Wall Street's highest flier, has been grounded, and it does not bode well for the rest of the financial industry or the New York City economy that depends on it.
The bank, both envied and loathed for its ability to churn out huge profits year after year, reported a quarterly loss on Tuesday - its first since the financial crisis and only its second since going public in 1999.
The misstep by the financial leader speaks to what could be a more lasting shift on Wall Street, which has been steadily retrenching over the last 12 months. While protesters a few blocks away were denouncing greed and "too big to fail" banks, the institutions themselves were coming to grips with the current diminished reality.
Banks, required by regulators to discontinue high-profit businesses like proprietary trading, reduce borrowings and hold more capital, may no longer be able to produce the supercharged earnings that were common before the financial crisis.
Although Wall Street has not changed in some significant ways - top executives are still receiving huge pay packages and its lobbyists continue to have sway in Washington - the industry is facing forces of change unlike anything since the Great Depression. Trading operations are muted. Risk-taking is tempered. And boring businesses are back in vogue.
"These firms are going back to the traditional investment banking model of the 1980s and early 1990s," said Tom Marsico of the mutual fund firm Marsico Capital Management, once a large owner of financial stocks who shed investments in Goldman and other banks this year.
Wall Street is feeling the pinch. Last week, JPMorgan Chase reported that earnings dropped by 4 percent in the latest period. Both Bank of America and Citigroup booked banner profits. But much of those results were attributed to one-time accounting gains, rather than improved fundamentals.
Goldman, which has been known for its prowess in trading, has found itself buffeted by the choppy markets and economic turmoil. While the firm posted decent results in equity trading and investment management, it lost nearly $3 billion on its investments in stocks and bonds, more than offsetting the pockets of strength.
New York, the nation's financial hub, is bracing for the fallout. Wall Street, which accounts for 14 percent of the state's tax revenue, is expected to lay off an additional 10,000 employees in the area by 2012, bringing total layoffs since 2008 to 32,000, according to a recent report by the New York State Comptroller. Each of those job losses could translate into nearly two additional positions eliminated in other industries, the comptroller estimated.
Investors have been anticipating the weakness for months. Since the beginning of the year, shares of financial companies have plummeted. While shares of Goldman jumped 5.5 percent on Tuesday, reflecting investor expectations and favorable developments in Europe, it was still down almost 40 percent for the year. Bank of America, which rose more than 10 percent the same day, stands at $6 a share, compared with $14 at the start of 2011.
The erosion of Wall Street's earning power is reflected in a closely watched barometer known as return on equity. It measures the amount of money that a company delivers on each share, an important indicator for investors.
In the last nine months, Goldman's return on equity fell to 3.7 percent on an annualized basis, down from 10.3 percent in 2010. Five years ago, it was 32.8 percent. Morgan Stanley, which is set to report earnings on Wednesday, posted return on equity of 8.5 percent last year, versus 23.5 percent in 2006.
Wall Street has proved resilient in the past. After the crisis - and the disappearance of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers - sweeping changes were predicted for the industry. A year later, the firms appeared to bounce back, reporting big profit gains and lavishing large bonuses on executives.
Whether the current weakness is short lived or the new normal will depend in part on how successful the industry's lobbying efforts in Washington. The banks already have gotten regulators to ease off some of the new restrictions.
Still, the industry's recent moves reflect more muted prospects.
To improve their profitability, banks have three main options: increase revenues, cut expenses and reduce the shareholder base. But the first method is not working at a time when earnings have been crimped by regulatory uncertainty and economic woes.
Goldman reported a loss of $428 million during the third quarter, compared with a $1.74 billion profit a year ago. The firm was punished by its holdings in stocks and bonds, losing $1.05 billion on its holdings in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a strategic investment the firm made in 2006. I.C.B.C. stock fell about 35 percent in the quarter, a paper loss that flowed through to Goldman's results.
Citigroup posted profit of $3.8 billion in the latest quarter, up from $2.2 billion in 2010. But 67 percent of its pre-tax earnings came from one-time gains, like reversing the reserves set aside to cover bad loans.
So the industry must rely on other means to improve returns in the current environment.
Cost-cutting has been a major focus across Wall Street. This summer, Goldman said that it would wring out $1.2 billion in costs from its operations by mid-2012, including eliminating about 1,000 jobs. Bank of America announced it would lay off 30,000 employees, as part of a wide-ranging plan to save $5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2013.
Goldman has also made share buybacks a priority, capitalizing on the weakness in the stock. In the third quarter, the firm bought back 18.1 million shares at a cost of $2.2 billion, one of the largest quarterly share reductions in its history.
In shrinking its shareholder base, Goldman does not have to produce the same level of earnings to maintain its returns or even increase them. But the situation reflects the broader problems facing the industry, said Roger Freeman, an analyst with Barclays Capital: "At least for now this is not a growth business."
An article on Wednesday about Goldman Sachs' quarterly earnings misstated a detail from the quarterly results of another Wall Street bank, Citigroup. One-time gains, like reversing the reserves set aside to cover bad loans, accounted for 67 percent of Citigroup's third-quarter earnings - not 85 percent.

HEADLINE: Frieze Frame | Ken Okiishi's Manhattan Transfer

BYLINE: KEVIN MCGARRY


HIGHLIGHT: A curious meditation on the psychogeography of Manhattan real estate, at the Frieze Art Fair. 

 BODY:
The Frame section of the Frieze Art Fair, curated by Cecilia Alemani and Rodrigo Moura, made space for experimentation on the fair's fringes in the form of 25 solo artist presentations presented by a younger batch of international galleries. Among them was Alex Zachary, one of New York's most idiosyncratic galleries both in terms of space and location. (It has been operating out of a multilevel, formerly residential condominium a couple of blocks from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.) Fittingly, the artist Ken Okiishi's project at Zachary's Frame booth was a curious meditation on the psychogeography of Manhattan real estate and mythologies of uptown bohemia. Eulogizing the recently shuttered Lexington Avenue establishment Gino as a point of departure (which over time has hosted luminaries as diverse as Sophia Loren, I. M. Pei and Robin Byrd), Okiishi began by outfitting the booth in the iconic Scalamandre-designed zebra wallpaper that made its debut in the restaurant's dining room circa 1930. He applied the same print to parasols bolted to the walls, whose slow and steady motorized twirling evoked bygone pageantry and ritziness. Faux-antique photographs of an early-20th-century apartment were hung beside the umbrellas; in actuality these were digital images lifted from the present-day Streeteasy.com listing for a unit on West 67th Street that was once home to Marcel Duchamp, from 1916 to 1918. East Side, West Side, Depression era, recession era: Okiishi's project drew foggy connections between places and times that are factually disparate but psychically proximate. These artifacts repurposed as ready-mades contribute to a meandering mental map of the city that relies on legends like Duchamp (and Gino's) as its compass.

HEADLINE: How Essential Is Indian Point?

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Not very, proponents of a shutdown of the nuclear plant insist; but that all depends on how heavy the demand for electricity in the New York metropolitan area turns out to be in coming years. 

 BODY:
 As I reported in Tuesday's paper, opponents of the Indian Point nuclear power plant assert that its two reactors can be retired in the next few years because alternatives exist that pose less risk and would not cost substantially more. New York City's position, however, is that retiring the reactors would raise prices sharply and reduce reliability. 
So, what would those alternatives be? New York's electricity infrastructure resembles its highway system, prone to saturation. Once in a while, though, new transmission capacity does gets added. 
 This month, in a little-noticed development, the Bayonne Energy Center finished a 6.75-mile cable that runs from Bayonne, N.J., under the Kill Van Kull, through Upper New York Bay to Gowanus Bay and then to Con Edison's Gowanus substation. The company plans to build a 512-megawatt gas-fired power station on the New Jersey side.
 In May, work began on a 660-megawatt cable that would run eight miles from Ridgefield, N.J., to Pier 92 in Manhattan, and then to Con Edison's 49th Street substation. Six miles of it will be underwater. 
 Opponents are also counting on projects like the Champlain-Hudson Express, a 1,000-megawatt submarine line that would connect Hydro Quebec with New York City. The two Indian Point reactors produce a bit over 2,000 megawatts.

Opponents of Indian Point commissioned a study from the research and consulting firm Synapse Energy Economics. Synapse acknowledged that the effect of closing Indian Point was hard to predict because it depends partly on the overall level of electricity demand in the New York City area. 
Synapse said that part of the portfolio of alternatives should be a high level of improvement in energy efficiency, effectively cutting demand by 1.5 percent from what it would be otherwise. 
Under Gov. Eliot Spitzer, New York State committed itself to reducing its energy use to 15 percent below "business as usual" by 2015. At the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the groups that sponsored the Synapse study, Ashok Gupta, an energy expert, acknowledged that the state is "not on target" to meet the Spitzer goal, let alone a tougher one. But he pointed out that some smaller states like Vermont had achieved such reductions. 
The feasibility study is part of a broader effort by Mr. Gupta's group and Riverkeeper, the study's other sponsor, to position themselves for license renewal hearings on Indian Point that are expected to start in the spring. At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Scott Burnell, a spokesman, said, "I can't remember any license renewal proceeding that has been this involved." 
The runners-up in terms of controversy are probably Oyster Creek in New Jersey, which eventually won a 20-year extension but whose owners promised to shut it in 2020 in a deal with state environmental regulators, and Pilgrim in Plymouth, Mass., a renewal process that is still under way. 
So far the commission has not turned down any , although it has instructed some applicants to do more work.

HEADLINE: Spin Recycle: What the Post-Debate Debate Might Be

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: A post-debate process that once was an organic effort, the "spin room" is now an expected and well-orchestrated part of a debate. After seeing the previous action, it is not hard to guess what will be said if patterns hold. 

 BODY:
If a presidential campaign is a test of a candidate's ability to govern, the moments immediately after a presidential debate measure a campaign's ability to twist, manipulate, cajole and spin members of the press.
In a few hours, tonight's debate will be over and reporters will flock to a nearby room where campaign surrogates -- and sometimes the candidate himself -- will explain away gaffes and strategically emphasize the good moments.
A post-debate process that was once an organic effort by those closest to the candidates, the "spin room" is now an expected and well-orchestrated part of the debate. Preprinted signs on long sticks declare "Romney" or "Bachmann" or "Perry" so that reporters at the debate venue can find their way.
In most cases, those doing the spin are professionals: the strategists, pollsters and "senior advisers." Often, the campaigns will bring in the big guns -- former politicians, current lawmakers, ex-governors and the occasional business executive who can vouch for how well their candidate did.
And then there are candidates like Rick Santorum, whose shoestring campaign doesn't go for all those fancy trappings. Standing under the "Santorum" sign after a debate is none other than Mr. Santorum.
So what will these spinners say after tonight's debate in Las Vegas? Having seen them in action at several of the previous seven debates, it's not hard to guess what they will say if past patterns hold up. So let's try: 
MITT ROMNEY: The spinners for the former Massachusetts governor will say he stuck to his theme of being the right "turnaround" guy to fix the ailing economy. He was "authentic," they will insist, despite efforts by his rivals to remind voters of his changed positions on abortion.
And that health care thing? Not a big deal, they will say. He dealt with it months ago, and besides, he wants to rip President Obama's health care law out by the roots. What about his Mormon faith? A big shrug from the spinners and a look of stern disappointment, as if to say: "Really? You're going there?"
RICK PERRY: There's no question, the Perry spinners will say, that our candidate is not a great debater. But really, Americans want a leader, not a debater in chief. He was better, they will say, on the economy and Texas's record of job growth under his tenure as governor. (Did you know he created one million jobs? they will ask.)
Sure, Mr. Perry stumbled with his answers a few times, they will concede. But he was more alert and focused. And the exchange with Mr. Romney about health care? That was pure gold for Mr. Perry, they will insist. Immigration? Look, Mr. Perry is never going to apologize for caring about children, they will say.
HERMAN CAIN: If the past is any guide, Mr. Cain might be his own spinner. And this will be an important night for him. His 9-9-9 plan was well received, he will say. Can it pass? Of course it can, he will say, if the people want it to. And they will!
Now on that pesky issue of the electrified fence on the border? Yes, it was a joke. But the issue of border security will be no joke under a Cain administration, he will say. And no, he will say (though he will be tempted) I won't sing for you.
MICHELE BACHMANN: The spinners for Mrs. Bachmann are used to this by now. Their candidate did fine, they will say. She spoke out when she could, was forceful and knowledgeable. She's a former tax lawyer, you know. And did you see how she landed those criticisms of Mr. Perry, Mr. Romney and Mr. Cain?
The key message for Mrs. Bachmann's presidential campaign, they will say, is this: Don't settle! If voters agree, they will pick her. If they don't, the spinners will insist, they may very well pick Mr. Romney, Mr. Perry or someone else with a lesser record on issues that people care about. And if Mr. Romney would pull "Obamacare" out by the roots, Mrs. Bachmann will drive a stake through its heart.
RON PAUL: If there are spinners at all, they will say this: It's all about liberty. Mr. Paul's plan -- released just this week -- calls for a $1 trillion cut in Year 1 of a Paul administration and a balanced budget by Year 3.
Can that pass? Of course, they will say. The people don't want big government, so getting rid of half a dozen federal agencies will inspire them. Remember: liberty.
NEWT GINGRICH: Mr. Gingrich sometimes saunters into the spin room himself. If not, his supporters will be there to insist that the news media are trying to keep Republicans at each other's throats. Mr. Gingrich was the one person defending the party's need to come together.
And he's the one with the big ideas, they will say. On immigration, the courts, housing and a variety of other more obscure areas of federal policy, Mr. Gingrich was the most loquacious, they will note.
RICK SANTORUM: Mr. Santorum, a former senator, will almost certainly be his own spinner, reminding the reporters gathered around him about his ability to win tough elections in a Democratic state, Pennsylvania. (You know, I beat one of James Carville's candidates, he will proudly say.)
Mr. Santorum will also echo Mrs. Bachmann. The debate proved that voters don't have to settle, he will say. They have in front of them a conservative candidate who is right on abortion, gun rights, taxes and spending (me). Oh, and I won in Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: As Economy Goes, So Go Takeovers, Even as Bargains Abound

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Market influences should be putting wind in deal makers' sails, but the Deal Professor says the overall trend is that of M.&#038;A. rushing toward a cliff. 

 BODY:
The merger market is like a pack of lemmings. If the economy is good , the takeover market will follow, but when times are bad, the market stalls.
For the moment, there are still mega-deals, like Kinder Morgan's $21.1 billion acquisition of the El Paso Corporation, and takeover activity is up. The volume of global mergers and acquisitions was up 22 percent, to $2.748 trillion, for the last 12 months ending in August from the period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters. The increase in deal volume was driven in part by a threefold increase in hostile offers and strong company balance sheets.
Yet many major economies in the world are growing sluggishly, if at all. The negative economic outlook is likely to counteract some otherwise strong drivers for deal-making.
The International Monetary Fund estimates growth for advanced economies at just 1.6 percent this year and only 1.9 percent in 2012, compared with a historical average of about 3 percent. In the United States, unemployment remains stubbornly high, and 2011 G.D.P. growth was recently estimated by a National Association for Business Economics poll of economists to be about 1.57 percent.
The European sovereign debt crisis has worsened the economic growth problem. And the uncertainty over how far the crisis will spread in Europe is bound to drive down takeover volume.
Then there is the stock market. In a presentation last week at the Penn State M&A Institute, Jane Wheeler, a senior managing director at Evercore Partners, noted that since 1985, takeover volume had grown in only two years when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had declined.
So we have the lemmings problem again. Takeover volume follows the stock market, and the market is down. Its recovery is fragile given the negative trends.
Also weighing on the merger market are signs that the Obama administration is stepping up antitrust enforcement. Last year, the federal government made a second request for information, an indication of an in-depth investigation of a transaction, in 4.1 percent of deals, compared with 2.5 percent in the last year of the Bush administration, according to a joint report submitted to Congress by the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice.
Mergers are also being challenged more often, and antitrust enforcement appears to be becoming even more aggressive in recent months. Although Continental and United Airlines cleared antitrust review by the Obama administration in August 2010, the federal government is suing to stop AT&T's acquisition of T-Mobile USA after effectively blocking Nasdaq's bid to acquire NYSE Euronext and Avis's effort to acquire Dollar Thrifty.
All this spells a decline in takeover volume. Deal makers do not want to take undue risks, and fear of uncertainty and a downturn is real even beyond the heightened regulatory scrutiny.
Yet there remain some forces that should be putting wind in deal makers' sails.
The takeover market's pattern of following equity prices is counterintuitive. When stocks are down, valuations are low and takeovers should make the most sense from a value perspective. Right now, price-earnings multiples are about 15 times earnings, compared, according to Standard & Poor's, with a historical average approaching 20 times earnings. One would think companies would be rushing to scoop up low-priced assets.
This is particularly true since credit is easy, at least for some. The high-yield market is choppy at best, but good companies can borrow at incredibly low rates for long periods. The Norfolk Southern Corporation, for example, priced a $400 million 100-year bond with a yield of 6 percent.
Even beyond credit there is cash, and companies have plenty of it. Standard & Poor's estimates that American companies have more than $2 trillion of cash on their balance sheets. Although much of it is held abroad as companies wait for the federal government to lower the dividend tax on the repatriation of cash, certainly hundreds of millions of dollars can be spent domestically.
Private equity firms are also sitting on big cash hoards. Globally, private equity still has almost $1 trillion in dry powder, according to a study by Bain. Leveraged buyouts currently average a mix of about 40 percent equity and 60 percent debt. Private equity therefore has enough firepower for more than $2 trillion in buyouts.
So where are they? The industry remains notably hesitant to make deals. Only 6.5 percent of global M.& A. transactions through the first nine months of 2011 were private equity acquisitions, according to Dealogic.
While it is hard to know what in particular is holding private equity back, they too are most likely following the economic cycle, afraid to invest in a volatile, potentially down market.
Must-do deals will still happen, like the El Paso acquisition, which Kinder Morgan's chairman and chief executive, Richard D. Kinder, called a "once-in-a-lifetime transaction."
Yet the overall trend is that of M.&A. rushing toward a cliff. Companies that might have pulled the trigger on an acquisition will instead spend their cash on dividends and stock buybacks.
Sure, some brave companies will take a plunge and try to acquire at a lower value. And the slowdown in initial public offerings may also spur takeover activity.
These are likely to be small blips. For the next few months, investment bankers are going to have a hard year as they try to point to the positive factors in the market to sell deals. But they are going to be running against those lemmings.

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: The latest political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
The wheels on President Obama's armored bus are rolling 'round and 'round through North Carolina and Virginia as the president promotes piecemeal passage of the components of his jobs bill and tries to regain the support that helped him capture both of those swing states in 2008, Mark Landler writes.

        
The Obama administration decided earlier this year against waging cyberwarfare in Libya aimed at Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's government amid doubts about setting a precedent for Russia and China, the president's authority to launch an attack, and the military's preparedness to execute it, Eric Schmitt and Thom Shanker report.

        
Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois was swept into office last year as Republicans rode a wave of Tea Party support to win his seat, but his financial problems may pose a threat to his re-election effortsas he faces the likelihood of running against another Republican freshman in a primary race for his redrawn Congressional district, Jennifer Steinhauer and Steven Yaccino write.

        
Despite his strong and steady performance on the campaign trail, former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts still faces formidable challenges to becoming the Republican Party's presidential nominee, with the primary season two months away and a new CNN poll showing two-thirds of G.O.P. voters undecided about who should run against Mr. Obama, Jeff Zeleny and Ashley Parker write. Mr. Romney will debate six of his rivals Tuesday night in Nevada.

        
As her presidential campaign loses its luster, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota has reverted to a basic strategy of meeting face to face with voters in the hope that they will give her a second look, Trip Gabriel writes.

        
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is facing questions about whether his presidential campaign underreported the value of his use of a private jet that, had it been rented from a private charter company, would have cost triple the $21,000 reported on financial disclosures, Richard A. Oppel, Jr. and Jim Rutenberg report.

        
A deficit-reduction panel linked to the Tea Party plans to release a survey Tuesday showing broad support for repealing the 2008 health care overhaul law and eliminating some entire federal departments for an estimated $6 trillion in savings, Kate Zernike reports.

        
Adam Liptak writes that the Supreme Court will consider whether lying about military awards is protected speech under the First Amendment, and, separately, observes Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.'s struggle to balance the law with what's fair.

        
The huge black holein front of the White House, a steady stream of workers, and the silence surrounding the project have ignited much speculation about what's going on down there, Will Storey writes.
Around the Web:

        
While almost two-thirds of voters are hoping Mr. Obama's policies will work, roughly as many believe they will fail, according to a CNN poll released on Monday. The poll also put Mr. Romney in a tie with Herman Cain ahead of Tuesday's debate.
Happening in Washington:

        
At 8:30 a.m., The Labor Department releases its producer price index for September.

        
In the Senate, the Labor Committee explores options for older Americans in the economic recovery, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee examines post-Sept. 11 safeguards against biological threats, and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner appears before the Small Business Committee for a discussion on federal aid to small businesses. All three hearings begin at 10 a.m.

        
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. makes two stops in Pennsylvania today to highlight provisions in Mr. Obama's jobs bill designed to support education and public safety. His first stop is at 10:45 a.m. in York and the second is at 3 p.m. in Philadelphia.

        
At noon, Vicente Fox, the former Mexican president, discusses legalizing drugs as a way of dealing with drug abuse in an appearance at the Cato Institute.

HEADLINE: Virginia Reveals Challenges Ahead for Obama

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama arrives in Virginia today, at a time when some Democratic candidates there are running away from him. 

 BODY:
President Obama arrives in Virginia on his bus tour today, just as some Democratic candidates for the state legislature are running away from him.
Ward Armstrong, the top Democrat in the House of Delegates, is one of several incumbents up for re-election in the state's off-year elections three weeks from now. And he's one of several who have been tied to Mr. Obama by Republican rivals.
"Now Charles Poindexter is comparing me to Barack Obama," Mr. Armstrong says in a television ad this month. "That's a stretch, Charles. I'm pro-life, pro-gun and I always put Virginia first. That's why I opposed the cap-and-trade bill."
The ad - and others like it in the state - underscores the challenge for Mr. Obama, who narrowly won the state in 2008 as part of a successful effort to campaign in places normally considered hostile to Democratic presidential candidates.
To win re-election next year, Mr. Obama's team is eager to keep Virginia and its 13 electoral votes in their column. But with polls showing Mr. Obama's approval ratings slipping here, Republicans, including Virginia's governor, say a repeat of his 2008 victory is increasingly unlikely.
"I don't see the magic reoccurring," Gov. Bob McDonnell said in an interview Monday evening. "Independent voters want to have a leader who will be positive and upbeat and tone down the partisan rhetoric and get stuff done. That's not what this president has done."
Mr. McDonnell will welcome Mr. Obama to Virginia in Hampton, where the president is scheduled to talk about helping veterans. (Mr. McDonnell and his daughter both served in the Army.) But that official welcome masks an increasing confidence among Republicans about defeating the president in the state next year.
A poll by The Richmond Times-Dispatch released Monday showed that Mr. Obama would face a tight race with either Mitt Romney, the Republican front-runner, or Rick Perry, the governor of Texas (Mr. Romney narrowly led the president 45 percent to 42 percent; and in a matchup with Mr. Perry, he and Mr. Obama were tied at 43 percent).
Jerry Kilgore, a Republican who is a former attorney general in Virginia, said the state's swing voters would probably mirror voters in the rest of the country, especially when it comes to concerns about the economy. The state's unemployment rate is much lower - at 6.2 percent - than in the rest of the nation. But Mr. Kilgore said Virginia voters still feel the economic pain.
"The Northern Virginia demographics continue to be more pro-Democrat," Mr. Kilgore, who is supporting Rick Perry for the Republican nomination, said. "But I think the demographics in Richmond and Hampton Roads are pure swing voters. They will go with the mood of the country."
Democrats in the state disagree that a victory in Virginia is out of reach for the president - though they concede that the race will be a tough one.
Mike Henry, a veteran Democratic strategist who is managing Tim Kaine's United States Senate race next year, said the growth of minorities and suburban votes in the state, as well as the Republican efforts to cut government spending, will help Democrats, including Mr. Obama.
"The environment is harder today in Virginia than it was in 2008. But, there is also huge promise here, and the president can win the state," Mr. Henry said. "The fast growing suburbs are getting better for us, not worse, and the issue menu the Republicans are running on is not helpful to them." 
The pledges to slash the size of the federal government - Ron Paul on Monday proposed cutting spending by 10 percent across the board in a single year - would hit Virginia's many government contractors particularly hard. That could fire up anger at Republican candidates and Republicans in Congress.
And Democrats are counting on shifts in the state's population that helped Mr. Kaine win the governorship in 2005. 
Those include increases in Hispanics, especially in the exurban communities around Northern Virginia, and the movement of traditionally Democratic voters like African-Americans into the suburban rings around the big, Democratic-leaning cities.
That includes places like the Richmond suburbs, which for years were bastions of Republican strength in the state, but which voted for Mr. Kaine and for Mark Warner, a Democrat who is the state's junior senator. Mr. Obama will hold an event in Chesterfield on Tuesday, a Richmond suburb that Republicans have traditionally won.
"I'm glad he's going to Chesterfield because it shows he's not conceding any territory," said Brian Moran, a former state delegate and the chairman of the Virginia Democratic Party. "If the economy starts to turn around, we're obviously very optimistic. As long as it doesn't get any worse, we'll be O.K."
Parts of the state remain extremely difficult for a Democratic presidential candidate. The rural communities in the state's southwest remain bastions of Republicanism. And Democrats have long struggled to win in places where textile factories and tobacco farms have largely disappeared.
Obama campaign officials are counting on the demographic changes to help Mr. Obama's chances in the state. The population centers are shifting inexorably away from the rural communities to the suburban ones. And they note that Mr. Kaine, who served as the chairman of the Democratic National Committee for two years, is continuing to embrace the president in his Senate run.
But it will almost certainly take a huge investment of time and money to secure a victory by the president, much as it did in 2008, when Mr. Obama broke a 40-year streak of victories by Republican presidential candidates in the state.
In 2008, Mr. Obama opened more than 50 campaign offices in communities around the state. And the campaign spent more than $25 million in Virginia. 
"If they do that again, it's going to be very competitive," said one leading Democratic strategist.
It will also require plenty of visits by Mr. Obama. His visit to the state on Tuesday is billed as an official White House trip designed to put pressure on lawmakers to pass his latest proposals to spur job creation in the nation's sluggish economy.
But the trip also serves as a reminder that the president is eager to win in Virginia, even if it's an uphill fight.

HEADLINE: Live Blogging the CNN Debate in Las Vegas

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Seven of the Republican candidates for president will gather again tonight for the eighth debate of the year and the first held in the West.&#160; 

 BODY:
Seven of the Republican candidates for president will gather again tonight for the eighth debate of the year and the first held in the West.
The Las Vegas debate, sponsored by and broadcast on CNN, is likely to shine a bright spotlight on Herman Cain, the ex-pizza mogul whose "9-9-9" tax plan has helped rocket him to the top of the recent polls.
But the live, 90-minute event will also be a test of whether Rick Perry can regain his footing after several disappointing debate performances. And it will offer Michele Bachmann another chance to re-emerge as a leader in the contest.
For Mitt Romney, the current front-runner, the debate holds political danger if he fails to meet the expectations he has set in past debates, or if he stumbles under criticism from his rivals.
We'll be providing real-time analysis and fact-checking on our live dashboard, and also taking suggestions from readers for candidate statements that deserve a closer look. You can submit them via Twitter with the hashtag #asknyt or on the dashboard.

10:48 P.M. | Fact Check: Examining Romney's Claim on Illegal Immigrants in Texas
In a tense, at times personal argument over immigration, where Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry repeatedly interrupted and spoke over each other, Mr. Romney charged that the population of illegal immigrants in Texas had increased by 60 percent while Mr. Perry was governor. Mr. Romney said California and Florida, two states that also have large populations of illegal immigrants, had seen no increase in the last 10 years.
It is not clear where Mr. Romney got his figures, but they do not appear to be right. The Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group, estimates that the number of illegal immigrants in Texas increased to about 1.6 million in 2010 from 1.1 million in 2000. But the same study found that the number of illegal immigrants in California increased by at least 200,000 in the decade, to 2.5 million from 2.3 million. In Florida, that population saw a big increase, according to the Pew center, to 825,000 in 2010 from 575,000 in 2000. 
In Massachusetts, a much smaller population of illegal immigrants grew to 160,000 in 2010 from 150,000 a decade earlier.
- 
10:41 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney's Texas Jobs Claim
In an attack on Gov. Rick Perry's record on job creation in Texas, Mitt Romney said 40 percent of the jobs created in the state while Mr. Perry was governor went to illegal immigrants.
Mr. Romney was citing a recent study by the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative-leaning think tank that favors reducing immigration over all. The study, by Steve Camarota, a demographer, found that 81 percent of the jobs created in Texas since 2007 went to recently arrived immigrant workers, including both legal and illegal immigrants. About half of the jobs, or about 40 percent, went to newly arrived illegal immigrants, the study found. 
Governor Perry's campaign says the study is false, arguing essentially that it could not be right because the numbers did not add up. A post on the Perry campaign Web site cites a statistic from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that Texas has gained 384,700 jobs since 2007. Department of Homeland Security figures cited by the campaign show that 60,000 illegal immigrants arrived in Texas in that period. That number does not amount to 40 percent of the new jobs. So, Mr. Perry says, the math and the study must be wrong.
- 
10:39 P.M. | Perry and Romney Seem to Make Peace on Faith
Rick Perry went further tonight than he initially did in backing away from controversial remarks about Mitt Romney's Mormon faith made by the Dallas pastor who introduced the Texas governor at a conservative conference earlier this month.
It was an unusual moment of relative comity between Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney, who had tangled during the evening.
Mr. Perry even used the word "apologize," and Mr. Romney seemed to accept it.
Here's the back story:
On Oct. 7, the pastor, Robert Jeffress of Dallas, introduced Mr. Perry at the conference as a "genuine follower of Jesus Christ" - apparently an implicit slap at Mr. Romney - and then made the attack explicit when he walked outside and told reporters that the former Massachusetts governor was in a "cult" and not a Christian.
Within hours, Mr. Perry said he did not agree that the Mormon faith was a cult. 
But asked that day whether the Texas governor agreed or disagreed with Dr. Jeffress that Mr. Romney was not a Christian, a spokesman for the Perry campaign had been more equivocal, saying Mr. Perry "doesn't get into the business of judging other people's hearts or souls. He leaves that to God."
The Perry campaign staffers also did not answer when asked whether they knew when they agreed to a request that Dr. Jeffress make the introduction that the pastor had previously, and very publicly, attacked Mr. Romney's faith. 
But on Tuesday night, Mr. Perry's debate answers seemed simpler and softer, and perhaps even a little contrite.
"I said I did not agree with Pastor Jeffress's remarks, I don't agree with them," said Mr. Perry, who, unlike his campaign spokesman's initial remarks after the incident, did not parse which parts of Dr. Jeffress's statements he was backing away from.
"I can't apologize any more than that," Mr. Perry told the debate audience, and Mr. Romney.
To which Mr. Romney, who had previously called on Mr. Perry to repudiate the remarks, softly said, "Yeah, that's fine."
- 
10:20 P.M. | Trending: 'Libya Is in Africa'
Debates are unforgiving of mistakes. So is Twitter. Just ask Michele Bachmann.
In tonight's debate, she blamed President Obama for putting the United States "in Libya," a reference to the military action that Mr. Obama took in that country.
Then she said Mr. Obama is "now putting us in Africa," an apparent reference to the recent decision to send 100 trainers to help fight the Lord's Resistance Army, a militant group, in Uganda.
The only problem? 
Libya is in Africa, too, something that Mrs. Bachmann either did not know or, at least, misspoke about during the debate.
The result? The phrase "Libya Is in Africa" is trending worldwide on Twitter. Ouch.

10:18 P.M. | Cain Dodges Question on Electrified Fence
Herman Cain appeared to back off - or maybe he just dodged a question about - his on-again off-again suggestion that an electrified fence be built on the border of Mexico. 
But with three flip-flops in as many days, it is anyone's guess how long he stands by his newest statement. 
Here's the day-to-day play-by-play:
On Saturday, Mr. Cain said he would build an electrified fence on the border that could kill those who try to cross illegally. "It's going to be 20 feet high," he said. "It's going to have barbed wire on the top. It's going to be electrified. And there's going to be a sign on the other side saying, 'It will kill you - Warning.' "
On Sunday, he said in a television interview that his comments were meant as "a joke" and "not a serious plan" - despite having sounded quite serious about it the day before. 
On Monday, he told journalists who spoke to him after he met with Joe Arpaio, the staunch anti-immigration sheriff in Phoenix, that he still believed that a border fence was needed "and it might be electrified," according to CBS News. "I'm not walking away from that."
On Tuesday - Day 4 of this particular saga - Mr. Cain told the debate audience that he would "give the serious answer" to a question posed by Anderson Cooper: "So would you build an entire fence along the entire border, and would you have it be electrified?"
But he did not address the question directly.
"Yes, I believe we should secure the border for real," he said. "And it would be a combination of a fence, technology, as well as possibly boots on the ground for some of the more dangerous areas."
- 
9:51 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney and Illegal Immigration
Governor Perry went on the offensive to attack Mr. Romney over an immigration controversy that came to light when Mr. Romney campaigned for president in 2008.
"You hired illegals in your home and you knew about it for a year," Mr. Perry said. 
He said that a year after Mr. Romney first learned that illegal immigrants were taking care of his lawn, those immigrants were still working for him. Mr. Romney's claim that he is tough on illegal immigration is "the height of hypocrisy," Mr. Perry said.
Mr. Romney fired back, "I don't think I've ever hired an illegal immigrant in my life." He gave a long explanation: when he discovered that his landscaping company had sent illegal immigrants to his home for the second time, he fired the company and told the illegal immigrants working at his house to leave.
It isn't clear that Mr. Romney ever knew directly that his landscaping company was using illegal immigrants to tend his lawn. But the episode was embarrassing for Mr. Romney, and it is still awkward now.
The Boston Globe first reported in December 2006 that Mr. Romney was employing a lawn care company that regularly hired illegal immigrants. Mr. Romney said he told an illegal immigrant working on his property to leave but continued to use the same lawn service company. A year later, The Globe reported that the service had once again sent illegal immigrants to Mr. Romney's house in Belmont, Mass. On the same day as the Globe report was published, Mr. Romney fired the company.
At that time, Mr. Romney said he had continued to use the same company because the company had guaranteed that it would not hire any illegal immigrants.
In Tuesday's debate, Mr. Romney said he would combat illegal immigration by adopting a nationwide electronic program to verify the immigration status of all new hires.
- 
9:47 P.M. | Foreign Aid 
Foreign aid represents about 1 percent of America's budget. But don't tell that to the Republican candidates for president, who love to hate it.
All of them indicated that they would slash foreign aid, with Mr. Paul saying he would just end all foreign aid.
Mr. Romney was on the other end of the spectrum, suggesting that some foreign aid was necessary, but acknowledging that the country paid out "too much."
Foreign aid is a frequent subject of conversation with conservative voters, and never more than during an economic downturn.
But none of the candidates pointed out that foreign aid was a tiny share of the national budget.
- 
9:38 P.M. | Fact Check: Border Fence
Is it possible to build a fence along the entire 2,000-mile United States-Mexico border? And if it is, is it worth the cost and would it effectively secure the border? 
Most of the candidates are competing to outdo one another on their support for building a fence - as Mrs. Bachmann has put it - "on every mile, every foot, every inch" of the border. Mr. Cain has called for an electrified fence that could "kill" people, a statement he later said was in jest, then later still said he meant.
Only Mr. Perry, whose state shares 1,200 miles of border, begs to differ about the sense of a hard fence on every mile, without conceding one iota of his own commitment to securing the border. 
It would take 10 to 15 years and cost $30 billion to build a complete fence, Mr. Perry said, arguing that a more cost-effective way is to build a fence in high-traffic areas and to use "boots on the ground" and Predator drones to monitor other areas. "That is the way to shut that border down," he said.
The Department of Homeland Security agrees with Mr. Perry. Officials say that a hard fence is prohibitively costly and inefficient, given that many stretches of the border are in remote mountain areas. To date, according to my colleague Julia Preston, who covers immigration, the department has completed about 650 miles of hard fence, mostly in cities and at points of heavy illegal crossings. Most of that work was done under the Bush administration.
A report in February by the Government Accountability Office found that border authorities, by their own measure, had "operational control" of only 873 miles, or 43 percent, of the border.
Homeland security officials responded that they could either patrol or monitor 81 percent of the border, and that the remaining areas were hostile terrain where illegal crossings are rare.
The Obama administration, with the support of Border Patrol officials, has focused on surveillance technology, equipping the Border Patrol with dozens of fixed remote surveillance systems for busy crossing points and mobile surveillance units for mountainous terrain.
The Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank that seeks to lower immigration, wants more border security but does not favor a fence across the entire border.
(Incidentally, apprehensions by the Border Patrol dropped to 448,000 in 2010, the lowest number since 1972, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The decline under the Obama administration accelerated a drop in border apprehensions that began under President George W. Bush. Since 2005, apprehensions at the Mexican border are down 61 percent.)
That is not stopping most of the Republican candidates from calling for a mile-by-mile fence. Over the weekend, Mrs. Bachmann raised her own bid, signing a pledge to build a "double fence" along the border.
- 
9:31 P.M. | Romney and Faith
Will Mitt Romney's religion - he is a Mormon - be an issue for voters? Should it be? 
That was the question posed to Mr. Romney's rivals, and they tried to carefully walk a fine line in answering.
Mr. Santorum said voters should look at "a candidate's values." Mr. Gingrich insisted that "faith matters," but said, "None of us should rush in judgement of others in the way in which we approach God."
And Rick Perry, who has declined to fully repudiate Robert Jeffress, the Dallas megachurch pastor who has called Mormonism a cult, said politicians need to "stand by our faith." 
But he went further than he has so far to apologize to Mr. Romney for the statements by the pastor, who introduced him at the Values Voter Summit, a conservative conference in Washington, on Oct. 7.
"I have said I didn't agree with that statement," he said.
What's clear is that none of Mr. Romney's rivals are ready to use the issue in the direct way they might use health care or immigration or taxes.
But they may not need to. Mr. Romney, in his answer, said he found it repulsive that "we should choose people based on their religion." He added that he could not abide "the concept that we select people based on the church or synagogue they go to."
For many people, that answer is the right one. But for some conservative Christians - like the pastor - it's possible that the answer could costs him some votes, especially in places like Iowa and South Carolina.
- 
9:26 P.M. | Housing Woes
Housing prices have dropped more steeply in the Las Vegas area than anywhere else in the United States. The price of the average home has fallen 59 percent, according to the S & P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. Nevada has a larger share of homes that have been foreclosed on than any other state.
And of course, it's not just a Nevada problem. A growing number of economists regard the collapse of housing prices, and the accompanying loss of wealth, as a central reason that the economy is still growing so slowly. Some of them, including prominent conservatives, have been calling for stronger federal action.
"Failure to act means that further declines in home prices will continue, preventing the rise in consumer spending needed for recovery," Martin Feldstein, an economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan, wrote in a recent opinion piece in The New York Times.
Yet when Anderson Cooper, a debate moderator, asked the Republican candidates what they would do to help homeowners, only two chose to answer the question directly.
Mitt Romney said the government should not address the problem directly, but should instead focus on reviving the economy. "The right course is to let the markets work," he said. "The best thing we can do is to get the economy going."
Mrs. Bachmann expressed empathy for people facing foreclosure. She said President Obama had failed to address the problem. She promised, "I will not fail you on this issue." But she did not offer any ideas, specific or general.
- 
9:20 P.M. | Santorum Mixes It Up
Rick Santorum took his vitamins today. Or maybe he just ate his Wheaties.
Whatever it was, he's been the biggest catalytic force in the debate tonight.
He started the Romney pile-on regarding health care. Like a pit bull, he wouldn't let go.
And now, here he is again, repeatedly accusing his rivals - Mr. Romney, Mr. Cain and Mr. Perry - of supporting the bank bailout known as TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. He said Mr. Perry had written urging action on the day of the TARP vote.
Mr. Perry interrupted, saying that wasn't true. He said the letter only urged action on the bailout bill, not passage. 
But Mr. Santorum wouldn't give up. What else was he talking about if not passage? an aggressive Mr. Santorum asked. 
A former senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum sometimes comes across as a mild-mannered politician who cares about families and social issues. To date, he has made little impact on the race, has raised little money and is stuck near the bottom of the polls. 
But his performance in the debate tonight has served to mix things up more than in any previous debate.
That might help him gain attention in the next several days. But it also could serve the purposes of Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney, both of whom are probably eager to see each other attacked by someone else.
- 
9:09 P.M. | Fact Check: A Model Plan? 
Another Republican presidential debate, another attack on Mitt Romney for the health care plan that was the centerpiece of his tenure as Massachusetts governor but has since emerged as the most frequent point of attack for his Republican rivals.
Tonight the attack came from Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who criticized Mr. Romney for the plan and said it was the basis of President Obama's health care plan, more commonly known among Republicans as "Obamacare."
Mr. Romney punched back, suggesting that he never thought his plan would or should be a model for a national program to expand health insurance.
Mr. Romney said that during the 2008 campaign, "I was asked: 'Is this something that you would have the whole nation do?' And I said: 'No; this is something that was crafted for Massachusetts. It would be wrong to adopt this as a nation.' "
Not exactly. Mr. Romney has repeatedly suggested that he believed that the Massachusetts program - and in particular its mandate for individuals to purchase health insurance plans - would be a good model for the rest of the country.
During an appearance on "Meet the Press" in December 2007, Mr. Romney said that while he did believed that every state would face different circumstances, his program was "a good model for other states."
"I think it's a good model for other states. Maybe not every state but most, and so what I'd do at the federal level is give every state the same kind of flexibility we got from the federal government as well as some carrots and sticks to actually get all their citizens insured. And I think a lot of states will choose what we did."
Mr. Romney added that he would not want a policy that would force other states to adopt the Massachusetts model - which Mr. Obama's health care bill, in some sense, does - but suggested that other states should consider the mandate.
"So if a state chose a mandate, it wouldn't bother you?" asked the host, Tim Russert.
"I'd think it's a terrific idea," Mr. Romney answered. "I think you're going to find when it's all said and done, after all these states that are the laboratories of democracy get their chance to try their own plans, those who follow the path that we pursued will find it's the best path, and we'll end up with a nation that's taken a mandate approach."

9:08 P.M. | Bachmann on Cost of Financial Regulation
On what basis does Bachmann claim that [financial] regulation costs $1.8 trillion? #asknyt
ECONPROF, New York
Mrs. Bachmann is referring to a 2010 study by economists at Lafayette College that was sponsored by the office of advocacy at the Small Business Administration.
- 
8:56 P.M. | Perry's Strategy - Be Aggressive
When "Saturday Night Live" mocks you for falling asleep at a debate, you do something.
If you're Rick Perry, you come out blazing, launching a direct, personal attack on your chief rival and repeatedly interrupting to accuse him of lying to the American people.
The exchanges between Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney clearly show the agenda that the Texas governor had coming into the debate: be really aggressive.
But a politician can sometimes take a strategy too far. When Mr. Perry returned to the issue of Mr. Romney's hiring of illegal immigrants a second time, the audience booed.
There's still more than 30 minutes left. Plenty of time for more clashes.
- 
8:51 P.M. | Perry vs. Romney on Immigration
Governor Perry, asked about the uninsured in Texas, shifted gears entirely to attack Mr. Romney on immigration, and on allegations that Mr. Romney's family hired a lawn service that employed illegal immigrants.
"You stood here and did not tell the truth that you had illegals working on your property," Mr. Perry said. "The idea you can talk about any of us having an immigration issue is beyond me." 
Mr. Romney went right back on the offense, accusing Mr. Perry of opposing a fence along the United States-Mexican border and of supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants. This led right into a shouting match, with Mr. Perry saying Mr. Romney was the only one who'd supported amnesty.
"This has been a rough couple of debates for Rick," Mr. Romney said, as if in explanation. "You have a problem with allowing someone to finish speaking." 
- 
8:43 P.M. | Hitting Hard on Health Care 
If Mitt Romney thought he could skate above the fray in these debates, he found out quickly tonight that his rivals won't let him.
Led by a furiously intense Mr. Santorum, Mr. Romney's rivals took direct aim once again at Mr. Romney's Massachusetts health care plan.
Mr. Santorum called it "top-down government-run health care," and Mr. Gingrich added that it was "one more big-government, bureaucratic, high-cost system."
For the first time in the debates, Mr. Romney looked a bit rattled, and on the defensive. He tried to argue that his plan was different from President Obama's health care plans. And he tried to explain the motivations for enacting the plan in his state.
But his rivals were having none of it. They interrupted him. They shook their heads and rolled their eyes. It was clear that they were not going to let him off the hook.
And when Mr. Romney told Mr. Gingrich that he came up with the individual mandate for his health care plan from Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker, himself, Mr. Gingrich was insistent: "You did not get that from me."
In fact, as he then admitted, Mr. Gingrich did support an individual mandate. Score one for Mr. Romney. But at the end of the long exchange, it became clear that Mr. Romney's rivals are eager to go after what they see as his soft underbelly.
- 
8:34 P.M. | Cain Taking Heat from the Field
Herman Cain has discovered what it's like to be in the top tier of the presidential contest.
Within moments of the CNN debate opening - spurred by an audience question about a national sales tax - his rivals pounced, politely praising him even as they did.
Mr. Romney said he liked Mr. Cain's chutzpah. Rick Perry said, "I love you, brother." Rick Santorum said, "I love his boldness." 
But they also described Mr. Cain's 9-9-9 plan as a terrible idea that would increase taxes for the middle class and would become a tool for the federal government to increase taxes even further over time.
Mr. Santorum called it "major increases in taxes on people." Mr. Perry added, "Let me tell you something: you don't have to have a big analysis to figure this one out." He said it would not work.
Mr. Cain resisted, saying he had been attacked. "That simply is not true. I invite people to look at our analysis," Mr. Cain said. "I invite every American to do their own math."
But it is clear that the Republican candidates are eager to knock Mr. Cain down a peg or two, especially given the quick rise in the national polls that Mr. Cain has experienced in the last several days.
Asked after several minutes of the criticism why he thought Mr. Cain's plan would be a harder sell to the American people, Newt Gingrich said, "You just watched it."
- 
8:30 P.M. | Fact Check: A Deeper Look at 9-9-9
Herman Cain said his much-discussed "9-9-9" plan "does not raise taxes on those that are making the least. It's simply not true."
But that is exactly what a growing number of independent analysts have concluded.
The plan calls for deep cuts in the existing federal taxes on individual and corporate income, both of which would be reduced to a flat rate of 9 percent from a system of tiered rates that run above 30 percent for the highest earners. Mr. Cain then proposes the addition of a 9 percent tax on sales.
Analysts say Mr. Cain's plan would raise taxes for lower-income families, while reducing the taxes paid by higher-income families.
"Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan is a terrific example of fiscal hocus-pocus," Edward D. Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California, writes in a coming analysis of the plan for the trade journal Tax Notes. "It is presented as a low-tax panacea, but it actually would raise the tax bills of many Americans very substantially."
Professor Kleinbard estimated that a family with $120,000 in 2010 income would have paid $541 less in federal taxes under Mr. Cain's plan. A family that earned $50,000, by contrast, would have paid $4,800 more.
The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institute, concluded that the plan amounted to a 25.38 percent national sales tax. Flat sales taxes fall more heavily on lower-income families, siphoning off a much larger share of their total income.
It is also important to note that the 9-9-9 plan is only a transitional stage in Mr. Cain's broader plan to overhaul federal taxation. He has proposed the ultimate elimination of income taxes, in favor of a flat 30 percent sales tax.
- 
8:24 P.M. | 'Bump Plans' 
Rick Perry is clearly sick of being told that he's not enough of an attack dog out there. Moments into the Las Vegas debate, he took the opportunity to swipe at Mr. Romney in his introduction, calling himself "an authentic conservative, not a conservative of convenience." Then, in the first question - on Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan - Mr. Perry came out swinging, telling Mr. Cain that it was a complete no-go in states like New Hampshire that have no sales tax, and switching gears to pitch his own jobs plan, the second half of which will be released next week in South Carolina.
"I'll bump plans with you, brother, and we'll see who has the best idea about how to get this country working again," Mr. Perry said.
- 
8:14 P.M. | Perry Comes Out Swinging
Well, that didn't take long.
Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, decided to use his two-sentence introduction to take the first shot of the night, at Mitt Romney.
Mr. Perry declared himself to be a "proven job creator" and then said he was "an authentic conservative, not a conservative of convenience."
That was clearly directed at Mr. Romney, who may be Mr. Perry's chief rival for the Republican nomination. Mr. Perry has made it clear that he intends to attack Mr. Romney as not being a true conservative. 
Expect more to come.

7:32 P.M. | A Pre-Debate Guide to Post-Debate Spin
If a presidential campaign is a test of a candidate's ability to govern, the moments immediately after a presidential debate measure a campaign's ability to twist, manipulate, cajole and spin members of the press.
In a few hours, tonight's debate will be over and reporters attending the debate will flock to a nearby room where campaign surrogates - and sometimes the candidate - will explain away gaffes and strategically emphasize the good moments.
Here's a pre-debate look at the post-debate spin process from the Caucus blog.

7:11 P.M. | Obama Campaign Offers New Twist to an Old Game
Remember that college drinking game? The one where you'd all gather together to watch a movie, and every time a certain word was uttered, everyone would drink? 
Well, Obama for America clearly remembers, and it's got an interesting twist on the old game.
A new Web site - G.O.P. Debate Watch - invites supporters of President Obama to pick from a series of words or phrases that are likely to be uttered during tonight's debate.
The words are: "Obamacare," "9-9-9," "(de)regulation," "Romneycare," "repeal," "amnesty," "fence," "socialism" and "class warfare."
Supporters can then pick a donation amount -from $5 to $50 or anything else - and every time their word gets uttered, their credit card will be charged that amount.
"Tomorrow, after the debate is over and a final tally of words has been calculated, your card will be charged and you'll receive an email confirmation of how much you've contributed," the Web site says.
And it adds the following warning: "Joining us late in the game? Please be aware that you'll be charged for words used since the beginning of tonight's debate."

4:46 P.M. | Republicans Go 'All In' for Vegas Debate
Seven of the Republican candidates for president will gather again tonight for the eighth debate of the year and the first held in the West. 
The Las Vegas debate, sponsored by and broadcast on CNN, is likely to shine a bright spotlight on Herman Cain, the ex-pizza mogul whose "9-9-9" tax plan has helped rocket him to the top of the recent polls.
But the live, 90-minute event will also be a test of whether Rick Perry can regain his footing after several disappointing debate performances. And it will offer Michele Bachmann another chance to re-emerge as a leader in the contest.
For Mitt Romney, the current front-runner, the debate holds political danger if he fails to meet the expectations he has set in past debates, or if he stumbles under criticism from his rivals.

Mitt Romney and Gov. Rick Perry in one of many heated exchanges.
Romney's Texas Jobs Claim
In an attack on Gov. Rick Perry's record on job creation in Texas, Mitt Romney said 40 percent of the jobs created in the state while Mr. Perry was governor went to illegal immigrants.
Mr. Romney was citing a recent study by the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative-leaning think tank that favors reducing immigration over all. The study, by Steve Camarota, a demographer, found that 81 percent of the jobs created in Texas since 2007 went to recently arrived immigrant workers, including both legal and illegal immigrants. About half of the jobs, or about 40 percent, went to newly arrived illegal immigrants, the study found. 
Governor Perry's campaign says the study is false, arguing essentially that it could not be right because the numbers did not add up. A post on the Perry campaign Web site cites a statistic from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that Texas has gained 384,700 jobs since 2007. Department of Homeland Security figures cited by the campaign show that 60,000 illegal immigrants arrived in Texas in that period. That number does not amount to 40 percent of the new jobs. So, Mr. Perry says, the math and the study must be wrong.

Romney and Illegal Immigration
Governor Perry went on the offensive to attack Mr. Romney over an immigration controversy that came to light when Mr. Romney campaigned for president in 2008.
"You hired illegals in your home and you knew about it for a year," Mr. Perry said. 
He said that a year after Mr. Romney first learned that illegal immigrants were taking care of his lawn, those immigrants were still working for him. Mr. Romney's claim that he is tough on illegal immigration is "the height of hypocrisy," Mr. Perry said.
Mr. Romney fired back, "I don't think I've ever hired an illegal immigrant in my life." He gave a long explanation: when he discovered that his landscaping company had sent illegal immigrants to his home for the second time, he fired the company and told the illegal immigrants working at his house to leave.
It isn't clear that Mr. Romney ever knew directly that his landscaping company was using illegal immigrants to tend his lawn. But the episode was embarrassing for Mr. Romney, and it is still awkward now.
The Boston Globe first reported in December 2006 that Mr. Romney was employing a lawn care company that regularly hired illegal immigrants. Mr. Romney said he told an illegal immigrant working on his property to leave but continued to use the same lawn service company. A year later, The Globe reported that the service had once again sent illegal immigrants to Mr. Romney's house in Belmont, Mass. On the same day as the Globe report was published, Mr. Romney fired the company.
At that time, Mr. Romney said he had continued to use the same company because the company had guaranteed that it would not hire any illegal immigrants.
In Tuesday's debate, Mr. Romney said he would combat illegal immigration by adopting a nationwide electronic program to verify the immigration status of all new hires.

Border Fence
Is it possible to build a fence along the entire 2,000-mile United States-Mexico border? And if it is, is it worth the cost and would it effectively secure the border? 
Most of the candidates are competing to outdo one another on their support for building a fence -- as Mrs. Bachmann has put it -- "on every mile, every foot, every inch" of the border. Mr. Cain has called for an electrified fence that could "kill" people, a statement he later said was in jest, then later still said he meant.
Only Mr. Perry, whose state shares 1,200 miles of border, begs to differ about the sense of a hard fence on every mile, without conceding one iota of his own commitment to securing the border. 
It would take 10 to 15 years and cost $30 billion to build a complete fence, Mr. Perry said, arguing that a more cost-effective way is to build a fence in high-traffic areas and to use "boots on the ground" and Predator drones to monitor other areas. "That is the way to shut that border down," he said.
The Department of Homeland Security agrees with Mr. Perry. Officials say that a hard fence is prohibitively costly and inefficient, given that many stretches of the border are in remote mountain areas. To date, according to my colleague Julia Preston, who covers immigration, the department has completed about 650 miles of hard fence, mostly in cities and at points of heavy illegal crossings. Most of that work was done under the Bush administration.
A report in February by the Government Accountability Office found that border authorities, by their own measure, had "operational control" of only 873 miles, or 43 percent, of the border.
Homeland security officials responded that they could either patrol or monitor 81 percent of the border, and that the remaining areas were hostile terrain where illegal crossings are rare.
The Obama administration, with the support of Border Patrol officials, has focused on surveillance technology, equipping the Border Patrol with dozens of fixed remote surveillance systems for busy crossing points and mobile surveillance units for mountainous terrain.
The Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank that seeks to lower immigration, wants more border security but does not favor a fence across the entire border.
(Incidentally, apprehensions by the Border Patrol dropped to 448,000 in 2010, the lowest number since 1972, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The decline under the Obama administration accelerated a drop in border apprehensions that began under President George W. Bush. Since 2005, apprehensions at the Mexican border are down 61 percent.)
That is not stopping most of the Republican candidates from calling for a mile-by-mile fence. Over the weekend, Mrs. Bachmann raised her own bid, signing a pledge to build a "double fence" along the border.
- 
A Model Plan? 
Another Republican presidential debate, another attack on Mitt Romney for the health care plan that was the centerpiece of his tenure as Massachusetts governor but has since emerged as the most frequent point of attack for his Republican rivals.
Tonight the attack came from Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who criticized Mr. Romney for the plan and said it was the basis of President Obama's health care plan, more commonly known among Republicans as "Obamacare."
Mr. Romney punched back, suggesting that he never thought his plan would or should be a model for a national program to expand health insurance.
Mr. Romney said that during the 2008 campaign, "I was asked: 'Is this something that you would have the whole nation do?' And I said: 'No; this is something that was crafted for Massachusetts. It would be wrong to adopt this as a nation.' "
Not exactly. Mr. Romney has repeatedly suggested that he believed that the Massachusetts program -- and in particular its mandate for individuals to purchase health insurance plans -- would be a good model for the rest of the country.
During an appearance on "Meet the Press" in December 2007, Mr. Romney said that while he did believed that every state would face different circumstances, his program was "a good model for other states."
"I think it's a good model for other states. Maybe not every state but most, and so what I'd do at the federal level is give every state the same kind of flexibility we got from the federal government as well as some carrots and sticks to actually get all their citizens insured. And I think a lot of states will choose what we did."
Mr. Romney added that he would not want a policy that would force other states to adopt the Massachusetts model -- which Mr. Obama's health care bill, in some sense, does -- but suggested that other states should consider the mandate.
"So if a state chose a mandate, it wouldn't bother you?" asked the host, Tim Russert.
"I'd think it's a terrific idea," Mr. Romney answered. "I think you're going to find when it's all said and done, after all these states that are the laboratories of democracy get their chance to try their own plans, those who follow the path that we pursued will find it's the best path, and we'll end up with a nation that's taken a mandate approach."

A Deeper Look at 9-9-9
Herman Cain said his much-discussed "9-9-9" plan "does not raise taxes on those that are making the least. It's simply not true."
But that is exactly what a growing number of independent analysts have concluded.
The plan calls for deep cuts in the existing federal taxes on individual and corporate income, both of which would be reduced to a flat rate of 9 percent from a system of tiered rates that run above 30 percent for the highest earners. Mr. Cain then proposes the addition of a 9 percent tax on sales.
Analysts say Mr. Cain's plan would raise taxes for lower-income families, while reducing the taxes paid by higher-income families.
"Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan is a terrific example of fiscal hocus-pocus," Edward D. Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California, writes in a coming analysis of the plan for the trade journal Tax Notes. "It is presented as a low-tax panacea, but it actually would raise the tax bills of many Americans very substantially."
Professor Kleinbard estimated that a family with $120,000 in 2010 income would have paid $541 less in federal taxes under Mr. Cain's plan. A family that earned $50,000, by contrast, would have paid $4,800 more.
The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institute, concluded that the plan amounted to a 25.38 percent national sales tax. Flat sales taxes fall more heavily on lower-income families, siphoning off a much larger share of their total income.
It is also important to note that the 9-9-9 plan is only a transitional stage in Mr. Cain's broader plan to overhaul federal taxation. He has proposed the ultimate elimination of income taxes, in favor of a flat 30 percent sales tax.

HEADLINE: Protests Are a Payday for Security Firms

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
They call when they make the Forbes 400 list. They call when annual hedge fund rankings appear, when their names are mentioned on CNBC and when their children travel abroad. And, these days, they call when protesters camped in Lower Manhattan grow uncomfortable with the idea of their existence.
The ultra-rich bankers, hedge fund managers and private equity executives of New York City have long enlisted private security firms to help safeguard them and their wealth. But as the mood on Main Street turns increasingly hostile, New York's financial titans are cranking their security measures up to 11. For the high-end security firms that provide the moneyed elite with specialty services like around-the-clock bodyguards and elaborate home security systems, Occupy Wall Street has been a stimulus package all its own.
''We expect to more than double our revenue in New York this year,'' said Paul M. Viollis, a co-founder of Risk Control Strategies, a firm that protects some of the top executives on Wall Street.
Another company, Insite Security, has gotten dozens of calls since the protests began and expects to increase its revenue at least 40 percent this year, according to Christopher Falkenberg, its chief executive. (In accordance with the industry's code of secrecy, none of the security experts interviewed for this article provided client names.) 
Executive protection, as the guard-the-rich industry is known, got an initial jolt from the financial crisis of 2008. Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, got permission from a local review board to build a six-foot-high security gate outside his Hamptons house in April 2008, the month after Bear Stearns collapsed. Lehman Brothers, another crisis casualty, had a bomb-sniffing Labrador retriever named Bella stationed at its headquarters. And in 2010, when the activist group the Yes Men encouraged its supporters to perform citizens' arrests on John A. Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager, Mr. Paulson's firm hired additional security guards to combat the threat, according to a person with knowledge of the decision. A spokesman for Mr. Paulson declined to comment.
But the most recent round of Main Street rage has raised the risk factor. Last week, when protesters picketed the homes of some of Manhattan's richest residents, they made a stop at Mr. Paulson's mansion, as well as the homes of Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and Stephen A. Schwarzman, the billionaire co-founder of the Blackstone Group. One sign carried by protesters depicted Mr. Blankfein's severed head on a stake.
Scenes like these are causing executives to supplement their internal security teams with the services of outside specialty firms. A chief financial officer of a major bank recently called Risk Control Strategies with the news that he had received a menacing e-mail from an anonymous sender.
''You filled your pockets, and now I'm going to fill mine, starting with your family,'' the e-mail said, according to Mr. Viollis. The firm quickly dispatched a pair of guards to the client's house.
Another client, a C-suite executive at a large Wall Street firm, recently asked Mr. Viollis to send undercover agents to Zuccotti Park to find out if the protesters were planning to harm him or his colleagues. (Mr. Viollis said he would probably decline the request.)
But as versions of Occupy Wall Street fan out across the country, even executives who aren't recognizable to the general public are worried.
''If Zuccotti Park is tapping into resentment against wealthy people, that really changes the calculus,'' said Mr. Falkenberg, a former Secret Service agent. ''It's not that far of a connection between what's happening now in that park and a more focused, research-based kind of attack.''
The executive protection industry has existed as long as there have been executives, but it got a boost in 2003, when Edward S. Lampert, a Greenwich hedge fund manager, was kidnapped by four men on his way to his car. The men stuffed the billionaire into a Ford Expedition at gunpoint, took him to a motel and tied him up in the bathroom for two days. (Mr. Lampert survived the incident, and his kidnappers were caught and convicted.)
These days, bankers and hedge fund managers are willing to spend millions of dollars to avoid enduring anything similar.
''Typically, what happens is that these guys wake up one day, look around, and say, 'Wow, I've really provided some great benefits for my family, and boy, it looks like I've also introduced a modicum of risk,' '' said Mr. Viollis. ''Then they call me.''
The first step in securing an executive is building what is known as a risk profile. Security experts -- typically retired detectives, C.I.A. agents and military veterans -- conduct surveillance on a client and pick out every point of vulnerability. Does she eat at the same deli every Wednesday? Does he park his car in a spot labeled with his name? Are his children's Facebook profiles filled with photos of the family's vacation house? They then present the client with a list of the habits that could present an opportunity for thieves or kidnappers.
''People think security is having a 300-pound bald guy named Tiny following you,'' Mr. Falkenberg said. ''In reality, it's a lot more complicated than that.''
After the risk profile is complete, firms begin fortifying the client's life, starting at home, using a cornucopia of high-tech gadgets. There are biometric door locks that read palm prints, infrared cameras that can spot potential intruders in total darkness and in-ground sensors that can detect motion around a home's perimeter and immediately transmit data to a dispatcher.
''Now, instead of having a retired cop sitting in the garage on Maiden Lane, you have a whole command center at your disposal,'' said Robert S. Tucker, the chief executive of T.& M. Protection.
International travel, a staple of bank executive life, is among the biggest security hazards. In the downtown offices of Risk Control Strategies, a wall-mounted computer monitor displays a map of the world overlaid with blinking icons denoting security risks. There is an icon for hazardous materials, an icon for riots and civil disobedience and an icon indicating instances of cyber-hacking. Traveling executives are often given profiles of dangerous neighborhoods, and some are equipped with armored town cars.
As anxiety has rippled through the gilded class, a cottage industry has sprouted to protect high-net-worth individuals from every threat imaginable. There are companies that sell kidnapping insurance, companies that will run background checks on domestic staff members, companies that will replace glass windows with bulletproof polycarbonate panels and companies that will build safe rooms with steel-fortified walls.
Many of the latest technological advances in the executive protection industry are ''technical surveillance countermeasures,'' sensors that can sweep homes, offices, hotel rooms and cars for electronic spying devices. Mr. Viollis estimates that his business in that area has tripled this year, largely because of an influx of hedge fund managers who believe they may be the targets of an investigation and financial executives worried about the theft of trade secrets by competitors.
All these provisions come at a startling cost. Just one highly trained bodyguard -- ''personal protection professional,'' in the industry parlance -- can run $200 an hour, and a full-time driver can cost an executive $150,000 per year. A thorough sweep for surveillance can cost $1.25 per square foot of space and a full-home surveillance system can run anywhere from $100,000 to $1.5 million.
Even where paranoia is a cardinal virtue, there are those who seem to take caution too far. One executive contacted Insite requesting help planning his escape from the United States in the event the federal government was overthrown, said Howard A. Shapiro, Insite's chief technology officer. The executive wanted to know how much gold to keep on hand and how to escape the United States by submarine in the event of a major incident.
''He was spending the majority of his wealth on security,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''We don't encourage that.''
But when personalized security programs work, they can turn life-threatening situations into mere blips on the radar.
Late last year, Gertrude Boyle, the 86-year-old chairwoman of Columbia Sportswear, came home to find a man waiting in her driveway, asking her to sign a book for him. When Ms. Boyle refused, the man pulled a gun and demanded a large ransom payment. Ms. Boyle calmly told the gunman she had to disable her home security system before letting him into her house, and surreptitiously pressed a panic button that summoned the police. Officers arrived within minutes, and Ms. Boyle escaped unharmed.
In a turbulent age for Wall Street's power brokers, that kind of security has no price tag. ''You can never protect someone 100 percent,'' said Mr. Viollis, his face illuminated by the glowing icons on the global threat map in his office. ''But you can get close.''

HEADLINE: Lawsuit Seeks Release of Police Commissioner's Schedule

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
A civil liberties group filed a lawsuit on Tuesday seeking to force the New York Police Department to release the daily schedules of Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly.
The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan by the New York Civil Liberties Union, characterized Mr. Kelly as ''the most important appointed'' official in city government, and said that details of whom he meets with remained largely shrouded in secrecy. 
Other high-placed officials, including the president, publicly disclose portions of their schedules, the suit said, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo last month began posting a detailed version of his daily schedules online.
''There is no good reason for Commissioner Kelly to withhold this information from the public,'' Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the civil liberties group, said in a statement. ''If it's safe for the leader of the country to disclose his schedule, then it's safe for the N.Y.P.D. commissioner to do the same.''
The 10-page lawsuit, which seeks details of Mr. Kelly's appointments dating to January 2002, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg tapped him for a second stint as police commissioner, was filed on behalf of Leonard Levitt, a former Newsday reporter who now writes a blog about law enforcement matters on his Web site, NYPD Confidential.
Mr. Levitt first requested copies of Mr. Kelly's schedule in February, under the state's Freedom of Information Law, four months after reporting last October on Mr. Kelly's habit of entertaining guests at the Harvard Club, in Midtown. Though some of his expenses at the club, including the annual dues, were paid for by the New York City Police Foundation, neither the foundation nor a spokesman for Mr. Kelly would say whom the commissioner had entertained at the club.
After the Police Department denied Mr. Levitt's request in May, the civil liberties group appealed it. But a month later, the department denied that appeal, ''asserting that disclosing Commissioner Kelly's schedule over the past decade would endanger both the commissioner and the people with whom he met,'' according to a statement from the civil liberties group.
But the lawsuit pointed out that certain information from Mr. Kelly's appointments could be redacted if it presented a security threat to Mr. Kelly or anyone else. ''The department has no authority, however, to categorically withhold the entire schedule,'' the suit said.
Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman, declined to comment on the suit.
Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, said there was no provision in the City Charter mandating the disclosure of city commissioners' public schedules. He said a police commissioner should get ''broad latitude'' in a post-terrorist era.
''The police commissioner of New York City occupies a special, appointed position,'' Mr. Moss said. ''He's our secretary of defense, head of the C.I.A. and, I would say, chief architect rolled into one. He may be the one person who we should treat with some respect on his privacy.''
Invoking the television series ''24,'' Mr. Moss added of Mr. Kelly, ''He's as close as we come to Jack Bauer.''

HEADLINE: Bank Shares Lift Wall Street in a Turnaround

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Financial stocks propelled Wall Street higher on Tuesday as more banks and companies in other industries reported quarterly results, providing investors with fresh insight into the outlook for the global economy.
Bank stocks rose more than 4 percent by the close of the trading session, backtracking on the steep losses incurred on Monday that helped send the main stock indexes back into negative territory for the year.
By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.58 percent, or 180.05 points, at 11,577.05. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed more than 2 percent, or 24.52 points, to 1,225.38, while the Nasdaq composite index was up by 1.6 percent at 2,657.43. 
The Dow finished fractionally below where it started the year, and the Nasdaq was 0.17 percent higher for the year to date.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 6/32, to 99 18/32. The yield rose to 2.18 percent, from 2.16 percent late Monday.
''Every day does not have to follow exactly the pattern of a yo-yo, but sometimes that is what happens,'' said Lawrence Creatura, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. ''Yesterday's downdraft was large, and it is reasonable to have investors looking for bargains today.''
Some analysts said the late-day gains might be attributed to exchange-traded funds. A Guardian newspaper report, quoting unidentified diplomats, saying that France and Germany had agreed on a plan to bolster Europe's rescue fund could also have inspired such a reaction. That was ''entirely plausible,'' said Brian Gendreau, market strategist for the Cetera Financial Group. He and others noted that the market was highly volatile.
''Markets buy the rumor,'' Eric Viloria, a senior currency strategist at Forex.com, said in a research note that referred to the report. ''Today's price action highlights how sensitive the markets are to headlines.''
Investors sifted through news about France, after Moody's Investors Service said the country's AAA credit rating was at risk. It was the latest headline to remind investors of the challenges facing Europe.
''Europe continues to be the No. 1 negative,'' said Nick Kalivas, vice president for financial research at MF Global. ''We just are not seeing any signs of resolution there.'' He said he believed that the comments about France were keeping buyers cautious.
The debt crisis could also have an impact on China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States. New data showed that growth in China in the third quarter had slowed slightly to 9.1 percent. But Mr. Kalivas said he suspected the data could be ''a little bit supportive'' of the markets because industrial production and retail sales were firm.
Although the markets have been beset by volatility in recent months, buffeted largely by the instability related to the debt crisis in Europe, corporate results trickling out are a major factor giving investors direction.
Analysts believed investors were studying corporate profits for direction, specifically with banks, although some believed investors were already trading them at a discount.
''The rumor mill is so rampant,'' said Michael A. Mullaney, vice president at the Fiduciary Trust Company. ''The bottom line is, the one thing I have been mildly encouraged about, is the earnings reports have been pretty good, so on average that hopefully lends a degree of support for the market.''
Goldman Sachs reported on Tuesday that it had a loss of $428 million in the quarter, compared with a $1.7 billion profit a year ago. Bank of America said it had a $6.2 billion profit, and revenue was up 6.6 percent.
Bank of America was up more than 10 percent at $6.64 and Goldman rose 5.5 percent to $102.25.
Investors have been dissecting the fine print of reports for a glimpse into the future of the economy.
''We are in earnings season now, and managements' forward-looking comments are likely to dominate other factors,'' Mr. Creatura said. ''Today, because of some strong announcements, we are seeing a nice bid to the markets.''
The EMC Corporation, for example, said it expected global information technology spending to grow. It rose 5.8 percent to $23.99 after reporting a 28 percent rise in third-quarter earnings. VMware Inc. rose 8.2 percent, to $96.86, after it said net income more than doubled.
But Mr. Creatura said more volatility could be in store for banks, depending on what happened in Europe.

HEADLINE: At the Protests, The Message Lacks a Melody

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
''Every successful movement has a soundtrack,'' the songwriter Tom Morello told reporters after he had tried to fire up the crowd at the Occupy Wall Street Protest last week with a Woody Guthrie tune and one of his own labor songs.
Perhaps he is right, but the protesters in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan have yet to find an anthem. Nor is the rest of the country humming songs about hard times. So far, musicians living through the biggest economic disaster since the Great Depression have filled the airwaves with songs about dancing, not the worries of working people.
Where have all the protest songs gone?
To be sure, a handful of songwriters are tackling the issue. Ry Cooder, the blues and rock guitarist known for his exploration of roots music, lambastes bankers and conservatives in his latest album, ''Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down'' (Nonesuch). Similarly, Mr. Morello, who began his career as the guitarist and chief ideologue for the band Rage Against the Machine, makes an unapologetic call for leftist revolution in his new album, ''World Wide Rebel Songs'' (New West Records). 
On Tuesday Everlast, a Los Angeles songwriter who mixes rap and country blues, released an album, ''Songs of the Ungrateful Living'' (Martyr/EMI), with the song ''I Get By,'' a brooding meditation on the problems of the working-class people facing unemployment and foreclosures in today's economy. ''I voted for change, and it's kind of strange/now it's all I got in my pocket,'' he sings on the track.
These recent releases add to a trickle of politically charged songs since the banking crisis precipitated the economic downturn. In 2009 Justin Sane of the punk band Anti-Flag wrote ''The Economy Is Suffering, Let it Die,'' a scathing indictment of the bank bailout. The following year the soul singer Aloe Blacc captured the heartbreak of unemployment in his single ''I Need a Dollar.''
Yet none of these songs have been big hits, and none are likely to have the impact that a song like Bob Dylan's ''Blowin' in the Wind'' had in the early 1960s.
The scarcity of songs about the economic disaster stands in contrast to the flurry of pop songs in the mid-2000s blaming President George W. Bush's foreign policy for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Antiwar songs came not only from stalwarts like R.E.M. and Neil Young but also from younger performers like Green Day, Bright Eyes and Pink.
''What I have noticed is that the financial crisis has been a far more difficult topic for songwriters to wrestle with,'' said Dorian Lynskey, the British critic and the author of ''33 Revolutions Per Minute'' (Ecco/HarperCollins), a recently published history of protest music. ''What do you say about a financial crisis where the villains are obscure and the solutions are obscure. That's a challenge.''
Mr. Lynskey and other experts said that leftist protest music tended to die down when a Democrat was in the White House.
''A Darth Vader-like president makes a great target,'' Mr. Morello said. ''One of the reasons the air has gone out of the balloon of protest songwriting is people hung their hopes on the Obama administration.''
Alexander Shashko, who teaches a music history course at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, said that protest songs historically derived power from the social or political movements that adopted them, and that the main political movement to rise from the economic crash had been the Tea Party, the conservative antitax group. It has attracted the support of the country artist Hank Williams Jr., who put out a song in 2009 about Mr. Obama's election that stated flatly: ''I'll keep the U.S.A., and y'all can keep the change.''
But on the left, labor unions have been in retreat, unable to mobilize behind a common cause. And with no draft, opposition to the wars abroad has never reached the fever pitch of the 1960s either.
''When protest music exists without an effective social or political movement, its resonance is limited or scattershot,'' Mr. Shashko said.
The lack of a coherent message on the left has been evident at the Wall Street protest. ''I have not heard a single song that sums up what we are trying to do here,'' said Martian Hughes, a 24-year-old college student, after Mr. Morello's performance. ''Nor have I heard a single message.''
The music at the protest has been all over the map, from 1960s folk to erudite rap to contemporary punk. Every day a circle of drummers plays for hours on end. One day the folk singer Jeff Mangum played, followed by Michael Franti, the reggae and rap artist, who performed his 2006 call for revolution, ''Yell Fire.''
Peter Yarrow, of the 1960s folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary, said the music industry discouraged artists from taking a political stand more than it did in the 1960s.
''The bean counters took over,'' he said. ''The bottom line is music has been destroyed by the all-mighty dollar.''
Justin Sane, the lead singer of Anti-Flag, said the consolidation of the major record labels and the concentration of radio stations in the hands of a few companies had made it harder for songwriters who had anti-establishment messages to get record deals. ''I don't believe that the people who control the purse strings in the mainstream of music,'' he said, were pursuing those acts.
At the same time, some major acts, like U2 and Radiohead, have backed off writing political songs and instead are using their concerts and tours to promote causes.
The nature of protest has changed as well. Traditional rallies, songs and speeches are less important than the constant electronic conversation over the Web.
''In the 1960s music was the social media of the day,'' said Ralph F. Young, a professor of history at Temple University, who has written a book on dissent in America. ''Today protestors have Facebook and Twitter to disseminate their message.''
Mr. Lynskey said younger audiences tended to be impatient with political preaching from their musicians. In the 1960s, he pointed out, most rock bands and many R&B singers took a crack at social commentary. The Rolling Stones recorded ''Street Fighting Man,'' and Sam Cooke ''A Change Is Gonna Come.''
In recent years the songwriters taking on political issues have tended to be older musicians, like Mr. Cooder, 64, who regard political statements as a natural part of popular music; or musicians like Justin Sane, 37, and Mr. Morello, 47, who have made protest music an aesthetic choice.
Justin Sane often sounds as if he were trying to revive the Clash in his songs. Mr. Morello, on his solo albums, has gone further back, embracing the role of folk singers like Guthrie and Pete Seeger. He has played scores of labor rallies in recent years, and at Zuccotti Park he wore a baseball cap with the Industrial Workers of the World's symbol on it.
Mr. Cooder said he also felt a deep connection with Guthrie. It was the gift of several Guthrie records when he was 5 that set him on the path to becoming a musician, he said. He covered several Guthrie tunes on his early albums, and Guthrie was in his mind when he started writing topical songs in 2007, spurred by stories of returning soldiers who received inadequate care.
Then came the mortgage crisis, the Wall Street bailout and the forest of foreclosure signs across California, the skyrocketing unemployment and the anti-immigrant backlash among conservative politicians.
''What else can you do but respond to this?'' he said. ''Otherwise they paint you into a corner, you get angry, and it's very bad for your mental health.''

HEADLINE: Insurers See an Opening in Commercial Mortgages

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
Over the past several months, the commercial mortgage market has been volatile, plagued by weak investor appetite, wary lenders and warnings by ratings agencies of increasing risk. But one bright spot is emerging, as life insurance companies have taken advantage of the lull to become major lenders.
In the second quarter of this year, the life insurance industry underwrote $15.7 billion in new commercial mortgages -- the largest volume on record since the American Council of Life Insurers began tracking the number in 1965. This represents a doubling of the volume of mortgages underwritten in the first quarter and a nearly 26 percent increase over the second-highest number on record, $12.5 billion, reached in the fourth quarter of 2005.
A lack of activity from investment banks has opened the door for life insurers. Pummeled by a weak economy, many Wall Street banks, traditionally the largest commercial mortgage lenders, have gone quiet, leaving little competition for life insurers.
''It is as if these guys died and went to heaven,'' said Lawrence J. Longua, a clinical associate professor at the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University. ''Life insurance companies are pretty much the only game in town.'' 
Life insurers are typically conservative, favoring high-quality borrowers and trophy properties, and keeping the bulk of their loans on their balance sheets. Investment banks, on the other hand, pool most of their mortgages and issue bonds against these loans. This allows the banks to transfer the risk off their balance sheets, enabling them to underwrite more, and riskier, loans.
Investment banks typically dwarf life insurance companies. Banks and savings institutions, for example, held 33.4 percent of the $2.4 trillion of total outstanding commercial real estate debt as of the second quarter, compared with the 12.8 percent held by life insurance companies, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. But while the total amount of commercial mortgages increased 0.1 percent in the second quarter over the previous quarter, the amount held by life insurers increased 1.5 percent.
''Now is a good time to be a first-mortgage lender,'' said Robert R. Merck, a senior managing director and the head of real estate investments for Metropolitan Life.
MetLife originated $8 billion in real estate loans last year and has already lent that amount in the first three quarters of this year. The company recently financed two loans to a joint venture that includes General Growth Properties, the mall company.
''There is less competition,'' Mr. Merck said, ''which has allowed lenders like ourselves to put a lot of very good loans on the books for properties that meet our guidelines.''
There are several reasons that banks have been driven to the sidelines, including a difficult economic environment and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. The market for bonds backed by mortgages has also been weak, and this summer it hit a speed bump when Standard & Poor's refused to issue a rating on a commercial mortgage bond offering, spooking the investment community. As a result, experts now estimate that what had been expected to be a $50 billion market this year will instead amount to less than $35 billion.
''It was a very optimistic winter and spring, then we turned 180 degrees and it has been nothing but negative,'' said Manus Clancy, a managing director at Trepp, a commercial mortgage information provider. ''We have seen a vastly different mentality than what we saw in late May.''
Many insurers have responded by increasing their 2011 mortgage allocations. ''In 2007 through 2009, these companies sold off a lot of their mortgages,'' said Richard D. Jones, a co-chairman of the finance and real estate practice groups at the law firm Dechert, ''so now they are trying to rebalance their portfolios.''
For borrowers, life insurance companies can offer a price advantage over investment banks, experts said. Because banks pool their loans into bonds, they have to satisfy skittish bond buyers by offering them higher rates. The banks then pass on these higher rates to the borrower. But because most life insurers do not pool their loans into bonds, they can offer lower rates.
''It is a temporary consequence of a very fractured market,'' Mr. Jones said. ''Right now, the insurance companies are eating Wall Street's lunch. If a life company wants to get a deal done, there is nothing anyone can do to compete with them.''
Also, life insurers' mortgages are performing comparatively well. Some 99.6 percent of mortgages held by life insurance companies were in good standing as of the end of last year, according to Fitch Ratings. This is in large part because of their conservative lending approach and their ''active management'' of mortgage portfolios, Fitch said in a recent report.
Coming off such a strong performance, some life insurers are now exploring entering the mortgage bond market, an arena traditionally dominated by investment banks. Some insurers are becoming partners with banks to offer mortgage bond products. Under the agreements, the life insurers find the borrowers and originate the loans, and the banks pool those loans into bonds to sell. In this way, the life insurers earn fees for sourcing and originating the loans and the investment banks profit from selling mortgage bonds.
Life insurers want to team up with banks rather than go it alone because it allows them to be involved in more real estate lending without exceeding their asset guidelines. Typically, life insurers allocate less than 15 percent of their total assets to real estate, but because these loans are not on their balance sheets, they can be involved without bumping against these levels.
''Life insurance companies have risk management limits, but their relationships and their origination capabilities often exceed these limits, so this strategy of partnering with Wall Street makes sense,'' said Tad Philipp, the director of commercial real estate research at Moody's Investors Service. Offering mortgage bonds ''also helps broaden the suite of loans they can offer borrowers,'' he said.
Wall Street banks also do not want to allocate the resources to originate loans. ''It is expensive to originate and service a loan, but we already have a team of 45 who this is all they do,'' said Christine Hurtsellers, the chief investment officer for fixed income and proprietary investments at ING Investment Management, which is in talks to create a partnership with a bank.
This summer, the Prudential Mortgage Capital Company, a unit of Prudential Financial, announced it would join with Perella Weinberg Partners to create such a venture.
''There is only so much balance sheet capacity for the life insurance companies,'' said David Twardock, the president of Prudential Mortgage Capital, ''and there needs to be other loan products in the market that provide long-term fixed-rate financing.''
If the life insurance teams work with banks, that could help broaden the commercial mortgage market, Ms. Hurtsellers said. ING estimates that in the next year and a half, about $60 billion in commercial mortgage bonds are maturing, ''so given that wave, these partnerships can help refinance the loans, extend them and just help generally solve the problem.''

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: Affirmative Action

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''College Diversity Nears Its Last Stand'' (Sunday Review, Oct. 16) offers insight into the legal status of race-based affirmative action in college admissions. Given the good possibility that the Supreme Court will further limit that form of affirmative action, we should look to an alternative approach: considering economic status instead of race. 
Addressing racial injustice directly is difficult and has inspired a strong backlash in the culture wars. Using means as a factor offers many of the same advantages -- economic circumstances correlate closely with race -- without the backlash.
Several public universities in states like California, Washington and Florida that have banned race-based affirmative action are already using means as a factor in their admissions decisions. Like traditional affirmative action, giving special consideration to socioeconomic disadvantages can enhance both individual opportunity and campus diversity. Of course, ending affirmative action has reduced racial diversity in many cases.
But considering race without means might benefit wealthier members of a minority group -- those who are already the most competitive -- which seems unfair and not in keeping with the goals of affirmative action. We should examine whether making economic diversity a priority in college admissions might not offer a better way to address both economic and racial imbalances.

HEADLINE: There's the Wrong Way and His Way

BYLINE: By JEFF GORDINIER

 BODY:
MADISON, Conn.
WHEN Jacques Pepin slices a baguette, there is a distinct sound that seems to be imbued with six decades of experience in the kitchen.
The knife goes through, and you hear a little schloomp.
By contrast, many amateur cooks keep their knives far too dull, he said, and have a habit of crunching the blade downward on the crust, like a handheld cider press, which only squishes the white interior of a baguette into a fluff-less layer.
''Instead of going down and forward, people press down like this,'' Mr. Pepin said, standing at his kitchen counter last week. ''That way, you have to reinflate each piece with a little pump.'' Then he demonstrated a faulty technique that I recognized, with silent embarrassment, as my own.
I had traveled to Mr. Pepin's house in this Connecticut town, just east of New Haven, to talk about all the little details that go into the precision and majesty of that little schloomp. In other words, our topic was technique. 
This month marks the arrival of ''Essential Pepin'' (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $40), a cookbook that gathers together hit recipes from the arc of his career, from his childhood deprivation in France during World War II and his teenage apprenticeship in an array of French restaurants to his eventual ascent to fame as one of the first chefs who went on television to teach Americans to cook.
The book, his 26th, comes with an instructional DVD, coincides with the start of a new 26-episode TV series of the same name, and overflows with more than 700 recipes.
At the root of each one lies a deep-tissue database of skills that can't be picked up by flipping a few pages. In case anyone needed a reminder about the importance of technique, Mr. Pepin himself had hand-painted tiles in his kitchen with mantralike slogans: ''Great cooking favors the prepared hands'' was one. ''A great chef is first a great technician'' was another.
''All the great chefs I know -- Thomas Keller, Jean-Georges Vongerichten -- they are technicians first,'' said Mr. Pepin, 75.
Some of them, in fact, picked up that technique from Mr. Pepin himself. Tom Colicchio, the chef behind Craft and other restaurants, remembers receiving Mr. Pepin's standard-setting 1976 book, ''La Technique,'' as a gift from his father when he was a budding 15-year-old cook in New Jersey. ''It changed the way I looked at food and thought about food,'' Mr. Colicchio said. ''You felt like someone was looking over your shoulder teaching you how to do these techniques.''
He set aside books full of recipes and focused on teaching his fingers the true tricks of the trade, honing his knife skills and simmering chicken bones to make stock. Looking back, Mr. Colicchio compares it to playing the guitar: learning to play one song doesn't mean you've mastered your instrument. ''Once you learn the technique, then you can be a creative cook,'' he said.
And yet in this age of exploding gastronomic consciousness, with entire television channels devoted to cooking, people seem all too eager to sidestep the rigorous monotony of basic manual dexterity in order to leap right into expressions of creativity.
That can grate on Mr. Pepin, especially when he finds himself teaching a room full of students who are restless to get ahead to the superstar-chef part. (He is a dean at the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan.)
''You have no choice as a professional chef: you have to repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat until it becomes part of yourself,'' he said. ''I certainly don't cook the same way I did 40 years ago, but the technique remains. And that's what the student needs to learn: the technique.''
To that end, my morning lesson with Mr. Pepin didn't begin with food. It began with knives. A cook should have knives, he said, that glide with quick, delicate ease through the skin and pulp of a ripe tomato.
''People always ask me, 'What is the best knife?' '' he said. ''I say, 'A sharp one.' ''
I thought about when I had last sharpened the knives in my kitchen. Then I remembered: never. In the course of two decades of delusionally casting myself as a decent cook, I had sharpened my knives not once.
If Mr. Pepin was appalled, he was too gracious to show it. He simply grabbed a sharpening steel and demonstrated how to run a knife blade along the wand, which he did without flicking his wrist. ''Like a conductor,'' he said. ''You have to keep the angle constant.''
That angle needs to be about 20 or 30 degrees in relation to the steel. You can pull the knife toward you, across the steel, or away from you, but the point is to strive for uniformity.
For knives that are in truly sorry shape, one needs a sharpening stone. He placed one atop the counter and smeared it with some mineral oil. Then he began to run the blade of a knife along the oiled stone.
The motion was not at all like, say, slicing steak. Mr. Pepin drew the edge across the stone in a single long sweep, repeated over and over, as though he were skimming the oil off the surface.
Now and then, he would dab it with a rag to wipe away the black residue. ''I have to keep it clean, otherwise the stone won't be abrasive anymore,'' he said. ''If I spend 15 or 20 minutes here, I will create a new edge. If the knife's in really bad shape, that's what you do.''
His knife was in very good shape.
To prove it, Mr. Pepin began, with great alacrity and elan, to cut things. There was that schloomp through the bread. He minced some onion. He peeled the skin of a tomato and made a rose out of it.
''For me, what I mean by technique is almost what you might call a sleight of hand,'' he said.
Famously averse to waste, Mr. Pepin skinned an apple and left the peel on the cutting board. ''You can dry that out in the oven and make tea,'' he said. ''It's supposed to be good for your kidneys. We don't throw anything out.''
What I tend to waste in my home kitchen is time. Just peeling and mincing a clove of garlic seems to eat up a month. But Mr. Pepin's technique with garlic was a small miracle of deftness and economy.
He placed a whole head of garlic on his cutting board, upside-down, and held it at a slight angle. He popped it hard with the base of his palm. The cloves went scattering like marbles. He sliced off the stem of one (''that will make it much easier to peel,'' he said) and smashed the clove under the flat blade of his knife. The skin slipped off like a silk robe.
He smashed the skinned garlic again, to release the essential oils, placing it under the flat of his knife and banging the blade with his hand. ''At this point, I can chop it,'' he said. He now did so by rocking the knife back and forth over the flattened clove. He kept the knife steady by placing the fingers of his left hand on top, guiding the knife up and down in a semicircle across the cutting board as if it were the hand of a clock.
''And I have puree of garlic,'' he said.
An omelet was next.
Now, if there is any realm of cooking in which I feel a twinge of confidence, even cockiness, it is eggs. When I scramble them, I bring tenderness and precise timing (and tons of butter) to the equation, and the results are consistently impressive.
Nevertheless, I was prepared to be shamed. I confessed to Pere Pepin that my concept of an omelet probably qualified as heresy: beat the eggs, pour them into a hot pan, let them set and brown a bit, and then fold the flaps over a few random gobs of goat cheese.
Mr. Pepin's brown eyes took pity on me. ''There's nothing wrong with that,'' he said kindly. ''Sometimes I'm in the mood for that type of omelet.''
It's just not really a French omelet, that's all.
A proper French omelet is all about (you guessed it) technique. He grabbed a selection of backyard eggs provided by a neighbor and cracked three on his cutting board, not against the rim of the mixing bowl. (This, he said, prevents any bacteria on the surface of the shells from getting into the bowl.)
He dropped clumps of salt and pepper and chopped chives and tarragon into the bowl with the three eggs, and then, using a fork, he began to beat the eggs with notable brio. ''People tend to turn it like a wet mop,'' he said. ''You have to break the whites so that there aren't long strings of the white showing.''
He had agitated the eggs so fiercely that there was now a flotilla of bubbles on their surface.
That mixture went into a buttered nonstick pan; the heat was turned all the way up. What followed was a kind of Tilt-A-Whirl shaking and spinning and scraping of the pan, with Mr. Pepin keeping the eggs constantly in motion. He'd shake the pan like a tambourine, then stop and very quickly scrape off the papery edges of egg that would slosh up the sides, then shake again.
''I move this as much as I can, as fast as I can, so it's the smallest curd possible,'' he said. ''I don't let it brown on the top. Because browning will indicate that it has toughened the albumen.''
There was barely a second when the eggs sat idle in the pan, and that was the point. The omelet, when finished, was meant to have a consistent tenderness, inside and out.
He finished with a flourish that involved shifting the eggs to one side of the pan, tilting the pan up and using a fork to roll the still slightly wet mix into an oblong shape. His description of this, in ''Essential Pepin,'' sounds much easier than it looks: ''Roll the omelet by folding over one side and then the opposite side, and invert it onto a plate.''
Alas, in the kitchen, there's a lot more nuance to it than that. Even though I'd watched the whole thing up close, I knew I could not do what he had just done. But I knew I could master the next step.
''What you have to do now,'' he said, ''is eat that omelet with some salad.''
Recipe: Fines Herbes Omelet
Adapted from ''Essential Pepin'' by Jacques Pepin (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011)
Time: 15 minutes
10 large eggs, preferably organic
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup loosely packed chopped fresh herbs ( 1/4 cup parsley, and 1/4 cup combined tarragon, chives and chervil)
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 tablespoons unsalted butter.
1. Using a fork, beat the eggs, salt and pepper in a bowl until thoroughly mixed. Stir in the herbs.
2. Heat half the oil and butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over high heat. When the oil and butter are hot, add half the egg mixture. Stir continuously with a fork, shaking the pan, for about 2 minutes to create the smallest-possible curds. When most of the egg is solid, cook it without stirring for 10 seconds to create a thin skin on the underside.
3. Roll the omelet by folding over one side and then the opposite site, and invert it onto a plate. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make a second omelet. Cut each omelet in half.
Yield: 4 servings.
Recipe: Frisee With Croutons and Spicy Olives
Adapted from ''Essential Pepin'' by Jacques Pepin (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011)
Time: 15 minutes
1 1/2 cups 1-inch bread cubesf
1 tablespoon olive, canola or peanut oil
1 tablespoon spicy mustard
1 teaspoon crushed and finely chopped garlic
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 large or 2 small heads frisee, cut into 2-inch pieces (5 to 6 cups)
1/4 cup pitted spicy green olives
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained.
1. Drop bread cubes into a skillet and sprinkle oil over them. Toss gently and cook over high heat, tossing occasionally, until cubes are browned on all sides. Remove from skillet.
2. Mix mustard, garlic, salt, pepper and vinegar in a large serving bowl. Stir in oil.
3. Add the frisee, olives and sun-dried tomatoes to the bowl and toss thoroughly. Divide among 4 salad plates and sprinkle the croutons on top.
Yield: 4 servings.

IN THE DETAILS: Sharp knives are key in cooking, Jacques Pepin says. For knives in sorry shape, he uses a sharpening stone, which he coats with mineral oil. (Olive or vegetable oil will ruin the stone.) Then, he slides the edge of the blade along the stone in a series of long, steady sweeps, keeping the angle constant.
'SLEIGHT OF HAND': Mr. Pepin hits a head of garlic with the heel of his hand to separate the cloves, then pares off the stem ends so the skins slip off. He smashes the clove again before rocking the knife back and forth in a semicircle. Working close to the edge of the cutting board gives him better leverage on the knife.
THE SECRET TO EGGS: For a traditional French omelet, Mr. Pepin cracks the eggs on the cutting board, not the rim of the mixing bowl, then beats them energetically to blend the whites and yolks. He agitates the pan, keeping the eggs in motion so that they do not brown, even with the burners at full blast.

HEADLINE: Take Advantage of Tax Breaks Now, Experts Say

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
In Washington's war of words over economic and tax policy, Republicans and Democrats are aiming increasingly hostile barbs at each other that are leaving investors and business owners uncertain, even confused, about what tax and business strategies to pursue, according to financial advisers.
At the center of the politicians' disagreement is how to reduce the $1.3 trillion federal budget deficit. President Obama has called for a combination of spending cuts and tax increases for the wealthiest Americans, but Republican leaders in Congress adamantly oppose any tax increase, insisting on spending cuts alone. Because of this standoff, experts advise taking advantage of a variety of available tax breaks and incentives in the year's remaining weeks.
Mitchell A. Drossman, national director of wealth planning strategies at U.S. Trust in New York, said, ''Plan for what we know, not for what we think might happen.''
Under legislation enacted last December, the Bush-era tax cuts were extended for all Americans through 2012 with a top marginal rate for individuals of 35 percent. Long-term capital gains and most dividends are taxable at 15 percent, or not at all for people in the two lowest brackets on ordinary income, 10 percent and 15 percent. 
In 2013, the top rates are to revert to the pretax-cut levels of 36 percent and 39.6 percent for single filers with taxable income of more than $200,000, and for joint filers with more than $250,000. Long-term capital gains rates are to go to 20 percent, and a 3.8 percent Medicare tax on investment income is to begin.
Conceivably the law could change for 2012, and many expect changes to be enacted for 2013, perhaps in the lame-duck session after the 2012 election, but no one interviewed forecast changes for this year. Sidney Kess, a C.P.A and tax lawyer at Kostelanetz & Fink in New York, suggested accelerating income into 2011 if possible, perhaps requesting that a bonus be paid in December instead of January 2012.
Shareholders, considering their investment goals as well as tax consequences, may want to make some trades before year-end, he said. Up to $3,000 of net capital losses can be deducted from ordinary income. Owners of a closely held corporation may want to pay dividends this year, and some may be able to give bonuses in corporate stock before year-end to employees, including themselves, that will enjoy a 100 percent exclusion from capital gains tax.
People considering improving their homes to make them energy-efficient may be able to take advantage of federal and state tax credits, which reduce taxes dollar for dollar, he said, and those saving for children's educations should maximize contributions for 529 plans.
William R. Norwalk, a C.P.A. and partner in Sensiba San Filippo in the San Francisco Bay Area, had more advice for business owners. ''There are great opportunities in buying equipment'' this year, he said. ''Buy it and get an immediate 100 percent write-off.'' It is even possible to buy it, and if it results in a net operating loss, to carry the losses back two years, thus getting a refund on previous taxes paid. He also made these suggestions:
BAD DEBT DEDUCTION You can write off accounts receivable in the year in which they become uncollectible, but keep records showing that collection efforts have been exhausted.
RETIREMENT PLANS If profitable, review retirement plan options including profit-sharing plans. Consider matching contributions to employees. Some plans need to be in place by the last day of the fiscal year to enjoy the benefits. A profit-sharing contribution can be as much as $54,500 for an individual age 50 or older, compared with the 401(k) limit of $22,000.
GIFTING If planning to transfer ownership of a company interest or other property to adult children or valued employees, for example, consider doing it in 2011 or 2012 when up to $5 million is exempt from gift taxes. The exemption is to drop to $1 million in 2013. In addition, the highest estate and gift tax rate is scheduled to change from the current 35 percent rate to 55 percent in 2013. Mark Luscombe, a lawyer and principal federal tax analyst at CCH, a tax information service for professionals, cautioned investors to keep careful records of trades. A new reporting requirement goes into effect for 2011: brokers must report a client's basis in a stock or other asset when issuing a Form 1099 if they handled the purchase during 2011. He suggested looking at monthly statements now, and if an incorrect cost basis is shown, speaking with the broker to avert difficulties when filing 2011 returns.
Adam von Poblitz, a lawyer who is head of estate planning at Citi Private Bank, said personal gifts were ''a very powerful technique'' for reducing eventual estate taxes. Individuals can give up to $13,000 annually, or couples $26,000, to as many people as they like, not just family members, and incur no gift or estate tax consequences.
In addition, if tuition is paid directly to an educational institution, it does not count against the $13,000 limit, he said, and that often makes it possible for affluent grandparents to pay college costs for their grandchildren. A similar exclusion applies to medical costs if paid directly.
Evelyn Capassakis, a principal in PricewaterhouseCooper's personal financial services group, said one way for parents or grandparents to use part of that $13,000 personal gift exclusion was to set up a Roth I.R.A. for a student who had a summer or after-school job. Young people do not usually want to put money into such an account, she said, but as long as they have earned income, a relative or other adult may open one for them with the lesser of an amount equal to their earned income or up to $5,000. Roths are funded with after-tax money, so retirement distributions are tax-free, and the account can grow for many years. The money put in may even be withdrawn before retirement, perhaps to help pay the student's college expenses.
Another bit of advice from Ms. Capassakis: When going over 2011 financial records, look at insurance as well as investments and taxes. Many business owners have set up life insurance trusts to assure sufficient assets to meet estate tax obligations and still allow a family business to continue in operation, she said, but often they assumed a higher internal rate of return than is available in today's battered markets. It may be desirable to put in more money, if feasible.
Whatever tax strategies a person wishes to adopt, the time to act is now. After Dec. 31, there is little one can do to lower one's 2011 taxes except contribute to an I.R.A. or self-employed retirement plan.

HEADLINE: Behind Cain's Humor, a Question of Seriousness

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
It is safe to say that no other Republican on the campaign trail this year -- or ever -- has begun a speech with the phrase ''Awww, shucky ducky!'' the way Herman Cain did this year to the utter delight of his audience, which responded with wild applause.
Few candidates compare themselves to a flavor of ice cream, but Mr. Cain is intent on letting people know that he is like ''Haagen-Dazs black walnut,'' the point being that he is certainly not a flavor of the week because it ''tastes good all the time.''
Mr. Cain, who is black, has a penchant for gold ties because, as he explains with flirtatious flair, ''that color happens to look good against this beautiful dark skin.'' 
No candidate today is as daring as Herman Cain when it comes to charming an audience with silky silliness. His humor has distinguished him from his rivals, lending an air of folksiness and authenticity, a visceral contrast to his cooler, more staid rivals, especially Mitt Romney and President Obama.
Not all of Mr. Cain's attempts at comedy succeed, however. He tried to back away from what he called a joke about illegal immigration: that his policy would include an electrified border fence to kill anyone who tried to cross.
The moment illuminated one of the main concerns about Mr. Cain: He could have a hard time being taken seriously, at least to the degree that he uses sarcasm and laughs to divert attention from what for another candidate could be disqualifying gaps in knowledge and experience.
And while his casual style of racially inflected humor works to ingratiate him with mostly white audiences at campaign rallies, it has angered some black critics, who believe he uses age-old stereotypes.
He has no qualms, for instance, about playing off black cliches: should he become president, his Secret Service codename should be ''Cornbread,'' he wrote in his memoir, ''This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House.'' Mr. Cain's traveling aide, Nathan Naidu, already refers to him as Cornbread on the internal campaign schedule. (Why? Mr. Cain says he just loves cornbread.)
Those kinds of comments have drawn criticism from the likes of academics like Cornel West and entertainers like Harry Belafonte, who called Mr. Cain ''a bad apple.''
Of particular concern, some say, is how he seems to make a parody of black vernacular and culture.
''It makes the hair on my neck stand up,'' said Ulli K. Ryder, a visiting scholar at the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America at Brown University. ''The larger issue that a lot of people have, and I certainly have, is that he uses a certain kind of minstrelsy to play to white audiences. Referencing negative stereotypes in order to get heard to a white audience in the 21st century is really a problem.''
Take ''shucky ducky.''
''It's a nonsensical thing, down-home Southern black vernacular,'' Ms. Ryder said. ''It's coded as a black vernacular and it's uneducated black vernacular, so I find it really interesting that he would reference that, seeing as he is not that.''
Nonetheless, some strategists say that Mr. Cain has succeeded at being the everyman candidate, much like Mike Huckabee, whose clever quips helped him win the Iowa caucuses four years ago.
Mr. Cain ''has done a good job of positioning himself as a 'regular folks' kind of guy,'' said Steve Schmidt, a Republican consultant.
When a politician is trying to elicit laughs, the stakes are high.
''The drawback is that there is a line with humor, and every joke is a risk,'' said Landon Parvin, who has written humorous speeches for several Republican presidents. ''Often you don't know where that line is, and if you cross it, everything comes down on your head.''
''You want to project the humor of good-naturedness,'' Mr. Parvin added. ''That's what's important for politicians. Back in the Reagan White House, the easiest way to get on the evening news was to do a one-liner that had some substance to it. If you can crystallize your humorous point in a serious way, that's very effective.''
In contrast, in the days after Mr. Cain's comments about killing people with an electrified border fence, Mr. Cain felt the need to apologize over and again, which was ultimately a distraction from the substance of his larger immigration platform. ''Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa,'' he said.
That Mr. Cain, a former executive at Godfather's Pizza and Burger King who has never held public office, writes his own rules has been evident since the beginning of his campaign for the Republican nomination in the spring. Even as he has surged in popularity recently after winning the Florida straw poll and drawn increased interest for his ''9-9-9'' economic plan, which proposes a drastic reworking of the tax code, Mr. Cain has largely eschewed the campaign trail in favor of going on a tour to promote his memoir.
And he has hardly changed his style. At the Values Voter Summit last week in Washington, he received rave reviews. A snippet of the speech was long on attitude, short on policy prescriptions: ''Why are you running for president? To be president!'' Mr. Cain thundered in his booming baritone. ''What did I miss? I'm not running to go to Disneyland. America has problems. I'm a problem solver. That's why I'm running.'' Just then, someone in the crowd screamed, ''We love you, Herman Cain!''
He continued, ''My challenge to you is to stay informed because we are up against a lot of stupid people in America who do not have a clue.''
While ''stupid people in America'' might not have a pleasant ring to it, the phrase certainly elicited a great reaction from the crowd. (Presumably, the ''stupid people in America'' were not there.)
''That guy played the audience like a violin,'' said Dick Bott, an influential conservative radio broadcaster who owns 89 stations, mostly in the Midwest, who was in attendance. ''Herman Cain seems to be the kind of person who is comfortable with his own thoughts. He was expressing himself in a very major speech to that base of voters with the confidence that didn't require being careful about everything he said.''
''It's hard to imagine anyone who connects with an audience the way he does,'' Mr. Bott added.
In the fantasy debate of the humorist Mr. Parvin's dreams, the freewheeling Mr. Cain would be matched up with his stylistic antithesis, the professorial Mr. Obama.
''I know who would win on personality,'' Mr. Parvin said. ''Who would win on substance, that might be a different story.''

HEADLINE: Goldman Posts Loss, Signaling A Wall St. Shift

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
Goldman Sachs, once Wall Street's highest flier, has been grounded, and it does not bode well for the rest of the financial industry or the New York City economy that depends on it.
The bank, both envied and loathed for its ability to churn out huge profits year after year, reported a quarterly loss on Tuesday - its first since the financial crisis and only its second since going public in 1999.
The misstep by the financial leader speaks to what could be a more lasting shift on Wall Street, which has been steadily retrenching over the last 12 months. While protesters a few blocks away were denouncing greed and ''too big to fail'' banks, the institutions themselves were coming to grips with the current diminished reality. 
Banks, required by regulators to discontinue high-profit businesses like proprietary trading, reduce borrowings and hold more capital, may no longer be able to produce the supercharged earnings that were common before the financial crisis.
Although Wall Street has not changed in some significant ways - top executives are still receiving huge pay packages and its lobbyists continue to have sway in Washington - the industry is facing forces of change unlike anything since the Great Depression. Trading operations are muted. Risk-taking is tempered. And boring businesses are back in vogue.
''These firms are going back to the traditional investment banking model of the 1980s and early 1990s,'' said Tom Marsico of the mutual fund firm Marsico Capital Management, once a large owner of financial stocks who shed investments in Goldman and other banks this year.
Wall Street is feeling the pinch. Last week, JPMorgan Chase reported that earnings dropped by 4 percent in the latest period. Both Bank of America and Citigroup booked banner profits. But much of those results were attributed to one-time accounting gains, rather than improved fundamentals.
Goldman, which has been known for its prowess in trading, has found itself buffeted by the choppy markets and economic turmoil. While the firm posted decent results in equity trading and investment management, it lost nearly $3 billion on its investments in stocks and bonds, more than offsetting the pockets of strength.
New York, the nation's financial hub, is bracing for the fallout. Wall Street, which accounts for 14 percent of the state's tax revenue, is expected to lay off an additional 10,000 employees in the area by 2012, bringing total layoffs since 2008 to 32,000, according to a recent report by the New York State Comptroller. Each of those job losses could translate into nearly two additional positions eliminated in other industries, the comptroller estimated.
Investors have been anticipating the weakness for months. Since the beginning of the year, shares of financial companies have plummeted. While shares of Goldman jumped 5.5 percent on Tuesday, reflecting investor expectations and favorable developments in Europe, it was still down almost 40 percent for the year. Bank of America, which rose more than 10 percent the same day, stands at $6 a share, compared with $14 at the start of 2011.
The erosion of Wall Street's earning power is reflected in a closely watched barometer known as return on equity. It measures the amount of money that a company delivers on each share, an important indicator for investors.
In the last nine months, Goldman's return on equity fell to 3.7 percent on an annualized basis, down from 10.3 percent in 2010. Five years ago, it was 32.8 percent. Morgan Stanley, which is set to report earnings on Wednesday, posted return on equity of 8.5 percent last year, versus 23.5 percent in 2006.
Wall Street has proved resilient in the past. After the crisis - and the disappearance of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers - sweeping changes were predicted for the industry. A year later, the firms appeared to bounce back, reporting big profit gains and lavishing large bonuses on executives.
Whether the current weakness is short lived or the new normal will depend in part on how successful the industry's lobbying efforts in Washington. The banks already have gotten regulators to ease off some of the new restrictions.
Still, the industry's recent moves reflect more muted prospects.
To improve their profitability, banks have three main options: increase revenues, cut expenses and reduce the shareholder base. But the first method is not working at a time when earnings have been crimped by regulatory uncertainty and economic woes.
Goldman reported a loss of $428 million during the third quarter, compared with a $1.74 billion profit a year ago. The firm was punished by its holdings in stocks and bonds, losing $1.05 billion on its holdings in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a strategic investment the firm made in 2006. I.C.B.C. stock fell about 35 percent in the quarter, a paper loss that flowed through to Goldman's results.
Citigroup posted profit of $3.8 billion in the latest quarter, up from $2.2 billion in 2010. But 67 percent of its pre-tax earnings came from one-time gains, like reversing the reserves set aside to cover bad loans.
So the industry must rely on other means to improve returns in the current environment.
Cost-cutting has been a major focus across Wall Street. This summer, Goldman said that it would wring out $1.2 billion in costs from its operations by mid-2012, including eliminating about 1,000 jobs. Bank of America announced it would lay off 30,000 employees, as part of a wide-ranging plan to save $5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2013.
Goldman has also made share buybacks a priority, capitalizing on the weakness in the stock. In the third quarter, the firm bought back 18.1 million shares at a cost of $2.2 billion, one of the largest quarterly share reductions in its history.
In shrinking its shareholder base, Goldman does not have to produce the same level of earnings to maintain its returns or even increase them. But the situation reflects the broader problems facing the industry, said Roger Freeman, an analyst with Barclays Capital: ''At least for now this is not a growth business.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 25, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about Goldman Sachs' quarterly earnings misstated a detail from the quarterly results of another Wall Street bank, Citigroup. One-time gains, like reversing the reserves set aside to cover bad loans, accounted for 67 percent of Citigroup's third-quarter earnings - not 85 percent.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Glad Cuts the Hyperbole for Its New Green Trash Bag

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

HOW much are marketers of green products scaling back ambitious efforts to sell eco-friendlier brands as life-changers and planet-savers? Well, a line of recycled paper products, introduced by Marcal in 2009, bears the name Small Steps rather than something grander like Giant Leaps.
Each Marcal product is promoted on packages as ''A small, easy step to a greener earth,'' a realistic tack that diverges from the hyperbole so favored by Madison Avenue. But the economy has led many consumers who bought green versions of household merchandise to return to regular versions, which are usually less expensive. 
Still, many consumers continue taking social issues like sustainability into account when shopping. In a study this month by Cone Communications and Echo Research, 81 percent of respondents said that companies had a responsibility to ''address key social and environmental issues beyond their local communities.''
And 76 percent of respondents said they had bought a product with ''an environmental benefit'' in the last 12 months.
All that may be why the Glad Products Company, in deciding to introduce a version of its Glad tall kitchen drawstring trash bag that is made with less plastic, is not heralding the arrival on store shelves with gushy green poetry -- or charging higher prices. The trash bags will cost the same as the previous versions.
Glad Products, a joint venture of the Clorox Company and Procter & Gamble, is spending $30 million to $40 million on a campaign to introduce the trash bags. They are being billed in ads and on packages as ''strength with less plastic'' and ''stronger with less plastic waste.'' (The bags are made using 6.5 percent less plastic than before, Glad Products executives say, and have what are called reinforcing bands to make the bags stronger.)
Some ads play up the ecological angle by including a single green leaf, rather than, say, a forest. Others carry the theme ''Small change, big difference.''
DDB West in San Francisco, part of the DDB Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group, is among several agencies that are collaborating on the Glad campaign, which begins this week with digital ads and continues with commercials scheduled to start on Monday.
There are also educational aspects to the campaign, which include a section of the Glad Web site, at glad.com/waste-less; plans for a Trash Smart iPhone app, to provide tips on recycling and composting. It also includes joining with the Association for Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education and Keep America Beautiful to encourage college campuses to recycle and reduce waste.
'' 'Every small step makes a difference' is an internal motto we use here,'' said Cheryl Hagedorn, Glad green marketing manager at Glad Products in Oakland, Calif.
The goal is to woo shoppers by presenting the benefits as ''tangible and achievable'' in everyday ways, she added, in that using the new bags will remove some plastic waste from landfills.
Because consumers who buy green products ''don't want to make any tradeoffs,'' Ms. Hagedorn said, ''we make sure we underscore this is a stronger bag and they don't need to sacrifice performance.''
The new bags will reduce the use of plastic at Glad Products by 6.5 million pounds a year, Ms. Hagedorn said, or the equivalent of 140 million bags. That is brought to life in the campaign by calling the amount enough plastic ''to cover all of Manhattan'' or ''to fill over 200 garbage trucks.''
And to express in a fashion that is easy to visualize, the digital ads and commercials are set in Manhattan.
''The entire time this product has been in development, we've been talking to consumers about how to talk back to them about it,'' said Stacey Grier, chief strategy officer at DDB West. ''What we've heard them say is that they want to make more responsible choices but they don't want to make the tradeoffs if they involve either an inferior product or a greater price.''
''This creative approach is the one they responded to,'' she added. ''It's important to be honest with consumers about our path forward and helping them on their path forward.''
Lisa Bennett, managing partner and chief creative officer at DDB West, said the goal was to ''strike a balance between what it means for you and what it means for the environment.''
The Clorox annual report for 2011 lists Glad products like bags and wraps as accounting for 13 percent of the company's fiscal year 2011 revenue, second only to home care brands like Pine-Sol and Tilex.
Sales of some Glad trash bags declined in fiscal 2011 because of price increases resulting from higher oil prices, while sales of others rose. Glad Products also sells trash bags that are made from 65 percent recycled plastic as well as recycling bags and compostable bags.
The Glad brand has a 33 percent market share, according to Glad Products data, ahead of its principal branded competitor, Hefty, at 19 percent, but behind private label products, at 36 percent.
Makers of branded merchandise continuously hunt for additional methods to counter private label products, which typically cost less. Product enhancements (''New and improved!'') are one way, as is aligning a product with a purpose.
Other agencies working on the new Glad campaign include Current Lifestyle Marketing in Chicago, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, for public relations; and Effect Partners in Minneapolis, which specializes in sustainability.
The campaign represents a big increase in the ad presence for Glad tall kitchen bags, according to data from the Kantar Media unit of WPP. Ad spending in 2009, for two varieties, totaled $13.6 million, Kantar Media reported, then fell to $92,000 in 2010. There was no ad spending at all in the first half of 2011, according to Kantar.

HEADLINE: In Uncertain Times, Municipal Bonds Call for Caution

BYLINE: By JOHN F. WASIK

 BODY:
When the prominent banking analyst Meredith Whitney predicted late last year that ''hundreds of billions of dollars'' of municipal bond defaults would occur in 2011, it rattled the nearly $3 trillion market.
Fortunately for investors, nothing like that has come to pass, with defaults down 60 percent in the first half of this year from the same period of 2010. Notwithstanding the recent municipal bankruptcy filing of Harrisburg, Pa., defaults of the highest-rated municipal bonds are rare. Still, that does not mean you should not be cautious when buying a municipal bond.
With the prospect of a double-dip recession still on the horizon, it pays to be careful. You need to closely monitor bonds that could face problems, or have your adviser perform due diligence. Default risk soars in recessions. From 1929 to 1937, for example, the muni default rate hit 1.8 percent a year. 
Agencies issuing these tax-free bonds are still at risk as liabilities like pension debts, as well as lower tax revenue, weigh heavily on them. When the housing and stock markets crashed in 2008, that led to $8 billion in municipal defaults. This year, defaults have totaled $511 million, according to the newsletter Distressed Debt Securities.
If you stick with the highest-rated bonds, though, you are unlikely to have problems. The higher the letter grade by rating services like Moody's, Fitch or Standard & Poor's, the lower the risk of default or the prospect that the bond issuer will not pay interest. On the Moody's scale, ratings from Aaa to Baa are considered investment grade; those from Ba to Caa to C are not.
According to a white paper prepared by Asset Dedication, a money management firm in Mill Valley, Calif., ''99.97 percent of all Aaa- and Aa-rated municipal bonds have generated coupon payments and redemptions as promised over the past 40 years without a single missed or even late payment.'' Within the last decade, the firm found, no Aaa-rated munis have defaulted and there have been only 54 defaults since 1970 out of more than one million outstanding issues.
But ratings can also be misleading. As the 2008 crisis proved, a top rating is no ironclad guarantee that a bond is safe. Many mortgage-backed securities that failed during the housing collapse received the highest possible rankings by credit ratings agencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Standard & Poor's for its mortgage securities ratings.
Now it is possible to do extensive background research into an issuer on your own. The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the obscure regulator of municipal bonds, has created a system that allows for more transparency. The Web service, called EMMA (emma.msrb.org/), permits any investor to see filings, like disclosure documents from the issuer and pricing information. Just type in the name of the bond or its unique Cusip number and you can gain access to a wealth of data on the bond you are considering.
While these documents may be dense and opaque -- the S.E.C. is considering ways to make them more useful to investors -- they can give you some insights into the risk of the issuer.
What would you look for in researching a bond? Other than the coupon payment and maturity date, you would need to know if the bond could be redeemed or ''called'' before maturity, whether the issuer had a right to repurchase the bonds at face value and how interest payments were timed.
Most likely, though, your first concern is whether interest will be paid consistently. To answer that question, you will need to do some vetting of the issuer -- or have your adviser do it. Another key question is the bond's ''yield to maturity,'' the anticipated return if it is held until maturity. This number takes into account the market price, par value, coupon rate and time to maturity.
The type of bond chosen also makes a difference. General obligation bonds, the most common, finance projects like schools and fire stations. Revenue bonds are floated to pay for things like sewers and water plants. Private-purpose bonds are usually sold to pay for sports stadiums and other nongovernmental projects.
''State general obligation bonds are at the top of the food chain,'' says Stan Richelson, a Philadelphia-based financial planner and co-author of ''Bonds: The Unbeaten Path to Secure Investment Growth'' (Bloomberg, 2011). ''First look at quality, then returns.''
Mr. Richelson says the safety-minded might want to avoid bonds used to finance airports, hospitals and arenas, as ''they have higher default rates.''
Chris Shayne, senior market strategist for the BondDesk Group in San Francisco, said: ''Avoid bonds for nonessential services. Make sure the yields are plugged into a sustainable revenue source.''
He has found that unless you prefer the convenience of a bond mutual or exchange-traded fund, you can build a fairly low-cost, diversified portfolio with at least 10 bonds from different issuers.
Bond brokers and advisers charge a markup on the bonds to earn their compensation. Mr. Shayne's company has found that the ''typical transaction cost of buying a muni bond is about 0.23 percent on average.''
''For an individual looking to buy municipal bonds,'' said Brent Burns, president of Asset Dedication, ''the discount brokers provide pretty good pricing. For a do-it-yourselfer, they won't have to pay the ongoing management fee of a mutual fund or separate account.''
To avoid single-issuer risk, diversify your holdings among several issuers across the country. You can work with a broker, a financial planner or a registered investment adviser to create a portfolio and hold the bonds to maturity. And watch those bonds for any ratings downgrades, which could signal higher default risk.
If you or your adviser do your homework and you buy the highest-quality issues, it is unlikely you'll have any problems with default. Just keep a close eye on the local economy where the bonds are issued and their tax-revenue stream. Economic climates could become much murkier if job losses continue or the general economy sours.
''Meredith Whitney couldn't have been more wrong,'' Mr. Shayne noted, ''but there was a grain of truth in what she said.''

HEADLINE: Chasing Opportunity In an Age of Upheaval a

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Nicolas Berggruen is passionate about investing. A compact, handsome billionaire, Mr. Berggruen is often talked about for his eccentricities -- he does not own a home, preferring to jet around the world and live out of hotels -- but his ability to find, invest in and turn around neglected companies points to a hardened and savvy approach.
And while a series of extreme events in global financial markets this year have shaken investors' confidence, he maintains his strategy of investing in undervalued companies. In fact, the general sense that things are bad and could get worse seem to have little effect on him.
''I continue to do the same thing,'' said Mr. Berggruen, who would not disclose his net worth beyond saying it was more than the $2.2 billion estimated by Forbes. ''I buy businesses that deserve to exist but have been mismanaged. I feel there are more opportunities now.'' 
His focus is retailing, media and real estate. He picks companies in these areas, he said, that have lost a lot of their value because of macroeconomic events beyond their control, and he expects them to rebound, eventually.
''I'm not optimistic in the short term,'' Mr. Berggruen said. ''I just think that if some businesses are going to survive it's worth investing now as long as it's a real business, and as long as you don't have to sell the stock to make a mortgage payment or eat next week.''
Concerns about the ability to cover basic expenses and a fear of losing more money after the losses in the 2008 crisis are keeping most people on the sidelines. They have plenty of reasons to be there. Stock markets rise and fall like a stomach-churning roller coaster ride. European leaders have been slow to devise a resolution for the debt crisis in Greece, which has rippled through the European banking system and into other European countries.
While Mr. Berggruen has a front-row seat on the political problems in the United States through his nonprofit policy foundation, the Nicolas Berggruen Institute, he doesn't necessarily like what he sees. So he is looking long term.
In his belief that various assets are undervalued, he represents people who see opportunities and are moving their money from cash into investments. These investors are not looking for the hottest new investment but searching for companies that are strong and have continued to perform, regardless of what their stock prices say.
''Real big fortunes have been made in times of hardship,'' said Karl Wellner, chief executive of Papamarkou Wellner, an advisory firm that works with wealthy families and has $3 billion under management. ''These people are looking at it from a different perspective.''
While these investors are contemplating the perils of the market and how to safeguard and build their wealth, President Obama and others, including the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, have called for increased taxes on the wealthy. These proposals come in different forms, and how they may apply to the investors described in this article is not clear -- nor are the prospects that any such proposal will be enacted.
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, for example, recently proposed a 5 percent surtax on all income over $1 million, including capital gains and dividends.
Many of these investors have enough wealth to buy millions of dollars of some asset and the time to wait to see what happens. If that investment appreciates wildly, they have increased their fortune; if it goes to zero their standard of living will not change.
But even with the luxury of time and wealth, some of them can find ample reasons not to invest right now.
''Why should I plow money into the market because it has dropped, when it can drop some more?'' said Fred Branovan, the president and chief operating officer for FFC Capital Management, which is the family office for Milton Fine, who sold his hotel company to Wyndham Resorts in 1998 for $2.1 billion. ''This family is into wealth preservation. They got rich; now they want to stay rich.''
While Mr. Berggruen is confident about the long term, he acknowledged that the next few years could be bleak. ''I'm scared like everyone else is because the world is scary,'' he said. ''I just don't think the world will disappear.''
The amount of money it takes for even wealthy investors to feel comfortable with risk is staggering. Todd M. Morgan, senior managing director at Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages money for high net-worth investors including Hollywood celebrities, said he had clients who were worth $25 million to $30 million and remained entirely in bonds.
Those who are worth more than $100 million are comfortable taking some risk but rarely with more than 20 percent of their assets -- and many of them define risky as being in blue-chip stocks.
''In a perfect world you should be selling some bonds and buying some high-quality stocks,'' Mr. Morgan said. ''But the stock market is the only place in the world where if there's a big sale no one comes out and buys.''
Those who are investing now fall into three distinct approaches: the bargain hunters, the natural resource crowd and the bettors.
Bargains are everywhere right now, and those looking for them do not have to go into the riskiest assets.
Ron Carson, the founder of the Carson Wealth Management Group in Omaha, which manages $2.6 billion, said his firm focused on an ''advance and protect'' strategy, with the emphasis these days on protect. He has investments in dividend-paying stocks like Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, Verizon, ConocoPhillips and Abbott Laboratories.
''We've done the research and think they're cheap,'' said Mr. Carson, who has $68 million of his own money invested in this strategy. ''They all pay really good dividends. But if you look at what they could pay versus what they do pay, they could pay substantially more, so the dividend is safe.''
While this strategy has produced a gain of less than 1 percent this year, Mr. Carson said he was more concerned with positioning the portfolio for the time a rebound occurs.
Others share his view. ''You don't have to be in a particularly esoteric strategy right now,'' Mr. Wellner said. ''You can make money in plain vanilla.''
He said several of his clients were putting more money into an equity fund run by Fayez Sarofim, a billionaire investment adviser in Houston. Clients seem to appreciate that Mr. Sarofim is invested in blue-chip securities that they can understand.
Mr. Berggruen said he, too, favored simple investments like dividend-paying stocks as ''something I'd recommend to my mother.'' He mentioned multinational corporations with large cash flows and dividends, like Nestle or Anheuser-Busch InBev, because they spread their risks around in many different markets, so currency or economic crises in a few countries will not damage them. ''If I had to put all of my money away and come back in five years, this is what I would do,'' he said.
Natural resources have drawn many wealthy investors because they think that whatever happens in the global economy, demand for these resources will continue.
How they invest in this area is more intriguing. Some hear the siren song of alternative energy; others focus on companies that provide traditional sources of energy.
Steve Smiley, who made his money in banking and private equity, said he had been increasing his personal investments in oil and natural gas projects in the United States. His primary concern in choosing investments, he said, is in evaluating the management teams of the companies rather than the price of the commodities or any sentiment surrounding them.
''At some point we'll start building houses again, and the consumer will go back to the store and buy what he needs,'' Mr. Smiley said. ''That's going to create a demand for energy.''
Nicholas Butta, whose family's wealth came from interests in coal mines, said he had put a substantial portion of the equity allocation of his family's money into mining companies. He said he had little interest in what the price of commodities was today or tomorrow.
''Trying to guess in the short term what will happen to commodity prices is a mug's game,'' said Mr. Butta, who lives in Australia. ''Medium to long term, I can give a view on commodities. In the short term, it's futile.''
He said he focused on the costs and production levels of mines, then decided whether the companies that own them were undervalued. ''I'm never buying anything with the expectation that someone is going to buy something from me at a higher price,'' he said. ''I'm looking for strong cash flows.''
That is an advantage of wealthier investors: they can buy and hold indefinitely, and if the dividends are reasonable, they can be content with a steady, predictable return for years. When it comes to alternative energy sources, however, the view needs to be very long indeed.
Michael Steinrueck, 55, who managed money for institutions for 30 years before retiring, said he had about a third of his money in alternative energy. ''I believe it will be the next mini-industrial revolution,'' he said. And China will drive that with its push to build up its infrastructure.
He would have pushed as high as 40 percent if his adviser hadn't discouraged the idea. His adviser, Iain Silverthorne, a partner at Evercore Wealth Management in San Francisco, said Mr. Steinrueck was one of his few clients whom he has had to persuade not to invest right now.
Preferring not to choose among wind, solar or other alternative energies, Mr. Steinrueck has focused on energy storage. ''You just don't know what part of the sector is going to be the decisive one,'' he said. ''But energy storage is so underdeveloped.''
Most investors in the third category are more willing to speculate, but they also believe that the best future returns may come from nontraditional assets. Ward McNally, whose wealth derives from the Rand-McNally mapmaking fortune, said he was plowing his money into his firm, McNally Capital, which advises other wealthy families on private equity investments.
He said one deal his firm both advised on and invested in was a fund that lent money to companies that could no longer borrow from banks. The returns on these loans are 8 to 12 percent, and if the companies were to default, provisions in the loans would allow the fund to take over.
Recently Mr. McNally said his firm had put together a syndicate of 12 families with a collective net worth of $30 billion to invest in clean technology companies,. He said the Cleantech Syndicate, as it is called, includes Dick DeVos, a son of the founder of Amway, and David Nazarian, a co-founder of Qualcomm.
''For some it's a financial hedge on what they already have,'' Mr. McNally said. ''To others, like a family in the real estate business, investing in early-stage lighting technology could reduce their real estate expenses.''
Mr. Branovan said the Fine family was increasingly invested in farmland, an asset based as much on stability as demand. ''It doesn't look to have a tremendous amount of downside, and it has a lot of upside,'' he said.
Dennis Jones, who sold his company, Jones Pharma, in 2000 for $3.4 billion, said he had decided to bet on zero-coupon municipal bonds, which are bought at a discount and grow to their face value over a set time, usually decades. He sees them as a good way to leave something to dozens of relatives.
He and his wife recently bought $26,000 of zero-coupon municipals bonds for a niece that will be worth $156,000 upon maturity in 20 years. ''The Napa school district is going to survive,'' he said of the California municipality that issued the bonds. ''Worse comes to worse, you end up owning a building.''

HEADLINE: Zombie Apocalypse? Atlanta Says Bring It On

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- Welcome to the Zombie Capital of the World.
That, at least, is what Atlanta magazine, the glossy monthly, has called this Southern city.
It is not only that ''The Walking Dead,'' the hit zombie show that began its second season on AMC on Sunday, is filmed and set here. Or that Atlanta holds some of the nation's largest zombie film festivals, zombie parades and zombie haunted houses. Or that even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that staid Atlanta-based federal agency, joined in the fun with a tongue-in-cheek guide to surviving a zombie apocalypse.
It is mainly that there are Atlantans like Kevin Galbraith, 24, a Georgia State University student who is one of the 6,000 people who applied to be zombie extras on ''The Walking Dead.'' The pay is meager, the hours are long, the weather is steamy and even their friends barely recognize them staggering around in the background, coated in fake blood and corpse-gray paint. And only 200 will be chosen each season. 
''You have to be the sort of kid who grew up practicing your zombie walk in the mirror,'' said Mr. Galbraith, a lanky, 115-pound horror fan who beat the odds and was cast in both seasons. ''I feel more alive than ever when I'm dead.''
Horror is big business here. Hollywood films like 2009's ''Zombieland'' and ''Halloween II,'' which were both filmed in Georgia, pump millions of dollars into the local economy.
Why Atlanta? There are many theories.
Robert Kirkman, a Kentucky native who wrote the graphic novel on which ''The Walking Dead'' is based, wanted the story set in a large Southern city. One of the largest annual gathering of zombies, DragonCon, a fantasy and science fiction convention, happened to be founded by an Atlanta resident. And this sprawling city, with swatches of foreclosed or abandoned property, is easy to make look spooky.
But government bureaucrats also played a role. In 2008, Georgia passed some of the nation's most advantageous tax incentives for filmmakers. Since then, the money spent on filmmaking in Georgia -- music videos, television commercials and more -- has soared to $683 million from $260 million. Meanwhile, the blockbuster success of franchises like ''Twilight'' and ''Harry Potter'' has drawn studios to fantasy and science fiction.
''If you look at the TV being filmed in Atlanta now, you've got a werewolf show, a vampire show, a zombie show and a show about reincarnation,'' said Tom Luse, a line producer for ''The Walking Dead,'' referring also to ''Teen Wolf,'' ''Vampire Diaries'' and ''Drop Dead Diva.''
Not that other cities are rolling over and playing dead. Seattle also calls itself the country's zombie capital because it is home to ZomBcon, the only convention devoted exclusively to zombies. The popular spoof ''Shaun of the Dead'' was filmed in London, where Brad Pitt is shooting parts of his new zombie movie ''World War Z.'' And Pittsburgh was home, in part, to the classics ''Dawn of the Dead'' and ''Night of the Living Dead.''
''Atlanta's claim is completely unfounded,'' said Mark Menold, organizer of the Pittsburgh-based World Zombie Day celebration. ''Atlanta might be the current home of a TV series. But really that series is nothing without the special-effects work of a Pittsburgh native'' -- Greg Nicotero, a co-executive producer of ''The Walking Dead.''
''The Walking Dead'' is taking the monsters mainstream. The show, about a band of survivors fending off zombies in a post-apocalyptic landscape, set a network record with an average five million viewers per episode, beating critics' favorites like ''Mad Men'' and ''Breaking Bad.''
Steve Fennessy, the editor of Atlanta magazine, argues that Atlantans enjoy seeing their city in an alternate reality. There is the historic downtown neighborhood Five Points swarming with the undead. Here is the normally busy Freedom Parkway devoid of traffic.
Those Atlanta-specific details are missing from most films shot here, in which the city is a generic stand-in for ''any city or every city,'' Mr. Fennessy said. ''In this show, Atlanta is very much its own character.''
On the set of ''The Walking Dead,'' which is wrapping up shooting for the second season on a cattle farm south of the city, the most important zombies -- called ''hero zombies'' -- are treated like stars. Mr. Galbraith is one of them: the first-time actor gets his own trailer, makeup crew and folding canvas chair.
Before one of his biggest scenes, he huddles over a camera monitor with Mr. Nicotero, the co-executive producer. He takes detailed advice on flailing and growling, and then on attacking a living character.
''That's when we cut to you,'' Mr. Nicotero told him. Opening and closing his hand, he said, ''And you go, 'Munch, munch, munch, munch.' ''

HEADLINE: Bengals Trade Disgruntled Palmer at Deadline

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
The N.F.L. trade deadline is normally a somnolent affair, just a few moves involving disgruntled and mostly forgotten players. But the Cincinnati Bengals and the Oakland Raiders rocked the league Tuesday with quarterback Carson Palmer, who had threatened to retire rather than play again for the Bengals, moving to the Raiders in exchange for a first-round draft pick and another pick that could become a first-rounder.
The deal was a bold one for both teams, but it was a steal for the Bengals. Their owner, Mike Brown, had vowed for months that he would let Palmer, a former Heisman Trophy winner who had grown disenchanted with the sometimes dysfunctional team that drafted him first over all in 2003, retire rather than trade him. 
After Palmer demanded a trade, Brown maintained that there was a principle at stake, that players should honor the commitment to a team they made by signing a contract, even though those contracts are not guaranteed and teams can cut or trade players on a whim.
Palmer, who has never spoken publicly about the situation, sold his home in the Cincinnati area and had appeared willing to forfeit the $11 million in salary he was due. (His contract with the Bengals went through the 2014 season.) He essentially quit, and even in recent days, the Bengals said that they would not trade him.
Brown's reputation for stubbornness paid off, allowing him to maintain bargaining leverage. That was enhanced when the rookie quarterback Andy Dalton led the Bengals to a 4-2 start and the Raiders' starter, Jason Campbell, broke his collarbone Sunday, sending the Raiders scurrying for a new quarterback less than two weeks after the death of Al Davis.
In a statement, Brown referred to Dalton's emergence as one reason the Bengals were willing to deal Palmer. ''We also find ourselves rather suddenly in position of being able to receive real value for Carson that can measurably improve our team -- which is performing well and is showing real promise for this year and years to come.''
The Raiders, with the first-year coach Hue Jackson now leading the way on personnel decisions, gave the Bengals their first-round draft pick in 2012 and a conditional draft pick in 2013 that is a second-rounder unless the Raiders win a playoff game, when it would become a first-rounder, according to Fox Sports, which first reported the trade.
''If you know Hue, you don't get recruited any harder,'' Palmer said. ''For the past six weeks, I thought I was retired. Before the start of the season, I was training like it was a normal off-season. Week 1 hit, I thought I have got to find what the next phase of my life would be.
''I'm honored,'' he added. ''I don't know a lot about this organization, but I know it's dedicated to winning. I know where this organization has been and where it wants to get back to.''
After so many years of losing, the Raiders showed their players they were not willing to give up on the season. But the Raiders paid a staggering price for the 32-year-old Palmer, whose recent play has not approached his early success.
Palmer is a two-time Pro Bowler, but he missed much of the 2008 season with an elbow injury, and there have been concerns about diminished arm strength and accuracy ever since. During the lockout, many talent evaluators around the league doubted that Palmer would be worth even one first-round pick. Last season, he completed 61.8 percent of his passes for 26 touchdowns and 20 interceptions, matching a career high, as the Bengals sank to 4-12.
But Jackson has a long relationship with Palmer, whom he helped recruit at Southern California and whom he worked with when he was a receivers coach for the Bengals. And the Raiders are flush with speedy receivers who will present Palmer with viable options.
The Raiders' next three games are against division rivals. After a game against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, in which Kyle Boller will probably start, the Raiders have a bye, which would give Palmer three weeks of practice before starting against the Denver Broncos and then the San Diego Chargers.
Jackson was noncommittal about whether Palmer might play this week.
''Would this have happened if Jason was here?'' Jackson said. ''Probably not.''
The Raiders believe they can win now. At 4-2 and one game behind the Chargers, they may be right. They better be. The new collective bargaining agreement makes first-round picks economically friendly to teams, and the Raiders have potentially given up their next two. They currently do not have second-, third- and fourth-round picks in 2012. The fourth-rounder was given up for Campbell, who now becomes expendable. He will be a free agent next year.
And if Palmer does not play well, Jackson, who has gained significant influence within the Raiders in the wake of Davis's death because of the team's success, figures to lose some of his credibility on a team that will probably hire a general manager after the season.

HEADLINE: A World of Alternatives That Goes Beyond Stocks and Bonds

BYLINE: By JOHN F. WASIK

 BODY:
As the stock market continues to roil with no sign of abating, many investors have turned to alternative investments in hedging strategies.
These nontraditional vehicles often move in the opposite direction from stocks and bonds, and offer diversification in currency, commodities, real estate and other assets.
Individual investors have had plenty of reasons to flee the old-school portfolio model of stocks and bonds. The European debt dilemma and the prospect of a global economic slowdown have led to an exodus from traditional mutual funds. 
Almost $11 billion flowed out of long-term funds in the week of Oct. 5 -- nearly double the amount from the week before -- according to the Investment Company Institute, the trade association based in Washington. Surprisingly, $6 billion of that outflow left taxable bond funds, compared with nearly $4 billion from stock funds.
In an extreme crisis, nearly every stock may decline in lockstep, as occurred in 2008. Yet investors may still be in the dark about the breadth of the possible decline. Only half of investors surveyed said they fully understood their portfolio's risk, according to a recent study by Natixis Global Asset Management, the global money manager, and knowledge of alternatives was even lower: Only 7 percent of high net-worth investors said they understood these investments ''very well.''
Locking in a static mix of stocks and bonds may not provide a sufficient buffer against volatility. Creating a lower-risk portfolio using alternative investments may provide more stability than the traditional tactic of moving money from stocks into bonds, as new risks emerge among troubled global credit markets.
''In times of crisis, credit and equity risk are highly correlated, meaning they go down together,'' said Nadia Papagiannis, a chartered financial analyst and director of alternative fund research for Morningstar, the financial research company in Chicago.
''We must now think about interest rate risk, and how that can cause losses in bonds across the board, regardless of credit quality,'' she added. ''Alternative investments offer risk-managed approaches to both stocks, bonds and also nontraditional asset classes, including currencies and managed futures/commodities.'' (Disclosure: I occasionally write for Morningstar.com on a freelance basis.)
What's the best way to dip your feet in the alternatives pool? Start by acquainting yourself with the different asset classes, which include commodities, real estate, currencies and timber. Commodities and real estate, for example, may move in the opposite direction of stocks.
You can also choose strategy-oriented funds to offset stock market risk. It's possible to pick funds that can go long and short at the same time, gain only in bear markets or are market-neutral -- producing a small return in any market climate.
Some funds may focus on one theme, like distressed companies or those likely to be acquired or merged. It's also possible to take several bets in multistrategy funds that mimic hedge fund management.
The most telling indicator for how an alternative may offer refuge from stock market risk is how it moves relative to a benchmark like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of the largest United States companies. For insulation from stocks, you want assets that move in the opposite direction or do not closely echo the S.& P. index.
The Dow Jones/UBS Commodity Index, for example, has shown a monthly correlation of 0.39, with 1.00 being a perfect tracking of the S.& P. index, said David Reilly, a chartered financial analyst and president of Decision Critical Resources in Boston. The American dollar, as measured by the U.S. Dollar Index, follows stocks even less -- with a negative 0.34 correlation, Mr. Reilly found in a study of the period from June 30, 2001, through June 30, 2011.
Alternative funds allow you to choose specific areas to reduce stock, credit, political or currency risk.
Concerned about currency risk when the dollar loses value to other denominations? The Merk Hard Currency Fund (MERKX) manages a basket of currencies that may do well when the dollar is down, and offers a small allocation to gold.
The Wasatch Long/Short Fund (FMLSX), has the ability to buy stocks and bonds and sell short in securities its managers think are overvalued. The fund has beaten the S.& P. 500 over the last five years, returning 3.25 percent, compared with a negative 1.18 percent for the S.& P. through Sept. 30.
Bets on the price trends in things as diverse as stock indexes and commodities can be represented by a derivatives-trading fund like the AQR Managed Futures Strategy Fund (AQMIX).
A market-neutral fund, which aims to produce a modest return in most market climates, is also a worthy consideration. The 22-year-old Merger Fund (MERFX), for example, is managed to ''produce positive returns under a wide variety of market conditions.''
Be careful when you enter the alternatives universe, though. These funds may involve high-risk, complex hedging and leverage strategies (using borrowed money) that you may not understand. They also tend to be more expensive, with annual expense ratios often double those of plain-vanilla managed stock mutual funds, Morningstar has found.
Every alternative fund also has a unique risk-return portfolio. Some may move in the opposite direction of bonds, while others may only equal returns on Treasury bills. No single fund is risk-free, and there's always an additional cost for the ability to hedge an asset class.
Since there is no such thing as an off-the-shelf all-in-one alternatives fund, your portfolio purchases will be need to be customized to complement what you already own and your financial goals. Don't choose just one fund to represent alternatives; diversify among different strategies. There are many moving parts.
Most of all, be aware of the steep learning curve for alternatives. They are too complicated for casual market timers. If you are not comfortable with getting up to speed on them, work with a fiduciary adviser such as a certified financial planner, registered investment adviser or certified financial analyst to build the right portfolio for you. An adviser may be able to buy lower-cost share classes of these funds, to save you money on annual expenses and find the best managers.

HEADLINE: United Auto Workers Approve a New Four-Year Contract With Ford Motor

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The United Auto Workers has ratified its proposed contract with the Ford Motor Company after union members at two assembly plants in Kentucky approved the accord.
Local 600 in Dearborn, Mich., the largest local for the union, disclosed the development Tuesday on its Facebook page, citing national union officials. U.A.W. Local 862 in Louisville, Ky., said its members at two plants voted 53.3 percent in favor of the four-year agreement. The Louisville plants build pickups and sport-utility vehicles and employ 5,397 workers. Ford's 40,600 American hourly workers were to conclude voting Tuesday. 
Michele Martin, a spokesman for the union, did not immediately answer a voice message and an e-mail seeking comment.
U.A.W. members at Ford shifted from voting 53 percent against the contract last Friday to 63.2 percent in favor as of Tuesday morning. Ford is offering 12,000 new jobs, $6.2 billion in factory upgrades and bonus and profit-sharing payments per worker this year that total as much as $10,000. A lack of a wage increase was responsible for much of the initial opposition.
''People are saying there is room for improvement, but they'll vote in favor of this contract because it means jobs,'' said Jerome Williams, president of U.A.W. Local 2000, which represents 1,880 workers voting today at Ford's Ohio van plant. ''A few people are saying we gave up monetary concessions and other things that they'd like to see come back, and rightfully so. But the economic situation isn't the best right now.''
The U.A.W. negotiated contracts for 113,000 workers for the first time since General Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. G.M. workers endorsed a new deal last month and workers at Chrysler begin voting this week. Only workers at Ford, which avoided Chapter 11, could strike in these contract talks because G.M. and Chrysler employees agreed not to walk out as part of their government-backed rescues.
Ford has promised investments totaling $1.26 billion at the two Kentucky assembly plants. .

HEADLINE: What to Ask a Prospective Wealth Manager

BYLINE: By JOHN F. WASIK

 BODY:
What do you do when your financial adviser becomes damaged goods?
That's surely on the minds of thousands of clients of firms like UBS Financial Services, which is embroiled in a recent trading scandal, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which is suffering myriad financial woes.
If you're concerned about whether an adviser's parent firm is going to survive a crisis or if you're not happy with your portfolio, there are some important questions to ask before you make a change to a new wealth manager. 
Brand reputation is often the linchpin for advisory relationships. You should expect a wide range of services and extensive handholding from a top-tier firm. But when the company is tarnished, top executives and advisers often resign or are fired.
Take UBS, the Swiss bank that was once one of the most powerful brands in wealth management. At one point before the 2008 financial crisis, it employed 8,000 advisers. It was one of the largest managers of private wealth, with $1.7 trillion in client assets. Since the crisis, the firm has lost more than 1,000 advisers.
After it was revealed that a UBS trader had lost $2.3 billion from unauthorized trading, the company's chief executive, Oswald Grubel, and other managers resigned.
If you are with a troubled firm, how do you know whether or when to move on?
The financial advisory industry is going through climactic change. The Securities and Exchange Commission is writing a rule that will make brokers and advisers become fiduciaries. This means that if they don't put your interests first, you can sue them, which is not the case with most securities brokers and agents now, as they are governed by a looser standard of whether an investment they recommend is ''suitable.''
''Don't think that brand names are important when the industry is going through a paradigm shift,'' says Paula Hogan, a certified financial planner (C.F.P.) and chartered financial analyst (C.F.A.) who is based in Milwaukee. People do not care as much about portfolio returns as they do about maintaining a standard of living for a lifetime, she said, and many high-visibility firms focus more on returns and less on comprehensive financial planning.
Finding an adviser who already acts as a fiduciary -- while not a fail-safe standard -- offers better investor protection than the broker-dealer model.
Generally, most fee-only C.F.P.'s, C.F.A.'s, lawyers and accountants who do personal financial advising have a written standard of care that combines a code of ethics with extensive pro-client guidelines.
Fees also provide an insight into the relationship you will have with a firm. Do they charge for assets under management or an hourly rate for planning services, or both? Do they earn a commission on their recommendations?
''Where does your adviser get their compensation from?'' Mr. Hogan asks. ''Do they own another business that benefits from their recommendations to you, or does the business own them?''
Don Trone, a fiduciary consultant with 3Ethos in Mystic, Conn., said he looked at credentials carefully. He favors C.F.A.'s because of their rigorous training in investment analysis, as well as those who are constantly updating their knowledge ''through a commitment to lifelong learning.''
In addition to preparing an investment policy statement outlining your financial goals and risk tolerance, a worthy adviser must have the ability to listen, Mr. Trone said.
''They should adopt a consultative approach,'' he said. ''They should sit down and listen to you and write on a legal pad your goals and objectives. I like the 70/30 rule. You should do at least 70 percent of the talking and not vice versa.''
Yet even if an adviser is a great listener, the bedside manner can often cover some huge problems. Just ask the victims of Bernie Madoff. The next level of your inquiry can get at some of the most troublesome conflicts.
Stephen Horan, head of private wealth management for the CFA Institute in Charlottesville, Va., which represents chartered financial analysts, says it would be worthwhile to ask for an adviser's Security and Exchange Commission's ADV Form, Part II. This document is supposed to list any potential conflicts of interest and specify how advisers are compensated.
While you may grimace at the thought of poring through a disclosure form, you will learn if the adviser is paid referral fees by financial product firms, information about their transaction costs and where they hold your assets. This last item is critical. Ideally, your money should not be held by the adviser's firm. You need a trusted third party holding your cash.
Several specialized search engines will check for disciplinary or legal actions and summarize the firm's record. While it is not possible to know everything about an adviser, you can also learn a lot by how much attention they pay to ethical codes and adherence to tougher global guidelines, including the Global Investment Performance Standards, industrywide ethical benchmarks recognized in 32 countries.
''The world's imperfect, and you can't hold an adviser to impossible standards,'' Mr. Horan says. ''But a code of ethics and standard of practice is important. Just because a broker's background check comes up clean doesn't mean it's a seal of approval.''
Ultimately, finding the right wealth manager goes beyond what the firm can bring to the table. They need to make the time investment in you and your objectives, and you need to complement the process by asking the right questions before engaging with them.

HEADLINE: Deficit Panel May Need Push, Lawmakers Say

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With just five weeks until its deadline, a secretive Congressional committee seeking ways to cut the federal deficit is far from a consensus, and party leaders may need to step in if they want to ensure agreement, say people involved in the panel's work.
The 12-member committee is just over halfway through the 76-day interval from its first meeting to the date its final report is due on Nov. 23, but has not gained much traction. The lawmakers have not agreed on basic elements like a benchmark against which savings will be measured. 
The panel's members, evenly divided between the two parties, spent most of September in a standoff. Republicans refused to budge from their position against new taxes. Democrats said they would not discuss cuts to entitlement programs like Medicare unless Republicans made a firm commitment to accept additional revenues.
The two leaders of the panel, Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, have told committee members not to talk publicly about their work. But other lawmakers and Congressional aides privy to the panel's effort have provided a remarkably consistent picture of the deliberations as the committee tries, in a matter of weeks, to find fiscal answers that have eluded Congress and the White House for years.
A Republican who has worked on Capitol Hill for more than two decades said: ''Basically we are going in circles. It's going very, very slowly. The only way this will work is if the leaders decide they want to get a deal and lay down parameters. Everybody is sitting around sucking their thumb until they get some guidance on what to do.''
Some lawmakers expressed similar views.
''My impression is they are not progressing too rapidly,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, which is responsible for Medicare, Medicaid and taxes. ''Things are not moving too fast.''
Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said: ''These 12 people are no more autonomous than your left thumb. They need some guidance from the White House and from the leadership of Congress.''
Congressional leaders -- including Senators Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio -- have refrained from offering public advice to the panel, which they helped create.
The committee, with equal numbers of senators and House members, is supposed to write legislation reducing deficits by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years. Committee members have not decided how to apportion the savings among various categories of spending like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, farm programs and the military, or how much should be raised in revenues.
A person working for the committee said members were ''still hovering at 30,000 feet,'' asking basic questions: ''What is the baseline? Are we doing tax reform?''
Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee, said ''the jury is still out'' on whether it could agree on $1.2 trillion in savings.
If legislation to save that amount is not enacted, the president is supposed to make up the difference by imposing across-the-board cuts in most military and civilian programs in January 2013.
The joint committee is trying to flesh out ideas for deficit reduction developed in May and June during bipartisan talks led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. In the joint committee, as in the Biden group, lawmakers have held lengthy discussions, but when they reach a decision point, it appears that neither side wants to go first.
Several committee members said they were afraid of failure. They know that voters, investors and credit-rating agencies will take the panel's work as evidence of how well Congress functions.
The circular nature of the discussions, the ethereal talk about ''modernizing Medicare'' and ''reforming the tax code'' has frustrated some panel members like Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who has said he is eager to start serious negotiations.
By all accounts, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, has been the most talkative panel member behind closed doors. He has managed to irk members of both parties as he weighs various options.
''Kerry just talks a lot,'' said a House Republican aide. ''It's what I would call Senate talk. It's like a waterfall of words. It never gets you anyplace.''
Another person who has attended the committee's meetings said: ''Kerry is very aspirational. People hope he will come down to earth.''
An aide to Mr. Kerry said the senator knew that ''some people are unhappy'' with his remarks. ''He thinks out loud, running through the options in his mind,'' the aide explained. ''He vocalizes options that may cause distress. That does not necessarily mean he supports them.''
Several members of the committee, like Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, have pushed for changes in the tax laws that they believe would revive the economy and generate additional revenue.
''Portman is the most gung-ho for tax reform,'' said a Republican who has attended many of the committee's sessions. ''He's the Chihuahua in the room, constantly yapping about it, sometimes to the frustration of other Republican members, who want to focus on deficit reduction through entitlement reform.''
Mr. Portman defended his stance, saying, ''Most economists agree that fundamental corporate tax reform is going to produce more economic growth and therefore, as a consequence, more revenues.''
Members of both parties want to simplify taxation of corporations, reducing the rates while eliminating many deductions and credits. But panel members have discovered that it is difficult to separate corporate changes cuts from individual tax issues. A large number of businesses, including partnerships, are not subject to the corporate income tax, but distribute profits to the owners, who report the income on their individual tax returns.
The co-chairmen of the committee say their goal is to come up with a package of savings that will avoid across-the-board cuts.

HEADLINE: As the Economy Goes, So Go Takeovers, Even Though Bargains Abound

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer, is a professor at the Michael E. Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @Steven Davidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
The merger market is like a pack of lemmings. If the economy is good , the takeover market will follow, but when times are bad, the market stalls.
For the moment, there are still mega-deals, like Kinder Morgan's $21.1 billion acquisition of the El Paso Corporation, and takeover activity is up. The volume of global mergers and acquisitions was up 22 percent, to $2.748 trillion, for the last 12 months ending in August from the period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters. The increase in deal volume was driven in part by a threefold increase in hostile offers and strong company balance sheets.
Yet many major economies in the world are growing sluggishly, if at all. The negative economic outlook is likely to counteract some otherwise strong drivers for deal-making. 
The International Monetary Fund estimates growth for advanced economies at just 1.6 percent this year and only 1.9 percent in 2012, compared with a historical average of about 3 percent. In the United States, unemployment remains stubbornly high, and 2011 G.D.P. growth was recently estimated by a National Association for Business Economics poll of economists to be about 1.57 percent.
The European sovereign debt crisis has worsened the economic growth problem. And the uncertainty over how far the crisis will spread in Europe is bound to drive down takeover volume.
Then there is the stock market. In a presentation last week at the Penn State M&A Institute, Jane Wheeler, a senior managing director at Evercore Partners, noted that since 1985, takeover volume had grown in only two years when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had declined.
So we have the lemmings problem again. Takeover volume follows the stock market, and the market is down. Its recovery is fragile given the negative trends.
Also weighing on the merger market are signs that the Obama administration is stepping up antitrust enforcement. Last year, the federal government made a second request for information, an indication of an in-depth investigation of a transaction, in 4.1 percent of deals, compared with 2.5 percent in the last year of the Bush administration, according to a joint report submitted to Congress by the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice.
Mergers are also being challenged more often, and antitrust enforcement appears to be becoming even more aggressive in recent months. Although Continental and United Airlines cleared antitrust review by the Obama administration in August 2010, the federal government is suing to stop AT&T's acquisition of T-Mobile USA after effectively blocking Nasdaq's bid to acquire NYSE Euronext and Avis's effort to acquire Dollar Thrifty.
All this spells a decline in takeover volume. Deal makers do not want to take undue risks, and fear of uncertainty and a downturn is real even beyond the heightened regulatory scrutiny.
Yet there remain some forces that should be putting wind in deal makers' sails.
The takeover market's pattern of following equity prices is counterintuitive. When stocks are down, valuations are low and takeovers should make the most sense from a value perspective. Right now, price-earnings multiples are about 15 times earnings, compared, according to Standard & Poor's, with a historical average approaching 20 times earnings. One would think companies would be rushing to scoop up low-priced assets.
This is particularly true since credit is easy, at least for some. The high-yield market is choppy at best, but good companies can borrow at incredibly low rates for long periods. The Norfolk Southern Corporation, for example, priced a $400 million 100-year bond with a yield of 6 percent.
Even beyond credit there is cash, and companies have plenty of it. Standard & Poor's estimates that American companies have more than $2 trillion of cash on their balance sheets. Although much of it is held abroad as companies wait for the federal government to lower the dividend tax on the repatriation of cash, certainly hundreds of millions of dollars can be spent domestically.
Private equity firms are also sitting on big cash hoards. Globally, private equity still has almost $1 trillion in dry powder, according to a study by Bain. Leveraged buyouts currently average a mix of about 40 percent equity and 60 percent debt. Private equity therefore has enough firepower for more than $2 trillion in buyouts.
So where are they? The industry remains notably hesitant to make deals. Only 6.5 percent of global M.& A. transactions through the first nine months of 2011 were private equity acquisitions, according to Dealogic.
While it is hard to know what in particular is holding private equity back, they too are most likely following the economic cycle, afraid to invest in a volatile, potentially down market.
Must-do deals will still happen, like the El Paso acquisition, which Kinder Morgan's chairman and chief executive, Richard D. Kinder, called a ''once-in-a-lifetime transaction.''
Yet the overall trend is that of M.&A. rushing toward a cliff. Companies that might have pulled the trigger on an acquisition will instead spend their cash on dividends and stock buybacks.
Sure, some brave companies will take a plunge and try to acquire at a lower value. And the slowdown in initial public offerings may also spur takeover activity.
These are likely to be small blips. For the next few months, investment bankers are going to have a hard year as they try to point to the positive factors in the market to sell deals. But they are going to be running against those lemmings.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As City Plants Trees, Some Say a Million Are Too Many

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
In a city of steel and concrete, a single tree offers a burst of green, a cooling canopy and an antidote for frayed nerves. It seems as if nobody is against one tree. But try planting a million of them.
That is what New York City has been aiming to do, and as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg installed the 500,000th tree in St. Nicholas Park in Upper Manhattan on Tuesday -- reaching the halfway point in the Million Trees campaign -- officials extolled the role of trees in making the city more sustainable. Trees help fight asthma, reduce storm water runoff, absorb carbon dioxide and lower ambient temperatures.
But as callery pears, honey locusts and white pines grow in all five boroughs -- on sidewalks, along medians and in parks -- so, too, have New Yorkers' grumblings.
Residents worry that the saplings will eventually lead to buckling sidewalks, dangling limbs, excessive shade and leaf litter, among other things. Three of the top five categories of parks-related calls to 311, the city's help line, involved complaints about trees. One Queens homeowner begged the city not to plant a tree in front of her house by arguing that her dog would get confused by the introduction of a new smell; she got a tree anyway. 
Even elected officials who profess a love of trees say they fear that the city may not be putting the necessary resources into caring for the trees once they are planted. They cite instances of premature deaths, as well as a pruning backlog, made worse by recent budget cuts. The regular pruning cycle of street trees is now once every 15 years to 20 years, down from once every 7 years.
''I'm all about trees -- trust me,'' said Jimmy Van Bramer, a city councilman who represents western Queens. ''But we're not going to get what we want unless we commit to the ongoing maintenance of these trees as they grow older. These are tough economic times, but more trees means more maintenance and pruning. It's got to mean that.''
Of course, many residents have embraced a leafier streetscape. And most of the trees planted under the Million Trees program, which began in 2007, are too small to have caused problems -- their roots and boughs have not yet reached the tentacle stage.
But at least some of the newly planted trees have met untimely deaths. Efforts to plant trees along a narrow median on 11th Street in the Long Island City section of Mr. Van Bramer's district, for example, have failed.
Tom Paino, an architect whose house overlooks the median, said that landscapers planted the trees too late in the spring and that the root balls were not sufficiently submerged. Recently, workers chopped down the dead trees, leaving behind stumps. ''As soon as they put them in, I thought, 'They're not going to make it,' '' he said. ''It's a very frustrating experience.''
City officials defend their record, saying some tree mortality is to be expected. Various studies of newly installed trees show that 7 percent to 11 percent die within two years of planting, depending on the location. ''It's not surprising in urban areas to see these mortality rates,'' said Bram Gunther, chief of forestry, horticulture and the natural resources group at the Department of Parks and Recreation.
Moreover, city officials say, all new trees are under warranty for two years from the date of planting by landscaping contractors, who are also responsible for watering them.
''Most people love trees,'' the parks commissioner, Adrian Benepe, said. ''But this being New York, you'll always find someone who doesn't want a tree.''
Indeed, at the other end of the complaint spectrum are those residents whose requests for new street trees have gone unheeded. Some lost trees to Tropical Storm Irene. The city says there is a waiting list of at least a year for a new street tree in some neighborhoods.
The Million Trees campaign, which is a year ahead of schedule, is a partnership between New York City and a nonprofit agency founded by Bette Midler, the New York Restoration Project. The city is overseeing new trees on streets and in parks, which will make up most of the plantings. The Restoration Project, meanwhile, is focusing its efforts on libraries, churches, cemeteries and housing projects, while encouraging New Yorkers to plant trees in their own yards through tree giveaways.
''A really important tree is about to hit the ground,'' Mayor Bloomberg declared in St. Nicholas Park on Tuesday morning, before he lifted a shovel and planted an 11-year-old pin oak on a patch of lawn. He was helped by Representative Charles B. Rangel and other elected officials, as well as Carmelo Anthony, the Brooklyn-born basketball star with the Knicks.
As with most initiatives under the Bloomberg administration, the tree effort has been meticulously documented. Some 120 species have been planted across the city so far, with Manhattan receiving 49,045 trees (9.8 percent of the 500,000) and the Bronx getting 135,626 trees, or 27.1 percent.
To address residents' concerns, the city has introduced a number of programs. For buckling sidewalks, for instance, the city now does repairs in front of one- to three-family homes; in the past, it was the homeowner's responsibility. Since starting a repair program several years ago, the city has received 38,300 requests, and it has addressed 9,169 so far. To prevent buckling in the first place, all new trees have considerably larger beds, allowing room for spreading roots.
As for pruning, the city says it responds to all complaints about dead limbs or trees within 30 days; if the condition is deemed hazardous, the work will be performed immediately.
The parks department, with the nonprofit group Trees New York, has stepped up its ''citizen pruner'' program, in which residents can become trained and certified to do limited pruning of street trees. The one limitation, however, is that citizen pruners must keep their feet on the ground, which prevents most work on taller trees.
And the city recently revamped its Adopt-a-Tree Web site, where residents can sign on to take care of trees in their neighborhood. By Tuesday afternoon, 2,999 people had officially adopted trees, pledging to water, mulch and weed. New Yorkers who take a free tree-care class get a bucket or garden hose.
''At the end of the day, our goal is to have New Yorkers form an emotional connection to trees,'' said Morgan Monaco, director of MillionTreesNYC, which is part of the parks department.
In the East New York section of Brooklyn, where asthma rates are high, Marisol Rivas's block is now graced with Kwanzan cherries, Japanese Zelkovas, honey locusts and Canada red cherries. Surveying the street, Ms. Rivas, a 40-year-old bus attendant, voiced approval of the new trees -- her vista as yet unclouded by fears of what they might sow.
''It makes the block greener,'' she said. ''Before, it was a little gloomy.''

HEADLINE: In Tripoli, Clinton Pledges U.S. Help to a 'Free Libya'

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Kareem Fahim contributed reporting from Bani Walid, Libya.

 BODY:
TRIPOLI, Libya -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton pledged political and economic support for Libya's transitional government on Tuesday, even as a senior administration official warned that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and his loyalists remained ''a lethal nuisance'' who could stall the country's evolution.
Mrs. Clinton, the Obama administration's most ardent champion of the NATO-led intervention, arrived here from Malta aboard an American military jet shortly after noon and was greeted by a phalanx of uniformed fighters, part of an irregular militia that now controls Tripoli's airport.
They chanted ''God is great'' and raised their hands in signs of victory. 
''I am proud to stand here on the soil of a free Libya,'' Mrs. Clinton said at an Islamic conference center in the capital after meeting with the country's interim leaders, including the chairman of the Transitional National Council, Mustafa Abdel-Jalil.
Mrs. Clinton raised a host of issues with Mr. Abdel-Jalil and other Libyan officials, including the consolidation of political control, the prevention of violence against Colonel Qaddafi's supporters and the integration of myriad rebel militias into a new security structure.
''Not all of the militias have yet come on board,'' said a senior official traveling with Mrs. Clinton. ''More are. More still need to come.''
Mrs. Clinton is the highest-ranking American official to visit Libya since the fall of Tripoli two months ago, the climax of a conflict in which the Obama administration went to some lengths to play down American involvement. She is the first secretary of state to visit Libya since Condoleezza Rice in 2008, during a thaw in the Qaddafi government's international isolation.
''Now the hard part begins,'' Mrs. Clinton told Libya's interim prime minister, Mahmoud Jibril, when she greeted him on the steps of the conference hall.
The United States has contributed $135 million in assistance to Libya's new leaders since February, including humanitarian aid and military equipment -- though not weapons, which France, Qatar and other nations have supplied. Mrs. Clinton promised more help on Tuesday, including medical equipment and treatment in the United States for some of the most gravely wounded fighters, educational and cultural exchanges and a project with Oberlin College in Ohio to help preserve ancient ruins at Cyrene.
Mrs. Clinton said the relatively meager amount of new assistance reflected not only fiscal austerity at home -- she told Mr. Jibril that such aid faced deep opposition in Congress -- but also the fact that oil-rich Libya needed expertise more than cash to rebuild its society and economy after four decades under Colonel Qaddafi.
One of the largest pieces of the aid -- $40 million -- involves expanding the search for mobile antiaircraft rockets in an effort to keep them out of terrorists' hands after they were looted from Libya's arsenals. The United States has sent 14 civilian contractors to join the hunt for the missiles, which, along with sealed stockpiles of chemical weapons, are among the most worrisome aspects of Colonel Qaddafi's fall.
Mrs. Clinton arrived a day after the interim government said it had taken control of Bani Walid, a loyalist enclave in the desert south of Tripoli. The anti-Qaddafi forces had been stalled for weeks at the approach in a valley dominated by loyalist positions on the hills above the city.
On Tuesday, though, anti-Qaddafi fighters celebrated in one of the town's squares, near an electric utility building that appeared to have been flattened by an airstrike. Commanders said they had captured hundreds of fighters during an assault on Sunday. Many more had fled, along with most of Bani Walid's residents.
''It's like a city of ghosts,'' said Hatem Dwaik, a fighter from Tripoli.
With no one to stop them, some former rebels looted and burned houses, as they have in other loyalist towns. New cars could be seen being carted out of town on the back of trucks. A transitional government official, Abdulhakim Momen, said several of the houses he owned in the city had been looted.
''We are sorry for this,'' Mr. Momen said. ''It is a few people. There are honorable freedom fighters.''
A commander, Mohamed Bashir, said the former rebels had received information that Colonel Qaddafi and his son Seif al-Islam Qaddafi had been in Bani Walid after the fall of Tripoli, though that information could not be independently confirmed. Colonel Qaddafi had been seen in the city twice about a month ago, and Seif had fled in recent days, he said.
''We will make the city safe,'' he said. ''The residents will come back.''
With loyalist forces clinging to a small district of Colonel Qaddafi's hometown, Surt, the new government has yet to proclaim total victory, and in her public remarks Mrs. Clinton repeatedly noted that the fighting continued.
The continued resistance and Colonel Qaddafi's success at eluding capture have created uncertainty and fear about a political transition that is only now gaining momentum in Libya and has uncomfortable parallels to Saddam Hussein's eight months in hiding after the fall of Iraq in 2003. It was during that period that an insurgency took root in Iraq that continues to simmer, years after Mr. Hussein's capture, trial and execution.
''I wouldn't underestimate Qaddafi's ability to be a lethal nuisance,'' a senior administration official said.
Mrs. Clinton privately urged the new government to keep its promises not to unleash retaliatory violence or tolerate abuses of the sort that Human Rights Watch has documented.
''It is going to be a challenge for them to make sure that in all cases they are able to have fair judicial procedures that meet international standards, just given the history of Libya over the past 42 years,'' the official said. ''The intentions certainly strike us as being sincere -- we have positive examples -- but there's definitely going to be challenges going forward.''
Mrs. Clinton also raised the case of Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, the Libyan man convicted in a Scottish court for the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. He was released from prison on humanitarian grounds and returned to Libya two years ago to a hero's welcome. Despite assertions at the time that he was terminally ill and near death, he is still alive and living in Tripoli, leading many in Congress to demand his arrest.
Mrs. Clinton, for her part, reiterated that Mr. Megrahi should never have been released, and noted that the Justice Department considered the bombing an open case. But she did not explicitly call on the new government to order his detention.
''They have assured us,'' she said of the Libyan officials, ''they understand how strongly the United States feel about this case.''
Mrs. Clinton spent six and a half hours on the ground in Libya before returning to Malta. She spoke to students at the University of Tripoli, who peppered her with broad questions about democracy, political parties, free speech and the aspirations of the Palestinians for their own state, as well as specific requests for educational exchanges for dentists and librarians.
She also visited Tripoli Medical Center, where she promised doctors to help untangle logistical challenges that would allow patients to be transferred abroad for treatment. In one room, she met three fighters who had been gravely wounded in combat near Bani Walid and another loyalist stronghold in the south, Sabha. One man had lost a leg.
''We are on your side,'' she told one of the men.
Online Correction: October 18, 2011, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the chairman of the Transitional National Council. He is Mustafa Abdel-Jalil, not Mustafa Abdul Jabril. The interim prime minister's name was also misspelled. He is Mahmoud Jibril, not Mahmoud Jabril.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Prices Shot Up 0.8% In September, Fed by Gasoline

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Producer prices in the United States rose in September at their fastest pace in five months and the cost of gasoline surged, but a small gain in core prices suggested that the increased price pressure was unlikely to be sustained. 
The Labor Department said Tuesday that its seasonally adjusted index for prices received by farms, factories and refineries increased 0.8 percent after being flat in August.
Economists had expected prices to rise 0.2 percent.
Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, wholesale prices rose 0.2 percent after inching up 0.1 percent in August.
''Slower growth abroad suggests further moderation in demand for raw materials heading into the fourth quarter, which will likely translate into inflation moderation,'' said Lindsey Piegza, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.
Gasoline prices climbed 4.2 percent, the largest gain since March, after dropping 1 percent in August. Economists, however, dismissed the rise in the cost of gasoline, attributing it to how the data was adjusted to try to smooth seasonal volatility.
''It probably did not point to a new trend to higher inflation,'' said Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis.
But some said there was a risk that data on Wednesday could show a surprise in September consumer prices. The consumer price index most likely rose 0.3 percent last month, according to a Reuters survey, after increasing 0.4 percent in August.
The strong rise in wholesale prices last month is unlikely to prompt a broad increase in inflation pressures given the weak economy.
It will probably have little impact on the Federal Reserve, which focuses on core consumer inflation, as it weighs further options to help the anemic recovery and pull down an unemployment rate stuck above 9 percent.
Pressure on the central bank for further monetary stimulus has eased in recent weeks as retail sales and the trade balance data suggested that economic growth accelerated in the third quarter after the tepid 1.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
Economists estimate that gross domestic product grew at an annual pace of 2.3 percent to 2.7 percent in the third quarter.

HEADLINE: U.S. Moves To Cut Back Regulations On Hospitals

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration moved Tuesday to roll back numerous rules that apply to hospitals and other health care providers after concluding that the standards were obsolete or overly burdensome to the industry.
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said the proposed changes, which would apply to more than 6,000 hospitals, would save providers nearly $1.1 billion a year without creating any ''consequential risks for patients.''
Under the proposals, issued with a view to ''impending physician shortages,'' it would be easier for hospitals to use ''advanced practice nurse practitioners and physician assistants in lieu of higher-paid physicians.'' This change alone ''could provide immediate savings to hospitals,'' the administration said. 
Other proposals would roll back rules for doctors' offices, kidney dialysis centers, organ transplant programs, outpatient surgery centers and institutions for people with severe mental disabilities.
In January, President Obama ordered his appointees to modify or revoke rules that were outmoded, ineffective or ''excessively burdensome.'' Republicans in Congress have demanded such changes, arguing that many federal rules have stifled economic growth and job creation.
Many of the new proposals deal with Medicare and Medicaid rules that have not been altered in decades. In general, the proposals do not affect the large number of rules issued under the new health care law, which set detailed standards for coverage offered by insurance companies and employers.
One of the new proposals would allow hospital patients to take certain drugs on their own, with the approval of hospital officials but without immediate supervision by a nurse. A hospital may allow a patient to ''self-administer both hospital-issued medications and the patient's own medications brought into the hospital,'' the proposal says. In the past, hospitals have often restricted patients' ability to give medications to themselves.
Another proposal would relax requirements for hospitals to notify the federal government immediately after the death of any patient who had been confined with certain wrist restraints like those used to prevent patients from harming themselves by pulling out intravenous tubes.
Other proposals would eliminate requirements for hospitals to keep detailed logs of infection control problems and would relieve certain organ transplant centers of the need to certify the blood type of organ donors. Hospitals would still have to investigate outbreaks of infections, and other medical experts would check on donors' blood type.
The administration said it was proposing the second change ''in an effort to reduce the administrative burden for transplant centers and the surgeons'' who obtain organs for transplants.
The administration also proposed eliminating fire safety standards for certain kidney dialysis centers. The federal standards duplicate state and local standards and would require some dialysis centers to make costly structural changes, it said.
Federal officials would also eliminate a detailed list of emergency equipment that must be available in the operating rooms of outpatient surgery centers. Such clinics would have leeway to decide what equipment was needed for the procedures they performed.
Under current rules, each hospital must have its own governing body, which is legally responsible for its operations. Under the proposal, a multihospital system could have a single governing body for all its hospitals.
The administration will accept public comments on the proposals for 60 days and will review the comments before issuing final rules with the force of law.
Not all the rules are aimed at saving money. One proposal would discontinue use of the term ''Medicaid recipients'' to refer to low-income people receiving medical assistance. In the future, the government will refer to them as Medicaid beneficiaries, just as it speaks of Medicare beneficiaries.

HEADLINE: In Queens, Neglected Sector Attracts Big Developers

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Willets Point, the unsightly jumble of auto shops in northeastern Queens, looks pretty much as it did in May 2007, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced plans for a $3 billion mixed-use development on the site -- with the notable exception that Citi Field, the new home of the New York Mets, now looms over it.
The streets still have no sidewalks and are pocked with huge potholes and littered with garbage, broken glass and rusted chassis. Mosquito-attracting puddles linger for days after a rain. And the 250 businesses in the district must still rely on cesspools rather than sewers. Only a few small shops have closed since the city began assembling the site.
But city officials say their project at Willets Point has reached an important milestone and is moving full speed ahead. They say they are gratified that despite the uncertain economic climate, a number of developers, including some big names, responded last month to a request for proposals sent out in May to 29 companies that had indicated interest in the project. 
''After receiving numerous responses for the first phase of development, we are another step closer to the new Willets Point,'' said Thomas McKnight, an executive vice president of the city Economic Development Corporation. ''This project will create thousands of jobs and allow an environmentally contaminated area to become a model center of economic growth for Queens and New York City.''
The applicants themselves are barred by a confidentiality agreement from acknowledging that they have submitted proposals. But public officials, developers and other real estate specialists say about half a dozen companies are seeking the development rights for the first phase of the project.
Among them are the Related Companies, the developer of the Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market, a shopping center in the South Bronx; Silverstein Properties, the developer of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan; and Macerich, the owner of the Queens Center mall in nearby Flushing, which teamed up with AvalonBay Communities, the developer of Avalon Riverview North, a luxury residential complex in Long Island City.
Related, which also developed the Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle in Manhattan, is believed to have teamed up with Sterling Equities, the real estate company founded by Fred Wilpon and Saul B. Katz, the owners of the Mets. Sterling, like other developers on the list, would not say if it had responded.
The one applicant that has gone public is TDC Development, a Queens company with Chinese backers that is one of the developers of Flushing Commons, a five-acre mixed-use project.
On its Web site, TDC states that it is one of the ''finalists'' for Willets Point, but the company president, Michael Meyer, said in an e-mail from China that he could not discuss the project until the city Economic Development Corporation ''gives the green light.''
Willets Point, sometimes known as the Iron Triangle, is bounded by Roosevelt Avenue to the south, the Van Wyck Expressway and the Flushing River to the east; Northern Boulevard to the north and 126th Street to the west.
As approved by the City Council in 2008, Willets Point was supposed to be built all at once and include 5,500 units of housing, a local convention center and 500,000 square feet of office space.
Instead, developers were asked to submit proposals for a first phase of 12.75 acres to be located closest to Citi Field, extending from 126th Street to 127th Street, and from Roosevelt Avenue to 35th Avenue. This phase would include up to 680,000 square feet of retail space, up to 400 units of housing (of which about a third would be income restricted), a hotel, two acres of open space and parking.
An additional 7.5 acres would be set aside as a vacant buffer zone to separate the new development from the auto-parts businesses. The city says that it now controls nearly 90 percent of the land needed for the first phase and intends to acquire the rest through condemnation if necessary. City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras, who represents the area, said the city was still negotiating with nine property owners.
In submitting their bids, applicants also had to supply a ''concept plan'' for the entire 62-acre district.
The designated developer will be responsible for cleaning up the site, perhaps with the help of the state brownfields tax credit program. But the infrastructure will be the city's responsibility. Officials say they plan to begin constructing sanitary and storm sewers later this fall, a project that is expected to take 18 months. They say they expect to choose a development team by spring.
Though the project has the support of politicians, some business owners are still fighting it. Michael Rikon, one of their lawyers, accused the city of trying to clear the site to make way for additional parking for the ballpark, which is much closer to Willets Point than its predecessor, Shea Stadium.
''It's just a sham,'' Mr. Rikon said, referring to the project. ''No developer can build there, and it will cost billions of dollars to correct the conditions that exist. What will happen is that Bloomberg will go out of office, and the project will be forgotten again.''
In a brief filed last month with the appellate division of the New York Supreme Court, Mr. Rikon argued that since no developer has been selected Willets Point cannot be considered a ''public use'' that would justify condemnation.
But Lisa Bova-Hiatt, a deputy chief of the city law department, said Willets Point is part of an urban renewal plan, which the courts have viewed as a valid public use. ''The notion that you can't use eminent domain without first designating a developer is clearly a mistake,'' she said.
Opponents say there are other legal hurdles that could delay or thwart development. They have argued that dividing the project into stages was not permitted under the plan approved by the City Council because cleaning up only one part of the site at a time runs the risk of recontamination.
They also contend that it would violate environmental laws to start building at Willets Point until two ramps are added to connect the new development to the Van Wyck Expressway to ease traffic.
''It is our belief that this project, if built, would put so much traffic on the Van Wyck as to immobilize it,'' said Michael B. Gerrard, a Columbia law professor who is also representing the business owners.
City officials say the ramps are included in the overall plan but are not needed for the first phase.
Yet is it realistic to imagine that redevelopment will occur anytime soon on a site that has bedeviled city officials and civil leaders for decades? ''I think it's absolutely realistic,'' Ms. Ferreras said, citing the proposals the city has received. ''It will kick-start our economy.''
Specialists in real estate financing who are not working with any of the Willets Point bidders point out that a project of this scale is likely to require a great deal of public financing at a time when the city and state are slashing their spending.
Scott A. Singer, a principal of the Singer & Bassuk Organization, a New York company that arranges financing for major property owners, said that some construction financing is still available today, but that the hurdles for developers -- especially outside Manhattan --are much higher than they used to be.
''It's not necessarily impossible,'' Mr. Singer said, ''but it wouldn't be at all surprising if this moved forward only in fits and starts.''

HEADLINE: Some Risks As Obama Confronts Congress

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
EMPORIA, Va. -- For the last several weeks, President Obama has railed against the ''do-nothing Congress.'' Not content with that, he is now needling it as the ''know-nothing Congress.''
On the road in the important electoral states of Virginia and North Carolina the past two days, Mr. Obama has joked that his administration is breaking up its $447 billion jobs bill into separate chunks so it would be easier for befuddled Republicans in the Senate to understand. 
But the increasingly caustic tone of the president's attacks on Congress raises a question: How long can Mr. Obama continue to hammer Republicans without exhausting the patience of voters who elected him to be an alternative to Washington partisanship -- and without risking the perception that he is part of the problem?
As his bus rolled from the Blue Ridge Mountains toward the Virginia Piedmont, the president delivered an unwavering message: the nation is facing a jobs crisis of historic proportions, and Republicans are blocking his attempts to deal with it.
''Maybe they just couldn't understand the whole bill at once,'' Mr. Obama said to a chortling crowd at the airport in Asheville, N.C. ''We're going to break it up into bite-size pieces.''
Republicans seem likely to reject several parts of Mr. Obama's package, including new money for retaining teachers and repairing schools. And the president's acerbic tone suggests that he knows as much.
Running against a hostile Congress is an appealing strategy for a president who, however much he has slipped in the polls, is still far more popular with voters than are his foes on Capitol Hill. Polls also show that most voters support large parts of the jobs bill, a point Mr. Obama drove home at every stop.
But the approach is not without risks for the president.
''What he's obviously trying to do is model himself on Harry Truman and the 'do-nothing Congress,' '' said David Winston, a Republican strategist. ''The problem with that is that the unemployment rate in November of 1948 was 3.8 percent.''
While Mr. Obama's partisan jabs appeal to his Democratic base, they may turn off independent voters, who flocked to him in 2008 in part because of his carefully cultivated image as a leader who rises above the partisan fray. With the jobless rate closer to 10 percent than 4 percent, they may start to tune out the president.
The risks and advantages of the strategy were on display Tuesday at Guilford Technical Community College in Jamestown, N.C., where Mr. Obama spoke about the first piece of the jobs bill to face a vote: $35 billion in federal aid to states and cities for teachers, firefighters and police officers.
Mark Jewell, a 47-year-old teacher trainer, said that North Carolina's schools desperately needed that money, and that he backed the president's strategy of forcing Republicans to declare their position on every component of the jobs bill.
''We're going back 50 years because of a Congress that wants to vote against anything Obama does,'' Mr. Jewell said. ''The Republicans are using it as a campaign tactic.''
But Thomas O'Connell, a 20-year-old student at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, said that blaming Congress was not enough. ''If he's going to say the system is broken, he's got to put forward something of substance himself,'' he said.
Mr. O'Connell, who described himself as an Obama supporter but a disenchanted one, said he wished the president would propose public financing of political campaigns, rather than raising $1 billion for his own campaign.
There was a lot of sympathy for the president's predicament among those who lined up to hear him at the community college. But there was also a sense that people's patience was limited.
''We want to stand behind him and support him, but at some point we also want to see forward motion,'' said Natalie Hopkins, an administrator in the Guilford County school district.
White House officials argue that Mr. Obama has laid out a detailed list of remedies in the American Jobs Act, including school aid and help for veterans in finding jobs, which the president will highlight with the first lady on Wednesday in Virginia.
In the end, they argued, Republicans will support some of the measures. But with at least five votes on parts of the bill likely to come up in the Senate, the exercise could keep the spotlight on those lawmakers until Thanksgiving. ''This is the first act of a long drama,'' a senior White House official said last week.
Mr. Obama seemed to recognize the yearning for an end to the rancor. He spoke of his efforts to find common cause with Republicans, telling the crowd in heavily Democratic Asheville, ''Some of you have been mad at me for trying too hard to cooperate with them, haven't you?'' And he praised a free trade agreement with South Korea that passed the Senate with Republican support.
He also acknowledged that the Republicans had come up with an alternative to his jobs plan, though he quickly dismissed it. Speaking at a high school here, Mr. Obama claimed that the package would gut environmental regulations, roll back Wall Street reforms, leave 30 million Americans without health insurance and perhaps even cost jobs.
''I don't know how you present a plan for jobs that results in less jobs,'' Mr. Obama said to titters. ''I mean, they didn't call it the American No-Jobs Act.''

HEADLINE: Three Lawmakers Propose Cutting Contractor Wages

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Already facing the prospect of losing billions of dollars in revenue from cuts in government spending, federal contractors could also see limits on how much they can be paid in salary with federal funds. 
Several lawmakers are asking the special debt-reduction committee to consider curbing the federal wages paid to top employees of government contractors to make them comparable with the salaries of federal employees. Currently, the top five employees of a company can be paid up to nearly $700,000 a year each in salary, bonuses and deferred compensation.
In a letter to the members of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, Senators Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, proposed lowering the cap to $200,000, and said that reining in the amount of money contractors can charge the government for salaries would help reduce the deficit by billions of dollars. In the House, the measure is being pushed by Representative Paul Tonko, Democrat of New York.
The recommendation made last week is similar to a salary cap proposed by President Obama last month in his own deficit reduction plan. The White House estimates that limiting the wages paid to contractors would save about $3 billion over a decade. Lawmakers say the proposal would not limit employee compensation from nongovernment revenue sources.
The proposed recommendation from Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Grassley and Mr. Tonko -- one of many being made to the panel by lawmakers -- would also expand the cap to cover all of a contractor's employees, not just the top employees. The lawmakers said that inflated contractor salaries were passed on to government through higher bids for goods and services. In their letter, the lawmakers said that from 1998 to 2010, the rate for contractor salaries grew 53 percent faster than the rate of inflation.
''It's excessive,'' Mr. Tonko said. ''Taxpayer dollars should not be used as a reward for contractor executives, especially when other segments of society are hurting.''
Federal contactors say they are opposed to any changes in the compensation rules.
''It's a good sound bite, but it doesn't work,'' said Stan Soloway, president of the Professional Services Council, a trade group in Arlington, Va., that represents government contractors. ''This is not about contractors gouging the government. It's about the government getting top talent for the work it needs.''
Mr. Soloway, who was a deputy under secretary for defense in the Clinton administration, said the government already had control over what was paid to contractors.
''The current rates represent the maximum that can be charged to the government, but the actual amount an individual company can charge to the government is tied directly to what the government determines is fair and reasonable,'' he said. ''Not everyone is getting $700,000 in salary.''
Mr. Soloway said lowering the amount that contractors could be paid would exacerbate a problem already experienced by government agencies -- keeping good people with government salaries.
Contractors' compensation is set by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. The office decides how much in salaries and bonuses the government will reimburse a contractor, based on available surveys on executive pay at publicly traded United States companies with more than $50 million in annual sales, according to the agency.

HEADLINE: It All Adds Up

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
The same things making many air travelers grumble these days -- rising fares with more and more fees, fewer flights, planes filled to the brim -- are the things giving airline executives a reason to smile.
After a decade of losing money because of cutthroat competition, slumping traveler demand and volatile fuel prices, the industry has found a way to regain control of its fortunes -- and make money -- by shelving its 1990s strategy of aggressive growth. Despite the weak economy, most domestic airlines will have their second consecutive profitable year in 2011, after losing $55 billion since 2001.
The one exception is American Airlines, which is set to report another quarterly loss on Wednesday. Once the largest airline in the United States, American has lost its top perch and is struggling with high costs and debt, and acrimonious labor relations. 
American trails its top rivals after being left out of the major mergers that have consolidated the industry. These began with the purchase of Northwest by Delta Air Lines in 2008, which created the nation's biggest airline, and followed last year by the merger of United Airlines and Continental and the purchase of AirTran Airlines by Southwest Airlines. The mergers allowed the biggest airlines to cut service to many smaller markets, ground unprofitable flights and focus on their most profitable hubs. With fewer airlines competing to make their seats the cheapest, they could increase fares. The nation's top five airlines, including joint figures for United-Continental and Southwest-AirTran, accounted for 85 percent of all domestic seats in 2010; that compared with a 64 percent share for the top five in 2000, said Hunter Keay, an aviation analyst at Wolfe Trahan & Company.
''This has been an incredible picture over the past three years,'' Mr. Keay said. ''It's not rocket science. Airlines finally understand basic economics. It's supply and demand. It's fear-based discipline.''
Just looking at the number of seats available, domestic airlines' capacity peaked in 2005 and has generally fallen since. But the cuts have been even steeper when the number of seats is compared with the size of the economy, said John Heimlich, the chief economist for the Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade group. That ratio is at its lowest since 1979.
''The industry's survival over the past decade has necessitated a substantial degree of shrinkage,'' Mr. Heimlich said. ''It's a combination of how oversupplied and under-demanded we've been and how tough the decade has been. That's an unfortunate result. Most businesses would rather see an entity grow profitably rather than shrink profitability.''
With fewer scheduled flights, planes are now fuller than they have ever been. The percentage of filled seats on international and domestic flights rose to a record high of 81.9 percent in 2010, compared with 72.9 percent in 2000, according to figures compiled by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. And that number does not entirely capture how full most flights are to the most popular destinations at the most desirable times.
Meanwhile, the flight experience has worsened, as the big airlines have reduced service and stopped providing free meals or even blankets and pillows on flights. Legroom shrank on many of the low-cost airlines. Spirit Airlines, for instance, is now flying Airbus A320s with a seat pitch -- or the distance between seats -- of 28 inches. (A typical pitch at the other airlines is 31 inches.) That allows it to pack 178 passengers on these planes, 28 more than JetBlue, which flies similar planes, according to Matthew Daimler, the founder of SeatGuru.com.
Domestic fares, which have risen in recent years, averaged $337 last year. Adjusted for inflation, they are still nearly 30 percent lower today than they were in the mid-1990s, but the fare is only part of the price passengers pay today.
The airlines now generate extra revenue from passengers by charging for a variety of services and goods, including checked bags, priority seating and onboard items like food, television and blankets.
The fees can be confusing, with little consistency across airlines. American, Delta and Continental, for instance, charge $25 for the first checked bag, while AirTran charges $20 and Southwest and JetBlue charge nothing. Some airlines charge extra for exit row seats or to sit in the first few rows of coach. Some apply cancellation charges. Some provide satellite television free; others charge for it.
''The airlines are only catching up to other consumer businesses,'' said Richard H. Anderson, Delta's chairman and chief executive. ''Look at rental car companies, which offer you GPS for a fee, or to fill up your car or have one-way drop charges. Look at hotels, where you pay for Wi-Fi, where you pay for the drinks in your room. You tailor your product to what the consumer wants. One thing we understand now is what our costs are when we price our products.''
The new revenue has provided a critical shot in the arm and helped airlines cushion the impact of fuel costs, which now account for about 40 percent of the industry's fixed costs, up from 30 percent before 2005.
In 1990, tickets accounted for 88 percent of the airlines' passenger revenue. In 2010, that share dropped to 71 percent. The new revenue accounted for most of the difference. Bag fees alone brought in revenue of more than $784 million in the first quarter -- out of total revenue for the industry of $43 billion.
''The industry's ability to adapt to the harsh economic climate of 2009 is a great example of its willingness and ability to adapt,'' Barclays Capital analysts wrote in a recent industry report.
The airlines had little choice. In the decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, 41 airlines filed for bankruptcy. And the industry is still under significant stress. A slower economy could force passengers, especially business travelers, to travel less. Global business travel, which had been rebounding, fell in August compared with the same month last year, according to the International Air Transport Association.
Airline shares have suffered this year as a result of economic uncertainty. Shares of Delta and Southwest have lost a third of their value this year, while United is down 14 percent in that period.
American Airlines has been particularly hard hit because of growing investor concerns that it cannot weather yet another slump in travel and may have to file for bankruptcy protection, something it has persistently refused to do.
Shares in its parent company, the AMR Corporation, have lost 64 percent of their value this year. American recently said it had ordered 460 new single-aisle planes from Boeing and Airbus to rejuvenate its fleet with more fuel-efficient planes that are cheaper to operate. ''Their turnaround plan is very ambitious, very expensive, and will take a decade to fully flesh out,'' Mr. Keay said. ''The question is whether the macroeconomic environment will grant American that much time.''
While many aviation executives and analysts say most airlines have a more solid financial foundation, they remain cautious, given how fragile the recovery has been.
''It's like the TV show 'The Biggest Loser,' where you just lost 25 pounds but you still weigh 220,'' said Steve Lott, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the trade group. ''You might still be declared a winner, but are you really fit? I think we have a long way before we regain our financial health.''

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Now Biggest Bank in U.S.

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
For Bank of America, it is the end of an era.
With the bank shrinking its balance sheet and selling off assets, the company, based in Charlotte, N.C., surrendered its title as the country's biggest bank Tuesday, another sign of how a money-losing giant assembled over decades is being reshaped into a smaller and, investors hope, more profitable institution.
Bank of America, with $2.22 trillion in assets reported Tuesday in its third-quarter earnings, is now second to JPMorgan Chase, which has $2.29 trillion assets. It also ranks second to JPMorgan Chase in terms of branches and total deposits. 
Analysts said it was more evidence of how Bank of America's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, is reversing the legacy of his controversial predecessor, Ken Lewis, an empire builder who craved being the biggest in United States banking and whose creation ultimately needed two federal bailouts to survive the financial crisis.
''There's been a huge philosophical change in who they want to be,'' said Mike Mayo, a veteran bank analyst with Credit Agricole Securities. ''This is a milestone that marks the end of a two-decade-long period during which they aspired and eventually became the largest bank.''
In today's slow-growth economy, though, bigger is not necessarily better. And the challenges Bank of America still faces were evident in the numbers it released Tuesday.
Buoyed by one-time gains from accounting changes and asset sales, Bank of America reported a $6.23 billion profit for the third quarter, but the headline number camouflaged weak results in many of its businesses. Still, investors cheered the news, pushing the bank's shares up 10 percent to $6.64 a share.
Although its investment bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, has been a crucial source of profit recently as other businesses like mortgage lending hemorrhaged money, the slow trading environment and financial uncertainty in Europe caused trading revenue to drop. The company's global banking and markets revenue fell to $5.2 billion from $7 billion, and the unit reported a $302 million loss in the third quarter, a sharp contrast to the $1.46 billion gain a year ago.
Mr. Mayo estimated that the bank's underlying core revenues dropped 17 percent, as other businesses like global commercial banking, card services and consumer real estate services also posted declines from a year ago. One exception was the company's wealth management business, where revenue and net income both rose.
Still, the story behind the $6.23 billion profit was mostly a tale of one-time gains from accounting changes and asset sales, including $4.5 billion from positive adjustments to the value of its outstanding debt, a $1.7 billion accounting gain on the perceived riskiness of its debt and a pretax gain of $3.6 billion from the sale of half its stake in China Construction Bank.
''It's not like 2007 or 2008 where there are losses that threaten the bank's capital's position,'' said Christopher Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer. ''But nothing was particularly great and trading was very weak.''
Without the special items, Bank of America would have earned about $2.7 billion, which included pulling back $1.7 billion it had set aside, largely for borrowers who fail to pay their consumer and credit card loans.
Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays Capital, counted 15 special items in the quarter, down from 16 in the second quarter but more than the 12 in the first quarter. ''It's a big company undergoing a transformation.''
The bank reported net income of 56 cents a share, compared with a loss of $7.3 billion or 77 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Analysts had been expecting the bank to earn 28 cents a share in the third quarter. Revenue rose to $28.7 billion from $26.9 billion, although that too was pumped by one-time gains.
For investors, the red ink flowing from Bank of America's disastrous 2008 acquisition of Countrywide Financial, the subprime mortgage giant, remains the biggest worry. Both the federal government and private investors are seeking compensation for tens of billions of dollars in losses on securities backed by subprime mortgages.
Part of the reason investors breathed a sigh of relief Tuesday was that the red ink from subprime mortgages eased in the last quarter. Provisions for so-called put-backs, in which investors try to force the bank to buy back soured mortgages by arguing they were improperly originated and bundled into securities, fell to $278 million. In the second quarter, these provisions totaled a whopping $14 billion, including an $8 deal billion with investors that include the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Litigation costs fell to $290 million from $1.5 billion in the second quarter.
In 2006, Bank of America surpassed Citigroup to become the biggest bank by market capitalization, an event that can be seen as a high-water mark of Mr. Lewis's era. Today, its $67 billion market value lags Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.
Bruce R. Thompson, the company's chief financial officer, said he expected assets to keep shrinking in the coming months, as some loans come due and are not renewed and the company's Canadian credit card business is sold in the fourth quarter.
''We're not focused on the size of the balance sheet, what we're focused on is getting the balance sheet that's best for our customers and best for us,'' he said.
In fact, while JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup showed slight growth in terms of total loans in the third quarter, Bank of America's overall loan portfolio declined by about 0.9 percent compared with the second quarter, Mr. Goldberg noted.
The company's headcount is also set to drop sharply from the 290,509 recorded during the third quarter. Roughly 2,000 employees were told last quarter their jobs were being eliminated, and 30,000 more are set to go over the next three years as part of Project New BAC, an efficiency initiative aimed at cutting $5 billion in expenses in its first phase.
Mr. Moynihan defended Bank of America's controversial new $5-a-month debit card fee Tuesday, arguing that customers who bring more of their banking business to the company will be able to avoid it.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Imagined in America

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Hong Kong
After spending last week talking with Hong Kong entrepreneurs about a bill, just passed by the U.S. Senate, to clear the way for tariffs on Chinese exports to America if China doesn't revalue its currency, there are three things I have to say. One, I really hope the people pushing this bill do not give up. Two, I really hope the people pushing this bill do not succeed. And, three, I really hope no one thinks this legislation will make any sustainable dent in our unemployment problem, which requires much more radical rethinking.
I support this legislation in theory because China needs a wake-up call. I know, China never responds to in-your-face pressure -- not immediately. But it began revaluing its currency upward in 2005, the last time the Senate brandished a big stick. The fact is, China's strategy of using low wages and a cheap currency to build up an enormous export-led growth engine -- while using its huge market to lure and compel companies to transfer their next-generation technology to China as well -- is now hurting both sides. 
China is spending tons of money manipulating its currency downward and, in the process, creating domestic inflation and a real estate bubble, which is weakening its competiveness. Meanwhile, it is hair-raising to hear stories in Hong Kong about the number of American companies feeling the need to transfer advanced technology to China under pressure from Beijing officials -- and being afraid to complain to Washington about unfair trade practices. Yes, China's leaders, fearing unemployment, will revalue their currency at their own pace. But if pushing this bill even marginally slows the pace of American firms shifting operations here, and gives others more time to adapt, it will be worth it.
But, Lord in heaven, do not let the House pass this bill. That would trigger a trade war in the middle of our Great Recession. We tried that in 1930. It didn't end well. Worse, today it would distract us from thinking about the real issue: How do we adjust our labor market to the simultaneous intensification of globalization and the I.T. revolution, the biggest thing happening in the world today? The intensification of globalization means more parts of any product or service can be produced anywhere, and the intensification of the I.T. revolution means more parts of any product or service can be created by machines and software.
I am typing this column on a Dell laptop that says ''Made in China'' on the bottom. In fact, it was assembled in China -- but the design, memory board, screen, casing and dozens of other parts were all made in other countries. And while the machine says ''Made in China,'' the lion's share of its value and profit goes to the firm that conceived the idea and orchestrated that supply chain -- Dell Inc. in Texas.
We are never going to get those labor-intensive assembly jobs back from China -- the wage differentials are far too great, no matter how much China revalues its currency. We need to focus on multiplying more people at the high-value ideation and orchestration end of the supply chain, and in the manufacturing processes where one person can be highly productive, and well paid, by operating multiple machines. We need to focus on ''Imagined in America'' and ''Orchestrated From America'' and ''Made in America by a smart worker using a phalanx of smarter robots.'' In total value terms, America still manufactures almost as much as China. We just do it with far fewer people, which is why we need more start-ups.
But we also need to stop thinking that a middle class can be sustained only by factory jobs. Thirty years ago, Hong Kong was a manufacturing center. Now its economy is 97 percent services. It has adjusted so well that this year the Hong Kong government is giving a bonus of $775 to each of its residents. One reason is that Hong Kong has transformed itself into a huge tourist center that last year received 36 million visitors -- 23 million from China. Their hotel stays, dining and jewelry purchases are driving prosperity here. The U.S. Commerce Department says 801,000 Mainland Chinese visited the U.S. last year, adding $5 billion to the U.S. economy. More Chinese want to come, but, for security reasons, visas are hard to obtain. If we let in as many Chinese tourists as Hong Kong, it would inject more than $115 billion into what is a highly unionized U.S. hotel, restaurant, gaming and tourism industry.
Another idea officials here offer is that the United States invites Chinese firms to invest in toll bridges, toll roads, and rail systems across the United States, in partnership with American companies. They could build them, and operate them for a set number of years, until their investment pays out, and then transfer them to full U.S. ownership. It may be the only way we can rebuild our infrastructure.
Yes, China manipulates its currency and market access. But the reason we are so vulnerable is that we have no leverage. We don't save; we overconsume; we don't plan; and we have not invested enough in infrastructure and education. Dealing with a superpower like China without leverage? Let me know how that works out for you.

HEADLINE: Gloom Grips Consumers; It May Be Home Prices

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Ernest Markey lost his stone-cutting business in 2009. He then sold his home for half a million dollars less than its value at the peak of the housing bubble and moved with his wife, Marie, to a smaller home in a less affluent suburb. They gave up two new cars and bought one. Used.
The Markeys have since patched together a semblance of their old life, opening a new stone-cutting shop. But they do not expect that they will ever recover financially from the loss of equity in their old home.
''For two years I kept thinking that things would get better,'' Mr. Markey, 51, said as he stood in his empty store on a recent weekday. ''Now I think the future doesn't look so good.'' 
The United States has a confidence problem: a nation long defined by irrational exuberance has turned gloomy about tomorrow. Consumers are holding back, businesses are suffering and the economy is barely growing.
There are good reasons for gloom -- incomes have declined, many people cannot find jobs, few trust the government to make things better -- but as Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, noted earlier this year, those problems are not sufficient to explain the depth of the funk.
That has led a growing number of economists to argue that the collapse of housing prices, a defining feature of this downturn, is also a critical and underappreciated impediment to recovery. Americans have lost a vast amount of wealth, and they have lost faith in housing as an investment. They lack money, and they lack the confidence that they will have more money tomorrow.
Many say they believe that the bust has permanently changed their financial trajectory.
''People don't expect their home to regain value, and that's really led to a change in consumer attitudes about the economy that we've just never seen before,'' said Richard Curtin, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan who directs its Survey of Consumers. The latest data from the survey, released Friday by Thomson Reuters, shows that expectations for economic growth have fallen to the lowest level since May 1980.
In Orlando, a city that trades in upbeat fantasies, the housing crash has been particularly painful. The total value of area homes has fallen below the total mortgage debt on those homes, according to the real estate analytics firm CoreLogic. In the parlance of the real estate world, Orlando is underwater, a distinction matched by Las Vegas.
''I don't know that it's going to get better. We just have to get used to it,'' said Sherry DeWeese, whose home in Ocoee, a northwestern suburb of Orlando, is worth less than she paid for it 13 years ago -- and about a third of its value at the peak of the market. ''It was nothing to buy whatever we wanted. Now we just think about what we really need.''
Economists have only recently devoted serious study to how a decline in housing prices affects consumer spending, not least because this is the first decline in the average price of an American home since the Great Depression. A 2007 review of existing research by the Congressional Budget Office reported that people reduce spending by $20 to $70 a year for every $1,000 decline in the value of their home.
This ''wealth effect'' is significantly larger for changes in home equity than in the value of other investments, such as stocks, apparently because people regard changes in housing prices as more likely to endure.
A recent paper by Karl E. Case, an economics professor at Wellesley College, and two co-authors estimated the decline in home prices from 2005 to 2009 caused consumer spending to be $240 billion lower in 2010 than it otherwise would have been. That figure is equal to about 1.7 percent of annual economic activity, enough to be the difference between the mediocre recent growth and healthy growth. And it does not include all the other effects of the housing crash, including the low level of new home construction, that are also weighing on the economy.
Roy Pugsley, who owns a pool supply store in Winter Garden, another suburb here, said that he made 2,500 fewer sales during the first eight months of 2011 compared with the same period in 2007. That translates to one less person walking through the doors to buy chemicals or toys or spare parts in each hour that the store is open.
Mr. Pugsley said business actually increased in the early days of the recession; customers had told him they were spending more time at home. But now people buy only what they need for maintenance. ''People realized that it wasn't going to get any better, and they stopped spending on their pools, too,'' he said.
At Milcarsky's Appliance Center in the adjacent town of Longwood, business now comes from people remodeling their own homes rather than builders, and customers are picking cheaper models, said Doug Morey, a sales manager.
''People who might have bought that'' -- he taps a stove with chunky burners, designed to look like it belongs in a restaurant kitchen -- ''are double-thinking it. Everyone has had to cut back.''
That means Milcarsky's has cut back too. The company, which employed 26 people three years ago, now has about a dozen workers, and they are making less in salary and commissions.
''I might like to think that I'm middle class, but I'm not. I'm not anymore,'' said Rae-Anne Crotty, a customer service manager at the store. She now shops for groceries at discount stores, she said, and buys gifts for her children at Christmas but not on their birthdays.
It remains the prevailing view of economic policy makers that economic activity will eventually return to the same trajectory as before the recession. Mr. Bernanke and others have said that they see no evidence of any permanent change in the economy. Previous bouts of economic pessimism, as in the early 1980s and early 1990s, went away once growth picked up.
But many people in the Orlando area do not share this confidence, at least not when it comes to their own prospects. Instead, like the Markeys, they are settling into lives of less prosperity.
The couple moved to Orlando 12 years ago from central Massachusetts in search of opportunities. The business Mr. Markey created, Stone Giant, grew to include two factories and 60 employees, and it installed granite countertops in up to 15 new kitchens every day.
His new company, Winter Park Granite, now installs two kitchens on the average day. He has eight employees but cannot afford health insurance for them or himself. The family income last year was less than a third of the $175,000 that he and his wife made in 2007, their last good year.
And he sees little room for growth. He has stopped spending money on advertising.
''We're never going to get that big again,'' he said. ''I was someone employing people and taking people to the good life. Now I'm just trying to survive.''

HEADLINE: Hopes of Big Deal in Europe, Then Denials

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; Stephen Castle contributed reporting from Brussels, and Louise Story from New York.

 BODY:
PARIS -- The roller-coaster saga of Europe's debt crisis continued Tuesday, as hopes that Germany and France were near agreement on a big infusion of bailout money sent American stocks up in late trading.
Officials are working on the broad outlines of a three-pronged agreement to keep the debt crisis from spiraling into Europe's large countries.
They have been giving serious consideration to increasing the size of a new euro zone bailout fund of 440 billion euros to at least 1 trillion to 1.5 trillion euros (about $1.3 trillion to $2.06 trillion), an idea pushed by the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who argues that similar action helped stem the financial crisis that started on Wall Street in 2008. 
Europeans are also discussing recapitalizing many European banks as insurance in case the crisis worsens; as well as forcing banks to take sizable losses on their holdings of Greek debt to help the country get back on its feet.
The discussions have taken on greater urgency since Moody's warned late Monday of a possible downgrade to France's flawless credit rating. French finance officials worry that any such move would make it hard for Paris to negotiate solutions, according to an official who was not authorized to discuss the situation publicly.
The rally in American stock markets was set off by a report late Tuesday on the Web site of The Guardian, a British newspaper, that France and Germany had agreed to increase the size of the rescue fund -- the European Financial Stability Facility -- to as much as 2 trillion euros to contain the crisis and backstop Europe's banks. But almost as soon as those hopes soared, European officials quickly brought them back to earth, with denials flooding forth from Brussels, Paris and Berlin.
This latest round of rumors and rebuttals about a European solution was a repeat of earlier situations.. Such episodes have played out several times since the debt crisis intensified this year. Most recently, investors have been pegging hopes on a meeting of Europe's leaders set for this coming Sunday in Brussels, anticipating that a comprehensive solution to the debt crisis might be unveiled.
Fueling those hopes had been impressions given last weekend in Paris, at a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20, that a grand plan was forthcoming. Those conveying such signals included the French finance minister, Francois Baroin.
Mr. Geithner said at the Paris meeting that he was encouraged by the speed and strategy of the European planning, but said the Europeans still had a lot of work to do on the fine print. ''As you know it's all in the details, and it's very hard to judge the impact something will have until you see it take shape,'' he said.
And on Monday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany quickly brought things back to reality, warning that ''dreams'' of a package that would immediately resolve the problems were unrealistic.
Eventually, whether this coming weekend or sometime after, European leaders will almost certainly come forward with some form of solution that they hope will convince investors that they have the wherewithal to keep the crisis from infecting Spain and Italy, the third- and fourth-largest economies in the euro monetary union. That is the foremost goal of all their efforts.
But should the leaders fail to devise a convincing enough plan, there is widespread fear the borrowing costs for both of those countries will rise so high that the governments will be shut out of borrowing in international markets -- the same way Greece, Ireland and Portugal were before they had to be bailed out. The overriding worry, though, is that there may not be enough money to bail out Italy and Spain, or to keep the contagion from spreading even farther.
Finance officials want to have something in place before their bosses -- the presidents and prime ministers of the Group of 20 industrialized nations -- gather Nov. 3 and 4 in Cannes, France, to discuss the economic and financial problems that now plague both the European and American economies.
But even if a deal on the bailout fund is agreed to, any stock market rally might not prove to be permanent, as the realization sank in that the costs could weigh heavily on certain countries for some time to come. That was the case in the autumn of 2008, when American officials struggled to contain the fallout from the demise of Lehman Brothers. Back then, a number of market relief rallies were followed by a continuing decline in stocks.
A fresh reminder of the current crisis's contagion dangers came on Tuesday, when France rushed to defend its AAA credit rating -- one of the few top ratings left among major Western economies -- after a warning by Moody's Investors Service that the French government was at risk from the Continent's widening sovereign debt problems. Mr. Baroin was compelled to go on French television Tuesday to declare the government would ''do everything to avoid being downgraded.''
The price that France pays to borrow on international financial markets compared with Germany surged on Tuesday to its highest level since the euro was introduced in 1999. Rising borrowing costs are what pushed weaker countries, including Greece, Ireland and Portugal, to seek bailouts.
More problems in Italy or Spain would stretch the finances of big countries like France and Germany even further.
While France's accounts are still in better shape than those of many of its neighbors, they could deteriorate if the government provided significant financing to other European countries or to its own banking system in a bid to keep the euro crisis from spiraling. Such moves could give rise to significant new liabilities for the government's balance sheet, Moody's warned.
President Nicolas Sarkozy has made it a priority to keep France's top rating intact, especially headed into a campaign against his Socialist opponent, Francois Hollande -- who, like Mr. Sarkozy, has vowed to cut France's deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2013.

HEADLINE: In Defense of the Back-Room Deal

BYLINE: By JORDAN TAMA. 
Jordan Tama, an assistant professor of international relations at American University, is the author of ''Terrorism and National Security Reform: How Commissions Can Drive Change During Crises.''

 BODY:
Washington
THE Congressional ''super committee'' charged with finding $1.5 trillion in debt savings through 2021 is under growing attack from both the left and the right for carrying out most of its work in secret. As Senator Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican, said recently, ''We don't get a better result for the people of this country when things are done behind closed doors.''
But greater openness by the panel, officially known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, would actually be harmful to the public interest. Private meetings are essential to give the committee's six Republicans and six Democrats the freedom to step away from party orthodoxies, conduct serious negotiations and search for common ground, rather than engage in political posturing. 
For the committee's recommendations to be voted on in the full House and Senate, 7 of the 12 committee members must agree on them. If all of the meetings were held in public -- as a number of lawmakers and open-government advocates propose -- the prospects for such agreement would drop from slim to none.
History reveals the importance of extensive private talks for members of a bipartisan group to get to know one another and pursue compromises. Eleven of the 18 members of President Obama's fiscal commission endorsed a $4 trillion deficit reduction package, but only after months of private deliberations. When the panel did hold public hearings, they resulted in partisan grandstanding about fiscal stimulus and health care reform.
Private deliberation can also help ensure legislative follow-up. In 1981, a crisis in Social Security financing prompted President Ronald Reagan to appoint a 15-member commission led by Alan Greenspan (then an economic consultant) and including seven members of Congress. The panel achieved a breakthrough at a three-day retreat in Alexandria, Va., during which commissioners agreed on the amount of revenue needed to keep Social Security solvent and began discussing proposals to meet the shortfall through benefit cuts and tax increases.
Later, a subgroup of five members negotiated the details with House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. and the Reagan administration in numerous private meetings in lawmakers' offices, at the home of the White House chief of staff, James A. Baker III, and at the presidential guesthouse. Congress enacted the resulting compromise in 1983.
Secrecy has also enabled commissions to succeed on national security issues. Few people thought the 9/11 Commission could reach a consensus because its membership included five Republicans and five Democrats. They disagreed on many issues, including the use of subpoenas to compel administration cooperation and the assignment of blame to both the Clinton and Bush administrations. But the group ultimately reached consensus on all of its findings and recommendations, including the establishment of the position of national intelligence director. Though the secrecy of many of its meetings provided grist to the mill of (unfounded) 9/11 conspiracy theories, it was necessary.
The commission's leaders, Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, established a bipartisan environment by speaking to the public in tandem and prohibiting commissioners from sitting next to fellow party members at meetings. Encouragingly, the leaders of the deficit super committee, Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, have a friendly and cooperative relationship.
Compared to independent commissions, however, the super committee has a disadvantage: all of its members are sitting members of Congress. For Democrats on the committee, political danger lurks if they back any cuts to entitlement programs, whereas for Republicans, support for any tax increases is even more perilous.
The attacks on the committee for meeting in private are probably motivated as much (or more) by fear of the committee's succeeding as by a commitment to open government. Those calling for greater committee transparency are largely staunch conservatives, like Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, or staunch liberals, like Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, who have opposed a grand bargain that includes significant tax increases and entitlement cuts. They surely know that it will be harder to reach agreement if the panel cannot meet privately.
Critics say it is undemocratic for the super committee to exclude the public from its meetings. But on all issues, elected officials carry out much of their work behind closed doors; secrecy is not in itself undemocratic. Critics also argue that greater transparency would help the committee win broader support by bringing other lawmakers and the public into the process at an earlier stage. But transparency would actually make it far less likely that members would move past posturing to negotiations, and would enable critics to pick apart ideas under consideration before the members could make a strong case for them.
In an age when elected officials rarely deliberate across party lines, private discussions should be welcomed, rather than attacked. This is all the more true considering that the fundamental task before the committee is not to establish facts, but to find a political sweet spot. The committee's success remains a long shot in our age of extreme ideological polarization, but its secrecy gives it a glimmer of hope.

HEADLINE: Market Volatility Hurts Profit at BlackRock

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: BlackRock said that its third-quarter profit fell 3 percent, to $521 million, as the world's largest asset manager battled a volatile stock market and an anemic economic recovery. 

 BODY:
8:51 p.m. | Updated 
The stock market's summer storm, which racked up a long list of victims in finance, even shook one of the industry's most solid performers: BlackRock.
After churning out quarter after quarter of double-digit growth, BlackRock announced on Wednesday that its third-quarter profit fell 3 percent, to $521 million, as the money management industry battled market volatility and an anemic economic recovery. That figure was adjusted to reflect one-time charges, without which the company would have earned $595 million.
 "In this period of uncertainty and volatility, we're very well positioned to serve our clients," Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock's chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. But Mr. Fink, speaking from the Plaza Hotel in New York, where he was hosting a conference for 250 customers, added that the gloomy markets were "causing a lot of stress."
The stock dropped 4.7 percent on Wednesday, to $148.92.
Because BlackRock is the world's largest money manager for institutional and retail investors, its fate is often tied to the ebbs and flows of the stock market.
Earlier this year, when the markets were soaring, BlackRock was reaping the benefits. In April, Mr. Fink highlighted how clients were flocking to equities, or "re-risking," as he put it.
Now, with a choppy stock market, he said spooked investors were "de-risking."
The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted roughly 12 percent in the third quarter, its largest drop since the financial crisis, because of poor economic data and the European debt crisis. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index tumbled 14 percent over the summer months, while European markets fared even worse.
The market woes weighed down BlackRock's third-quarter results. BlackRock's assets under management, an important measure of the company's strength, dropped 3 percent in the period, to $3.35 trillion. The firm's performance fees fell 20 percent, to $91 million.
 "They tend to move around with the markets," said Greggory Warren, an analyst at Morningstar, the research firm.
Despite the turmoil, BlackRock has dodged the financial industry's most serious woes. Unlike the nation's biggest banks, BlackRock does not carry baggage from Wall Street's near collapse in 2008. Nor does it have a trading division, those boom-and-bust businesses that have felled other companies. Despite the weaker profits, revenue rose 6 percent, to $2.2 billion, making it one of the few financial institutions in recent months to show top-line growth.
BlackRock also has advantages over its fellow asset managers. The company, for instance, caters to a mixture of investors, including large institutional funds. "You've got a lot more institutional investors who tend to not bail just because the markets are heading south, whereas retail investors are quick to flee," Mr. Warren said.
 The company has also profited from the turmoil. BlackRock Solutions, which offers risk management advice to troubled institutions and governments across the world, reported revenue of $117 million in the third quarter, compared with $101 million last year. The powerful unit, whose clients have included the Central Bank of Ireland and the Federal Reserve, gained 13 new clients in the quarter.
Even with the anxiety swirling around the global economy, Mr. Fink is hopeful for a turnaround. "This is not 2008," he said on Wednesday. "This is a confidence crisis, not a liquidity crisis."

HEADLINE: Coming Attractions: Occupy Wall St., the Documentary

BYLINE: PATRICK WALL


HIGHLIGHT: Led by a pair of filmmakers from Brooklyn, more than 50 people from more than a dozen American cities are pooling material for a feature-length film about the nascent movement. 

 BODY:
Occupy Wall Street, the protest movement that began in Lower Manhattan and quickly spread across the country and around the world, might be coming to a theater near you.
Led by a pair of filmmakers from Brooklyn, Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell, more than 50 people from more than a dozen American cities are pooling material for a feature-length documentary. The organizers said they envisioned a film told from many perspectives, tapping into the enormous supply of on-the-scene footage from protests around the country.
"I'm interested in finding whatever truth is to be found from whatever angles there are," Ms. Ewell said.
Mr. Aites added, "I expect it to be an immense challenge."
The two filmmakers, 30-somethings who live together in Williamsburg, produced and directed a 2009 documentary about Norwegian black metal, "Until the Light Takes Us." They began filming the protests on Oct. 1, when more than 700 demonstrators werearrested on the Brooklyn Bridge. The next day, Ms. Ewell e-mailed other filmmakers she knew to ask if they'd like to help shoot, edit and produce a documentary about the nascent movement. 
Since then, the project, currently titled "99% - The Occupy Wall Street Collaborative Film," has expanded at nearly the same speed as the movement itself. 
Ms. Ewell said she has spent hundreds of hours reaching out to contributors and collecting footage. The pair created a page on Kickstarter, the online donation site, to raise money for production expenses, including the nominal fee they plan to pay any contributor whose footage is used in the final film. So far, more than 100 supporters on the site have pledged $2,385. 
The amateur and professional filmmakers who have signed onto the project have amassed more than 200 hours of material from Occupy protests in cities including Seattle, Austin, Miami, Nashville, Chicago and Boston. Currently, they can upload low-resolution shots to the group's YouTube channel. The organizers are in the process of setting up a separate server that can store larger quantities of high-quality video.
Ms. Ewell said they were inspired to create the film to fill what they called "a screaming gap" in mainstream coverage of the movement. Referring to footage of the protests he saw on televised news reports, Mr. Aites said, "I'm tired of seeing people drumming that is fairly indistinguishable from the parking lot of a Grateful Dead show."
Most of the coverage, they said, appears superficial and occasionally mocking. (They might be dismayed if reports that MTV's "Real World 27" is seeking Occupy-affiliated cast members turn out to be legitimate.) 
The role of the film, the two said, is to provide an accurate, up-close view of the movement from multiple perspectives - including critical ones.
"We are actively looking for a filmmaker who is not in favor of this movement at all," Ms. Ewell said. But so far, she said, "it's been shockingly hard to find."
To address the imbalance, the filmmakers have been brainstorming "outside parties" they could potentially interview, including economists, hedge-fund managers, the police and the mayor's office.

HEADLINE: The Toll of Stress on Parents - and Kids

BYLINE: JUDITH WARNER


HIGHLIGHT: Gen X parents, according to a new report, are financially, emotionally and logistically challenged like no others in recent memory - which isn't good for the kids. 

 BODY:
Call us "Generation Squeeze."
Gen X parents, says Paul Kershaw, the Canadian academic who has coined the new somewhat inelegant appellation, are financially, emotionally and logistically challenged like no others in recent memory. "The generation raising young kids today is squeezed for time at home, squeezed for income because of the high cost of housing and squeezed for services like child care that would help them balance earning a living with raising a family," he said this week after issuing a new report that compared the costs of living, household incomes and family services today with the financial and living style of families in the 1970s.
Though focused on Canada, his findings directly mirror trends in the United States in the same time period: average household incomes have stagnated over the decades, even as a tiny minority of families have become enormously rich. Housing prices have skyrocketed, putting an ever-greater strain on flat family resources. Health care costs have spiraled; affordable, high-quality child care opportunities haven't expanded at anywhere near the rate needed to keep pace with the influx of women into the workplace. And the time squeeze on families, as the length of the work week (for those with full-time work) has steadily increased, is nothing less than toxic.
Dr. Kershaw makes a set of policy recommendations - a New Deal for Families, he calls them - which, read in an American political context, sound laughably utopian. I reproduce a couple of them here so that you can end your morning with a coffee-snorting guffaw: an 18-month paid family leave for mothers and fathers of newborns, child care services that cost no more than $10 per day.
Here in America, a bill that would allow employees to merely request flex-time arrangements without fearing negative job consequences is malingering in the back offices of Congress. Given the virtual impossibility, for now at least, of addressing our families' stress in any meaningful, systematic way, the burden of stress management - on top of everything else - has to fall on American parents. More often than not, this means America's mothers. This is no side issue: children are exquisitely permeable to parental stress, and studies have shown they're really suffering from the stressors weighing down on their parents. 
An even greater problem than today's acute worries may well be that, for too many American families, stress has essentially become a way of life, one that will live on, unexaminedly, even when our prospects otherwise improve. After all, even back in the 1990s - when the economy was booming - American children surveyed by the Families and Work Institute president Ellen Galinsky said that their No. 1 wish, far greater than the desire to spend more time with working parents, was for their moms and dads to be less stressed.
For the sake of our families, how can we de-stress without making the quest to calm down yet another impossible-seeming demand on our time? (Not to mention a cause for guilt and resentment. I, for one, find patently unhelpful the "Stop obsessing about the economy, you're scaring the children" Recession 101 ad campaign, which assaults me from a bus stop every morning after school drop-off.)
In the long term, the only meaningful way we can address the vise-like squeeze on American families is through political action. In the short term, we're on our own. I do yoga. I'd like to know if others have found a way to do better.

HEADLINE: Is Occupy Wall Street Being Overhyped?

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS AND GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Public opinion on the movement is mixed. How reliable are polls in assessing patterns of human behavior? 

 BODY:
David Brooks: Gail, can we talk about the overhyping of the Occupy Wall Street movement?
Gail Collins: Absolutely. It's one of our duties as opinionators to call attention to the fact that too much attention is being paid to something.
David Brooks: I mentioned in my last column that Americans are paying less attention to the movement than any other major news story, like the continuing war in Afghanistan. This makes total sense to me. There are hundreds of thousands of Americans who have cycled through Afghanistan and Iraq, with millions of relatives. There are tens of thousands of people worldwide in the Occupy movements. I'm in Minneapolis and the movement here has about 30 people, as best I can tell. I visited the one in Washington and there were maybe 80 people. So even if you just count the people directly involved, the movement is small.
Sure, they are photogenic, and they do have some grievances, but it is extremely dangerous to extrapolate from the protests to the wider country.
Gail Collins: You know, back in the all-print days we used to do surveys asking readers what their main news interests were, and the readers would always say foreign affairs. Couldn't get enough of it. When the surveyors actually probed deeper, it turned out that quite a few of the foreign affairs fans had specific knowledge only of the sports section. I'm sort of dubious about people's theories about what they're reading. But I did notice that a report on the first day of protests was one of The Times 10 most visited stories over the past month. Also, for the past month "Occupy Wall Street" is the No. 1 search. 
David Brooks: I could mention the studies on the political make-up of Times readers, but let's not go there. Instead, let me point to more evidence that public opinion is moving in the exact opposite direction than that suggested by the Occupy movement. That movement is in protest against the richest 1 percent. Its members seem to support redistributing money away from that 1 percent. The American public, though, is moving sharply in the other direction. 
Here is a passage from a recent study of public attitudes about redistribution:
Support for redistribution, surprisingly enough, has plummeted during the recession. For years, the General Social Survey has asked individuals whether 'government should reduce income differences between the rich and the poor.' Agreement with this statement dropped dramatically between 2008 and 2010, the two most recent years of data available. Other surveys have shown similar results the change is not driven by wealthy white Republicans reacting against President Obama's agenda: the drop is if anything slightly larger among minorities, and Americans who self-identify as having below average income show the same decrease in support for redistribution as wealthier Americans.
Gail Collins: Hmm. But if you ask about a millionaire's tax, you get a very enthusiastic reception. Really, it's all in the wording. 
David Brooks: The report continues, "Which group was the most opposed [to an increase in the minimum wage]? Those making just above the minimum wage, between $7.26 and $8.25." The work was done by Ilyana Kuziemko and Michael I. Norton. It was highlighted on Marginal Revolution and The Browser, two of the greatest blogs on the planet or in the cyberspace around it for that matter. 
Gail Collins: O.K., I'm sorry. I just don't buy that one. There is no group in America that responds negatively to "I should make more money" except maybe the Warren Buffett group. Let me say this one more time. Polling is a wildly inexact science. Polling has given us Herman Cain, Republican presidential front-runner.
David Brooks: Kuziemko and Norton explain the unpopularity of redistribution among the working class to "last place aversion." People in second to last place in any ranking system don't want to help the people at the bottom because then they themselves would fall to last. I think that's the wrong explanation. It goes back to values. Americans, especially those in precarious circumstances, want to see the moral fabric restored, and the essence of this - that effort should be linked to reward and redistribution - seems to muddy that moral fabric, even in harsh times like these. 
Gail Collins: I took a look at that paper and was once again impressed by your willingness to dive into scholarly essays in which patterns of human behavior are described by complex mathematical formulas. My other reaction was that the social sciences are always at their weakest when trying to analyze the behavior of people who make less money than social scientists.
Let me tell you a story. When I was a graduate student in political science, one of my professors had us do a survey in Springfield, Mass., to test the hypothesis that poor people were less concerned about the general public welfare than rich people were. We went into neighborhoods and asked our target responders to tell us what Springfield's most important problem was and why. A poor person might say: "The school my kid goes to is terrible." And they would go down as private-regarding, and only concerned about their own problems. Then you'd interview the owner of the biggest store in town and he might say: "The lack of support for our local merchants, because a good economy helps everyone." He went down as public-spirited and the hypothesis was proved.
But we were talking about Occupy Wall Street, right?
David Brooks: All of this fuels my general rule about covering protest movements, of whatever stripe. Don't watch the people doing the marching. Watch the people watching the marching. Among the boomers, it wasn't the people at Woodstock who ended up shaping history the most. It was the people who saw it and didn't like what they saw who fueled the Republican revival between 1980 and 2008. 
Gail Collins: I was at Woodstock and all the outside world saw at the time was the traffic jam, which was definitely something you'd want to avoid. However, the people who were there were the same folks who gave the country a good chunk of the civil rights movement, the women's movement and the anti-war movement. I'd rather take credit for that than Ronald Reagan and the Bushes.

HEADLINE: America's Car Museum Takes Shape in Tacoma

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: The LeMay Museum in Tacoma, Wash., is scheduled to reopen in June 2012 in a new, 165,000-square-foot space. 

 BODY:
To hear David Madeira tell it, building a 165,000-square-foot, four-story museum to house the breadth of American automotive history is a solemn task and a mathematical quandary.
While the gravity of the undertaking may be clear, an answer to the baseline question, "How many cars are we talking about?" is not.
Mr. Madeira and his team are charged with presenting a private collection that at one time may have contained 3,500 vehicles. But even that number is suspect.
"I don't know," Mr. Madeira said recently in an interview at The Times, when asked how many vehicles were in the possession of Harold LeMay, the garbage-disposal magnate whose collection of American automobiles would comprise the majority of the museum's holdings. Mr. LeMay, who died in 2000, was prone to buying a barn or even a field containing old automobiles just to prevent their contents from landing in a junkyard. "He was not a connoisseur; he was a true collector," Mr. Madeira said.
Since 2002, Mr. Madeira has been the president and chief executive of the LeMay Museum, which since 1998 has had a somewhat fluid physical presence on the campus of a former military academy on Interstate 5's northbound approach to downtown Tacoma. Many of the museum's cars are stored in specially built warehouses and in a former gymnasium on the campus. The museum has used certain events, particularly the New York auto show, to build public awareness not just of the developing museum, but the institution itself. In April, the LeMay mounted a show of vintage minicars at the Javits Center.
In June, the museum, accommodating "up to 750" automobiles in gallery spaces, according to Mr. Madeira, is scheduled to open on a nine-acre lot near the Tacoma Dome.
In keeping with the project's scale, Mr. Madeira and the museum's advisory board envisioned a national attraction, not a roadside curiosity.
"We went to Epcot, to Disney, to Universal CityWalk," Mr. Madeira said. "We realized we had to make a destination."
The collection has been culled over the years, with input from the board, Ms. LeMay and her sons, to "north of a thousand" automobiles, Mr. Madeira said. Even so, the scope of the collection was such that the new institution's name, America's Car Museum, would be deserved, he said.
"The earliest car is from 1903," Mr. Madeira said. "His tastes went everywhere. We've got everything from an AMC Pacer to a Duesenberg."
Much of Mr. Madeira's work has consisted of fund-raising, a process complicated by the financial crisis of 2008. "It was looking bad for a while there," he said.
The museum has 53 corporate sponsors, including local corporations like Boeing. Napa, the auto parts retailer, contributed $500,000 as well as equipment for an on-site maintenance facility. Hagerty, the collector-car insurance provider, and State Farm are among the museum's other sponsors. It also received a $1 million federal grant to assist with construction. According to a news release, the museum expects to contribute $34 million annually to the Seattle-Tacoma economy.
The museum's board also intends to utilize the site's 3.5-acre show field as the new home of the Kirkland Concours d'Elegance, the premier vintage show in the Pacific Northwest. The inaugural concours at the museum is scheduled for Sept. 9, 2012.
Mr. LeMay's collection is to be rotated in and out of exhibition spaces, but Mr. Madeira anticipates that there would be room to accommodate vehicles visiting from other private collections. The watchmaker Nicola Bulgari, an avid collector of midcentury American automobiles who also serves on the museum's board, is expected to exhibit some of his cars there.
Despite its deep connections in the collector car world, America's Car Museum must assert itself as a compelling destination for people outside the hobby if it is to succeed.
"Now we're here, and we've got to make it viable," Mr. Madeira said.

HEADLINE: Blaming Government More Than Wall Street

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Forced to point the finger at just one of those two culprits, twice as many Americans chose Washington, according to a new Gallup poll. 

 BODY:
Americans blame the federal government more than they blame Wall Street for the nation's current economic distress, according to a new poll from Gallup. In fact, forced to declare j'accuse to just one culprit, twice as many chose the feds:
To be sure, Americans still say financial institutions deserve a lot of blame.
In a separate question in Gallup's survey, which was conducted Oct. 15-16, respondents were asked how much they blamed Wall Street in general, and more than three-quarters said the banks deserved "a great deal" or "a fair amount" of blame.
Perhaps not surprisingly, in the question about apportioning blame between the two potential malefactors, Tea Party sympathizers were tremendously more likely to assign more blame to the government. What's more, both Democrats and Republicans were more condemnatory of the government than finance, to varying degrees.
Occupy Wall Street supporters, as you might imagine, were indeed more likely to blame the financial services crowd, but the preference was still relatively small:
Given persistently high unemployment rates, and Washington's insistence on arm-wrestling over the debt ceiling rather than focusing on the jobs crisis in recent months, it's hardly surprising that there is so much anger at the federal government. A separate Gallup survey found that Americans' confidence in their political leaders was at historic lows.
The question now is: Is there anything that the government will -- or even can -- do to help fix the economic wreckage that Americans blame them for? What do you think, readers?

HEADLINE: More UK Inflation

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Too much information. 

 BODY:
Too much information, I know. But since I did the homework, I might as well share it. The UK provides a measure of inflation corrected for changes in indirect taxes, basically VAT. So how does that compare with the US, where we know -- or at least I know -- that we're just seeing a commodity-driven blip? The answer is, it's about the same:
Neither of us has an underlying inflation problem.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Names a Deputy to Lead the Port Authority

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Patrick J. Foye's appointment comes as the governor seeks a significant expansion of the authority's portfolio. 

 BODY:
9:15 p.m. | Updated Patrick J. Foye, a veteran of economic development circles and a well-known figure in Long Island's public life, was nominated on Wednesday by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to become the next executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The selection of Mr. Foye, a deputy secretary to the governor, coincided with a call by Mr. Cuomo for the Port Authority to take over the long-moribund Moynihan Station project, which would create an expanded train terminal on the West Side of Manhattan.
The addition of the Moynihan Station development would expand the Port Authority's formidable infrastructure portfolio of airports, tunnels, bridges and maritime shipping. It would also reunite Mr. Foye with a project he oversaw during a brief tenure as a co-chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, his lone experience as the head of a major public agency.
Mr. Foye, 54, had been seen as a front-runner for weeks, and his nomination is expected to be approved by the Port Authority's board on Thursday. He would succeed Christopher O. Ward, who clashed with Mr. Cuomo but enjoyed a mostly successful tenure highlighted by a jump-start of construction at the World Trade Center site. 
A board member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Mr. Foye is viewed in municipal circles as a well-liked and intelligent public servant who is considered a trustworthy ally to Mr. Cuomo.
His critics, however, have said he was indecisive and hesitant during his 15 months leading the development corporation, a term blemished by infighting (by the end, Mr. Foye and another top executive did not speak), the collapse of a billion-dollar planned expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and little progress on the Moynihan Station project.
A spokesman for the governor did not make Mr. Foye available for an interview. But Mr. Foye's supporters - and even some former detractors - said he had made the most of a difficult situation, hiring consultants to cut costs and grappling with the micromanagement of Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who appointed him. They said none of the problems could be pinned on him alone.
Steven Spinola, the chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York, acknowledged that the abandonment of the Javits expansion had been "a disappointment." But in hindsight, he said, Mr. Foye could be commended for eventually saying no to a project that might have cost the state billions.
Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, said Mr. Foye had strong relationships with the city's real estate and business circles. Of his time at the development corporation, she said, "He inherited what amounted to a totally ineffective agency, and set the stage for turning it around."
In a statement, Mr. Cuomo said he hoped the Port Authority would "meet its potential as a major economic engine that plans for the region and attracts business on an international scale." But some transportation professionals said they feared that Mr. Foye, despite his solid credentials, lacked the vision of some of his predecessors.
Mr. Foye began his career as a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, the Manhattan law firm, where he worked with Eliot and Silda Wall Spitzer. He later left for a public career, serving as a deputy executive of Nassau County on Long Island; vice chairman of the Long Island Power Authority; and the chief executive of United Way of Long Island. He lives on Long Island.
Mr. Cuomo's call to transfer control of Moynihan Station, a project that has been held up by decades of financial and political hurdles, was praised by some of the station's supporters. The Port Authority, they said, might have the financial and engineering might to bring the project to fruition. Senator Charles E. Schumer, in a statement, called the move a "welcome decision."
The governor's office said in a statement that the project would have "no fiscal impact" on the Port Authority's budget, which some financial experts feel is strained with maintenance and expansion of its existing facilities. Kate Slevin, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, said the move "is likely to speed the project up, but it could put more pressure on the agency's budget."
Mr. Cuomo also asked the Port Authority on Wednesday to assume control of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, an agency jointly controlled by the governor and New York City's mayor that assists with the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site.
"Too many different agencies doing the same or closely related work makes little sense," the governor said in a statement.
Mr. Cuomo also nominated two candidates for the Port Authority's board: Rossana Rosado, the publisher and chief executive of El Diario/La Prensa; and James P. Rubin, a former spokesman for the State Department who was recently forced out of his position as executive editor at Bloomberg View, the opinion section of Bloomberg News. He nominated David Emil, a member of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's administration, to become Mr. Foye's deputy.
An earlier version of this blog post erroneously described Mr. Foye's tenure leading the Empire State Development Corporation as lasting 18 months.

HEADLINE: Oct. 19, 1987 | Stock Market Crashes on 'Black Monday'

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On Oct. 19, 1987, a day that became known as "Black Monday," the stock market crashed as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 508 points, or 22.6 percent in value, its largest single-day percentage drop. 

 BODY:
On Oct. 19, 1987, a day that became known as "Black Monday," the stock market crashed as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 508 points, or 22.6 percent in value, its largest single-day percentage drop. The crash came after a two-week period in which the Dow dropped 15 percent.
According to the Oct. 20 New York Times, "Business leaders were shaken by the collapse, which wiped out huge amounts of the market value of their companies. And they seemed to have been caught by surprise. But many leaders were confident the panic would pass."
Despite fears of a recession, the stock market quickly rebounded. The Dow made record gains on Tuesday and again on Thursday. By the end of the year, the Dow was higher than it had been at the start of the year, and returned to its pre-Black Monday level just two years after the crash.
There are several theories about why the stock market crashed on Black Monday. Some believe the market had gone too high so the steep declines of October were a swift correction of the market. Another popular theory is that the crash was exacerbated by computer programs designed to sell stocks that dropped below a certain price.

HEADLINE: Is Wind Worth It?

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: An analyst at a conservative policy institute suggests that economically, the high costs of wind energy argue against its playing a big role in electricity generation. 

 BODY:
 Most of the backlash against renewable energy lately has involved solar power, largely because of of Solyndra's recent bankruptcy filing. But Robert Bryce, an analyst at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research center, took a swipe at wind power on Wednesday in a new study. 
He acknowledged that it was not comprehensive, but his extrapolation does provide a sense of how much work it would be to bring about a major transformation in the electric system. 
 Mr. Bryce referred to a 2008 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of the Energy Department, that said the United States could get 20 percent of its electricity from wind by 2030. At the moment, about 40,000 megawatts of wind capacity are installed in the United States, producing about 2.3 percent of the country's kilowatt-hours. (Wind is about 70 times larger than solar in terms of the energy produced.) 
 Hence, bringing wind up to 20 percent by 2030 would require a nine-fold increase, he noted. With the Energy Department calculating that a megawatt of wind costs $2.43 million to install, that would require investing $850 billion, or $44 billion from now until 2030.) 
 Of course, the electric grid will spend tens of billions of dollars anyway by 2030 to replace retiring plants; there is also likely to be substantial growth in electricity demand. Mr. Bryce's theory, though, is that new wind will not be a worthy substitute for other kinds of new generation because so little of it is available at hours of peak demand.

Mr. Bryce lives in Texas, where grid operators assume that for each 100 megawatts of installed wind, they can count on just 8.7 megawatts on the peak demand days, which tend to be hot and calm.
His study does not include a cost for new transmission lines, which would be needed to move wind energy from the best place onshore for wind machines, the high plains, to major markets. 
Yes, relying more on wind wind will reduce carbon dioxide emissions, he said, but at a price of at $45 to $54 per ton. That is roughly triple what a ton of carbon dioxide emissions trades for on the European exchange, he pointed out. 
Advocates, including public officials, have argued that "this is going to be great for you," Mr. Bryce said, "but there's never an explanation of what it's going to mean.''
The analysis does not consider two factors that wind advocates are counting on, however. One is lower prices for wind energy per kilowatt-hour as the industry installs ever-larger machines and achieves economies of scale. 
The other, stressed in the renewable energy laboratory study, is that a wired network of wind farms will be more valuable than scattered installations. That's because when the machines are spread out in a network, they will be producing electricity based on the average wind in a larger number of places. 
Because geographically diverse farms are unlikely to be simultaneously becalmed, the laboratory said, the minimum generation that system operators can count on will be higher. 
Nor does the study consider the possibility that natural gas prices will return to levels so high that wind machines will pay for themselves with the value of the fuel not burned at conventional gas plants. 
Thus far, however, it is not economics that is driving wind energy growth; it is the renewable energy mandates in force in 29 states and the District of Columbia.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Venue and the Delaware Solyndra Ruling

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: Despite moves in Congress to change Chapter 11 venue rules, the Delaware court ignored any political pressure to name a trustee in the Solyndra bankruptcy. 

 BODY:
Given all the important economic legislationand issues that Congress might be considering, it is probably not too much of a surprise that lawmakers are spending time on the question of whether corporate bankruptcy cases should be as clustered in New York and Delaware as they are.
I've previously been pretty clear about my opinion: namely, worrying about Chapter 11 venue is largely a waste of time and might even be harmful to the Chapter 11 process, which seems to work pretty well, all things considered.
Those bankruptcy professionals west of the Acela high-speed rail line who are dreaming of huge new Chapter 11 cases should get real. The big New York firms are still going to handle these cases if this legislation passes -- they will just have to travel more.
But given the reality that Congress is looking at Chapter 11 venue, many thought that the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware would have felt some political pressure to appoint a bankruptcy trustee to replace Solyndra's top executives, who refused to answer questions about the bankruptcy of the government-backed solar panel maker, citing their rights under the Fifth Amendment. After all, here was a politically charged case pending while Delaware and the Southern District of New York are under the microscope, so why not appoint a trustee?
But the court did not.
The normal rule is that the debtor's management stays in control in Chapter 11: this is the famed "debtor in possession," or D.I.P., in bankruptcy speak. Only in extreme cases is management replaced with a trustee, unlike the rule in most every other country.
Trustee are exceedingly rare in big Chapter 11 cases. There was no trustee in the Enron bankruptcy, for example, despite all the scandal surrounding that case. The reason: the board had changed and it replaced senior management with outside restructuring professionals. With the bad guys out, why appoint a trustee?
And there is some support for that, for example, in my research I have found that appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee often leads to conversion to Chapter 7, which itself leads to basically nothing for the unsecured creditors.
That's sort of what happened in Solyndra. Sort of.
Solyndra's previous chief executive did resign and has been replaced with a turnaround professional. But the company's chief financial officer, who is almost more important in a Chapter 11 case, is still around.
The key issue is that while there has been lots of insinuations about Solyndra, there is little proof yet that there was actual fraud at the company. Some poor lending decisions by the Department of Energy, sure, but little with regard to fraud.
An examiner -- like the one appointed in the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers -- could investigate any fraud at the company, but do the creditors really want to go down that road? Examiners are not cheap, and with the company up for sale, right now the creditors might be better served by maximizing the sale price and minimizing the costs of the Chapter 11 case.
That argues for leaving the investigation to the F.B.I.

HEADLINE: Chevy Turns to Pictures to Celebrate a Centennial

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Chevrolet is using vintage pictures to mark its 100th anniversary in a commercial that is to be introduced during the first game of the 2011 World Series. 

 BODY:
The Chevrolet division of General Motors is turning to television to mark its 100th anniversary with a commercial that is to be introduced on Wednesday night during the first game of the 2011 World Series on Fox Broadcasting.
The commercial, titled "Then and Now," is the most recent element in a multimedia commemoration of the centennial of Chevrolet. The brand was introduced in 1911 and acquired by G.M. in 1918.
The commercial, by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, part of the Omnicom Group, is centered on vintage photographs of vintage Chevrolets, which are held up to the camera at the same locations as they appear today. 

While the photos are displayed, the soundtrack plays Ray Charles performing a live version of "America the Beautiful."
In one instance, the car that is in the photo - a Chevy circa the late 1940s - appears to be parked where it was in the photo. In other instances, contemporary Chevrolets appear where their old-time counterparts once drove or were parked.
The commercial ends with a photo of a family with a Chevy from the mid-1950s parked in a driveway. When the photo is lowered, a family is with a new Chevy Volt in the same driveway.
At the end, the actor Tim Allen, who is the voice-over announcer in Chevy commercials, says: "For the first hundred years, and for generations to come. Thank you for making us a part of your life."
On screen is superimposed the current Chevy slogan, "Chevy runs deep" and the words "since 1911."
The commercial, which will appear throughout the World Series as well as during other TV programming, complements two online campaigns that Chevrolet has already begun.
One, also by Goodby, Silverstein, is called "The Ride of Your Life." It is designed to work with Facebook.
The other online campaign, called "The Road We're On," is being created by the New York office of Mother. This campaign offers video clips from around the country, in an echo of the commercial.
The commercial reflects how when "it's your birthday, you have a tendency to look back at what you've accomplished and look forward at what lies ahead," said Chris Perry, vice president for Chevrolet marketing and global strategy at G.M.
Mr. Perry spoke about the commercial on Wednesday afternoon, before its debut on Fox.
The photos in the commercial were found in "our archives," Mr. Perry said, and were shared by employees. They were also discovered on Internet sites like flickr.com, he added.
Brands that are marking milestone anniversaries sometimes shy from playing them up because of a perception that younger consumers find little of interest in product heritage.
That may be different now, however, because since the financial crisis there is more of an interest among so-called millennial consumers in brands with histories and track records, particularly those with American roots.
The history of Chevrolet "resonates" with younger consumers, Mr. Perry said, in that the brand has "played an integral part in American culture and is woven into the fabric of America."
At the same time, he added, there is "a nod to the future" in the campaign in that the commercial features current models like the Volt and Silverado.
And in the online "The Ride of Your Life," computer users can choose from among six Chevrolets to feature in short videos; the dates range from 1948 to 2010.
As much as Chevrolet is enjoying the celebration, "we're not going to overdo it," Mr. Perry said. "We're not using it to pound our chest."
For instance, the TV spot is likely to be the only one related to the centennial that will be produced, he added.
The Chevrolet Motor Car Company was founded on Nov. 3, 1911, by Louis Chevrolet and William C. Durant. The Chevy brand is now sold in more than 140 countries, G.M. says.
The spot marks the first time that a version recorded live by Mr. Charles of "America the Beautiful" has been used in a commercial, Mr. Perry said.

HEADLINE: Chevy Turns to Pictures to Celebrate a Centennial

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Chevrolet is using vintage pictures to mark its 100th anniversary in a commercial that is to be introduced during the first game of the 2011 World Series. 

 BODY:
The Chevrolet division of General Motors is turning to television to mark its 100th anniversary with a commercial that is to be introduced on Wednesday night during the first game of the 2011 World Series on Fox Broadcasting.
The commercial, titled "Then and Now," is the most recent element in a multimedia commemoration of the centennial of Chevrolet. The brand was introduced in 1911 and acquired by G.M. in 1918.
The commercial, by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, part of the Omnicom Group, is centered on vintage photographs of vintage Chevrolets, which are held up to the camera at the same locations as they appear today. 

While the photos are displayed, the soundtrack plays Ray Charles performing a live version of "America the Beautiful."
In one instance, the car that is in the photo - a Chevy circa the late 1940s - appears to be parked where it was in the photo. In other instances, contemporary Chevrolets appear where their old-time counterparts once drove or were parked.
The commercial ends with a photo of a family with a Chevy from the mid-1950s parked in a driveway. When the photo is lowered, a family is with a new Chevy Volt in the same driveway.
At the end, the actor Tim Allen, who is the voice-over announcer in Chevy commercials, says: "For the first hundred years, and for generations to come. Thank you for making us a part of your life."
On screen is superimposed the current Chevy slogan, "Chevy runs deep" and the words "since 1911."
The commercial, which will appear throughout the World Series as well as during other TV programming, complements two online campaigns that Chevrolet has already begun.
One, also by Goodby, Silverstein, is called "The Ride of Your Life." It is designed to work with Facebook.
The other online campaign, called "The Road We're On," is being created by the New York office of Mother. This campaign offers video clips from around the country, in an echo of the commercial.
The commercial reflects how when "it's your birthday, you have a tendency to look back at what you've accomplished and look forward at what lies ahead," said Chris Perry, vice president for Chevrolet marketing and global strategy at G.M.
Mr. Perry spoke about the commercial on Wednesday afternoon, before its debut on Fox.
The photos in the commercial were found in "our archives," Mr. Perry said, and were shared by employees. They were also discovered on Internet sites like flickr.com, he added.
Brands that are marking milestone anniversaries sometimes shy from playing them up because of a perception that younger consumers find little of interest in product heritage.
That may be different now, however, because since the financial crisis there is more of an interest among so-called millennial consumers in brands with histories and track records, particularly those with American roots.
The history of Chevrolet "resonates" with younger consumers, Mr. Perry said, in that the brand has "played an integral part in American culture and is woven into the fabric of America."
At the same time, he added, there is "a nod to the future" in the campaign in that the commercial features current models like the Volt and Silverado.
And in the online "The Ride of Your Life," computer users can choose from among six Chevrolets to feature in short videos; the dates range from 1948 to 2010.
As much as Chevrolet is enjoying the celebration, "we're not going to overdo it," Mr. Perry said. "We're not using it to pound our chest."
For instance, the TV spot is likely to be the only one related to the centennial that will be produced, he added.
The Chevrolet Motor Car Company was founded on Nov. 3, 1911, by Louis Chevrolet and William C. Durant. The Chevy brand is now sold in more than 140 countries, G.M. says.
The spot marks the first time that a version recorded live by Mr. Charles of "America the Beautiful" has been used in a commercial, Mr. Perry said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Unit for Seniors Draws a Famous Name

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Hubert H. Humphrey III, the son of the deceased former vice president, will lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's "older Americans" unit. 

 BODY:
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has recruited a famous name: Hubert Humphrey. 
On Wednesday, Hubert H. Humphrey III, the son of the deceased former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate, was appointed head of the bureau's new "older Americans" unit. Mr. Humphrey, known as Skip, has been a longtime public official in Minnesota, serving as a state senator and four-term attorney general. More recently, he led the Minnesota arm of AARP, the lobbying group representing older Americans. 
At the consumer bureau, Mr. Humphrey, 69, will be charged with preventing financial schemes aimed at defrauding senior citizens. 
"I am honored and excited to bring my experience in consumer protection and my work with seniors to the C.F.P.B. to help educate seniors about fair practices and how to make financial decisions that are right for them," Mr. Humphrey said in a statement. "A well-informed consumer is the best protection against fraud and deceptive practices -- especially if that knowledge is backed up by tough regulatory enforcement." 
The bureau, born out of the Dodd-Frank Act, has broad new authority to police Wall Street banks and the lightly regulated corners of the financial industry, including payday lenders and mortgage firms. Mr. Humphrey's unit will offer counseling and education to senior citizens, who saw their savings plummet in the aftermath of the financial crisis. 
"As baby boomers join the ranks of the retired, their hard-earned savings should help them realize opportunities, not serve as the target of deception and fraud," Raj Date, who is leading the bureau, said in the statement. "Skip's experience," he said, makes "him a perfect fit to lead the Office of Older Americans."
Democratic lawmakers also lined up to hail the new hire. Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who was a co-author of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, praised the move as continuing a "pattern of excellent choices by this important agency." Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Humphrey is "just one more example of the high-caliber talent" working at the bureau.
Over the last year, the bureau has hired some former bankers, including Mr. Date, a former Deutsche Bank managing director. And Mr. Humphrey will not be the only former attorney general at the agency. Richard Cordray, the former top prosecutor in Ohio, leads the agency's enforcement division. 
President Obama chose Mr. Cordray to lead the bureau, although Republicans are moving to block the nomination.

HEADLINE: Deer-Car Collisions Less Frequent but More Costly

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Deer-car collisions are down, an analysis found, but the average cost of damage caused has risen. 

 BODY:
As I was driving my children home from an after-school activity recently, I had to brake as a herd of deer sauntered across the road in the dusk, their eyes glinting in the glare of my headlights. My children were thrilled to see them, but I was quietly relieved I had seen them in time to stop.
It turns out that we are in the peak time of year for deer-car collisions -- October and November -- because fall is mating season and the animals are on the move. State Farm says that deer vs. automobile crashes are on the decline, but they're still a problem. An annual analysis of the insurer's auto claims estimates that 1.09 million collisions between deer and automobiles occurred from July 2010 to June 30, 2011, down 7 percent from the prior year and 9 percent from three years ago.
State Farm says it can't pinpoint a reason for the decline. (A quick check of state wildlife department Web sites suggests that the deer population in the United States remains robust.) Rather, it may be a result of reduced auto traffic in the slow economy. "It makes sense to us that during these challenging economic times, drivers in the U.S. are logging fewer miles," a spokesman for State Farm, Dick Luedke, said in an e-mail. "Everything else being equal, the fewer miles we drive, the fewer deer we hit."
The state where drivers have the highest odds of hitting a deer continues to be West Virginia. State Farm estimates the chances of a West Virginia driver hitting a deer in the next 12 months at 1 in 53. Iowa ranks second (1 in 77), followed by South Dakota (1 in 81). The lowest-risk state remains Hawaii, at 1 in 6,267 (about the same odds, State Farm notes rather oddly, that the driver is a "practicing nudist"). You can see a map ranking states by their deer-collision risk here. (Turns out I live in a high-risk state.)
The bad news is that the average cost of damage from deer encounters went up by more than 2 percent over last year, to $3,171. Your auto insurance policy will generally cover such repairs, but there's usually a deductible that you'll pay out of pocket.
The Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, offers these tips for avoiding a deer while driving:
Be especially attentive during the highest risk times of day: From sunset to midnight and during the hours shortly before and after sunrise.Drive carefully in marked deer-crossing zones, in areas with a known deer population and on roads that divide fields from forests.Deer seldom run alone. If you see one deer, others may be nearby, so slow down.When driving at night, use high beam headlights when there is no oncoming traffic.Slow down and blow your horn with one long blast to frighten the deer away.Brake firmly when you see a deer, but stay in your lane. Many serious crashes occur when drivers swerve to avoid a deer and hit another vehicle or lose control of their cars.Always wear your seat belt.Don't rely on devices like deer whistles, deer fences and reflectors to deter deer. These gadgets have not been proven to reduce deer-vehicle collisions.
If your car does strike a deer, don't touch the animal; a frightened and wounded deer can hurt you or further injure itself. Get your car off the road, if possible, and call the police.

HEADLINE: Are You Managing Your Unemployment Insurance?

BYLINE: JAY GOLTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Unemployment benefits are a necessary lifeline for people who lose their jobs, but -- especially in a tough economy -- they can also create big expenses for companies that are already struggling. Fortunately, there are ways to control the costs. 

 BODY:
Every Nov. 30, the State of Illinois sends out a statement that tells businesses what rate they will pay in the coming year for unemployment insurance. I view the rate as one indication of how I did this year as a manager. This time around, I'm anticipating a gift, because we had no unemployment claims this year, and I expect the rate to go down. In a bad year, the statement feels more like a reprimand, one that comes with a bill attached.
As you can read in the helpful article The Times just published about unemployment insurance, businesses ultimately pay the bill for unemployment claims. The state may write the check, but the money comes from employers. Most important -- and something a lot of small-business owners don't understand -- is this: The more people you lay off or fire "without cause" in the current year, the more you will have to pay into the system for the next three years, at least in Illinois (it varies by state). On the other hand, if you have a good year and manage your people well, you can keep the rate down. 
In my case, because of a few claims made after the economic crisis first hit, my rate jumped to 3.8 percent, from 2.1 percent. I have 110 employees, and that jump increased the cost of unemployment insurance for my company by about $24,000 per year. It is the cost of doing business, especially the cost of doing business in a bad economy. Make no mistake: I understand that unemployment insurance is an essential lifeline for people who have lost their jobs. But I also know that it can be a big expense for a company that is already struggling.
When times are good, this is much less of an issue. Fewer employees are laid off and those who do lose their jobs tend to stay unemployed for less time and to collect fewer benefits. When the economy goes bad, of course, many companies are forced to lay off employees, and those laid off are less likely to find another job. But this is not just a function of a bad economy -- it can also be a function of bad management. Trust me, I know.
My unemployment rate used to be at the maximum, and it wasn't because the economy forced me into mass layoffs. It was many years ago, and it was because I was hiring the wrong people -- people who ultimately got fired and became eligible to collect unemployment. Our hiring has gotten much better, largely because I have found people who are much better at it than I am. In the old days, only about half of the people I hired worked out well. Today, we're probably closer to 80 percent. That means there are far fewer people to unhire, and that saves us from wreaking havoc on both the employees' lives and our unemployment rate.
This is really about recognizing that great companies have great hiring protocols. It is about placing the right ads, interviewing well and checking references. It is also about recognizing when you have made a mistake -- and recognizing it quickly. In Illinois, you have 30 working days before you become liable for a person's unemployment claims. Most of the time that is enough, although for some jobs -- like outside sales -- it really isn't. But there is more you can do to avoid the need to fire someone, and that's good for both parties.
If there is a problem with an employee, the situation has to be managed. It starts with honest conversations about what the problem is. There should be a plan for improvement, and there should be a clear understanding that things have to improve or the situation will be unacceptable. After a couple of conversations, one of three things should happen:
Best case, the employee improves. Great.
Second-best case, the employee sees the writing on the wall and finds another job -- perhaps having concluded that is the problem, which may well have been the case. Or maybe the employee just wasn't right for that particular job. Or has outgrown it. Or the job has outgrown the employee. Regardless, the employee has moved on, and the problem is solved. Win-win.
And then there is the last group, the people who are not getting better and are not looking for a new job. Obviously, many of these people will leave their bosses no choice but to fire them. When you get better at the hiring and management process, this group shrinks significantly. And that's good for all concerned.
The costs of unemployment insurance are substantial enough that they should be taken into account when considering layoffs. If sales have fallen and laying someone off is looking like the smart and responsible thing to do, think again. And do the math.
If this is a good employee, and you think it's likely that either the business will rebound in a few months or there might be some attrition, you might be better off toughing it out and keeping the person around. In Illinois, the insurance increase can end up costing you more than 50 percent of a person's salary if he or she doesn't get another job (although the cost will be spread out over the following three years).
It comes down to this. You might be better off paying people to get some work done -- even if it is painting the walls, cleaning out files, contacting old customers, doing research and development or building inventory -- rather than paying them to stay home and look for a job. And if you end up hiring them back in a few months, you will have saved little and you will probably have done damage to the employee and to your relationship. It's also not great for other employees who may wonder how secure their own jobs are.
Good employees are valuable assets. This is all very tricky, and sometimes you have to make decisions that require a crystal ball -- unfortunately, they seem to be on back order. Someone at the crystal-ball factory must have laid off too many people.

Wall Street Grapples with Diminished Reality | The first loss at Goldman Sachs since the financial crisis points to what could be a more lasting shift in the financial industry, as the bank that was once Wall Street's highest flier has been grounded.
While protesters a few blocks away from Goldman's Lower Manhattan headquarters were denouncing greed and "too big to fail" banks, the institutions themselves were coming to grips with the current diminished reality. Trading operations are muted. Risk-taking is tempered. And boring businesses are back in vogue.
Banks, required by regulators to discontinue high-profit businesses like proprietary trading, reduce borrowings and hold more capital, may no longer be able to produce the supercharged earnings that were common before the financial crisis.

HEADLINE: Debate Suggests Brutish Campaign to Come

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR AND RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Tuesday night's debate raised the prospect of a nasty, brutish and potentially long nomination fight between Rick Perry and Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
12:55 p.m. | Updated Rick Perry and Mitt Romney braced Wednesday for a new, more aggressive phase in their presidential rivalry after a debate Tuesday night in which both men made clear how deep the personal animosity between them goes.
In slightly less than two hours, the nationally televised debate raised the prospect - maybe even the likelihood - of a nasty, brutish and potentially long fight for the nomination between the two men, both of whom are sitting on campaign war chests that exceed $10 million.
Mr. Perry is scheduled to speak Wednesday to the Western Republican Leadership Conference in Las Vegas at noon Eastern, while Mr. Romney is headed to South Dakota and then, later this week, back to Iowa and the heart of the early battle with Mr. Perry. It is a state that Mr. Romney has spent only limited time campaigning in, but which is likely to take on increasing importance as he tries to derail Mr. Perry's hopes.
Advisers for both men struggled after the debate to spin the results in their candidate's favor. But that job will fall to Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney on Wednesday as they face voters -- and reporters -- for the first time since their confrontational exchange in Las Vegas.
A Texas Republican operative said the Perry campaign would be rolling out its full-blown economic plan in the next week or so, one that Steve Forbes has helped shape. This person said Tuesday's debate put Mr. Perry back on the right course.
"He started out with a lot of momentum, and it slowed, and I think they are trying to steady the ship."
What Perry did Tuesday night "is more in line with what he's going to do in the campaign," the operative said. "The economic plan is going to become a major theme moving forward, and they are going to take selective criticisms of Romney to point out the differences and point out that he's not been as strong and as consistent a conservative. I'm sure they have got a boatload of stuff and they are digging through his record."
Tuesday night's debate was striking testimony to the increasingly stark choice that is confronting Republican voters in the very near future - and of the high stakes riding on their decision.
With President Obama looking increasingly vulnerable in the polls and the economy continuing to struggle, it is becoming clear that one of the seven people who took the stage in Las Vegas will have a strong shot at becoming the country's 45th president.
That reality seemed to suddenly dawn on the Republican hopefuls, who finally dropped all pretense of a playful competition among themselves. They struck out at each other in deeply personal ways, accusing their rivals not only of misguided policy but also of a lack of personal credibility or standing.
In the debate, Mr. Perry revived a 2006 story about Mr. Romney having hired a lawn company that employed illegal immigrants. In doing so, he took aim not at the immigration debate, but at Mr. Romney's character. "Mitt, you lose all of your standing from my perspective because you hired illegals in your home, and you knew for - about it for a year," he said.
The accusation sparked a heated, intense back-and-forth clash, leading an exasperated and red-faced Mr. Romney to shout: "Are you just going to keep talking or are you going to let me finish?"
Perhaps mindful of having been mocked by comedians as practically comatose in previous debates, Mr. Perry, who has fallen precipitously in the polls in recent weeks, appeared anything but sleepy. He repeatedly interrupted Mr. Romney, badgering him to "tell the truth," and relented only after he forced a rattled rival to practically beg for help from the moderator.
"It's time for you to tell the truth," Mr. Perry said repeatedly.
"The way - the way the rules work here is that I get 60 seconds," Mr. Romney said, trying to continue.
"But no," Mr. Perry insisted, "but the American people want the truth."
Finally, Mr. Romney barked at Mr. Perry, cutting him off. 
"You have a problem with allowing someone to finish speaking," Mr. Romney blurted out. "And I suggest that if you want to become president of the United States, you got to let both people speak."
Both men appeared unwilling to give ground to the other. Mr. Romney has clearly become a different debater than he was four years ago - less willing to concede points or be bullied. And Mr. Perry showed up ready for a fight. In the opening seconds of the debate, Mr. Perry called himself "an authentic conservative, not a conservative of convenience."
But it was unclear after it was over how the exchange would be received by voters over the next several days.
Mr. Romney clearly appeared flustered by the clash. After several debates in which he seemed in control of the conversation, Mr. Romney was less prepared for the rhetorical assault from Mr. Perry and others on the stage. And the immigration charge was another reminder that Mr. Romney's past remains a source of ammunition against him as he seeks the presidency.
But Mr. Perry's performance - while undeniably more intense than in previous debates - ran the risk of being overly contentious. Supporters of Mr. Romney sent Twitter messages and e-mails that the Texas governor had "lost it" and would appear mean, or even nasty, to viewers watching the debate at home.
But even when the two men weren't fighting with each other, Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry were at the center of the debate's crucial moments.
It was Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, who first lashed out at Mr. Romney, calling into question his personal credibility on the issue of repealing Mr. Obama's huge health care law.
"You just don't have credibility, Mitt, when it comes to repealing 'Obamacare,'" Mr. Santorum said. As Mr. Romney began to answer, Mr. Santorum shook his head in disbelief, interrupting his rival repeatedly and accusing him of lying.
Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, took the same approach a few minutes later, responding when Mr. Romney noted that he "got the idea" for the individual health care mandate in the Massachusetts health care law from Mr. Gingrich. Mr. Gingrich repeatedly denied the charge, interrupting Mr. Romney over and over.
"He still has time. Let him finish," Anderson Cooper, the CNN host and debate moderator, pleaded on Mr. Romney's behalf.
But if Mr. Romney appeared under siege, he was not the only one. 
A feisty Mr. Santorum once again sank his teeth into a rival later in the debate, accusing Mr. Perry of having supported the bank bailout known as TARP with a letter to lawmakers on the day they voted in Congress.
"Wrong," Mr. Perry said as the two sparred.
"I mean - I mean, you guys complain about Governor Romney flip-flopping," Mr. Santorum continued. "I mean, look at what's going on here."
"I'm just telling you, I know what we sent," Mr. Perry shot back. "I know what the intention was. You can read it any way you want."
Herman Cain, whose 9-9-9 tax plan has rocketed him to the top tier of candidates in polls, found himself at the bottom of a brief pile-on as rivals all denounced the plan as unworkable, unfair and - in the case of an accusation from Representative Ron Paul of Texas - downright dangerous.
But the story of the night was the animosity between Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney, a development that speaks volumes about the way each man views the other as the chief obstacle to the White House.
In 2008, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton viewed each other that way. They both saw the White House as within reach, but in jeopardy unless the other was dispatched. Their icy relationship (captured by Mr. Obama's "you're likable enough, Hillary" comment) and their prodigious fund-raising kept the Democratic contest going until June.
Could that happen again, this time on the Republican side? If Tuesday's debate is any indication, the answer could be yes.

HEADLINE: Are Too Many Americans Earning Four-Year Degrees?

BYLINE: REBECCA R. RUIZ


HIGHLIGHT: An Intelligence Squared debate in Chicago last week explored whether too many students in the United States go to college. 

 BODY:
"True or false: too many kids go to college."
That was how John Donvan, an ABC News correspondent, began a debate last week about the necessity of an undergraduate degree.
The debate, held by Intelligence Squared in Chicago as part of that city's Ideas Week, featured Peter Thiel, PayPal founder and entrepreneur, and Charles Murray, a political scientist, arguing that the college market is flooded with too many students.
Arguing against them were Henry S. Bienen, president emeritus of Northwestern University, and Vivek Wadhwa, a director of research at Duke University.
(As I did just now, you can watch a replay of the full debate, on the Intelligence Squared Web site.)
Mr. Theil, who went to Stanford University for his bachelor's and law degrees, said he used to view college pedigrees as "the most important thing in our society." But, he said, his view has shifted having seen many dropouts operating in Silicon Valley, people he hailed as oftentimes more creative and, practically, not forced to take "boring," better-paying jobs to pay off suffocating student loan debt.
"We are experiencing a bubble in education," Mr. Thiel concluded, likening that bubble to the technology boom in the 1990s and the housing bubble of the 2000s. Like those other bubbles, he said, people are paying too much for the product -- a diploma, in this case -- and are revering its value in a dogmatic way.
"To question the value of education is like questioning the existence of Santa Claus with 3-year-old kids," he said. "We're not trying to scare the children, but we cannot afford to have a third bubble in this country."
Mr. Bienen of Northwestern took the lectern after Mr. Theil, emphasizing the societal good of educating more people. "More degrees correlate with lower rates of unemployment," he said. He painted the success of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and other notable college dropouts as impressive but isolated instances.
Taking a step toward the moderate, Mr. Murray, the economist, spoke next. While he was staunchly in favor of the resolution -- "too many kids go to college" -- he appended an asterisk, in effect, to his support of it, praising two-year community colleges.
"Nearly everyone needs more education after high school," Mr. Murray said. "What they don't need is to chase after this fraudulent, destructive, antediluvian thing called a B.A. The B.A. is really the work of the devil."
Mr. Murray asserted that what and where someone studies is subjective in value and therefore "meaningless, a false credential."
In rebuttal, Mr. Wadhwa of Duke invoked globalization, defending the strength and reputation of the American system of higher education as the best in the world. He additionally credited American colleges for their special social experiences and their openness, welcoming any party interested in enrolling. He stressed the importance of considering a full range of schools, "not just Stanford."
"America is what it is because of our education system," he said. "America started educating the masses, and its productivity rose. We became the most fiercely competitive land in the world because we educated everyone. If we keep having these silly debates about four-year degrees, we're going to lose out."
While the larger debate on this issue carries on -- unlikely to ever yield a black-and-white verdict -- this particular forum's audience (which numbered several hundred) elected a winner. By a hair -- 1 percentage point -- Mr. Thiel and Mr. Murray were named victors of the debate, having proved, by just over half the crowd's estimation, that too many students go to college.

HEADLINE: Biden Visits Capitol Hill to Rally Support for Jobs Legislation

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: The vice president worked to corral support for legislation that Democrats say would put thousands of laid-off teachers and public safety workers back on the job. 

 BODY:
10:47 p.m. | Updated Back on his old stomping grounds at the Senate on Wednesday afternoon, Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. outlined dire consequences if Republicans blocked a $35 billion piece of President Obama's jobs bill.
At a rally where he was surrounded by his former Senate colleagues, nurses, firefighters and teachers, Mr. Biden, who was Delaware's senator for 36 years, said that crime "has gone through the roof" in cities like Camden, N.J., and Flint, Mich., where the police forces have been halved because of budget cuts.
More than 300,000 teachers and 10,000 law enforcement officers have been laid off in the last 18 months, and the result in many cities has been increased rates of murder, robberies and rapes and victims waiting longer for emergency responders, Mr. Biden said. Some school systems were eliminating kindergarten and increasing class sizes, he added. 
"You are the middle class and you're getting crushed," he said.
Mr. Biden has been touring the country "from Florida to Michigan and everywhere in between" to corral support for the jobs bill. On Wednesday in the Democrats' caucus room, he said the public safety legislation, sponsored by Senators Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, would put 400,000 teachers back in classrooms, 18,000 police officers on the streets, and 7,000 firefighters back in firehouses, he said. 
Republicans have complained that the jobs bill as a whole is temporary and would increase taxes on the wealthy.
"I don't know where these guys live," Mr. Biden started before he was interrupted by a man in the audience who shouted, "Fantasyland!"
"Seriously," he continued. "I don't know where they live, because it's not in the neighborhoods I grew up in, or any of us grew up in, where they call it temporary. Ladies and gentlemen, the consequences of these losses are real and they're now."
The jobs bill, Mr. Biden said, would increase taxes on people making more than $1 million by about $500 and the millionaires don't oppose it. 
"They know it's the equitable thing to do," he said. But Republicans "seem to want to curry favor with guys who aren't even asking for the favor."
Republicans, who have repeatedly said that they will not support legislation containing any new taxes, have fired back, accusing Democrats of encouraging "class warfare," a response Mr. Biden called "bizarre."
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Republicans in Congress have taken a position at odds with Republicans around the country who support the president's jobs bill. On the Senate floor late Wednesday, he filed a procedural motion to end debate on the legislation, a move that sets up a vote on Friday, before the Senate takes a break next week.
Putting the audience to the test, Senator Richard J. Durbin, the majority whip, asked if the crowd thought the legislation was a bailout, as Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has referred to it.
"No," the crowd said.
Mr. Schumer fired off four more questions in his bailout quiz and the audience gave the same correct answer each time. He finished, "Then, go tell Mitch McConnell!"
The legislation is "something we desperately need," he said. "It's good for our kids. It's good for our neighborhoods. It's good for our economy. It's good for our country. And it's even good for the people making over a million dollars who will pay for it."

HEADLINE: Citigroup to Pay Millions to End Fraud Complaint

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT; Eric Dash contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As the housing market began its collapse, Wall Street firms and sophisticated investors searched for ways to profit. Some of them found an easy method: Stuff a portfolio with risky mortgage-related investments, sell it to unsuspecting customers and bet against it.
Citigroup on Wednesday agreed to pay $285 million to settle a civil complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had defrauded investors who bought just such a deal. The transaction involved a $1 billion portfolio of mortgage-related investments, many of which were handpicked for the portfolio by Citigroup without telling investors of its role or that it had made bets that the investments would fall in value. 
In the four years since the housing market began its steady descent, securities regulators have settled only two cases related to the financial crisis for a larger sum of money. This is also the third case brought by the S.E.C. accusing a major Wall Street institution of misleading customers about who was putting together a security and about their motive. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Company both settled similar cases last year.
The settlement will refund investors with interest and include a $95 million fine -- a relative pittance for a giant like Citigroup. On Monday, the company reported that in the third quarter alone it earned profits of $3.8 billion on revenue of $20.8 billion. The settlement may also have trouble getting approval from Jed S. Rakoff, the federal district judge in New York who must ultimately sign off on the fine and who has taken a hard line on S.E.C. settlements.
Neither the S.E.C. nor the Justice Department would say whether the case raised questions about whether Citigroup had been involved in any criminal wrongdoing. But the case highlights a growing frustration felt by foreclosed homeowners, investors and Wall Street protesters alike that few, if any, senior banking executives have faced criminal charges for losses growing out of the financial crisis.
Citigroup has settled one case stemming from the crisis. Last year, it agreed to pay $75 million to settle federal claims that it hid from investors vast holdings of subprime mortgage investments that were losing value during the crisis and that ultimately prompted the federal government to rescue the bank.
''The securities laws demand that investors receive more care and candor than Citigroup provided'' to investors in the security, said Robert Khuzami, director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, referring to Wednesday's action. ''Investors were not informed that Citigroup had decided to bet against them and had helped to choose the assets that would determine who won or lost.''
The complex amalgamation of investments known as Class V Funding III produced $126 million in profits for Citigroup's brokerage subsidiary, and another $34 million in fees for putting it together. All of that, including interest and the $95 million fine, will now be going back to the investors; the government will not receive anything.
In a statement, Citigroup noted that the S.E.C. did not charge it with ''intentional or reckless misconduct.'' Rather, it settled charges that its actions were negligent and misleading to investors. Despite its profits on the current deal, over all Citigroup lost tens of billions of dollars on its holdings of mortgage-related investments.
''We are pleased to put this matter behind us and are focused on contributing to the economic recovery, serving our clients and growing responsibly,'' the company said in a statement. ''Since the crisis, we have bolstered our financial strength, overhauled the risk management function, significantly reduced risk on the balance sheet and returned to the basics of banking.''
The S.E.C. on Wednesday also brought a case against Credit Suisse, which played a smaller role in the transaction, and against one individual at each company. But those individuals were midlevel employees in each company's investment and trading departments; no senior executives at either company were charged.
Credit Suisse, which managed the portfolio of mortgage bonds that served as collateral for the deal, agreed to pay $2.5 million, half of it in penalties, to settle the case. The company declined to comment.
Samir H. Bhatt, 37, a former portfolio manager at Credit Suisse, also agreed to settle, paying no fine but agreeing to a six-month suspension from association with any investment adviser.
Only Brian H. Stoker, 40, a former Citigroup employee who was primarily responsible for putting together the deal, has decided to fight the S.E.C.'s case. He left Citigroup in 2008.
''There is no basis for the S.E.C. to blame Brian Stoker for these alleged disclosure violations,'' said Fraser L. Hunter Jr., a lawyer at WilmerHale who is representing Mr. Stoker. ''He was not responsible for any alleged wrongdoing -- he did not control or trade the position, did not prepare the disclosures and did not select the assets. We will vigorously defend this lawsuit.''
Mr. Stoker joined Citigroup at the height of the housing boom in 2005, and worked as a director on the structured product desk. His job tasks were largely behind the scenes, crunching numbers and assembling deals like Class V Funding III.
After the deal closed on Feb. 28, 2007, more than 80 percent of the portfolio was downgraded by credit ratings agencies in less than nine months. The security declared ''an event of default'' on Nov. 19, 2007, and investors soon lost hundreds of millions of dollars, the S.E.C. said, while Citigroup gained.
Among the losers was Ambac of New York, which insured financial instruments and was the largest investor in the deal, according to the S.E.C. Ambac's role in the transaction was to assume the credit risk associated with a $500 million portion of the portfolio. When the value of the portfolio fell, Ambac had to make payments to those who had bet against the bonds, as Citigroup had.
In part because of losses tied to the financial crisis, Ambac filed for bankruptcy last year.
Criminal prosecutions related to the financial crisis have been few. Two former Credit Suisse brokers were sentenced to jail in their roles for misleading clients about purchases and thus inflating their sales commissions. Six executives at a mortgage company, Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, have pleaded guilty in a scheme to issue false mortgages to obtain federal mortgage money and bank bailout funds. Lee B. Farkas, a former chairman of Taylor Bean, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in the case, which resulted in the demise of Colonial Bank of Montgomery, Ala.
Those crimes started long before the financial crisis. A prosecution of two former executives of Bear Stearns, the failed investment bank, ended in acquittals.

HEADLINE: John Portman, Symphonic Architect

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
In the 1960s, the architect John Portman began transforming the Atlanta skyline, first with his Merchandise Mart and then, in 1967, with the famed Hyatt Regency Hotel. Considered the first modern atrium-style hotel, it had glass elevators, lighted columns and cascading fountains that created a fizzy extravaganza of space and light, or what the former New York Times architecture critic Herbert Muschamp called ''architecture at happy hour.''
Mr. Portman went on to build many more hotels and commercial buildings in the following decades, including the Westin Bonaventure in Los Angeles, the Marriott Marquis in New York and the sprawling Peachtree Center in Atlanta. The buildings weren't always a hit; some critics said they were concrete islands, cut off from the city. But by acting as both architect and real estate developer on many of his projects, Mr. Portman forged a career that was unique among his contemporaries: half artist, half savvy businessman. 
Now 86 and still running his Atlanta-based firm, John Portman & Associates, the architect is the focus of a new documentary, ''John Portman: A Life of Building,'' which premieres tomorrow at the Architecture & Design Film Festival in Manhattan. Mr. Portman recently spoke with a reporter about his career.
Your buildings are known for dramatic features like soaring atriums and glass elevators. Why do you design so theatrically?
Anyone can build a building and put rooms in it. But we should put human beings at the head of our thought process. You want to hopefully spark their enthusiasm. Like riding in a glass elevator: everyone talks on a glass elevator. You get on a closed-in elevator, everyone looks down at their shoes. A glass elevator lets people's spirits expand. Architecture should be a symphony.
How do you feel about boutique hotels? Do they represent the antithesis of your style?
I don't have an objection to it. But they're trying to capture an environment for a certain kind of person. I think architecture is exposed to everybody and should not be standoffish. I'm for every man.
Your Times Square hotel, the Marriott Marquis, took more than a decade to complete. Is it harder to build in New York than it is in other cities?
It's more complicated, both physically and nonphysically, to build in New York. There were more things to go through, more people to satisfy and it wasn't the best of economic times. We were dealing with all that and trying to build in Times Square. It took a long time to make it happen. It went through three mayors up there.
Some of your buildings, like the Marriott, have been criticized for being cut off from the streetscape.
The context has a lot to do with it. The whole idea in New York was to create an internal lung. To take people out of that congested street, up to this garden on the eighth floor, with all this daylight coming in from the skylights. It was designed as a transition from all the congestion and anxiety.
What were your early influences?
Tivoli Gardens was one. Sure, it's an amusement thing, but it's much more than that. Another influence was observing people walk the Champs-Elysees. When you're sitting at a cafe, you're in the audience. And when you're walking up and down the street, you're on a stage. And people are happy in both roles.
Have you ever been to the Alhambra in Spain?
I haven't.
You poor guy. In architecture circles, there used to be a saying that if you went to the Alhambra, you never get it out of your mind. Everything has an impact.
You're known for your commercial buildings, but as the documentary points out, you've also built two very striking houses for your family, Entelechy I and Entelechy II.
Most architects don't build their own houses. You don't have anyone you can blame if the design doesn't work -- you can't blame it on the client. I asked myself, ''What was the beginning of architecture?'' In my mind, it was when man raised the first column and created space. Entelechy I evolved from that kind of thinking.
When I went to the beach for Entelechy II, the first image that came to me was the umbrella in the sand, and the blanket under the umbrella. And people sitting under it and reading books. I wanted something where architecture and nature would come together. It's not architecture with a few trees planted around it.
When an architect builds a house for his family, does his spouse get to weigh in?
Are you kidding me? You bet. But as long as you're satisfying the basic fundamental needs and philosophy, if they're part of it from the beginning, it works out fine.
Do you still go into the office?
A fish got to swim and a bird got to fly. I'm here six days a week, and it'd be seven if I didn't make a commitment to my wife to take a day off.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Names Deputy to Run Port Authority and Asks Agency to Expand Role

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Christine Haughney and Patrick McGeehan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
9:15 p.m. Updated Patrick J. Foye, a veteran of economic development circles and a well-known figure in Long Island's public life, was nominated on Wednesday by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to become the next executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The selection of Mr. Foye, a deputy secretary to the governor, coincided with a call by Mr. Cuomo for the Port Authority to take over the long-moribund Moynihan Station project, which would create an expanded train terminal on the West Side of Manhattan. 
The addition of the Moynihan Station development would expand the Port Authority's formidable infrastructure portfolio of airports, tunnels, bridges and maritime shipping. It would also reunite Mr. Foye with a project he oversaw during a brief tenure as a co-chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, his lone experience as the head of a major public agency.
Mr. Foye, 54, had been seen as a front-runner for weeks, and his nomination is expected to be approved by the Port Authority's board on Thursday. He would succeed Christopher O. Ward, who clashed with Mr. Cuomo but enjoyed a mostly successful tenure highlighted by a jump-start of construction at the World Trade Center site.
A board member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Mr. Foye is viewed in municipal circles as a well-liked and intelligent public servant who is considered a trustworthy ally to Mr. Cuomo.
His critics, however, have said he was indecisive and hesitant during his 15 months leading the development corporation, a term blemished by infighting (by the end, Mr. Foye and another top executive did not speak), the collapse of a billion-dollar planned expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and little progress on the Moynihan Station project.
A spokesman for the governor did not make Mr. Foye available for an interview. But Mr. Foye's supporters - and even some former detractors - said he had made the most of a difficult situation, hiring consultants to cut costs and grappling with the micromanagement of Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who appointed him. They said none of the problems could be pinned on him alone.
Steven Spinola, the chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York, acknowledged that the abandonment of the Javits expansion had been ''a disappointment.'' But in hindsight, he said, Mr. Foye could be commended for eventually saying no to a project that might have cost the state billions.
Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, said Mr. Foye had strong relationships with the city's real estate and business circles. Of his time at the development corporation, she said, ''He inherited what amounted to a totally ineffective agency, and set the stage for turning it around.''
In a statement, Mr. Cuomo said he hoped the Port Authority would ''meet its potential as a major economic engine that plans for the region and attracts business on an international scale.'' But some transportation professionals said they feared that Mr. Foye, despite his solid credentials, lacked the vision of some of his predecessors.
Mr. Foye began his career as a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, the Manhattan law firm, where he worked with Eliot and Silda Wall Spitzer. He later left for a public career, serving as a deputy executive of Nassau County on Long Island; vice chairman of the Long Island Power Authority; and the chief executive of United Way of Long Island. He lives on Long Island.
Mr. Cuomo's call to transfer control of Moynihan Station, a project that has been held up by decades of financial and political hurdles, was praised by some of the station's supporters. The Port Authority, they said, might have the financial and engineering might to bring the project to fruition. Senator Charles E. Schumer, in a statement, called the move a ''welcome decision.''
The governor's office said in a statement that the project would have ''no fiscal impact'' on the Port Authority's budget, which some financial experts feel is strained with maintenance and expansion of its existing facilities. Kate Slevin, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, said the move ''is likely to speed the project up, but it could put more pressure on the agency's budget.''
Mr. Cuomo also asked the Port Authority on Wednesday to assume control of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, an agency jointly controlled by the governor and New York City's mayor that assists with the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site.
''Too many different agencies doing the same or closely related work makes little sense,'' the governor said in a statement.
Mr. Cuomo also nominated two candidates for the Port Authority's board: Rossana Rosado, the publisher and chief executive of El Diario/La Prensa; and James P. Rubin, a former spokesman for the State Department who was recently forced out of his position as executive editor at Bloomberg View, the opinion section of Bloomberg News. He nominated David Emil, a member of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's administration, to become Mr. Foye's deputy.
Christine Haughney and Patrick McGeehan contributed reporting.
Correction: October 22, 2011, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the nomination of Patrick J. Foye to become the next executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey misstated, in some editions, the length of time that Mr. Foye was a co-chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. It was 15 months, not 18 months.

HEADLINE: U.S. Benefits For Retirees To Rise 3.6% Next Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Social Security recipients will get a 3.6 percent increase in benefits next year to help keep up with inflation, the first such cost-of-living adjustment in three years, the government announced Wednesday.
The automatic increase will begin with payments that go to nearly 55 million Social Security beneficiaries in January.
For retired workers, the average monthly benefit will increase by $43, to $1,229. That translates into annual income of $14,748, up $516 from this year. 
Social Security is the major source of income for most Americans 65 and older, according to the agency that runs the program. It expects to pay $727 billion in benefits this year to retirees, people with disabilities, and surviving spouses and children.
As baby boomers retire, the number of beneficiaries will grow. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the annual cost of the program will climb by 75 percent in the next decade, reaching nearly $1.3 trillion in 2021.
The announcement of the benefit increase came as members of Congress look for ways to slow the growth of the program. Such proposals could be considered by a special joint committee of Congress seeking ways to reduce the federal budget deficit.
One option, discussed by the White House and Congressional Republicans over the summer, would calculate the annual update in benefits using an alternative measure of inflation, known as the ''chain-weighted version'' of the Consumer Price Index. The budget office says such a change could save more than $100 billion over 10 years.
Advocates for older Americans say the change would be tantamount to a backdoor cut in benefits. House Democrats, including two members of the committee on deficit reduction -- Representatives Xavier Becerra of California and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland -- opposed the idea when it came up earlier this year.
The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said that any savings in Social Security should be used to strengthen the program, not to reduce the deficit.
Nancy LeaMond, an executive vice president of AARP, the lobby for middle-aged and older Americans, said the increase in benefits would provide some relief for people whose finances had been battered by a ''decline in housing values, deep losses to retirement and savings accounts and skyrocketing health and prescription drug costs'' in the last few years.
The Social Security Administration pointed out on Wednesday that for some beneficiaries, the increase in Social Security benefits next year ''may be partially or completely offset by increases in Medicare premiums.''
Social Security could be a political issue in campaigns for the White House and Congress. In September, at a debate among Republicans seeking the party's presidential nomination, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas talked about the need to shore up Social Security and referred to the program as a ''Ponzi scheme.'' Mr. Perry was assailed by some of his Republican rivals and by Democrats, who promise to defend the program.
''Democrats created Social Security, and we will protect it,'' Ms. Pelosi said Wednesday. ''We must reaffirm our fundamental commitment: to preserve and strengthen Social Security, not privatize it; to maintain this pillar of economic security, not undermine it.''
Under federal law, the cost-of-living adjustment, intended to preserve the purchasing power of Social Security benefits, is based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners.
Social Security beneficiaries received an increase of 5.8 percent in 2009. No cost-of-living adjustments were provided in 2010 or 2011.
The recent increase in consumer prices has eroded the purchasing power of the wages paid to many workers under 65 who do not automatically receive cost-of-living adjustments in their paychecks.
Based on the increase in average wages, the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax will increase next year to $110,100, from $106,800.
More than eight million low-income people receiving Supplemental Security Income will also get a 3.6 percent increase in benefits next year. The standard federal payment will rise to $698 a month for an individual, from $674, and to $1,048 for a couple, from $1,011, the government said.

HEADLINE: Investment Banking Faces Diminished Future at UBS

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- In a golfing resort in the rolling farmland of Hamburg, N.J., about 100 senior UBS investment bankers gathered last month to discuss their unit's uncertain future.
Even before UBS, the giant Swiss bank, lost $2.3 billion in a rogue trading scandal five weeks ago, it was determined to shrink its investment banking operation to placate regulators and to improve profitability.
To give the bankers a flavor of what to expect at a firm whose focus was increasingly shifting toward the more profitable and less risky business of wealth management, their boss, Carsten Kengeter, had arranged for a special guest speaker: Jurg Zeltner, UBS's head of wealth management.
An enthusiastic Mr. Zeltner told the bankers that their division was still much needed even as it faced far-reaching cuts, according to a person who was present but declined to be named because the meeting was private. In fact, the key to improve UBS's profitability and share price, the Swiss manager said, was to outsmart the competition by having investment bankers work closer with their colleagues in wealth management and share more clients. 
The abrupt resignation of Oswald J. Grubel as chief executive last month over the trading loss left the new investment banking strategy mainly in the hands of Mr. Zeltner and Mr. Kengeter, the head of investment banking, who came from Goldman Sachs three years ago. UBS's interim chief executive, Sergio P. Ermotti, came to UBS only in April and it was unclear whether his role would be made permanent.
''What they are trying to do has never been done before,'' Christopher Wheeler, an analyst at Mediobanca, said. ''They want to shrink the investment bank by choice, which means unwinding positions without loss and running down their books while keeping the morale among staff, and it's unclear who's running the shop.''
The sudden shift of UBS, long one of Europe's major investment banks, is driven by a disappointing performance but also by demands from Swiss regulators and politicians to abandon riskier practices like proprietary trading and to buttress their operations with more capital.
Switzerland, which is not part of the European Union, already has stricter capital rules than the rest of the region, but European leaders are considering forcing banks to hold more reserves to cushion them in a crisis. UBS officials say they hope that their urgency to restructure could give it a head start against rivals like Deutsche Bank.
UBS is expected to reveal the investment banking plans to investors at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York on Nov. 17, but some analysts said the bank might present some details on Tuesday;, when it releases its third-quarter earnings figures.
The question is whether UBS can shrink the investment banking business enough to satisfy investors and Swiss regulators without disrupting its other operations, losing lucrative clients or costing too much. With a smaller investment bank, UBS expects earnings growth to come from attracting high-net-worth clients with services and products created by linking investment banking and wealth management closer together, especially in Asia. For example, UBS would help a family-owned business in Hong Kong sell shares on the stock market and then offer advice on how to manage the proceeds.
''The increasingly close relationship we enjoy with wealth management allows its clients to more actively benefit from the full capabilities the investment bank offers,'' Mr. Kengeter said in an interview this month. ''In today's market and regulatory environment, that proposition has never been more compelling.''
Much is at stake for UBS, whose investors are slowly running out of patience after watching the bank stumble from one credibility crisis into another, forcing three chief executives out the door in five years.
UBS is not alone among banks seeking to scale back their investment banking business at a time of declining trading revenue and stricter capital requirements. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are also cutting thousands of jobs. But unlike them, UBS missed out on a fixed-income trading boom in 2009 that generated big profits on Wall Street because it was still repairing its troubled credit operation.
UBS's wealth management had its own difficulties when it admitted last year that it had helped thousands of American clients to evade taxes. But the bank was able to stem a net outflow of money while its investment banking performance continued to disappoint.
The arrest in September of Kweku M. Adoboli, the London trader facing charges of fraud and false accounting after UBS uncovered a large trading loss, renewed calls by some Swiss politicians for UBS to abandon investment banking altogether.
Susanne Leutenegger Oberholzer, a lawmaker from Switzerland's Social Democratic Party, said ''everything that has some risk has to go.'' She might be a minority voice among politicians but the public sentiment against Switzerland's big banks is growing.
''In Switzerland, we've had it so bad with the big banks,'' she said. ''People are just fed up.''
Shares in UBS, which fell 32 percent this year, are widely held by Swiss retail investors and the bank's total assets are about three times Switzerland's gross domestic product. UBS's net profit fell 33 percent to 2.8 billion Swiss francs, or $3.1 billion, in the first half of this year as earnings at the investment bank more than halved. Most of the money the bank makes comes from wealth and asset management, with investment banking generating about 31 percent of earnings. Yet, the investment banking operation incurs the biggest costs.
UBS repeatedly said it would hold on to its investment banking business and would not sell its United States retail brokerage business, the former PaineWebber, despite persistent rumors that Wells Fargo would buy it. With renewed urgency after the rogue trading scandal, Mr. Kengeter, based in London, and Mr. Zeltner, based in Zurich, continued to analyze every asset class and service offered by the investment banking unit to determine which areas should be scaled back and which abandoned. The two 44-year-old executives hold daily calls and often invite each other to present at their units' committee meetings.
Any area that is unnecessary for the wealth management operation, has a low income but high costs and in which UBS does not rank among the top players is likely to be abandoned, said a senior executive with direct knowledge of the plan, who declined to be named because the plan was not final.
As a result, UBS might keep the currency and equity business, where it is relatively successful, and hold on to research, which is considered essential for the wealth management business. Parts of its credit business, including asset-backed corporate lending, which require a larger part of the bank's capital, and commodities, where UBS is an also-ran, are likely to be scaled down.
In London and New York, investment bankers watch the developments with a growing fear of being reduced to a support function for private bankers.
''Suddenly investment banking drifted to become a difficult stepchild and noncore,'' said one UBS banker, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak about his employer. ''Nobody in management would admit that, but actions speak louder than words.''
While the investment banking unit shed thousands of jobs, the wealth management operation added 300 advisers in the Asia-Pacific region since the start of the year. There are compulsory training courses for investment bankers and wealth advisers about how to work closer together and in March, Alexander S. Friedman, the former chief financial officer of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, joined in the new role of chief investment officer for the wealth management business.
UBS is convinced that in a world where banks' profitability is curbed by strict capital rules and falling risk appetite by clients, its large wealth management business is a big competitive advantage.
But even some wealth managers feel less enthusiastic. The wealth management unit is unlikely to attract the levels of net new money it wants until investigations into UBS's rogue trading scandal are completed, said one wealth manager, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. ''Clients say, 'It's nothing personal; I just don't feel comfortable having my money with you at the moment,' '' he said.
Beyond the hope that the planned revamp would create a more profitable and stronger UBS, there is a desire to move on from the recent turbulent times. ''People just want peace and quiet to return to the Swiss banking world,'' said Mrs. Leutenegger Oberholzer. And Mr. Kengeter wrote in a memo to staff earlier this month that he would do whatever it takes ''to restore the reputation that we have worked so hard to build over the last two years.''

HEADLINE: Ford Employees Ratify Contract, Despite Show of Displeasure

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Workers at the Ford Motor Company showed that they were clearly not happy with the four-year labor agreement their union negotiated, but in the end they approved it rather than jeopardize hefty bonuses and thousands of new jobs in an uncertain economy.
Early on, the deal appeared in danger of being rejected, after several large plants turned it down. But the tide turned sharply as leaders of the United Automobile Workers stepped up efforts to sell the deal's benefits and warned that other options -- possibly a strike or lockout -- almost certainly would be worse. 
The U.A.W. said Wednesday that the contract had passed, with 63 percent voting ''yes'' and 37 percent voting ''no.'' As a result, most workers will get $6,000 signing bonuses on Nov. 4, followed shortly by profit-sharing checks averaging $3,750.
''The members walked right to the very edge of a cliff, and they looked over and decided to take a step back,'' said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of labor relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. ''It's pretty hard nowadays for a worker to risk not getting a signing bonus and have to explain that to a spouse.''
Having a new contract in place clears a formidable hurdle for Ford and allows it to start reducing its hourly labor rate by hiring thousands of new workers at lower wages. Some of the jobs they fill will be new, while others will replace veteran workers cajoled into retirement by buyouts of as much as $100,000. By adding shifts at its busiest plants, Ford will have fewer full-wage workers earning expensive overtime pay.
Consequently, the deal carries a minimal price for Ford, no more than $70 million a year, or roughly a 1 percent increase in labor costs, according to Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital, even as Ford prepares to pay about $400 million in extra checks next month.
Mr. Johnson said the contract's approval cleared the path for Ford to resume paying dividends to shareholders and to regain its investment grade credit rating. The rating companies Standard & Poor's and Moody's said recently that they might upgrade Ford to one notch below investment grade if the contract were ratified.
''This agreement is proof that, by working together with our U.A.W. partners and local communities, we can significantly create new jobs, invest in our plants and people and make a very positive impact on the U.S. economy,'' Mark Fields, Ford's president of the Americas, said in a statement. ''Our agreement is fair to our employees and it improves our competitiveness in the U.S.''
Ford is the second of the three automakers to win approval of a new contract. General Motors workers ratified their deal last month by a ratio of nearly two to one.
Labor specialists predicted less opposition at Chrysler, which reached a tentative agreement with the union last week, because of its shakier financial position. At two Chrysler plants in Kokomo, Ind., 55 percent of workers who voted on Tuesday supported the contract, which provides smaller bonuses than the Ford and G.M. pacts
''Is it as good as we want? No,'' said Jerry Price, the vice president of U.A.W. Local 685 in Kokomo, the first large group to vote, ''but it gives us a chance to live another day.''
Ford workers, too, seemed to increasingly sense, as voting progressed, that this was not the best time to take a stand. After workers at two plants in Chicago and one in Wayne, Mich., voted against the deal, it received overwhelming support from large locals in Dearborn, Mich.; Louisville, Ky.; and Kansas City, Mo. On the union's official Facebook page dedicated to negotiations with Ford, the tone shifted from anger about the lack of a raise and other omissions to fear about the consequences of rejecting the contract, even if few professed to like it. (On Wednesday, most workers were asking how soon their bonuses would arrive.)
''Our leadership went in the plant and made sure we answered as many questions as we could so they were making an informed decision,'' said Jeff Wright, the president of U.A.W. Local 249 in Kansas City. More than 90 percent of voters there supported the deal on Sunday after Jimmy Settles, the U.A.W. vice president in charge of negotiations with Ford, flew in and met with workers.
Ford plans to add about 1,600 workers in Kansas City and spend $1.1 billion to upgrade the plant. Over all, Ford committed to invest $6.2 billion in its American plants and add 12,000 hourly jobs by 2015, including 5,750 that it had not previously announced.
''As the nation's economy remains stalled and uncertain and its employment rate stagnates, we were able to win an agreement with Ford that will bring auto manufacturing jobs back to the United States from China, Mexico and Japan,'' the U.A.W.'s president, Bob King, said in a statement. ''The American auto industry is on its way back.''

HEADLINE: Euro, Meant to Unite Europe, Seems to Be Rending It

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- The euro was a political project meant to unite Europe after the Soviet collapse in a sphere of collective prosperity that would lead to greater federalism. Instead, the euro seems to be pulling Europe apart.
As European leaders scramble to present a united front for this weekend's critical meeting in Brussels, anxiety in Europe is growing, and not just about the euro. The assumptions of 60 years suddenly seem hollow, and the road ahead is unclear, as if the GPS system has gone out of whack.
On the surface, the European Union is an enormous success. It has nearly 500 million citizens and a gross domestic product of more than $17 trillion, larger than that of the United States and more than three times China's or Japan's. It is America's largest trading partner by far, and together the two economies account for roughly half the world's gross domestic product and nearly a third of its trade. 
But Europe is in economic and demographic decline as Asia is rising. The European Union's share of global trade is steadily dropping, especially in exports. Its aging population is placing huge strains on generous social welfare and pension programs and pumping up sovereign debt in an extended period of flat growth.
Technologically, it is behind the United States, but its pay scales are too high to be an easily competitive exporter.
The current crisis over the euro has deep roots in the imbalances between north and south, rich and poor, export-led and service-driven economies, tied together by a currency but few rules, and those rarely enforced.
A fix will require fundamental changes in the functioning of the bloc, with more interference in the workings of sovereign states. There would need to be a fiscal union, with a treasury and a finance minister capable of intervening in national budgets, and more unified tax and pension policies. But it is far from clear that the European Union can gather itself to take these fateful steps away from nationalist identities to a truly European model.
''We are today confronted by the greatest challenge our union has known in its entire history,'' said Jose Manuel Barroso, the head of the European Commission. ''It is a financial, economic and social crisis. But also a crisis of confidence -- in our leadership, in Europe itself, in our capacity to find solutions.''
There are many who believe that the European Union and its leaders have already been found wanting, and that the European project that brought democracy and peace to the Continent may begin to unravel.
''This crisis is threatening the benefits of 60 years of European integration,'' said Nicolas Baverez, a French economist and historian. ''All the principles on which the euro zone was built -- no state default, no monetary transfers, no bailouts and strict limits on debt -- all these principles are dead, and we have no rules to make this work.''
Worse, he said, political leaders underestimate the dangers. ''This is not just another recession, but a real and fundamental crisis,'' he said. ''There is a tension in the political system and doubt about democratic institutions that we have not experienced since the fall of the Soviet Union.''
Built from the ruins of war and expanded generously in the euphoria after the Soviet collapse, the European Union heralded itself as a model, radiating ''soft power.'' But now the model looks tarnished and flawed.
Leaders seem diminished; local politics trump solidarity. There is a new nationalism degrading the collective responsibility and shared sovereignty that defines the European Union. Euro-skepticism runs from far-right parties that simultaneously detest immigrants, globalism and Brussels to the governing parties of Europe's most successful countries.
A European Union of 15 nations seemed coherent and manageable; the Europe of 27, soon to be 28, is almost ungovernable, even by a professional bureaucracy with little connection to voters and whose decisions cause increasing resentment, summarized in the ''democratic deficit'' that the European Union suffers.
The historical ironies are considerable.
Germany, for example, divided and in ruins after the war it fought to dominate Europe, is reunited and dominating Europe now, but without arms and with deep reluctance.
Nothing gets done in the European Union without German agreement, commitment and money. But in Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany has a leader who is reactive and uninspiring, while her coalition partners, the Free Democrats, are slumping into irrelevance. Her eye is on Germany's internal politics, its loose federalism and coalition government, a major contrast to France's centralized, nearly monarchical state.
France once dominated the European Union, but Paris has now fallen behind booming Germany, one reason that Francois Mitterrand feared German reunification. Anxious about its own debt, banks and credit rating in the midst of a nasty presidential campaign, France is having a hard time dragging Berlin along.
At the same time, the countries of Eastern Europe are more vibrant economically than many of their western partners. They share much of the German, Dutch and Finnish view about strict fiscal discipline, and are reluctant to join a shaky euro and become responsible for the failures of others.
Britain, always an outlier in the European Union, looks wise to reject the euro, and the mood now is probably more anti-European than even in the days of Margaret Thatcher.
The fundamental changes needed to cope with the euro crisis -- particularly the historic step of creating a common treasury -- would require a redrawing of the basic treaties, which would require the approval of the voters.
But Europe is unpopular, a local metaphor for globalization, faceless and interfering. It is by no means certain that the voters are ready to leap into a new world of economic integration. Even if they prove to be, the new treaty will be complex and take years to draft even before being put to the electorate for ratification, if there is ratification.
It is easy to say that the answer is ''more Europe,'' not less. That can seem self-evident to Eurocrats and the political elite. But ''more Europe'' may not be what voters want.
''The only thing that can save the euro in its current form can't and shouldn't be done without democratic debate and support,'' said Simon Tilford, chief economist for the Center for European Reform, a research institution.
''You need to bring the electorate with you,'' he said. Of course, he acknowledged, a real democratic debate ''could exacerbate the crisis.'' That may be the largest historical irony of all.

HEADLINE: Mediator in N.B.A. Talks Has Strong Sports Pedigree

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
George H. Cohen, the federal mediator who is seeking to coax, cajole and occasionally strong-arm the N.B.A. and its players into ending their 112-day showdown, would seem to have an ideal pedigree for the role.
Not only did Cohen, 77, once serve as outside counsel to the professional baseball, basketball and hockey players unions, but his father, Leonard, also spent 48 years as a sportswriter, columnist and sports editor for The New York Post.
''I grew up being with my Dad, and that meant Dodgers, Yankees, Giants baseball games,'' Cohen said in an interview during a break in the N.B.A. negotiations Wednesday at a Manhattan hotel. For Giants football games, he said, ''I often sat with him on the 50-yard line.''
Mediating can be grueling, as Cohen's last two days on the job have demonstrated. He presided over a 16-hour negotiating session between the N.B.A. and its players union that ended at 2 a.m. Wednesday, and then, after waking at 7:30 in the morning, resumed the talks at 10. 
The bargaining went on until shortly before 7 p.m. Wednesday, when Cohen emerged to tell several dozen assembled reporters that the talks were done for the day but would resume Thursday. How much progress, if any, is being made remains unclear, with both sides abiding for now with Cohen's standard insistence on silence.
What is clear is that Cohen will again be in the middle of it all for a third straight day, trying to somehow get David Stern and Billy Hunter closer to a deal.
Notwithstanding Cohen's pro-union background, management lawyers say he is a down-the-middle mediator who is adept at nudging two sometimes unmovable groups, as he must do in this instance. His skills as a private mediator helped persuade President Obama in 2009 to appoint him director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, which steps in to help end major disputes that are hurting the economy.
''George has unique qualifications for sports mediation,'' said Robert Batterman, chief outside counsel to the National Football League. Batterman spent 17 days negotiating, and tangling, with Cohen last winter as the mediator tried unsuccessfully to end the N.F.L. lockout.
''He has total credibility on both sides,'' Batterman said. ''He knows how to move the process, and he understands the politics on each side of the table.''
Despite such praise, Cohen is not a miracle worker, and he declined to discuss the N.B.A talks in his interview Wednesday. But Cohen -- who has mediated opera, symphony and aviation disputes as well as ones involving federal workers -- did say that sports confrontations are especially hard to resolve.
''Among the important differences between sports negotiations and others,'' he said, ''is you have the two parties, the union and team owners, then you have the commissioner representing the league as a third party. And then, behind the scenes, you have a fourth party, the agents who are representing individual players, and they have a voice that is being heard in the process. And then there are the interests of the fans.''
Cohen knows all about the interests of fans. He recalls attending the first spring-training game in which Jackie Robinson put on a Brooklyn Dodgers uniform. He was at Game 6 of the 1947 World Series when the Dodgers' Al Gionfriddo made his famous catch of Joe DiMaggio's 415-foot smash, the play that ended with DiMaggio memorably kicking the dirt in frustration.
Cohen was born in Brooklyn, grew up on Long Island in Long Beach, and attended Cornell University, where he was a sports reporter for the college paper. But he decided against journalism.
''The notion of following in your father's footsteps wasn't appealing to me,'' he said. ''Perhaps in retrospect that was my biggest mistake.''
Still, he has done just fine. He got a law degree from Cornell in 1957 and then joined the United States Army. Inspired by his wife, Phyllis, who was working for the Labor Department, he became a lawyer with the National Labor Relations Board. Next he became the third lawyer at what has become one of the nation's most respected union law firms, Bredhoff & Kaiser.
He argued five cases before the Supreme Court, winning an important 1981 case in which the court upheld the authority of the Secretary of Labor to order limits on cotton dust in textile factories to help prevent brown lung disease.
''I practiced labor law for 45 years, and no one paid me one bit of attention,'' he said. ''Then I'm involved in a couple of sports disputes, and that all changed.''
Cohen's son, Bruce, a producer of the Academy Awards show and the films ''American Beauty'' and ''Milk,'' said his father's demeanor serves him well as a mediator. ''Dad has one of those personalities that people love and want to spend time with,'' he said. ''He really enjoys people and loves to find the best things about people. He's a very glass-half-full kind of gentleman.''
Cohen said he uses two principal strategies to reach a deal. First, he said, ''A good mediator is someone who listens carefully to what each side has to say, who takes the 50 or 60 things that people are polar opposites on and then identifies two or three critical components about what would make a deal.''
''My other principle is to start not with the most difficult issue, but to start with easier ones,'' he continued. ''It's a matter of walking before they can run, getting comfortable with each other and developing confidence with the parties.''
And, Cohen said, ''I often tell the two sides that you're eventually going to settle so you might as well try to settle today.''
Chris Klein was a player on the Los Angeles Galaxy and served on the executive board of the Major League Soccer players union when that group was threatening a strike last year. Cohen mediated that dispute, helping the sides reach a settlement before the strike deadline.
''What he tried to do was take the 20 things we didn't agree on and set aside four major, difficult issues, like free agency,'' Klein said. He said Cohen started with smaller issues, like pay for exhibition games.
Klein said Cohen could be tough toward both sides, pressing them to ease their positions: ''He was very difficult on many of our issues, like free agency.''
But Klein said he appreciated the energy Cohen brought to the bargaining and his attention to detail. ''It would have taken much longer without him,'' he said.
Whether Cohen can have the same influence on the N.B.A. lockout has yet to be determined. The nearly 25 hours of talks over the last two days show he's trying.

HEADLINE: Volatility In Markets Hurts Results At BlackRock

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
8:51 p.m. Updated
The stock market's summer storm, which racked up a long list of victims in finance, even shook one of the industry's most solid performers: BlackRock.
After churning out quarter after quarter of double-digit growth, BlackRock announced on Wednesday that its third-quarter profit fell 3 percent, to $521 million, as the money management industry battled market volatility and an anemic economic recovery. That figure was adjusted to reflect one-time charges, without which the company would have earned $595 million.
''In this period of uncertainty and volatility, we're very well positioned to serve our clients,'' Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock's chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. But Mr. Fink, speaking from the Plaza Hotel in New York, where he was hosting a conference for 250 customers, added that the gloomy markets were ''causing a lot of stress.'' 
The stock dropped 4.7 percent on Wednesday, to $148.92.
Because BlackRock is the world's largest money manager for institutional and retail investors, its fate is often tied to the ebbs and flows of the stock market.
Earlier this year, when the markets were soaring, BlackRock was reaping the benefits. In April, Mr. Fink highlighted how clients were flocking to equities, or ''re-risking,'' as he put it.
Now, with a choppy stock market, he said spooked investors were ''de-risking.''
The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted roughly 12 percent in the third quarter, its largest drop since the financial crisis, because of poor economic data and the European debt crisis. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index tumbled 14 percent over the summer months, while European markets fared even worse.
The market woes weighed down BlackRock's third-quarter results. BlackRock's assets under management, an important measure of the company's strength, dropped 3 percent in the period, to $3.35 trillion. The firm's performance fees fell 20 percent, to $91 million.
''They tend to move around with the markets,'' said Greggory Warren, an analyst at Morningstar, the research firm.
Despite the turmoil, BlackRock has dodged the financial industry's most serious woes. Unlike the nation's biggest banks, BlackRock does not carry baggage from Wall Street's near collapse in 2008. Nor does it have a trading division, those boom-and-bust businesses that have felled other companies. Despite the weaker profits, revenue rose 6 percent, to $2.2 billion, making it one of the few financial institutions in recent months to show top-line growth.
BlackRock also has advantages over its fellow asset managers. The company, for instance, caters to a mixture of investors, including large institutional funds. ''You've got a lot more institutional investors who tend to not bail just because the markets are heading south, whereas retail investors are quick to flee,'' Mr. Warren said.
The company has also profited from the turmoil. BlackRock Solutions, which offers risk management advice to troubled institutions and governments across the world, reported revenue of $117 million in the third quarter, compared with $101 million last year. The powerful unit, whose clients have included the Central Bank of Ireland and the Federal Reserve, gained 13 new clients in the quarter.
Even with the anxiety swirling around the global economy, Mr. Fink is hopeful for a turnaround. ''This is not 2008,'' he said on Wednesday. ''This is a confidence crisis, not a liquidity crisis.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

 BODY:
Occupy Wall Street is shining a useful spotlight on one of America's central challenges, the inequality that leaves the richest 1 percent of Americans with a greater net worth than the entire bottom 90 percent.
Most of the proposed remedies involve changes in taxes and regulations, and they would help. But the single step that would do the most to reduce inequality has nothing to do with finance at all. It's an expansion of early childhood education.
Huh? That will seem naive and bizarre to many who chafe at inequities and who think the first step is to throw a few bankers into prison. But although part of the problem is billionaires being taxed at lower rates than those with more modest incomes, a bigger source of structural inequity is that many young people never get the skills to compete. They're just left behind. 
''This is where inequality starts,'' said Kathleen McCartney, the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, as she showed me a chart demonstrating that even before kindergarten there are significant performance gaps between rich and poor students. Those gaps then widen further in school.
''The reason early education is important is that you build a foundation for school success,'' she added. ''And success breeds success.''
One common thread, whether I'm reporting on poverty in New York City or in Sierra Leone, is that a good education tends to be the most reliable escalator out of poverty. Another common thread: whether in America or Africa, disadvantaged kids often don't get a chance to board that escalator.
Maybe it seems absurd to propose expansion of early childhood education at a time when budgets are being slashed. Yet James Heckman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the University of Chicago, has shown that investments in early childhood education pay for themselves. Indeed, he argues that they pay a return of 7 percent or more -- better than many investments on Wall Street.
''Schooling after the second grade plays only a minor role in creating or reducing gaps,'' Heckman argues in an important article this year in American Educator. ''It is imperative to change the way we look at education. We should invest in the foundation of school readiness from birth to age 5.''
One of the most studied initiatives in this area was the Perry Preschool program, which worked with disadvantaged black children in Michigan in the 1960s. Compared with a control group, children who went through the Perry program were 22 percent more likely to finish high school and were arrested less than half as often for felonies. They were half as likely to receive public assistance and three times as likely to own their own homes.
We don't want to get too excited with these statistics, or those of the equally studied Abecedarian Project in North Carolina. The program was tiny, and many antipoverty initiatives work wonderfully when they're experiments but founder when scaled up. Still, new research suggests that early childhood education can work even in the real world at scale.
Take Head Start, which serves more than 900,000 low-income children a year. There are flaws in Head Start, and researchers have found that while it improved test results, those gains were fleeting. As a result, Head Start seemed to confer no lasting benefits, and it has been widely criticized as a failure.
Not so fast.
One of the Harvard scholars I interviewed, David Deming, compared the outcomes of children who were in Head Start with their siblings who did not participate. Professor Deming found that critics were right that the Head Start advantage in test scores faded quickly. But, in other areas, perhaps more important ones, he found that Head Start had a significant long-term impact: the former Head Start participants are significantly less likely than siblings to repeat grades, to be diagnosed with a learning disability, or to suffer the kind of poor health associated with poverty. Head Start alumni were more likely than their siblings to graduate from high school and attend college.
Professor Deming found that in these life outcomes, Head Start had about 80 percent of the impact of the Perry program -- a stunning achievement.
Something similar seems to be true of the large-scale prekindergarten program in Boston. Hirokazu Yoshikawa and Christina Weiland, both of Harvard, found that it erased the Latino-white testing gap in kindergarten and sharply reduced the black-white gap.
President Obama often talked in his campaign about early childhood education, and he probably agrees with everything I've said. But the issue has slipped away and off the agenda.
That's sad because the question isn't whether we can afford early childhood education, but whether we can afford not to provide it. We can pay for prisons or we can pay, less, for early childhood education to help build a fairer and more equitable nation.

HEADLINE: It's What They Asked For

 BODY:
Alabama's new anti-immigrant law, the nation's harshest, went into effect last month (a few provisions have been temporarily blocked in federal court), and it is already reaping a bitter harvest of dislocation and fear. Hispanic homes are emptying, businesses are closing, employers are wondering where their workers have gone. Parents who have not yet figured out where to go are lying low and keeping children home from school. 
To the law's architects and supporters, this is excellent news. ''You're encouraging people to comply with the law on their own,'' said Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, who has a side career of drafting extremist immigration legislation for states and cities, notoriously in Arizona and now in Alabama.
Alabama's law is the biggest test yet for ''attrition through enforcement,'' a strategy espoused by Mr. Kobach and others to drive away large numbers of illegal immigrants without the hassle and expense of a police-state roundup. All you have to do, they say, is make life hard enough and immigrants will leave on their own. In such a scheme, panic and fear are a plus; suffering is the point.
The pain isn't felt just by the undocumented. Legal immigrants and native-born Alabamans who happen to be or look Hispanic are now far more vulnerable to officially sanctioned harassment. Many of those children being kept home from school by frightened parents are born and bred Americans.
The problems do not stop there. Farmers are already worrying that with the exodus, crops will go unpicked. Like much of the rest of the country, Alabama needs immigrant labor, because too many native-born citizens lack the skill, the stamina and the willingness to work in the fields -- even in a time of steep unemployment.
The new law has also added frustrating layers of paperwork for Alabamans who must now prove legal status when enrolling schoolchildren, signing leases and interacting with government. After the law went into effect, the lines at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Birmingham grew so long that officials had to bring in portable toilets.
Alabama's reputation has also taken a huge hit just when it is trying to lure international businesses. No matter how officials may try to tempt foreign automakers, say, with low taxes and wages, the state is already infamous as a regional capital of xenophobia.
If Alabama succeeds in driving out all of its estimated 120,000 unauthorized immigrants, restrictionists will surely cheer. They will have only 49 states and 11 million more people to go.
There is another more humane and realistic path in which immigrants could earn the right to stay -- if Congress would accept its responsibility and move ahead with serious immigration reform. America's history shows that assimilation works better than deportation -- for everyone. If first-generation immigrants don't all learn English, their children and grandchildren invariably do. They may be poor, but their children grow up to be productive citizen taxpayers. Unless, of course, you frighten and oppress them, and forbid them to work, live and go to school.
Other states that are tempted to follow should look at what is happening in Alabama. Nobody is winning there.

HEADLINE: Tracing the Life of Deng Xiaoping as a Man Who Changed China

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- In 1979, just when Americans were beginning to reflect on the ascent of Japan, the Harvard University sociologist Ezra F. Vogel wrote his best-selling book, ''Japan as Number One: Lessons for America.''
Now, at age 81 and retired from Harvard as a professor emeritus, Mr. Vogel has written an equally compelling study of the rise of another Asian super power.
In ''Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China,'' he chronicles the life of China's paramount leader during the 1980s and 1990s and his determined push to open up and modernize the world's most populated country.
''My book 'Japan as Number One' played a role in educating Americans about Japan,'' Mr. Vogel said during a recent interview at his home here, a few hundred yards from the Harvard campus. ''With this book, I thought I could write something new that would educate Americans about China.'' 
The book, published last month by Harvard University Press, has already been called a monumental biography of Deng and the most comprehensive survey to date of China's spectacular but rocky road to economic reform.
Some reviews, however, have accused Mr. Vogel of devoting too little space to Deng's iron-fisted rule, including his 1989 decision to allow the military to use deadly force against demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
But other scholars say Mr. Vogel's new volume offers a deeply textured portrait of Deng and the reforms he championed.
''It's a major accomplishment,'' said David Shambaugh, a leading China scholar who teaches at George Washington University. ''This book pushes our knowledge of Deng further. And while much of this information is not necessarily new, this is the first time we've seen it all in one place, analyzed with scholarly detachment.''
Deng, of course, was one of the giant political figures of the 20th century, and has been credited with setting China on a path that helped lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty while reshaping global trade patterns. But only a handful of biographies have been written about the man, among them Richard Evans's 1993 ''Deng Xiaoping and the Making of Modern China.''
Historians have largely focused on Mao, the revolutionary commander-philosopher who led the Communist takeover in 1949. But scholars have begun to conclude that it was Deng (1904-97), Mao's diminutive and long-suffering lieutenant, who deserves credit for truly reshaping China after Mao's death.
Few scholars were better situated to write a biography of Deng than Mr. Vogel, who retired from teaching in 2000. For decades, Mr. Vogel had studied China, Japan and the other dragons of East Asia. He traveled to Guangdong Province in southern China in 1987 and 1988, when China began opening its special economic zones to foreigners, in order to study the reforms. He had also covered some of this material in his groundbreaking 1969 book, ''Canton Under Communism,'' a study of Guangdong's capital in the time after the Communist takeover.
Mr. Vogel, who worked for a decade on this huge biography, spent a year brushing up on his Chinese language skills with a tutor (most of his interviews were conducted in Chinese without a translator). He talked to people close to Deng, including two of his daughters, as well as relatives and aides of Communist leaders like Chen Yun, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, who had worked with Deng.
He also talked to former Chinese president Jiang Zemin, who rarely grants interviews.
Mr. Vogel visited Deng's birthplace in Sichuan Province, as well as remote Jiangxi Province, where Deng was exiled during the Cultural Revolution, consulted all of Deng's official writings and was given access to newly released documents from United States and Russian archives.
The result is an exhaustive, 876-page study of Deng's life that includes his multiple falls from power and his final comeback, when he assumed the top position in 1978; the book offers new details into how Deng pushed aside Mao's chosen successor, Hua Guofeng.
Mr. Vogel compresses the first 65 years of Deng's life into 30 pages, offering a sweeping overview of his journey from being the son of a small landlord in Sichuan to his transformation into a Communist revolutionary living in France and Russia, and then on to his role as military commander, and later, Mao's vice premier.
Deng loosened state controls over the lives of ordinary people, opened the door for Chinese to study overseas and, Mr. Vogel explains, he retreated from Maoist doctrine and Communism without ever really saying so. He lured foreign investors to China and tapped outside know-how to jump start a largely moribund economy, setting the stage for China's three decade-long economic boom.
Much of this happened, Mr. Vogel explains in minute detail, despite stiff opposition from Communist Party elders, some of whom feared the reforms were too aggressive and others who viewed them as bourgeois liberalization.
Mr. Vogel also writes about Deng's darker periods, like his role in the ''anti-rightist campaign'' during the 1950s, which harshly targeted scientists and intellectual, and set the stage for the Great Leap Forward, which led to mass starvation.
And he makes clear that in June 1989 it was Deng who ordered the military action, which led to the deaths of hundreds of people and sparked international outrage, to end demonstrations in and around Tiananmen Square.
The political scientist Richard Baum, a professor emeritus at University of California at Los Angeles, said the book offers an enormous amount of new material about Deng's leadership and internal power struggles in China during the '70s. But he also said those achievements are mildly diminished by sections that read like ''an uncritical paean to Deng's character.''
Other critics are harsher, saying some passages read as if they came from Communist Party headquarters..
During an interview, Mr. Vogel defended his work. ''This is unfair because in some places I'm very critical,'' he said, noting: ''A lot of Americans' view of Deng is so colored by Tiananmen Square. They think it was horrible. I have the same view. But it's the responsibility of a scholar to have an objective view.''
With this book, the Mr. Vogel said he tried to put Deng's life in context, to show him as a survivor, obsessed with social and political stability and economic progress.
''Who in the 20th century had more influence on more people?'' he asks. ''He took 300 million people out of poverty. They'd be trying to do it in China for 150 years, and they couldn't. And he did it.''

HEADLINE: In Bleak '70s, Salvo Of Protest

BYLINE: By KIM PHILLIPS-FEIN. 
Kim Phillips-Fein, a historian and an assistant professor at the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, New York University, is the author of ''Invisible Hands: The Making of the Conservative Movement From the New Deal to Reagan.''

 BODY:
OCCUPY WALL STREET, the protest encampment at Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, has many historical inspirations. After all, the tactic of sitting down and refusing to move was used by angry veterans marching on Washington in the early Depression years, striking automobile workers in the late 1930s and civil rights protesters in the 1960s. But there is a local precedent, one that few people remember today: the sit-ins and ''occupations'' that followed New York City's deep budget cuts in 1975 and 1976.
In the spring of 1975, amid a recession and mounting anxiety about municipal bookkeeping, the banks that had long marketed the city's bonds refused to do so any longer. To regain access to the bond market, and under pressure from Albany and Washington, Mayor Abraham D. Beame proposed a series of austerity budgets, slashing funds for schools, libraries and firehouses and, for the first time, charging tuition for the City University of New York. 
Leaders of public sector unions organized a mass march on Wall Street to protest the cuts. They criticized the First National City Bank (forerunner of Citibank) for failing to support the city in its hour of need. They urged members to cancel their accounts and withdrew union funds from the bank.
When the first cuts were made in early July, protests swept the city. Laid-off police officers rushed onto the Brooklyn Bridge, their still employed brethren reluctant to make arrests. Sanitation workers went on a wildcat strike, leaving garbage piled up in the South Bronx and on the Upper East Side alike.
Perhaps the most creative acts of resistance occurred in November, when the city shut Engine Company 212, a fire company in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Tipped off to the imminent closure by an air-raid siren, residents occupied the fire station, refusing to leave or to let the fire engine be driven away. They slept and ate there, and held meetings every Tuesday night that were open to the community and attracted large numbers of activists. After a 16-month occupation, the firehouse reopened.
The people of North Brooklyn had had good reason to be afraid. The neighborhood was filled with wood-frame buildings and the city was in the midst of an epidemic of fires. But their anger was not only about immediate dangers; they saw the plan as part of a larger, systemic failure to address the needs of working-class New Yorkers.
The cutbacks also prompted outrage elsewhere in the city. Students sat in at Hostos Community College in the Bronx to protest a plan for its closure. People wrote their elected officials letters to object to the cuts. They fumed as services deteriorated. They were angry at Washington, which Mayor Beame argued was more interested in bailing out bankrupt corporations (like the Lockheed Corporation) than in aiding the nation's largest city. But more deeply, New Yorkers feared being shut out of the political life of their city. Occupying public institutions was a way of reclaiming them, of insisting that the city should work for all those who lived in it.
Those who balanced New York's budget in the 1970s by cutting services have long been celebrated as saviors, while the wave of protest that swept the city has been largely forgotten. Much separates that time from our own; the city's fiscal crisis had different causes than the financial meltdown of 2008, and even conservatives then were wary about suggesting that the collective bargaining rights of public sector employees be curtailed or terminated.
But today, as people around the world face the contraction of the public sector, the demonstrations of that time seem oddly prophetic, a first salvo of protest against the age of austerity we still live in today. Then as now, people protested the power of a small economic elite to decide the fate of cities and even nations. Then as now, the damage done by cutbacks falls most heavily on those who do not have the vast wealth needed to retreat into a private sphere. New York did not go bankrupt in the 1970s, but it became economically polarized in the way that the people who occupied Engine Company 212 -- which was shuttered again in 2003, the victim of another round of budget cuts -- feared it might. And that is why Zuccotti Park has become the center of a new movement today.

HEADLINE: Food and Gasoline Helped Push the Consumer Price Index Higher in September

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
A rise in food and energy prices pushed up the index for consumer prices in the United States in September, although the increase was slower than in August, according to government statistics released on Wednesday.
The report, from the Labor Department, showed that the overall Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent last month compared with a 0.4 percent increase in August. Gasoline prices rose at a faster pace, while the increase in food prices slowed.
The core C.P.I., which strips out such volatile categories, increased 0.1 percent in September, its smallest rise since March, compared with 0.2 percent in August. It was kept in check by some of its crucial components, like rents, which rose moderately, and automobiles, which did not rise at all. Apparel, used cars and recreation declined. 
The report, which reflects seasonally adjusted figures, showed that inflationary pressures had been largely contained despite a rise in wholesale prices. And some commodity prices are expected to moderate in the months ahead as lower energy costs start to filter through the data, according to Russell Price, a senior economist with Ameriprise Financial.
''That is the lagging impact of petroleum prices,'' he said.
The overall consumer index was 3.9 percent in the 12 months through September compared with 3.8 percent in August. Gasoline rose 2.9 percent in September, compared with 1.9 percent the month before. Food prices were up 0.4 percent, compared with 0.5 percent in August.
In the 12 months through September, the core index was up 2 percent, the same rate as in the 12-month period through August.
''The core prices are starting to show that they are easing,'' said Chris Christopher, the United States economist for IHS Global Insight. ''So hopefully, for consumers in particular, prices will start moderating significantly.''
The report also showed that the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers increased 4.4 percent over the last 12 months. That measure is used as a basis, in the third quarter, for cost of living adjustments in Social Security payments. The government said on Wednesday that those monthly benefits would increase 3.6 percent starting in January, the first adjustment since 2009.
Mr. Christopher noted that actual net checks to retirees would probably not rise that percentage amount because of increases in Medicare premiums.
''At least it is mitigating,'' he said.
Government reports released on Wednesday also provided a glimpse of other areas of the economy, including the job market and the housing market, which continues to be challenged by financial pressures on households and a large supply of homes.
The Federal Reserve said in its beige book, a survey of regional economic conditions, that overall economic activity was expanding, according to information collected through Oct. 7, although many of its 12 districts described growth as modest or slight.
The beige book reported limited demand for new employees. Some districts noted difficulties finding skilled workers or said hiring had been hampered by an uncertain outlook for business or lower expectations for growth.
Residential construction remained at low levels, it said, particularly for single-family homes, while there was a moderate increase in the building of multifamily dwellings. In contrast, the report said, rental demand continued to rise.
Those observations were consistent with government statistics showing that housing starts, which reflect the commitment of builders and suggest that consumer spending on durable goods could follow, were up 15 percent, mostly for multiple family units. But there was no significant increase in the trend for the start of construction on single-family units.
''This is consistent with reports that home builder confidence remains severely depressed,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, said in a research note.
Celia Chen, a senior director at Moody's Analytics, said uncertainty about jobs and problems with foreclosures have affected the single-family housing market. Home values have fallen, and it is still difficult for many people to get a mortgage.
''Many of the households forming right now are just not going to have the wherewithal to purchase a home,'' Ms. Chen said.
''The ownership market faces many headwinds,'' she added. ''All the strength we are seeing is on the multifamily side.''

HEADLINE: Warning by States as Tax Revenues Fail to Rebound

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The warning by the State of Washington's economist was unusually blunt, a far cry from the kind of dry, green-eyeshade language that often cloaks such announcements: ''We are in the fragile aftermath of the Great Recession, where a return to normalcy seems like a mirage in the desert -- the closer we get to it, the further it moves away.''
The upshot: Washington's weaker-than-expected tax collections have led the state to project that it will take in $2 billion less than it expected when its two-year budget took effect in July. Gov. Christine Gregoire, a Democrat, called a special legislative session for next month so the state, which has cut $10 billion in spending since the recession began, can weigh more cuts. 
Other large states face similar problems, a clear sign that they are still not out of the woods several years after the housing bubble burst, the recession began and many states made big spending cuts. Florida, California, New York and New Jersey have all seen their tax collections come in below expectations in recent months as the nation has continued to struggle with high joblessness, a weak housing market, a sliding stock market and worries about the European debt crisis. The states are collecting more in taxes than last year, but not as much as they did before the recession began, and not as much as they expected when they drew up their budgets last spring.
State budget experts note that the fiscal year began in most states on July 1, and some remain hopeful that the economy will improve enough over the coming months that more rounds of cuts or tax increases will not be needed. Some states are seeing surpluses. But when budget analysts met last weekend near Washington, D.C., at a meeting of the National Association of State Budget Officers, many spoke of the uncertainty, said Scott D. Pattison, the group's executive director.
''They are cautiously optimistic that we'll miss a double-dip recession,'' he said, ''and sort of hobble through the fiscal year.''
California, which has collected $654 million less than it expected so far this year, could be forced to make a series of automatic cuts if tax collections do not pick up; a shortfall of more than $1 billion will set off $600 million in cuts, largely to education.
The shortfalls in California may turn out to be more about overly optimistic assumptions than about the weakness of the economy. After Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, failed to persuade the Legislature to extend several taxes that were expiring, the two sides papered over their differences and passed a budget in June by agreeing that the improving economy would lead the state to take in $4 billion more in taxes than they had previously projected. It is not clear the money will materialize.
Jason F. Sisney, an analyst at the state's Legislative Analyst's Office, said it was still possible. ''While there are many uncertainties, there can be no doubt that the challenging economic data since June makes it more difficult for the state to hit its budgetary goals -- difficult but not impossible by any means,'' he said.
New York, whose budget began in April, has collected $392 million less than it expected to, its comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, said in a report issued Wednesday. He warned that the state might need to lower its revenue projections.
Florida lowered its projections this month. The state collected more in taxes than it had projected last year. Then, shortly after its new budget took effect in July, fears related to Europe and the debt ceiling debate in Washington began to erode consumer confidence. Florida, which has no income tax and relies heavily on its sales tax, was suddenly seeing shortfalls.
The state now expects to collect $600 million less than it had projected this year -- a gap that can be covered by money the state kept in its reserve funds -- and $968 million less than it had projected for next year, which will require a new round of cuts. ''Where we thought the budget would be in a surplus next year, now we've developed another budget gap,'' said Amy Baker, the chief economist for the Florida Legislature.

HEADLINE: Apple's Disappointing Earnings Weigh Down Tech Issues

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks in the United States fell and the euro erased gains as a split emerged between France and Germany on ways to increase the European bailout fund. In addition, Apple's shares helped lead tech stocks lower after its iPhone sales in its fiscal fourth quarter disappointed.
Technology shares fell 2.2 percent as a group and were the biggest drag on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Apple slumped 5.6 percent. The company's profit trailed analysts' estimates for the first time in at least six years as customers waited for the new iPhone model to go on sale. 
The S.& P. 500 sank 1.3 percent to close at 1,209.88 after earlier climbing to 1,229.64. Financial shares in the index lost 1.7 percent as a group, reversing a 1.5 percent rally.
The euro was little changed at $1.375 after climbing 0.9 percent earlier.
Stocks, the euro and commodities turned lower as France and Germany disagreed on the role of the European Central Bank in leveraging the rescue fund, and banks lobbied against forced recapitalizations and larger write-downs of Greek debt. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France flew to Germany to join the talks as European leaders assembled in Frankfurt in an effort to narrow divisions before a summit meeting on Sunday.
''Time is running out for Europe,'' Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of asset allocation for ING Investment Management, said in a telephone interview. ''The longer it waits to fix itself the more uncertainty there is.''
Group of 20 finance chiefs last week set the Sunday meeting as a deadline for action by European officials. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany this week sought to lower expectations that the crisis-fighting effort would climax at the meeting in Brussels.
Separately, the Federal Reserve said the economy maintained its expansion last month, while companies reported more doubt about the strength of the recovery. ''Overall economic activity continued to expand in September, although many districts described the pace of growth as 'modest' or 'slight,' '' the Fed said in its beige book survey. ''Contacts generally noted weaker or less certain outlooks for business conditions.''
Alcoa, Bank of America and Johnson & Johnson tumbled to lead losses in the Dow Jones industrial average, which slipped 72.43 points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,504.62.
Many stocks that rose earlier on better-than-estimated earnings either pared gains or followed the market lower. Citigroup slipped 1.6 percent after earlier surging 4.9 percent. The bank agreed to pay $285 million to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had misled investors about a $1 billion collateralized debt obligation tied to the American housing market in which the bank bet against investors.
The S.& P. 500 has rebounded 10 percent from a 13-month low on Oct. 3 as United States economic data and corporate earnings topped forecasts and speculation grew that European leaders would do more to tame the region's debt crisis.
A gauge of home builders erased gains after rallying earlier on a Commerce Department report that showed builders began work on 658,000 houses at an annual rate in September, up 15 percent from August and the most since April 2010. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 590,000 pace.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32 to 99 23/32, pushing the yield down to 2.16 percent, from 2.18 percent on Tuesday.
Crude oil slipped from a one-month high, falling 2.5 percent to $86.11 a barrel in New York.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index closed up 0.6 percent as optimism grew during the European trading session that officials would reach an agreement to increase the bailout fund.
Spanish bonds slumped after Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday reduced its ranking to its fifth-highest investment grade, cutting it by two levels to A1 from Aa2, with the outlook remaining negative. The Spanish five-year bond yield increased five basis points to 4.70 percent, climbing for the seventh day, the longest stretch since December.

HEADLINE: For Artists and Performers, Britain Puts Out an Unwelcome Mat

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
LONDON -- Britain is turning away countless non-European writers, artists and performers at its borders, a result of cumbersome and unevenly interpreted immigration rules that are making it increasingly difficult for many arts organizations to include foreigners in their programs.
The system, intended to limit the influx of foreigners at a time of economic and security tensions, seems straightforward enough on paper. While some artists qualify for ''temporary worker'' status, the rules are intended to ensure that those who make brief visits for exhibitions, festivals, readings and the like do not earn money or try to remain in the country. But they have proved so onerous and so open to subjective misreading that even people who have been coming to Britain for years are suddenly being refused entry.
''Artists and authors are being treated as if they are potential economic migrants or terrorists,'' said Jonathan Heawood, director of the literary human-rights group English PEN, which has been pressing the government to loosen the rules. ''Essentially the government is trying to crowbar them into a system that wasn't designed for them and that sees them as a threat and not a benefit.'' 
Recent victims of the system include the Russian-born, New York-residing beat poet Alex Galper, who was turned away when he planned to read for no fee at a charity event; the Georgian artist Gela Patashuri, who was commissioned to produce a work for a London gallery but whose visa was denied because the authorities said they were ''not satisfied'' with his qualifications; and the renowned Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, who canceled plans to direct ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' at the English National Opera after his visa was granted and then withdrawn, and he was told to re-apply and to give his fingerprints again.
Britain is not the only Western country with tough borders. The United States has a notoriously arduous visa application system that has led to numerous well-publicized cases of artists and performers being refused entry.
But in Europe, Britain stands out for the strictness of its policies and the apparent inconsistencies in the way it enforces them.
In 2008 the government, under political pressure to curtail non-European immigration, introduced a tough points-based visa system. Artists and performers applying for temporary worker status now have to prove, among other things, that they have the equivalent of $:800 (about $1,250) in a bank and that it has been there for 90 consecutive days; pay nonrefundable application fees of hundreds of pounds; and find established arts organizations that can pay additional hefty fees, sponsor them and take responsibility for them while they are in Britain.
A separate category, for ''entertainers,'' requires that applicants promise not to make money in Britain or perform -- even for no fee -- at for-profit events.
''We expect individuals to meet our entry requirements,'' said a spokesman for the Home Office, speaking on condition that his name not be used, according to government policy. ''For too long immigration has been out of control, and this government is committed to having a system which benefits the best and the brightest but curbs the number of people who seek to abuse the system.''
But the rules are onerous and perplexing. Visa applicants are required to surrender their passports for weeks at a time -- a difficult proposition for people from, say, African countries without British consulates, who have to travel abroad and wait around while their cases are considered.
Tiny groups wanting to sponsor unknown artists often cannot afford the fees or meet the government's definition of a bona fide organization. Artists without sponsors -- novelists or painters who want to spend some time producing their work in Britain, for instance -- are often unable to come unless they lie and say they are tourists.
There seems to be little consistency in whether or not applications are approved. The celebrated Indian musician Rajeswar Bhattacharya, for instance, has been coming to Britain annually since 1996 -- always receiving a visa -- to give workshops and perform. This year he was scheduled to take part in a festival celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of the Bengali poet and cultural ambassador Rabindranath Tagore. Mr. Bhattacharya's application was all but identical to last year's, but it was rejected. British officials ruled that because he planned to teach as well as perform -- something he has always done -- he would be working as a ''music teacher'' and was ineligible.
The rules also stymie travelers coming for obscure but passionately attended events. The Argentine tango dancers Ismael Ludman and Maria Mondino, for instance, had hoped to dance, for no fee, for several dozen people at a village hall in Scotland, a brief stop in a European tour. Refused entry when officials questioned the nature of the event, they protested on the Web, posting a video of themselves tangoing at the airport.
The American photographer Alec Soth, meanwhile, ran into trouble when he told immigration officials he had been invited to take photographs to be displayed at the Brighton Photo Biennale. He finally got into the country after hours of interrogation -- but only after promising not to take photographs. (His 7-year-old daughter, traveling with him, took them instead.)
Even established artists at Springsteen-esque fame levels are required to obtain temporary worker visas if they come to Britain for paid engagements. While stars like Bruce Springsteen have managers and agents to handle such matters, this rule often trips up smaller-scale artists and performers from the United States and other countries whose citizens don't need visas to enter Britain as tourists. ''They assume that because of the visa waiver program they'll have no problem and so they just turn up,'' said Robert Sharp, campaigns manager at English PEN. ''But then an official spots their tuba or their cello or their paintbrushes and says, 'You're working, get back on the plane.' ''
Musicians say the mere sight of their instruments provokes instant skepticism at the border. Last year, arriving at Heathrow en route to Leeds, the American cellist Kristin Ostling was met by a wall of questions like: Do you intend to play that cello? And: No, really, who is paying you?
Ms. Ostling, a member of the Carpe Diem String Quartet in Ohio, explained that she had paid her own way and was performing free at an academic conference on the Russian composer Sergey Taneyev. But after eight hours Ms. Ostling (and her cello, which needs its own seat) were put on a plane and sent back to Chicago.
''Customs said to me that we should have advertised for anyone from the E.U. who was willing to play the music of Taneyev for nothing,'' said Derek B. Scott, the head of the University of Leeds School of Music and the host of the conference, describing his subsequent conversations with the authorities.
Even as she was being sent back, Ms. Ostling's three Carpe Diem colleagues flew to Heathrow to try their own luck at getting in.
Korine Fujiwara, the group's viola player, sailed through. But officials mistrusted the motives of the violinists, John Ewing and Charles Wetherbee, and took them aside for extra questioning.
''He was trying to get us to admit we were there to work,'' Mr. Ewing said of one official. ''He kept saying, 'Why do you have your violins?,' and we kept saying, 'We're musicians.' He basically didn't accept our story that we were going to an academic conference.''
Eventually they got through and made it to Leeds. But they could not play without Ms. Ostling.
Back in Chicago, meanwhile, with a passport reflecting her shameful new status as a British reject, a weary Ms. Ostling pleaded her case at the British consulate. And that was when the full incoherence of the system became clear.
''I said, 'Is there some kind of special visa that I should have?' '' she related. ''They said: 'No, we can't give you a visa because you don't need one. Immigration was wrong.' ''

HEADLINE: Curbside At School, A Red Carpet

BYLINE: By VERONIQUE HYLAND

 BODY:
IN the West Village, a stunningly decked-out woman is nothing unusual. But Rose Cameron still managed to turn heads in the neighborhood recently, with her long black hair and full-length fur coat. Perhaps it was because she wasn't leaving Bar Pitti at midnight, but exiting the Little Red School House after dropping off her child. The time: 8:30 a.m.
As New Yorkers descended blearily into the subway, Ms. Cameron rattled off her fashion credits with the practiced air of a star on the red carpet. The coat was Prada. Her boots, too. ''And the dress was, like, $40,'' she squealed. Is her high-low mix a representative look for the neighborhood?
''I am the wrong person to ask,'' said Ms. Cameron, who works in marketing. ''I'm not the typical mom.'' 
But in fact Ms. Cameron and her ilk are becoming, if not exactly the norm, far more common despite the faltering economy. The crowd surrounding the Sixth Avenue entrance of her daughter's school was thick with Rag & Bone jackets, Goyard bags, impractical footwear and even the ultimate fashion-insider comfort item: a sky-blue J'aime Rodarte sweatshirt. The sartorial M.O., as characterized by another Little Red Schoolhouse parent, Sophie Knight, is ''casual, but in a calculated way.'' Even the most ripped-up pair of jeans, Ms. Knight said, might have set their owner back $400.
Five miles or so north, the scene at drop-off is quite different. The area between Central Park and Lexington Avenue in the '90s features a cluster of private schools including Spence, Nightingale-Bamford, Dalton, the 92nd Street Y preschool and Convent of the Sacred Heart. Outside many of the schools' buildings, parents wait in line to enter with their children, a configuration that lends itself to label-gazing. Celine totes and Carolina Herrera jackets abound, and the looks are classic: shirtdresses with simple ballet flats, for example.
''A lot of moms are talking about the red jeans,'' said Cheryl Hoch, a mother in a snappy trench coat pushing a stroller down 93rd Street on a crisp fall morning, referring to this season's Technicolor denim trend. ''Someone has to get a pair of the red skinny jeans!''
Then there is the vogue for Christian Louboutin's red-soled shoes. The author Jill Kargman's daughter Sadie, whom her mother described as ''a hawk with all things fashion-y,'' once observed post-pickup at her Upper East Side school, ''Mommy, you're the only one without red bottoms on your shoes.''
Most weekday mornings at Yura, a coffee shop on Madison Avenue and 92nd Street, a largely female crowd tends to gather inside or sprawl on the benches outdoors, strollers parked alongside.
Lillian Holtzclaw Stern, a sales associate at Sotheby's Realty, was wearing a linen blazer and chatting with her friend Olivia Gerard, who was more casually dressed in a nylon jacket. Ms. Gerard's child attends a school where uniforms are mandatory. ''You feel like you should be a little more respectful, in a funny way,'' Ms. Gerard said of how this affects her own outfit choices. ''You should look a little cleaner, as a parent. But then, after a while, you're like, 'Oh, my God, I just woke up.' ''
Another mother, Catherine Abbott, seated at a corner table and wearing a casual zip-up jacket, laughed when the subject came up. ''Why do we feel the need to look good for school drop-off?'' she asked a friend rhetorically. ''I see a lot of moms that go 'fancy' to drop off and then they go change into sweatpants.'' Others come in sweatpants, of a kind: by Lululemon, favored by yoga enthusiasts. But it is rare these days to see a mother in a power suit, pantyhose and sneakers, as in the ''Working Girl'' era.
Celebrity mothers, ever-ready for the snap of cameras from tabloids and bloggers, have perhaps raised the ante. Claudia Schiffer and Elle Macpherson stalk the sidewalks of London in skintight leather Isabel Marant pants. Sarah Jessica Parker, in painted-on pink Rag & Bone jeans, walks 8-year-old James Wilkie to school. Gwyneth Paltrow shared her school-run staples in her online newsletter, GOOP, and once brought her new pal Beyonce on the trip with her. (The pop star wore five-inch heels for the occasion.)
The fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone, by contrast, relies on a rotation of monotone pieces by Maison Martin Margiela, Sonia Rykiel, Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des Garcons for the downtown drop-off of her daughter, Ava. ''For all anybody knows, I could be wearing all black from the Gap,'' Ms. Cutrone said, adding: ''If this were Compton, you would know who the Bloods and the Crips were upon arrival. Everyone has their colors.''
If one is routinely chased by paparazzi, drop-off can indeed feel like a combat mission requiring designer armor. The actress Brooke Shields, now appearing in ''The Addams Family'' on Broadway, said her older daughter has started offering her style tips -- the other day, for example, giving her a fedora because it would help her look like a ''cool mom.'' Her assistant has also gotten in on the act. ''If he gets his hands on me, he'll put out an outfit,'' Ms. Shields said. ''And it'll be like a put-together outfit. I'll say, 'What's this for?' and he goes, 'It's for pickup.' A part of me just goes: 'Look: I'm a mom, I'm tired. I don't feel like dressing up.' ''
Still, she makes the effort. ''You don't really want to be that mother that slows her car to a slow roll and shoves her kids out, although sometimes I have wanted to do that,'' she said.
While there are no telephoto lenses lying in wait for most Manhattanites, the pressure is still on, albeit on a smaller scale. ''The first day of school, at drop-off, is the big sort of kickoff. Everyone looks amazing,'' said Preston Davis, a mother of two who writes the fashion blog Keep it Chic with Jennifer Alfano. ''Jennifer and I laugh because it's O.K. to look like an unmade bed at drop-off. But by pickup, if that woman is still in her yoga pants, we keep counseling the women to put something else on, at least for pickup.''
The fashion designer Cynthia Rowley, who is from suburban Illinois, now lives in the West Village and favors simple dresses from her own line for school runs, recalled ruefully that her mother used to wear a flannel nightgown to drive her to school. It's a fashion moment she has no desire to repeat, despite the fact that, she said, ''the pajama look is in right now.''
Unlike Mama Rowley, urban parents can't count on vehicular camouflage.
As the morning wound down at Yura, Ms. Holtzclaw Stern recalled: ''I lived in Greenwich, and let me tell you: it's so different. People are in their -- what's the name of that designer, the terrycloth? They're all in their Juicy. Oh, it's awful, actually. It's actually awful. Because they're -- all of them, it's a uniform. And they all end up at Starbucks.''
Ms. Gerard gives her a look. ''Yeah, I know, but we end up here.''
''Yeah, but it's not Starbucks, and we're not in Juicy,'' Ms. Stern retorted.

HEADLINE: Six Companies Stay Anonymous in Solar Case

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- One of the most striking features of the trade case filed Wednesday by seven solar panel makers in the United States lies not in what appears in the public docket, but what does not: the names of six of the seven companies.
Commerce Department rules allow companies to keep their involvement in trade cases anonymous. And all but one company, Solar World, has exercised that option in the solar panel filing. 
Many companies are wary of filing trade cases against China, or of even cooperating with the United States government on investigations of possible Chinese violations of international trade rules. They fear being shut out of China's vast market, or being blocked from setting up manufacturing operations there.
''To the extent a company wants to share their concerns with us and not go public, we respect that,'' Francisco J. Sanchez, the American under secretary of commerce for international trade, said at a news conference Monday in Hong Kong. China is now the world's largest market for cars, desktop computers, cellphones, flat-screen televisions and many other products. And for multinational manufacturers, it is the least expensive place in the world to make a wide array of products -- although rising wages in China are starting to prompt manufacturers of some toys and garments to move to even lower-wage countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh.
The combination of China's attractiveness as a market and manufacturing base and the perceived risk of retaliation has led to the filing of remarkably few large antidumping and antisubsidy cases against China during the current global economic downturn -- at least until now.
But unlike many other types of manufacturers, solar panel makers have fewer concerns about missing out on the Chinese market. That is because China exports 95 percent of its solar panel production, as the Chinese government and state-owned utilities have been reluctant to accept the extra cost of solar panels in generating electricity.
Virtually all of the Chinese sales have been to the United States and Europe, where the Chinese panels usually qualify for generous government subsidies to consumers who choose clean energy.
Economic downturns in the early 1980s and early 1990s produced more large antidumping and antisubsidy cases, aimed mainly at Japan, than the current economic slump, despite its length and severity in the United States. Cases were aimed at Japan partly because few Western companies were trying to manufacture there, and they had enjoyed much less success in cracking the Japanese market than they have found in China in recent years.
Winning antidumping cases at the Commerce Department is particularly easy against Chinese companies because the United States still designates China as a nonmarket economy. To decide whether a Chinese company is dumping products at uneconomically low prices in the American market, the Commerce Department does not look at the price at which the Chinese company sells the same product in its home market, but in a third country.
The American solar panel industry is asking the Commerce Department to compare the prices that Chinese companies charge for solar panels in the United States with the prevailing prices in India, a less open market where prices have stayed much higher.
Antisubsidy cases also tend to be easier to win against China, because China has a large state-controlled sector, including banking, with a lot of money moving back and forth between private companies and the government. The American solar panel industry's case lists nearly $41 billion in loans and lines of credit to Chinese companies from state-controlled Chinese banks.
A manager at a Chinese solar panel company, who insisted on anonymity because of the legal disputes in the trade dispute, said that many of the Chinese companies had drawn down only a small share of their lines of credit. He also said that the Chinese companies were paying commercial interest rates in China.
China's central bank regulates the benchmark interest rate charged on corporate loans by Chinese banks at a level roughly equal to the country's consumer inflation rate, and below the producer price inflation faced by companies. The central bank then sets quotas for each bank's lending and the banks allocate these loans to companies based on complex criteria that include their political connections and whether industries have received Beijing's blessing, Chinese bankers and bank analysts said.
Renewable energy has been at the top of the list of government-favored industries in recent years.
Tim Brightbill, a partner at the law firm Wiley Rein who is representing the solar panel manufacturers who filed the case, said that the Commerce Department had ruled in other trade cases that access to credit from Chinese state-owned banks could qualify as an illegal subsidy.
Trade cases sometimes result in foreign companies moving production to the United States. One of the biggest Chinese solar panel makers, Suntech, has already begun shipping solar cells to Goodyear, Ariz., for final assembly, to qualify for ''Buy American'' programs; 60 or 72 solar cells are typically bolted together to make one solar panel.
But rival Chinese makers say that final assembly of solar cells into solar panels represents only about one-tenth of the wholesale price of a solar module. Wednesday's trade case covers imports from China not just of fully assembled solar panels ready for installation, but also of solar cells, so it would apply to operations like Suntech's as well.

HEADLINE: Perry Says He Backs Flat Tax, Drawing a Contrast With Romney

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Adam Nagourney contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Rick Perry announced his support for a flat tax on Wednesday, sharpening the contrast with his Republican rival Mitt Romney and capitalizing on popular frustration with the tax system among Republican primary voters.
The proposal by Mr. Perry, the Texas governor, does not yet have details, but it is expected to resemble a version previously advocated by the former presidential candidate Steve Forbes, who has advised Mr. Perry on his plan. Mr. Forbes's proposal in the late 1990s featured a 17 percent tax rate.
Mr. Romney has previously been critical of a flat-tax system, including in newspaper advertisements he took out in 1996 as a ''concerned citizen'' in which he argued that the Forbes tax plan was a ''tax cut for fat cats.'' 
Lately Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, has been more nuanced, arguing at a town hall meeting that he was concerned that too flat a tax structure would hurt middle class taxpayers and emphasizing that while there are some good attributes to a flat-tax system, he prefers tax breaks for the middle class.
Other candidates have also taken up the mantle for simplifying the tax system and broadening the tax base.
Herman Cain, a businessman from Atlanta, had entered the race as a relative unknown but has vaulted to prominence partly because of his plan resembling a flat tax (plus a national sales tax). Mr. Perry appears to be trying to harness the popular tax frustration that Mr. Cain has tapped into, and simultaneously differentiate himself from Mr. Romney.
A major result of adopting a flat tax would generally make the tax system more regressive, thereby reducing the percentage for high-income earners but increasing burden on lower-income groups.
''It's just simple basic math,'' said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. ''To the extent that it is revenue neutral, a flat tax implies large tax increases on middle-class people and, mirroring that, a major tax cut on wealthy people.''
For some conservatives, however, the regressive nature is actually a positive result of the flat tax system. Under current policy, the wealthiest earners are paying a higher tax rate than the poorest, with some Americans paying very little or no taxes.
That fact has angered many Americans who think they are shouldering too much of the country's tax burden. The ''99 Percent'' slogan of Occupy Wall Street protests, for example, has been countered with a ''53 Percent'' movement, referring to the fact that 53 percent of Americans pay federal income taxes (although many more pay payroll taxes).
The effects of these various proposals aside, replacing today's labyrinthine tax system with a flat tax does have the virtue of simplicity. Americans would spend less time, and endure fewer headaches, figuring out how much they owe the government.
''Simplicity is good, but that's not all you want,'' said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. ''If all you want is simplicity, you could just tax everybody $10,000. That would be easy and simple. But most people wouldn't think that's fair.''
A flat tax would be a major ideological victory for many economic conservatives, akin to how some social conservatives feel about overturning Roe v. Wade. Besides Mr. Forbes's plan, several other Republican leaders like Phil Gramm (also now advising Mr. Perry, according to Mr. Forbes) and Dick Armey have proposed their own versions over the years but with little traction.
Grover Norquist, the founder of Americans for Tax Reform, an influential conservative group, said all the candidates were moving toward a flatter tax structure. ''Now it's a consensus position in the center-right,'' he said, compared with 15 years ago, when Mr. Forbes's plan was attacked by other Republican candidates.
The presidential candidates advocating some version of a flat tax, however, denied that their proposals were regressive.
Mr. Forbes said Wednesday there would be large exemptions for adults and children, which he did not specify. ''That gets around the charge that it hurts the poor,'' he said. ''You won't get taxed until you reach a certain threshold.''
Mr. Forbes, chairman and editor in chief of Forbes Media, would not say whether there would be any exemptions for things like mortgage interest or charitable contributions. But he said the idea was to make the tax code ''as clean as possible.'' His 1996 plan did not contain those exemptions.
Though he supported Mr. Perry's tax plan, Mr. Forbes said he was not yet ready to back a Perry candidacy yet. ''I am not yet endorsing, but certainly leaning that way,'' he said.
The plan resembling a flat tax that has received the most scrutiny -- and that has nudged the other candidates to develop rival proposals -- is Mr. Cain's. His is a three-phase process, and the middle step would replace all federal taxes with a flat 9 percent personal income tax, 9 percent corporate income and a 9 percent sales tax.
Mr. Cain and his supporters have repeatedly said that this ''9-9-9'' tax plan would reduce taxes for the majority of Americans, including the poor. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan joint venture of the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute, found the opposite: the plan would instead overwhelmingly raise taxes on the poor and middle class, and decrease them for the wealthiest Americans.
Comparing the broad outlines of Mr. Cain's plan with current tax policy -- in which today's tax rates are extended, with the exception of the payroll tax cut -- the experts at the Tax Policy Center estimated that bottom 83.8 percent of American households would pay higher taxes, and the top 14.4 percent would receive tax cuts.
The lowest income households would have the biggest tax increases as a share of their income. The effect is mirrored on the other side of the income distribution, with the richest households receiving the biggest tax cuts both in raw dollars and as a share of their income.
Rich Lowrie, Mr. Cain's economic adviser, disputes the center's analysis, saying it does not account for ''invisible taxes'' that Mr. Cain's plan would address. He also said the campaign would release a proposal for how to shield the poor from any tax increases ''by the end of this week.''

HEADLINE: New U.S. Envoy and North Koreans to Meet in Possible Prelude to Nuclear Talks

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON and CHOE SANG-HUN; Brian Knowlton reported from Washington, and Choe Sang-hun from Seoul, South Korea. Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States will resume exploratory talks with North Korea next week in Geneva and has appointed a full-time envoy with a background in nuclear issues, the State Department announced Wednesday.
The news media in North Korea reported, meanwhile, that the country's leader, Kim Jong-il, made rare comments on the possibility of resuming broader six-nation talks aimed at ending his country's nuclear program.
The current American representative for North Korea policy, Stephen W. Bosworth, will be replaced by Glyn Davies, the United States ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman. In the past, Mr. Davies held a senior position in the State Department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. 
''It's important to stress this is a change in personnel, not a change in policy,'' Mr. Toner said during a regular State Department briefing.
Indeed, Korea specialists in Washington said that they would not read too much into the departure of Mr. Bosworth, 71, who has divided his time between his Korea duties and his position as dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. But the specialists said that the appointment of a full-time replacement could pave the way for more intensive contacts.
The Geneva talks, set for Monday and Tuesday, will include both men as well as a North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan. It was his meeting with Mr. Bosworth in New York in July that offered an initial sign of modest warming in diplomatic relations after the bitter chill produced by the North's continued nuclear activities, its testing of long-range missiles and the lethal shelling of a South Korean island, as well as the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel, which the South said was attacked by the North.
Kim Jong-il's comments on the broader six-nation talks were included in remarks he made about his government's nuclear program; in content, they simply restated the North's well-known conditions for the resumption of the talks, involving both Koreas, the United States, Russia, China and Japan. Those talks collapsed in 2008 in a dispute over how thoroughly North Korea should reveal its nuclear activities and subject its nuclear facilities to outside inspections.
''Our principal position remains unchanged: that the six-way talks should be quickly resumed without preconditions,'' Mr. Kim said in a written interview with Itar-Tass of Russia, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency. It was the reclusive North Korean leader's third known interview with the foreign news media.
Mr. Kim said that his government remained committed to the 2005 agreement setting up the six-nation talks, in which the North vowed to give up its nuclear assets in return for economic aid and a peace treaty and diplomatic ties with Washington.
That seemed almost to anticipate a remark by Mr. Toner, the State Department spokesman, who said that the Geneva talks were ''a continuation of the exploratory meetings to determine if North Korea is prepared to fulfill its commitments under the 2005 joint statement of the six-party talks and its nuclear, international, obligations, as well as take concrete steps toward denuclearization.''
Since six-party talks ended, North Korea has detonated a nuclear device and tested a long-range rocket that may one day be able to carry nuclear warheads. It also revealed an industrial-scale uranium enrichment plant, and it has increased hostilities with South Korea.
That has left policy makers in Washington and Seoul with few options: engaging North Korea in talks, even though it may use them to try to extract more economic concessions without giving up its nuclear weapons; or avoiding talks, risking a runaway North Korean nuclear program and more military tension on the Korean Peninsula.
A concern has been that North Korea would try again to manipulate differences in the interests of the other countries in the talks to its advantage. But at this point, any differences are probably between China and Russia on the one side, and the United States, South Korea and Japan on the other, according to Jonathan D. Pollack, an East Asia specialist at the Brookings Institution.
''It's fair to say that there have been some heightened pressures, particularly coming from the Chinese and the Russians, beseeching us to explore talks with North Korea again,'' Mr. Pollack said.
On Wednesday, a senior Obama administration official said, ''If we don't engage, that could result in miscalculations by the North Koreans.'' The official, traveling with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in Afghanistan, spoke anonymously under diplomatic protocol.
Mr. Kim also repeated his government's longstanding position that the denuclearization of the ''whole'' Korean Peninsula was a dying wish of his father, Kim Il-sung, the North's founder.
He said North Korea wanted to improve ties with the United States and Japan, but only if they abandoned their ''hostile policy'' toward North Korea. ''We built our nuclear deterrent to protect our sovereignty in the face of the United States' blatant nuclear threats and its escalating hostile policy,'' Mr. Kim was quoted as saying.
The United States, South Korea and Japan have been closely coordinating North Korea policy. After the sinking of the South Korean ship, the Cheonan, in March 2010, the United States bolstered the South by staging naval exercises in the Yellow Sea to deter the North. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, who has taken a tough line on North Korea, visited President Obama in Washington last week and signaled close agreement regarding the North. And in a visit on Wednesday to Seoul, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of Japan and Mr. Lee expressed similar unity, saying they would work closely on the North's illegal nuclear weapons program.
Meanwhile, easing obstacles to incremental diplomatic moves, Mr. Lee has dropped a demand that North Korea apologize for the sinking of the Cheonan -- for which the North denies responsibility -- before North-South talks can be resumed.

HEADLINE: 7 U.S. Solar Panel Makers File Case Accusing China of Violating Trade Rules

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Matthew L. Wald, Jackie Calmes and Eric Lipton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Seven American makers of solar panels filed a broad trade case in Washington against the Chinese solar industry on Wednesday, accusing it of using billions of dollars in government subsidies to help gain sales in the American market.
The companies also accused China of dumping solar panels in the United States for less than it costs to manufacture and ship them.
The trade case, filed at the Commerce Department, seeks tariffs of more than 100 percent of the wholesale price of solar panels from China, which shipped $1.6 billion of the panels to the United States in the first eight months of this year.
The filing, which the Commerce Department must review under federal rules, is certain to be controversial. For one thing, if successful, it would drive up the price of solar energy in the name of trying to breathe life into a flagging American industry. High costs have already kept solar power from becoming more than a niche energy source in the United States. 
The case also coincides with criticism by Congressional Republicans of the Obama administration's efforts to support American clean energy companies. Republicans argue that federal loan guarantees of more than a half-billion dollars to the now-bankrupt solar company Solyndra show the folly of the administration's efforts to guide industrial policy in that field.
The filing might also add fuel to the anti-China sentiments that are running high in some Washington corridors and have started to seep into the presidential campaign.
Chinese commerce officials had no immediate comment about Wednesday's solar panel filing, but have vehemently opposed such trade cases. A Chinese solar company manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, said in a telephone interview that in any trade case filed by the American industry, ''We would be well prepared and are confident we could defend it.''
In August, Solyndra and two other American solar energy companies filed for bankruptcy protection, citing the plunging prices of solar technology from China. Many of the surviving companies, meanwhile, have been laying off workers and closing factories, or setting up shop in China.
Two Democratic senators on Wednesday joined the news conference in Washington announcing the trade case, which is being led by an Oregon solar panel maker, SolarWorld Industries America.
''American solar operations should be rapidly expanding to keep pace with the skyrocketing demand for these products,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. ''But that is not what has been happening,'' Mr. Wyden said. ''There seems to be one primary explanation for this; that is, that China is cheating.''
He was joined by his Oregon colleague Senator Jeff Merkley, also a Democrat, who said China was engaging in ''rogue practices.''
Whatever the partisan positioning, though, the trade case will procedurally begin above the political fray. It will follow a quasi-judicial path at the Commerce Department and a related American agency, the International Trade Commission, that is intended to operate without partisan influence.
Other recent industry cases against China that have followed this process include one filed in late March, involving galvanized steel wire. The most recently completed case against China, in late May, resulted in tariffs of about 33 percent levied against certain types of imported aluminum products.
The White House on Wednesday declined to comment on the solar trade filing. But President Obama recently appeared to support the American solar industry's concerns. In a White House news conference on Oct. 6 he said: ''Even if the technology was developed in the United States, they end up going to China because the Chinese government will say, 'We're going to help you get started, we'll help you scale up, we'll give you low-interest loans or no-interest loans, we will give siting, we will do whatever it takes for you to get started here.' ''
United States policy toward China provoked a recent back-and-forth between Mr. Obama's staff and Mitt Romney, whom many Democrats expect to be the Republican presidential nominee. Mr. Romney, talking tough in a Republican debate last week, said the United States had been ''run over by China'' for 20 years and ''you have to have a president that will take action.''
In response, Mr. Obama's senior campaign strategist, David Axelrod, countered that Mr. Romney was once again flip-flopping, having criticized Mr. Obama in the past as protectionist for mounting a trade case against China on behalf of American tire producers.
Wednesday's filing could prove too late to save the American solar panel industry. China already accounts for three-fifths of the world's solar panel production, giving it enormous economies of scale.
China exports 95 percent of its production, much of it to the United States, which has helped push wholesale solar panel prices down from $3.30 a watt of capacity in 2008 to $1.80 by last January and now to $1.20. A typical solar panel might have a capacity of 230 watts.
The trade case seeks tariffs ''well in excess of 100 percent'' on the wholesale price of Chinese solar panels on arrival at American docks, as punishment for dumping goods. Including installation, the American solar power market is worth about $6 billion a year. So far, though, solar power generates only about one-tenth of 1 percent of the United States' electricity because it is still more expensive than fossil fuels. Any price increase in the technology -- particularly an effective doubling of the price of Chinese imports through tariffs -- is not likely to improve that ratio.
SolarWorld Industries America, the largest maker of conventional solar panels in the United States, made the decision in late spring to assemble a coalition for a case against China, even before Solyndra's difficulties became widely known, according to Gordon Brinser, SolarWorld's president.
Significantly, the other six companies that joined the case have withheld their names, as they are entitled to do under Commerce Department rules. Many companies fear that the Chinese government is ready to retaliate against any business that challenges its policies.
SolarWorld Industries America, based in Hillsboro, Ore., is a subsidiary of SolarWorld, a German company. The American subsidiaries of foreign companies are allowed to file antidumping and antisubsidy cases if they produce goods in the United States. Solyndra is not taking part because it does not manufacture the traditional kind of panels, so-called blue solar panels, covered by the case.
''This had nothing to do with any input from either side of the aisle'' in Congress, nor was it influenced by the Obama administration, Mr. Brinser added. SolarWorld might have acted sooner, he said, except that the Obama administration announced a year ago that it would investigate whether China's clean energy policies violated international trade rules. But so far the administration has taken no action on solar power beyond alerting the World Trade Organization to Chinese subsidies.
SolarWorld said it was representing a newly formed trade association, the Coalition for American Solar Manufacturing. An existing trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, is deeply split over trade actions against China, because it includes American subsidiaries of Chinese solar manufacturers and American companies that sell raw materials and factory equipment to Chinese makers of solar panels.
One of those American units, Suntech Power, which is owned by Suntech, a leading Chinese company in the field, said on Wednesday that it opposed the trade filing. That could be a big blow to the company, if successful. Suntech ships solar cells from China to the United States. where they are bolted together in Arizona for final delivery.
''The U.S. is a major contributor to the fast-growing global solar industry,'' said Andrew Beebe, Suntech's chief commercial officer. ''Protectionism would not only put thousands of jobs at risk, but it would inhibit solar technology's ability to compete against traditional forms of electricity generation,'' he said.
The trade case contends that China has helped its solar panel industry by providing the equivalent of billions of dollars in subsidies in the form of deeply discounted loans, land, electricity, water and raw materials, as well as cash grants and tax breaks.
Many American companies also receive subsidies from federal, state and local programs -- as in the instance of Solyndra's $528 million in federal loan guarantees. And Mr. Brinser said that SolarWorld was in the process of obtaining $4 million in research assistance from the federal government. An Energy Department report in July said that federal subsidies for solar power totaled $1.134 billion in the 2010 fiscal year, up from $179 million in 2009.
But because few American companies export 95 percent of their production, they are less likely to run afoul of trade rules against export subsidies.

HEADLINE: 2 Republicans Share History Of Bad Blood

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JEFF ZELENY; Ashley Parker, Jim Rutenberg and Richard A. Oppel Jr. contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The hostilities flaring between Mitt Romney and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas have been steadily rising inside both camps and may signal a new, more combative phase in the Republican presidential campaign.
The harsh exchanges between the men at a debate in Las Vegas this week made clear the differences -- in style and substance, background and belief -- facing voters as they get closer to selecting the party's nominee. Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry have been on a collision course for months, since Mr. Perry began considering a run for the presidency.
But the animosities began long ago, set off by a series of political encounters that began when the two men were governors -- Mr. Romney in Massachusetts -- fighting over the services of a political consultant.
The story of their political relationship starts with two ambitious men whose life stories led them to the statehouse. But the similarities in their careers have always been outweighed by the differences, and by the moments of personal and professional conflict. 
Mr. Romney's decision, as chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2006, to hire a consultant who was working for one of Mr. Perry's political opponents left the Texas governor angry, aides said.
''I think that started the downhill decline in the relationship between the two of them,'' a Texas Republican operative said on Wednesday, recalling the tension that existed at the time. ''They have never been close.''
It was not long before Mr. Perry criticized Mr. Romney by name in his 2008 book about the history of the Boy Scouts. To Mr. Romney's annoyance, Mr. Perry noted that the Scouts were blocked from participation in the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, which Mr. Romney led.
''In the absence of an explanation,'' Mr. Perry wrote, ''it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the decision was made as a reaction to the protests of gay activist groups.''
Mr. Romney beat Mr. Perry to the national stage, mounting his first bid for the presidency in 2008. Mr. Perry's decision to endorse Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, over his fellow governor, added to the insult that Mr. Romney felt, according to advisers. He has never forgotten the snub, according to people close to Mr. Romney.
Before Mr. Perry's entry into the current presidential race, the two men might have found common ground in their desire to defeat President Obama.
But beyond personal slights, the ideological and personal gulf separating the pair -- Mr. Romney, a wealthy businessman from Massachusetts whose father was a governor who also ran for president, and Mr. Perry, with his roots on a Texas farm -- has added to the longstanding suspicion and ill will between them.
It was only the third day of his presidential candidacy when Mr. Perry blew kisses into a television camera after being asked about Mr. Romney. ''Give him my love,'' Mr. Perry said, brimming with a confidence that has been largely absent during a series of tepid debate performances.
Mr. Romney, by contrast, has spent most of the last several months dismissing Mr. Perry as not ready for the White House. Mr. Romney's campaign released a video on Wednesday titled ''Ready to Lead?'' that mocked Mr. Perry's stumbling debate performances.
That sense of Mr. Romney looking down his nose at Mr. Perry has intensified the Texas governor's disregard for his rival, two associates said. Mr. Perry believes that Mr. Romney has been condescending and that he has not taken his candidacy seriously, they said.
Mr. Romney declined to engage in a discussion about his rival on Wednesday. After getting off a flight in Minneapolis -- where was changing planes on his way to a campaign stop in Sioux Falls, S.D. -- Mr. Romney refused to answer a reporter's question about whether the candidates' relationship could be described as having ''acrimony.''
Pointing to a traveling aide who was warding the reporter away, Mr. Romney said, ''I've got to do what my media guy tells me.''
But other aides publicly accused the Texas governor of acting like a bully at the debate. ''I don't think road rage is a quality people are looking for in their next president,'' said Stuart Stevens, a top strategist for Mr. Romney.
Mr. Perry pressed his case against Mr. Romney on Wednesday, insisting that ''you won't hear a lot of shifting nuances from me.''
Mr. Perry has struggled to find his footing since entering the contest to fanfare this summer and then performing badly in several debates. His campaign said he would spend the next several weeks unveiling a ''full-blown'' economic plan that includes a proposal to adopt a flat tax.
But it was his testy, personal exchange at the debate in which he accused Mr. Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to tend his lawn at his Boston home that finally managed to rattle his seasoned opponent. While Mr. Romney's advisers say they believe he fared better than Mr. Perry, his response may end up as a negative television ad.
''I'm running for office, for Pete's sake,'' Mr. Romney recalled telling the company that provided him lawn care. ''I can't have illegals.''
Asked whether Mr. Perry came across as too hostile in the debate, his communications director, Ray Sullivan said: ''That's for others to decide. Governor Perry is a very competitive, passionate guy when it comes to his record and his conservative values.''
Mr. Romney's aides said Wednesday that he had gotten the better of his rival. But they also said they welcomed the idea that Mr. Perry might emerge as a more compelling opponent in the weeks to come. Several said the challenge of defeating a stronger Rick Perry would improve Mr. Romney's shot at winning the White House.
''Of course people took swings at him, but he was passionate,'' said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney. ''He's always going to defend his record, he's not going to take these misrepresentations lying down by any means.''
The next debate is three weeks away, which gives the candidates a chance to regroup and take their messages directly to Republican voters. Meanwhile, the campaigns are engaged in a cat-and-mouse game about when to start their television advertising.
Both Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney have war chests with millions of dollars that could pay for months of advertising. And new rules by the Republican party will encourage proportional voting in some states during the primary, a move that could drag out the contest as the candidates amass delegates more slowly than in the past.

HEADLINE: The Other Zuckerberg

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
''WHO wants a tequila shot?'' Randi Zuckerberg shouted over the thump of ''Baby One More Time,'' Britney Spears's breakup anthem.
It was nearly midnight on a rainy Wednesday in September, and more than a dozen friends gathered by Ms. Zuckerberg, the older sister of Mark Zuckerberg, a founder of Facebook, were crowding a private room at the Midtown karaoke club Japas 38.
''Yay!'' cheered the crowd as their host hoisted a carafe of tequila in the air and circled the tables, pouring shots. The air smelled of stale beer and soy sauce. After salt was licked, plastic cups drained and limes squeezed, she grabbed a microphone and belted out a rousing version of ''I Will Survive.''
In August, Ms. Zuckerberg, 29, quit her job at Facebook, where she had been among the first two dozen people hired. Most recently, she was the director of marketing. In its early days, Ms. Zuckerberg was a buoyant presence, representing her reticent brother to an eager press. Later, she earned attention (not always favorable) singing at company functions with a band composed of colleagues. And she came up with the idea for Facebook Live, the social network's video channel, which has featured interviews conducted by Facebook executives with Oprah Winfrey and President Obama. 
Now Ms. Zuckerberg has started her own business, R to Z Media, to help companies take advantage of social media.
''This is the launch party of Randi Zuckerberg!'' she said at the club, beaming.
Ms. Zuckerberg, who lives in a rented house in Palo Alto, Calif., has ambitions beyond the Internet. ''I want a talk show,'' she said two days earlier over drinks at the Mercer Hotel. She also wants to sing on Broadway. And she is interested in philanthropy: while in New York, she conducted live online interviews with participants of the Clinton Global Initiative and worked the red carpet at a United Nations gala.
Older women who are mentors, Ms. Zuckerberg said, have warned her that she must tone down her flamboyant persona, but she refuses to take heed. ''This is a new world we live in, and it should be possible for a woman to be taken seriously and still do what she loves,'' she said.
Three weeks after the karaoke night, she spoke at a conference sponsored by the New York Stock Exchange. She then traveled to Warsaw to talk to 2,000 telecom and media executives about social media. And the estate of Michael Jackson hired her to be the host of an online show on the pop star's Facebook page.
''Every article written about me now refers to me as Randi Zuckerberg, Mark's sister,'' she said. ''Maybe one day that won't be what people say about me.''
MS. ZUCKERBERG was born in 1982 and grew up in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., a Hudson Valley town about 40 minutes from Manhattan. She is older than Mark by two years and has two younger sisters. Early on, her parents signed her up for piano lessons, but she longed to sing. She enrolled at Harvard in 1999 and studied psychology after being turned down by the music department, she said, because her piano skills were lacking. She continued to sing, using the stage name Randi Jayne.
In 2002 her brother joined her at college. ''I don't know if Mark and I ever talked about our feelings, but we overlapped at Harvard and hung out a lot,'' she said, adding that they were ''as close as a brother and sister could be.'' Ms. Zuckerberg graduated in 2003. (Her brother dropped out.) She moved to New York to work at the advertising firm Ogilvy & Mather before being hired in 2004 as a production assistant on the television show ''Forbes on Fox,'' making $32,000 a year.
In 2005, Mark, who by then had moved to Palo Alto and had received $12.7 million in financing for Facebook, recruited her. ''He actually called up my mom and said, 'I'm concerned Randi is in a dead-end career,' '' Ms. Zuckerberg said. ''He finally said: 'Randi, come out to the office. I think you'll like it.' '' She said Mr. Zuckerberg bought her a plane ticket; while visiting the company, she was asked to weigh in on the design of Facebook's logo.
''I had never had anyone hand me that decision-making power,'' Ms. Zuckerberg said, adding, ''I fell for it hook, line and sinker.''
On her last night there she joined her brother in his office to negotiate her signing package. Mr. Zuckerberg, then 21, sat behind a desk and slipped her a piece of paper with two lines: one with her salary; another with the number of stock options she would receive. She crossed out the stock options, doubled the salary and slid it back. ''He took the pen back from me and rewrote the original offer he proposed,'' she said. ''And, he's like: 'Trust me. You don't want what you think you want.' ''
She joined the company as a marketing manager, but made little noise about being the boss's sister.
''It was smarter for her to fall in line and be like one of us,'' said Kevin Colleran, Facebook's first advertising salesman, adding that Ms. Zuckerberg's responsibilities did not compete with her brother's expertise. ''I doubt he's even seen her job reviews. If she was an engineer it would have been much more complicated.''
Ms. Zuckerberg looks remarkably like her brother, with saucer-shaped eyes, a long nose and slight frame. But she is more outgoing and early on became an informal conduit for reporters.
''Everyone wants to talk to Mark, but Mark doesn't want to talk to anyone,'' Mr. Colleran said. ''Who better to trust than someone with the last name Zuckerberg?''
That alone would have raised her profile in Silicon Valley, but the natural performer in Ms. Zuckerberg also refused to be squelched. She made a widely posted amateur music video in 2007 satirizing Silicon Valley's start-up culture and began performing at company parties.
''Randi was a force against Facebook seeming Google-ish,'' said Chris Kelly, Facebook's former chief privacy officer.
Sometimes, however, Ms. Zuckerberg hit discordant notes. At her 2008 bachelorette party at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas -- she married Brent Tworetzky, a product leader at Chegg.com, a textbook rental company, and the two have a 5-month-old son, Asher -- she was videotaped by a friend, the Internet personality Julia Allison, shimmying poolside in a curve-hugging white bathing suit and tiara. Ms. Zuckerberg lip-synced to the song ''Chapel of Love,'' a pink boa wrapped around her shoulders. The video was posted online by Ms. Allison and widely mocked.
''I think I was a little irresponsible with my creativity in the beginning,'' Ms. Zuckerberg said. ''I didn't think about my personal brand or my responsibility to the company.''
If her brother was displeased, she said he did not mention it. But Ms. Zuckerberg felt her brother's ire after another video was posted online in May 2009 in which she discussed Facebook's less than stellar reception at the Republican National Convention.
''Mark was not happy about that, and he told me,'' she said.
Despite the missteps, Ms. Zuckerberg came up with or oversaw many ambitious media and politics projects for Facebook. In January 2009 the company teamed with CNN to stream President Obama's inauguration live on Facebook. Ms. Zuckerberg was nominated for an Emmy for the ''Vote 2010'' series on ABC News, which allowed users to watch midterm election coverage on Facebook.
Ms. Zuckerberg said she ''went a little rogue'' last year and set up a makeshift studio in a closet at the company's headquarters to tape interviews with visitors she found interesting. That led to her conducting live online interviews for Facebook at events, including the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where she interviewed Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain.
''If I just told the idea to senior management as a concept or theory, they would have said, 'No,' '' she said. ''But by the time people realized what I was doing it was too late to stop.''
EARLIER this year, Ms. Zuckerberg said she began to notice that many of the projects she championed were being given to a team to manage without her authority. ''It was a little frustrating,'' she said. She said she did not discuss the situation with her brother. But as Facebook became more bureaucratic, it seemed to her that there was less room for a personality like hers. ''I was butting up against being myself and trying to lie low,'' she said.
So, Ms. Zuckerberg decided to leave. And, recently, she said she advised her youngest sister, Arielle, who works at Wildfire Interactive, a computer software company in Redwood City, Calif., to not join Facebook until she had established her own reputation.
''I had just spent the last six years creating so much value for other people,'' Ms. Zuckerberg said. ''I had a clear vision. And I wanted to own my vision and create it for myself.''
Mr. Zuckerberg declined to be interviewed for this article even after his sister sent him an e-mail about it. Ms. Zuckerberg said she got an e-mail from the company's spokesman, Elliot Schrage, in reply. In a statement issued through Mr. Schrage, her brother said, in part: ''Randi has always been creative and we put her talent to good use at Facebook.'' He added, ''Now that she's on her own stage, I know she'll be recognized even more for making the world more open and connected.''
At the Clinton Global Initiative conference the day before her karaoke party, a camera and two director's chairs were set up for Ms. Zuckerberg and her guests, including Chelsea Clinton, in a corner of a room reserved for journalists. Matt Hicks, a former Facebook colleague, monitored Ms. Zuckerberg's Facebook page and Twitter account from a laptop, posting comments or taking questions while she interviewed guests. When Ms. Zuckerberg asked the model Petra Nemcova about her children (Ms. Nemcova does not have any), she smoothed over the flub, unruffled by onlookers who floated in and out of view.
If there was a lesson in that, perhaps it was that the show must go on. Ms. Zuckerberg said she had not seen the Academy Award-winning 2010 movie based on her brother's company, ''The Social Network,'' but read the screenplay, describing her family's reaction as ''angry and flattered and disgusted and excited.'' She wondered aloud, though, whether executives at Facebook, even her brother, secretly approved of the movie's release.
Like Mark, she wants to be an entrepreneur. ''The next step for me is launching my own live online show, taking everything I've learned from Facebook Live and create my own channel,'' Ms. Zuckerberg said. Thanks to all of those Facebook stock options, she would also consider investing in a Broadway show -- but only if she were given a small part.
''I feel like I got a winning lottery ticket in my life and the rug could be pulled out from under me at any time,'' Ms. Zuckerberg said. ''I am going to appreciate every last moment of awesomeness I can get.''

After the reporter told Ms. Zuckerberg that her brother had declined to be interviewed, Ms. Zuckerberg said she would e-mail him. But while a representative of Ms. Zuckerberg acknowledges that she did e-mail Mr. Zuckerberg to tell him about the article, the e-mail did not explicitly request that her brother agree to an interview.

HEADLINE: The Fight Over How to End a War

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- An unusually powerful phalanx of President Obama's top officials, charged with organizing an orderly exit from Afghanistan, will face an outwardly confident, almost defiant Pakistan during talks that open in an atmosphere of rancor here on Thursday night.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; the new C.I.A. director, David H. Petraeus; and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, will, among other things, be asking the Pakistani Army to tamp down the terrorist actions of the Haqqani network that are killing Americans in Afghanistan, according to American officials and Pakistanis with knowledge of the situation.
The head of the Pakistani Army, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, may even agree to try to help on that particular American request, the officials said. There were some very recent signs he was already doing so, a senior American official said.
But General Kayani, and the head of the Pakistani spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, hold fundamentally different views from Washington on how the war in Afghanistan should end, and so far, they are sticking to them, apparently unbothered by threats from Washington to withhold billions of dollars of American military and civilian assistance. 
The Pakistani generals are anticipating the American drawdown from Afghanistan that is to begin in December, are watching as the war, in their view, goes badly and are waiting for their share of the Afghan spoils. As they do so, they appear to have little incentive to bargain away their demands or to modify their side of the ledger, officials and analysts here say.
''I see this as a test of wills,'' said Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general, who is considered one of the few pro-American former Pakistani senior military officers. ''There are such deep divergences of policy. Both sides are stuck.''
In essence, General Kayani says he wants a ''stable'' Afghanistan, a phrase that seems to deliberately echo what the Obama administration says it wants, too. It is an idea the general outlined in a 14-page paper he gave Mr. Obama during a meeting at the White House a year ago, but to which, the general tells people, he has never received a response.
For General Kayani, a sphere of influence for the Haqqani network in eastern Afghanistan -- in Paktia, Paktika and Khost Provinces -- that abuts Pakistan's tribal belt is essential, Pakistanis and Americans say.
That is the area where the Haqqanis, who operate as assets of Pakistan inside Afghanistan, have long held sway. They have used the territory, as well as their havens in Pakistan's tribal areas, to stage attacks on American and NATO facilities in and around Kabul in the last several months.
The strength of the Haqqani forces in these three provinces is particularly galling to Washington, General Masood said, because in comparison, the Americans have been relatively successful in curbing the Taliban, who are Haqqani allies, in the south of Afghanistan.
Another Pakistani demand that clashes with American objectives is a post-conflict Afghanistan that is free from the encroachment of India, Pakistan's most mortal enemy.
Last month the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, visited New Delhi and sealed a strategic accord that included arrangements for India to train Afghan Army officers. The last thing Pakistan wants is Indian officers replacing NATO troops as trainers in Afghanistan, American and Pakistani officials said. The Pakistanis were ''furious'' that the Americans did not halt the accord, a senior American official said.
The very effort by the Americans to build a 350,000-strong Afghan Army is a contentious matter with General Kayani. He has said publicly and privately that he doubts the $12 billion annual expenditure by the United States is sustainable. Some American officials have begun to agree, given the growing economic pressures in Washington.
Last month, Lt. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, the head of training for the Afghan Army, said budget constraints were so onerous that he was saving money by installing fans instead of air-conditioners at Afghan Army bases, and by buying uniforms from Afghan outfitters instead of American ones.
Beyond the cost, General Kayani has predicted that the novice Afghan National Army, a wholly new institutional idea in Afghanistan, will crumble into a slew of militias that will probably turn on Pakistan once NATO forces leave Afghanistan in 2014.
To iron out some of these differences, the Pakistanis have told the Obama administration they would like, and deserve, a place at the peace table alongside the United States and Afghanistan. American officials balk at the idea. The State Department insists it is working on reconciliation but it is too early to talk of a concrete peace process.
In fact, the Pakistanis say they watch in bewilderment as the administration pursues a war and talk strategy, one that calls for American troops to kill the Taliban in Afghanistan while American diplomats search for ''reconcilable'' Taliban to talk to.
''Pakistan will want clarity on whether the Obama administration has one or several contradictory policies on how to approach the approaching Afghan transition,'' said Maleeha Lodhi, former Pakistani ambassador to the United States. ''Pakistan's preference is for a talk-talk strategy, while the United States is still pursuing a fight-talk one.''
The challenge of the Clinton trip is how to square this. Suspicions are high among American officials that the Pakistanis want to participate in any peace talks to ''game out'' the solution to Pakistan's advantage, the senior American official said.
Meanwhile, the Pakistanis were defiant. General Kayani gave the tenor of his outlook when he invited the Pakistani Parliament's two defense committees to his headquarters in Rawalpindi on Tuesday.
Washington could continue to withhold military assistance because the Pakistani Army could well survive without it, he said, according to accounts in the Pakistani press. The civilian aid was so small it was not worth worrying about, he added.
''I could feel the bitterness,'' said Tariq Azim, a senator who sits on the Defense Committee. ''He was saying that for all we have done we are getting peanuts.''
The army has suffered 12,829 casualties since 2001, including 3,097 killed and an unusually high ratio of one officer killed for every 16 soldiers since it began fighting the Taliban inside Pakistan as part of the American-led war on terrorism, the general told the gathering.
Asked by Mr. Azim if he thought the United States would perhaps bomb or invade Pakistan's tribal areas, where the Haqqanis keep bases, in a fashion similar to the American bombing of Laos and Cambodia to hit the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, General Kayani gave a rousing answer, the senator said.
The United States would have to think ''10 times'' before acting that way, he said, according to the senator's account.
After all, the general said, according to Mr. Azim, Pakistan is a nuclear power, not a weak country like Afghanistan or Iraq.

HEADLINE: A Hit Maker's Life and Lyrics

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
The venerable musician and record producer Nile Rodgers, wearing a bandanna tied around his dreadlocks, fade-out sunglasses and a charcoal-gray pinstripe jacket, arrived at Cafe Luxembourg right on schedule one morning last week.
The original idea was to have breakfast and then walk around the Upper West Side, revisiting landmarks represented in his new memoir, ''Le Freak: An Upside Down Story of Family, Disco and Destiny'' (Spiegel & Grau). We could have started at the former site of Ungano's, next door on West 70th Street, where Mr. Rodgers played guitar in 1970 with a jazz-rock band called New World Rising. He was a teenager then, organizing for the Black Panthers and unofficially attending Stuyvesant High School. (He wasn't enrolled, he explained; he just sat in on classes with teachers he found interesting.) 
Then we might have gone down to the site of Studio 54, which inspired his first No. 1 hit, ''Le Freak,'' in 1978, as the songwriter, guitarist and producer of the funk band Chic, a group that transcended the cliches of the disco era and became influential across styles. You can hear its imprint on hits by Queen, the Clash and Notorious B.I.G., as well as in piles of postpunk bands that sloppily emulated Mr. Rodgers's rhythm guitar style, cleanly chopping in perfect time.
We'd continue past the Power Station recording studio, now Avatar Studios, at West 53rd Street between 9th and 10th Avenues, where he spent many days producing hit records for Sister Sledge (''We Are Family''), David Bowie (''Let's Dance''), Madonna (''Like a Virgin''), Diana Ross (''I'm Coming Out'') and Duran Duran (''The Wild Boys'').
But we stayed put. Mr. Rodgers, 59, is a serious talker; leaving the table would have disrupted the flow. Chic valorized the notion of the breakdown -- the process whereby instruments strip away from the track one by one, leaving pure rhythm, then pile back in -- and like a breakdown in a song he makes his life transparent.
Breakfast became a discourse on a history that has never been well documented: the post-'60s, pre-D.J., nonrock nightclub scene in New York that fed Chic and Mr. Rodgers's entire conception of music. ''We weren't a disco band,'' he said, without rancor. ''We'd always have a ballad, always have an instrumental, just like any other R&B band.''
Anyway, he was soon due back at the same location for his next appointment, lunch with Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records, now a hotelier, philanthropist and rum producer. ''Chris and I used to be really good,'' Mr. Rodgers said, a little regretfully. ''I don't know if I tell it clearly in the book, but the last day I did drugs, I was in Chris Blackwell's hotel, in his suite. I went to Madonna's birthday party, and that was the first time I had cocaine psychosis.'' (Mr. Blackwell was not using cocaine.)
Yes, the freakout is in the book -- the bender leading up to the party in Miami in 1994; the paranoia; the procuring of a samurai sword for self-protection; etc., etc. -- but not the Chris Blackwell part. ''This will be the first time I've laid eyes on him since I was in that room,'' Mr. Rodgers said. ''Wow, that's weird.''
What's weirder is how Mr. Rodgers went from a chaotic and frequently dangerous childhood to making such gorgeously ordered music. Along with showcasing his rhythm guitar, Chic and its spacious sound also featured the virtuosic bass lines of Bernard Edwards, Mr. Rodgers's songwriting partner. Chic was also characterized by lush string arrangements and glamorous lyrics sung by five vocalists, including Luther Vandross.
Yet the first third of ''Le Freak,'' set partly in Los Angeles but mostly in New York, involves severe asthma, a heroin-addicted mother and stepfather nodding off in the living room, a convalescent home with a child-molesting caretaker, and a three-month truancy during second grade spent in movie theaters around Skid Row in Los Angeles. At 8 he spotted his biological father naked and deranged on the roof of a Bleecker Street flophouse in Greenwich Village; at 15 he was sleeping in the New York subways. (At that time his mother was not yet 30.)
''I think that childhood forced me to be a real taskmaster, to be completely organized,'' Mr. Rodgers said. ''My house is the same way.'' He's not lying: you can see it on his blog, at nilerodgers.com, on which, among other things, he has detailed his recent treatment for prostate cancer.
By his late teens Mr. Rodgers studied the guitar with intensity, playing stints in African, Persian, Latin, jazz and boogaloo bands. One story he left out of the book, strangely enough, was his first encounter with the serious dance-music world, in a nightclub called the Hadar, on Staten Island, around 1974. He was astonished by the crowd's dedication to dance, and to dressing up. ''It was like my mom: beautiful, elegant, organized and disorganized,'' he said of the scene.
By 1977, influenced by Mr. Edwards's songwriting economy with melody and rhythm, as well as by largely instrumental, protodisco records like Hamilton Bohannon's ''Foot Stompin' Music'' and El Coco's ''Let's Get It Together,'' Mr. Rodgers, a former hippie, had become attached to another subculture.
''The cat was a free spirit, and that's probably a result of the life he had,'' the singer Fonzi Thornton said of Mr. Rodgers. Mr. Thornton, a mainstay on Chic records and many of Mr. Rodgers's later productions, added, ''When you grow up having to look out for yourself, you go through a lot of scenes, and you meet a lot of different kinds of people.''
At the point in the book in which Mr. Rodgers's income soars, you learn much about piloting speedboats with powerful sound systems, party-induced heart stoppage and sexual practices in the women's bathroom at Studio 54. (And later, recovery, at a rehab center in Connecticut. Mr. Rodgers, who lives with his girlfriend Nancy Hunt in Westport, Conn., and on the Upper West Side, said he has been drug and alcohol free since that Madonna party 17 years ago.)
In and around and between there is much about the science and business of music. Mr. Rodgers is equally interested in harmonic theory, groove and coldblooded hit making. He is a composer-arranger first, and a jazz musician deep down. But he is fascinated by the marketplace and formulas for pop, even if his own golden touch began to fade in the '90s. (Among his recent productions are soundtracks for video games, including Halo.)
In 2004, inspired by what the musical ''Mamma Mia!'' did for Abba's back catalog, Mr. Rodgers imagined a Broadway show featuring his own songs, and those he produced, as the backbone, a kind of index of pop in the second half of the 20th century, moving through various cultural movements, cutting across race and class and sexual identity. It didn't happen, but Mr. Rodgers had already framed the narrative and found the connective threads to his own story, which became the memoir.
In a typical scene from ''Le Freak'' he finds himself in the men's room of a Hell's Kitchen bar, surrounded by transvestite Diana Ross look-alikes; he wonders about the possibilities of a song that capitalizes on Ms. Ross's gay audience. That song would become ''I'm Coming Out.''
Asked whether writing the book forced him to seize on moments that he might otherwise have passed over he looked incredulous. ''Man, 'I'm Coming Out' is one of the best songs I've ever written,'' he said. ''You don't forget how you thought of that.''
He reflected a bit. ''Now here's the only part of the story I don't know for sure,'' he said. ''I thought there were at least five Diana Ross impersonators in the bathroom, which seems like a large number, unless they were having a special theme night there.''

HEADLINE: Tough Immigration Talk Heats Up Debate, and Alienates Some Hispanics

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
Today, Republican candidates are competing over who can talk the toughest about illegal immigration -- who will erect the most impenetrable border defense; who will turn off ''magnets'' like college tuition benefits.
But after such pointed proposals heated up yet another Republican debate, on Tuesday night, some party officials see a yellow light signaling danger in battleground states with large Hispanic populations in November 2012. Will Hispanic voters remember and punish the eventual Republican nominee?
''The discussion of creating electrified fences from sea to sea is neither prudent nor helpful,'' said Ryan Call, chairman of the Republican Party of Colorado, where Hispanics cast 13 percent of votes in 2008 and helped President Obama flip the state to blue. ''They're throwing red meat around in an attempt to mollify a particular aspect of the Republican base.'' 
Besides Colorado, Mr. Obama cemented his victory in part by carrying three other swing states with large Hispanic voting populations: Florida, Nevada and New Mexico.
Republican strategists have hoped to win many of these voters back by appealing to their discontent over the economy and to their social conservatism, issues that helped George W. Bush win a historically high 44 percent of Hispanic voters in 2004.
Now, however, that pitch may be thwarted, according to some Republican strategists.
Both Herman Cain, the former business executive, and Representative Michele Bachmann are proposing a 1,200-mile border fence -- electrified, in Mr. Cain's case, double-walled in Mrs. Bachmann's.
Mitt Romney has attacked Gov. Rick Perry of Texas as soft on illegal immigration. Mr. Perry punched back in the debate on Tuesday in Las Vegas, accusing Mr. Romney of ''hypocrisy'' because, Mr. Perry said, ''you had illegals working on your property.''
Robert Ramirez, a Republican state representative from Colorado who attended the debate, said Hispanic voters in his state ''are sick and tired of empty promises from the Democratic Party.''
Nevertheless, Mr. Ramirez was concerned about the nominees' lack of sensitivity. ''We can't pretend the Latino vote doesn't exist,'' he said. ''It's time we became the party of inclusion.''
Even Mr. Romney, who has been more measured in his remarks, may have lost Hispanic support over his criticism of a Texas law that allows some children of illegal immigrants to attend state colleges on in-state tuition.
''He can make as many trips to Florida and New Mexico and Colorado and other swing states that have a large Latino population, but he can write off the Latino vote,'' said Lionel Sosa, a strategist in Texas who advised Mr. Bush and Senator John McCain on appealing to Hispanics. ''He's not going to gain it again.''
In each of those states, plus Nevada, Hispanics are a growing share of eligible voters, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Although these voters have traditionally favored Democrats, Mr. Obama's 67 percent share of the Hispanic vote in 2008 dipped to 60 percent who voted Democratic during the 2010 Republican wave that swept the midterm elections, said Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew center.
In a Pew survey that year, Hispanic voters ranked education and the economy as their top issues. But there was strong support for state-level ''Dream'' acts allowing children of illegal immigrants to attend colleges on in-state tuition, and 61 percent disapproved of more border fencing.
Many analysts credit the Democratic victories that year of Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado to get-out-the-vote efforts by Latinos.
''Sharron Angle got destroyed in the election because of her anti-immigration stand,'' said Andres Ramirez, a Democratic strategist in Nevada, referring to Mr. Reid's opponent, a Tea Party darling. Mr. Ramirez predicted that Hispanic participation in the 2012 election in Nevada would surpass the 15 percent from 2008, and he said that Republicans missed an opportunity in holding a debate in Las Vegas to showcase more moderate immigration views.
''Their rhetoric on illegal immigration was very over the top,'' he said. ''It will cost them in the future.''
Heidi Smith, the Republican national committeewoman from Nevada, said the focus on illegal immigration was a distraction. ''It's taking time off of the big issue, and that is we don't have any jobs,'' she said.
In Florida, where the Hispanic vote has traditionally leaned Republican because of large numbers of conservative Cuban-Americans, immigration issues may be especially divisive in 2012. The state's favorite son Republican senator, Marco Rubio, seems only too happy to duck immigration issues, and the Republican-controlled State Senate refused to pass a bill this spring with a tough requirement on employers to check workers' immigration status.
Joe Gruters, chairman of the Republican Party of Sarasota County in Florida, said that showing toughness against illegal immigration was an ''electrifying'' issue and could bump a Republican candidate many points in primary polls. He is disappointed by the moderation of candidates' proposals so far. ''Nobody said, 'We have to repeal the 14th Amendment,' '' he said, referring to the constitutional guarantee of citizenship to a child born in the United States. Critics of illegal immigrant mothers who supposedly enter the country to have ''anchor babies'' sometimes propose repealing the Reconstruction-era amendment.
Mr. Gruters was quick to concede that such positions would cost an eventual Republican nominee.
''In case they're the nominee, it could be a deal-breaker where they take themselves out as a serious contender,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley Beats Analysts' Forecasts

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
8:54 p.m. Updated
What a difference a few weeks can make.
In early October, shares of Morgan Stanley dipped below $12 during the day, as the financial firm battled rumors about its exposure to the European sovereign debt crisis.
But the company is slowly shaking off the speculation, addressing some concerns with better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday. The stock - which rose as much as 6 percent on the news before ending essentially flat at $16.64 - is now up more than 40 percent from its low earlier this month. 
''Clearly, we are in a very dynamic environment and our journey is not done,'' the bank's chief executive. James P. Gorman, said in a conference call with analysts. ''But the U.S. financial system in general, and Morgan Stanley in particular, has made far more progress than it is being given credit.''
It is a marked change from a year ago. The company earned $2.15 billion in the third quarter, in contrast to a loss of $91 million a year ago. Despite the sharp drop in the stock market, it notched gains in core divisions like equity sales and wealth management
In its results, Morgan Stanley moved to clarify its exposure to five countries at the center of the European debt crisis. It is less than some have feared, with just $2.11 billion in exposure, including hedges.
But Morgan Stanley, like rivals, also got a major boost from one-time gains. The firm booked $3.4 billion on the falling value of the company's debt. On a per share basis, the one-time gain accounted for 98 percent of the firm's earnings.
Howard Chen, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note to investors that it was a ''weak quarter, but not as bad as anticipated.''
Michael Mayo at Credit Agricole Securities noted the ''main news is that results were not worse than peers given inline declines in capital markets,'' which were down sharply in the quarter.
As with the rest of the industry, Morgan Stanley is trying to find its footing in a postfinancial crisis world, with a stricter regulatory regime and weaker growth prospects. With new rules forthcoming, the firm has exited high-margin businesses like proprietary trading. Instead, it is focusing on less risky groups like Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the firm's global wealth management division, which is a less capital-intensive business with the potential for steady profits.
In the latest quarter, the unit posted net revenue of $3.26 billion this quarter, compared with $3.1 billion in the period a year earlier. Still, the business got hit by the market turmoil, even as the firm logged record inflows. The division had $1.6 trillion assets under management in the quarter, down from $1.7 trillion in the previous quarter.
Third-quarter revenue in institutional securities, bolstered mainly by the one-time gain on the value of Morgan Stanley's debt, increased 123 percent, to $6.45 billion. Asset management reported revenue of $215 million for the period, down 73 percent from the previous year on losses in firm investments.
With the industry facing a more muted reality, Mr. Gorman told analysts that the firm intended to pay ''those employees who are delivering value.'' That is a theme that Wall Street chiefs have struck since last year, implying the best staff members would get competitive compensation while packages for the rest would fall. So far this year, Morgan Stanley has set aside $12.69 billion to cover compensation and benefits, up 6 percent from year-ago levels.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Living Like the Other Half

BYLINE: SARITHA RAI


HIGHLIGHT: An ex-investment banker and an MIT graduate, living on $2 a day. 

 BODY:
Three weeks ago, two city-bred, upper-class aspiring entrepreneurs from Bangalore embarked on a mission: learn more about India, by subsisting for a month on what the average Indian does - just 100 rupees ($2.04) a day.
So far, Tushar Vashisht and Mathew Cherian, both 26, have lost nine pounds and four pounds, respectively, and complained of dizziness and depression from a lack of food. Milk is a treat, traveling more than five kilometers (3.1 miles) a day can blow their budget and saving money is incredibly difficult. They say they miss dental floss, deodorant and toilet paper.
"This has been a humbling experience," said Mr. Vashisht, a former investment banker with Deutsche Bank in San Francisco and Singapore, who says his banker lifestyle now seems "unreal." He said he plans to live on the average Indian's income one day a week for the rest of his life.
Mr. Vashisht and Mr. Cherian, a computer science graduate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have been tracking their "lifestyle experiment" on a Facebook page and a blog that breaks down their spending into pie-charts and graphs, and tracks their grocery shopping and caloric intake.
The two met when they were both working at the Unique Identification Authority of India, a government project that aims to assign a number to each Indian citizen, in part to make sure that subsidies reach the poor. Recently, they both quit their jobs there to start a company together, selling education and health care content to India's more than 600 million mobile phone users. The 100 rupees-a-day project is a way to help them better understand average Indians' choices, they said.
To arrive at the 100 rupees-a-day figure, they took India's average per capita income, which works out to 4,500 rupees a month, and subtracted one-third of their budget for rent.
Normally, they rent an apartment together in the Bangalore suburb of Bellandur, so they decided to move into a 10- by-6-foot room used by their landlord's household help, to replicate what they might be able to afford to rent on their combined budget of 3,000 rupees a month. That left them each 3,000 rupees a month, or 100 a day to spend on everything else, from food to Internet use to utilities. From their old lifestyle, they kept the clothes they were wearing, their laptop computers and a badminton set.
Their insights into the life of the average India, so far:
*A manual laborer in India's lower middle class requires 3,000 calories a day, but invariably receives less. If he wants to add calories, he has to load up on carbohydrates because "protein is ridiculously expensive," they observed.
*Addiction can cost dearly. "You smoke, you drink, you lose," said Mr. Cherian. A beedi (hand-rolled cigarette) or gutka (mix of betel nut and tobacco available in sachets) or alcohol addiction can add 30 to 50 rupees in daily costs and decimate the food budget, they say.
*Mr. Vashisht and Mr. Cherian could not afford to hire household help, which is a staple of every upper-middle-class Indian household. They found that cooking and cleaning, including hand-washing their clothing, could take them each three hours a day.
*Life, including work, home, school and shopping, must be conducted within a five-kilometer radius to be economical, and even then the bicycle is the only really affordable means of transport.
Any kind of economic shock, such as medical expenses, can be devastating. After three weeks, the two managed to save 350 rupees.
For their final week, they plan to subsist on 32 rupees a day, the spending limit India's Planning Commission set in a controversial affidavit filed with the Supreme Court to define the poor. Urban dwellers who spend at least 32 rupees (less than a dollar) a day on food, education and health care would not be counted as poor, the affidavit written by the Tendulkar Committee said, and would therefore be ineligible for government subsidies.
Using that poverty line, 37 percent of India's 1.2 billion are poor, but many say that line is unrealistically low.
For their last week, the two men will be living in the suburbs of Kottayam, a city in Kerala state, after investing their savings in two 140-rupee train tickets. They plan to cook over a wood fire, wash their clothes outdoors and drink well water.
After deducting the Planning Commission's estimated spending on rent, utilities and transport, they will have 17 rupees a day for food, about one-third what they have been spending over the past three weeks.
The "budget that planners have envisioned is not - even by a long shot - enough to have a filling, balanced diet," said Mr. Cherian. "Widespread undernourishment will have serious consequences to the future of India," he predicted.

HEADLINE: Perry Capital Cuts Staff and Closes Hong Kong Office

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI and AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The hedge fund founded by Richard C. Perry has cut about 30 portfolio managers and analysts and three partners, according to people with knowledge of the situation. 

 BODY:
The hedge fund Perry Capital is retrenching, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.
The firm has cut about 30 portfolio managers and analysts and three partners, these people said. It is also shuttering its Hong Kong office, as it redirects its resources to investments in Europe and the United States.
"In an effort to best serve our investors, we have undertaken a strategic evaluation of our business and identified our strengths and weaknesses," the firm said in a letter to investors, an excerpt of which was obtained by DealBook. "There will likely be attractive, less liquid opportunities in both the U.S. and Europe going forward, and our core team is positioned to source and execute these deals."
Perry Capital declined to comment.
The cuts included Alp Ercil, a partner and the head of the firm's Asian operations and George Brokaw and Andy Isikoff, partners who focused on private equity and real estate investments.
The layoffs come at a particularly rocky time for money managers. Market volatility, fueled by Europe's sovereign debt crisis, has recently clobbered returns. A number of prominent hedge funds, including Paulson & Company and Maverick Capital have suffered double-digit losses in various funds this year. Perry Capital is down about 8 percent year-to-date as of the end of September, according to one person. 
The firm, founded in 1988 by a Goldman Sachs alumnus, Richard C. Perry, is a prominent investor in distressed assets. Mr. Perry is also well known in political circles as a big Democratic fund-raiser. 
Still, despite the cuts, Perry Capital tried to strike an optimistic tone on Thursday in its letter to investors. The firm said it saw immense opportunity on the horizon, given the dislocations in the debt markets: "With over $200 trillion of debt globally, balance sheet restructurings will inevitably create a variety of opportunities for the foreseeable future including corporate and sovereign debt, recapitalizations, privatizations, structured credit and direct lending in addition to catalyst oriented equities."

HEADLINE: Questions for The Times's Adam Liptak on the Future of Affirmative Action

BYLINE: JACQUES STEINBERG and ADAM LIPTAK


HIGHLIGHT: The Times's Supreme Court correspondent reflects on the latest chapter in the debate on the constitutionality of affirmative action in college admissions. 

 BODY:
Q.
You write in the article that, in the event the Supreme Court disavows diversity as a rationale for racial preferences in college admissions, the nation's public universities "would almost instantly become whiter and more Asian, and less black and Hispanic." Do you envision a similarly instantaneous shift in the admissions policies of private colleges, even though such a ruling might not directly apply to them? I recall that many private colleges, including those of the Ivy League, interpreted the court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003 as an affirmation of their decades-long efforts to consider race as a factor in whether to admit an applicant.
A.
Should the Supreme Court limit or strike down race-conscious admissions plans at public colleges and universities (meaning those run by the government), there is no particular reason to think that private institutions would decide to follow suit. Consider the example of California, where public universities have not used race in admissions decisions since 1996, when a ballot measure known as Proposition 209 banned the practice. 
In the five years that followed, black enrollment at the law schools of the University of California in Berkeley and in Los Angeles dropped to around 3 percent, according to Erwin Chemerinsky's "The Conservative Assault on the Constitution." In the same period, black enrollment at the law schools of two private institutions, Stanford University and the University of Southern California, was around 10 percent.
A ruling from the Supreme Court interpreting the Constitution to forbid racial preferences in admissions would, of course, have considerably more symbolic weight than a ballot measure, and it is certainly conceivable that some private institutions would take a hard -- but voluntary -- look at whether to continue the practice.
Q.
How might such a ruling -- whether limiting or striking down race-conscious admissions at public universities -- affect the application process of applicants themselves, including whites, Asians, blacks and Hispanics?
A.
From the applicant's perspective, I don't think very much would change. Applicants would continue to try to demonstrate that they would be strong and interesting students, highlighting their achievements and the ways in which they could contribute to a vibrant intellectual community. This might well include highlighting qualities sometimes associated with race and ethnicity. 
As things stand now, under the 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger decision, admissions officers may take account of race and ethnicity as one factor among many in a "holistic review" of applications. A hypothetical decision overturning Grutter might forbid direct consideration of those factors but continue to allow consideration of, say, economic hardship or knowledge of a second language.
Q.
What about the admissions officers at public colleges and universities? For several generations now, many have spoken in their closed-door deliberations about what a black or Latino applicant might "add" to the campus -- in the same way they might speak of a quarterback or poet -- even in instances where that student's standardized test scores or grade point average fell below the median of the class as a whole. If the Supreme Court acts as you predict, will such conversations -- and the very rules of engagement of how one decides who gets in -- have to change?
A.
That's hard to say. Some of the admissions personnel I've spoken to in states that bar race-conscious decisions say they still try to create a racially and ethnically diverse student body but that explicit discussion of that goal has been "driven underground." Others say they have become especially alert to factors that may serve as proxies for race and ethnicity. Still others say they have no choice but to narrow the admissions criteria and exclude all consideration of race and ethnicity.
I suspect that practices vary depending on the size of the institution. Very large ones cannot help but employ fairly mechanical cutoffs, no matter how much they claim to conduct a "holistic review" of each application. Smaller ones can build their classes by hand and work toward diversity that incidentally but effectively produces a students body of mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds.

HEADLINE: Report Supports the Practical Value of STEM Diplomas

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: A new report suggests that majoring in science, technology, engineering or math might pay off after graduation. 

 BODY:
Over at The Times's Economix blog, Motoko Rich reports today on a new study from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce that indicates that college students might do well to study science, technology, engineering or math.
As Ms. Rich writes:
The report shows that professions that depend heavily on skills learned in these fields are the second-fastest growing occupational group in the United States, after health care.
According to the study, people with talent in science, technology, engineering or math don't often major in such disciplines during college in the first place. And even if they start out doing so, many switch majors.

Compared with other fields outside of these disciplines, STEM workers can earn higher wages. On average, 65 percent of those who hold a bachelor's degree in such fields will earn more than those who hold a master's degree in other subjects. Among those with associate's degrees in the science and technical fields, 63 percent earn more than those who hold bachelor's degrees in other subjects.
But lest proponents of STEM degrees over liberal arts (like Gov. Rick Scott of Florida) take this news as another reason to steer clear of majoring in philosophy, Ms. Rich notes that:
In surveys of employers, one of the biggest complaints about technical workers is that they 'can't talk and can't write a memo and have horrible interpersonal skills.' So maybe the best course of study is a double major. Physics and poetry, anyone?

HEADLINE: The Rising Value of a Science Degree

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: Demand for science, technology, engineering and math skills is spreading far beyond fields like computing and lab research, a study finds. 

 BODY:
If you're trying to figure out what to study in college, a new report suggests you would do well choosing a major in science, technology, engineering or math.
 The report, based on Census and National Science Foundation data analyzed by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, shows that professions that depend heavily on skills learned in these fields are the second-fastest growing occupational group in the United States, after health care. 
 While traditional fields like computer engineering and laboratory research make up about 5 percent of the work force, demand for science, technology, engineering and math skills is spreading far beyond, to occupations in manufacturing, utilities, transportation and mining, as well as to sales and management. As a result, the study, by Anthony P. Carnevale, Nicole Smith and Michelle Melton, argues that there is a shortage of so-called STEM workers. 
 The scientific and technological disciplines have "become the common currency in the labor market," Mr. Carnevale said. With more companies concentrating on technology, "if you're going to sell in a technical world you've got to be credible," even to be in sales, he said. "You can't sell to an engineer unless an engineer thinks you're also an engineer."

 With a shortage of people trained in such fields, many technology and scientific companies in the United States are forced to recruit from abroad, the study's authors say.
 According to the study, people with talent in science, technology, engineering or math don't often major in such disciplines during college in the first place. And even if they start out doing so, many switch majors. Of those graduating with such degrees, only 10 percent go into related fields such as engineering, physical science or architecture. 
Compared with many other fields outside of these disciplines, STEM workers can earn higher wages. On average, 65 percent of those who hold a bachelor's degree in such fields will earn more than those who hold master's degrees in other subjects. Among those with associate's degrees in the science and technical fields, 63 percent earn more than those who hold bachelor's degrees in other subjects. 
But there are bigger lures. While engineers, technicians and lab researchers may start out earning more than their peers in other fields, they can top out by the middle of their careers. So by age 35, a STEM worker with a graduate degree will make about $50,000 less a year than a doctor or other health care professional with a graduate degree, leading many of those with engineering, science or math degrees to choose medicine as a career. Not surprisingly, managers also make more than technicians, so talented engineers often move into the C-suite to increase their salaries.
"What's striking to me is that I'm used to thinking of liberal arts as the foundational degree that gives you lots of options in a career," Mr. Carnevale said. Increasingly, he said, science, technology, engineering and math are crucial to a wide-ranging career. "You get a bigger bump going in, and almost at every stage you have other options," he said. 
 But don't count philosophy or literature out, either. Mr. Carnevale said that in surveys of employers, one of the biggest complaints about technical workers is that they "can't talk and can't write a memo and have horrible interpersonal skills." So maybe the best course of study is a double major. Physics and poetry, anyone?

HEADLINE: Americans for Greater Inequality

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: In the last few years, Americans have become less inclined to support overnment policies that try to reduce income inequality. 

 BODY:
As Rich Oppel and I wrote in an article today, the Republican presidential candidates have been steadily promoting flatter - and therefore more regressive - tax overhaul plans. Flatter taxes have of course always been the holy grail for many in the conservative base, but now such proposals seem to be gathering broader support, too.
In a recent article for Scientific American, Ilyana Kuziemko and Michael I. Norton write:
Support for redistribution, surprisingly enough, has plummeted during the recession. For years, the General Social Survey has asked individuals whether "government should reduce income differences between the rich and the poor." Agreement with this statement dropped dramatically between 2008 and 2010, the two most recent years of data available. Other surveys have shown similar results.
The article notes that declines in support for redistributive government policies have been larger among minorities, and that "Americans who self-identify as having below average income show the same decrease in support for redistribution as wealthier Americans."
These findings are a bit unexpected, given the spreading Occupy Wall Street movement and frequent complaints about rising inequality.
Ms. Kuziemko, a professor at Princeton, and Mr. Norton, a professor at Harvard, argue that greater opposition to redistributive policies may actually be a predictable reaction to having slipped in the distribution oneself:
People exhibit a fundamental loathing for being near or in last place - what we call "last place aversion." This fear can lead people near the bottom of the income distribution to oppose redistribution because it might allow people at the very bottom to catch up with them or even leapfrog past them.
This statement is based on a studyof theirs based on survey data. The surveys found that people making just above the minimum wage are the most likely to oppose an increase in it.

HEADLINE: Millions Will Be Trapped Amid Climate Change, Study Warns

BYLINE: HILLARY ROSNER


HIGHLIGHT: Environmental change is just as likely to trap people as it is to make them migrate - or it can cause them to flee to even more vulnerable areas, a British government study warns. 

 BODY:
Millions of people are expected to become trapped in places that are extremely vulnerable to environmental change in the course of this century, according to a British government study released on Thursday. 
Prepared by the Foresight group, a think tank that advises the government on planning for the future, the report explores the complex relationship between human migration and changing environmental conditions and argues that the issue must become a top policy priority on national and international agendas.
The study, titled "Migration and Global Environmental Change," warns that trying to block migration will result in increased poverty and ultimately, potentially unmanageable waves of movement. 
It therefore recommends planning for and financially aiding some migration, both within and between countries. 
"Reduced options for migration, combined with incomes threatened by environmental change, mean that people are likely to migrate in illegal, irregular, unsafe, exploited or unplanned ways," it warns.
The Foresight study cautions that it is often impossible to distinguish "environmental migrants" from people who move for any number of other related factors.
One of the report's messages is that environmental change is just as likely to trap people as it is to make them flee - or that it can cause them to flee to even more vulnerable areas. Imagine a Nigerian farmer who can no longer grow enough food because of persistent drought, and who then moves to Lagos, a sprawling, overcrowded city built on a floodplain. 
By 2060, as many as 552 million people across Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean could be affected by flooding related to climate change, and immigrant populations may be more likely to live in the most dangerous areas, the group's research indicates. 
"Human survival may depend on unplanned and problematic displacement," the report says.
The study also cautions that urban planning must begin to focus on the vulnerability of migrants. Across the planet, 150 million people live in cities with "significant" water shortages; by 2015, Africa's urban poor will number 400 million.
The Foresight study involved the work of about 350 people who generated more than 70 research papers over two years that inform the final report. 
Geoffrey Dabelko, who heads the Environmental Change and Security Program at the Woodrow Wilson Center and was not directly involved with the research, said the report demonstrated that previous estimates of migration are nothing more than "very fuzzy aggregate global figures that have weak to no methodology behind them." 
He said the study departed from what he called "old methodologies" like seeking "to overlay sea-level-rise maps with population distribution maps and say everybody who's flooded moves." 
"As we saw in New Orleans, not everybody moves," Dr. Dabelko said. "It was people who are fairly empowered who moved."
The World Bank plans to discuss migration and related risk at a summit meeting in London in December.

HEADLINE: Public Radio Host Linked to Protest is Dismissed

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: A public radio host who was linked this week to antiwar and anti-corporate-greed protests in Washington has been fired by one of her radio producers. 

 BODY:
A public radio host who was linked this week to antiwar and anti-corporate-greed protests in Washington, D.C., has been fired by one radio producer that employs her, but supported by another.
Lisa Simeone, who has been the host of two programs heard on some NPR stations, is reported to have been a leader in an occupation of Freedom Plaza in Washington. Her role was reported Wednesday by the Web site The Daily Caller, which suggested that her involvement might have violated NPR's code of ethics.
Ms. Simeone was the host of "Soundprint," a documentary program that is independently produced in Maryland but is broadcast on some NPR stations. "Soundprint" said Thursday that it had dismissed her.
She also is the host of "World of Opera," a program that is produced by WDAV, a member station of NPR in North Carolina. WDAV said Thursday that she remained employed by the station.

The Daily Caller, which was founded by Tucker Carlson and features conservative columnists, reported that Ms. Simeone "appears to be breaking the taxpayer-subsidized network's ethics rules by acting as a spokeswoman for Occupy D.C. group 'October 2011.' "
Ms. Simeone said in an interview with Salon that the situation had been "overblown."
"Everyone's overreacting," she said. "It's like McCarthyism."
NPR's ethics code specifies that "NPR journalists may not participate in marches and rallies involving causes or issues that NPR covers, nor should they sign petitions or otherwise lend their name to such causes, or contribute money to them."
It is not clear whether "Soundprint," as an independent program, shares that ethics code. But the program said in a statement that it was a "journalistic program" and that Ms. Simeone's "leadership role in the recent October 2011 protest activities, associated with the Occupy D.C. movement, conflicts with her role as the host of a documentary series."
The program added in the statement, "'Soundprint' adheres to the highest standards of journalism. Lisa has been a dynamic and engaging host for 'Soundprint,' and we wish her well for the future."
WDAV and "World of Opera," at least initially, had a different point of view toward the situation. Scott Nolan, the general manager of the station, noted that Ms. Simeone was an independent contractor, not a full-time employee. "Ms. Simeone's activities outside of this job are not in violation of any of WDAV's employee codes and have had no effect on her job performance," Mr. Nolan said in an e-mail message on Thursday, affirming that she remained employed by the station.
Mr. Nolan added: "WDAV and NPR have different missions. WDAV respects NPR's mission to serve as a leading news provider. WDAV, on the other hand, exists to serve as a leading provider of arts and cultural programming nationally and internationally. Based on the differing missions of these two organizations, we are working together to find a solution to the issues surrounding 'World of Opera.'"
NPR, for its part, tried to emphasize that it was not responsible for Ms. Simeone's employment or unemployment.
"We fully respect that the management of WDAV is solely responsible for the decision making around Lisa's participation in Occupy D.C. and her freelance role with WDAV's program," an NPR spokeswoman, Anna Christopher, said Thursday.
As for Ms. Simeone's dismissal from "Soundprint," she said, "We learned about it after the fact, through media reports."

HEADLINE: 2 Taxi Medallions Sell for $1 Million Each

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Two New York City taxi medallions changed hands in the highest recorded sale since the city's modern livery system began. 

 BODY:
The million-dollar taxicab is here.
Two New York City taxi medallions - aluminum plates that grant the right to operate a yellow cab - changed hands on Wednesday for $1 million apiece, the highest recorded sale since the city's modern livery system began.
The sale was the culmination of decades of astonishing growth for the humble medallion, which is literally nailed to the hood of every yellow cab in the city. When New York issued its first batch of medallions in 1937, the going price was $10 even, or $157.50 in today's dollars.
Some perspective: The Dow Jones industrial average has risen 1,100 percent in the last 30 years. In the same period, the value of a taxi medallion is up 1,900 percent. That return beats gold, oil and the American house. 
Sky-high prices and million-dollar deals seem a far cry from the medallion's early days; when World War II came around and demand for taxis dropped, many drivers simply returned their medallions to the city to avoid the annual $10 renewal fee.
"It's a lot of money, and it is an investment that someone would not make without being confident in the industry and the future of the city," said David S. Yassky, chairman of the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission.
The man who brokered Wednesday's sale, a taxi financing specialist named Nat Goldbetter, grew up on the Lower East Side and got into the taxi business in the 1960s as a driver. He bought his own medallion in 1969 for $25,000, but sold it a few years later. "I could have made a zillion dollars, but I did O.K.," he said.
The million-dollar sale was hatched earlier this year, when Mr. Goldbetter received a visit from an old acquaintance looking to sell two medallions purchased for $80,000 apiece in the 1980s. There was an offer that valued each medallion at $975,000, but the seller was hoping for more.
With many owners reluctant to sell these days, hoping for the value to keep going up, Mr. Goldbetter figured he could find a willing buyer. The papers were signed on Wednesday morning.
"Nobody ever thought the medallion would get to this point," Mr. Goldbetter said on Wednesday from his office in Long Island City, Queens, a few hours after the papers were signed. "It was pretty cool. It broke up the boredom of my work."
Mr. Goldbetter, a youthful looking 67, was no stranger to the historic: In 1985, he handled the sale of the first $100,000 medallion, a feat that earned a front-page article in The New York Times.
"It's kind of history repeating itself, only multiplied by 10," Mr. Goldbetter said.
There are 13,237 medallions in the city; new ones, when issued, are sold at auction. Large fleets, which can control hundreds of medallions, often find it easy to secure financing to meet the high prices. Medallion sales can make for big business: the biggest lender, Medallion Financial, is a publicly traded company (ticker symbol: TAXI) and shares its skyscraper on Madison Avenue with the Rockefeller Family Fund.
Corporate medallions, like the two sold on Wednesday, do not need to be driven by their owners and can be leased out 24 hours a day. Individual medallions, which make up about 40 percent of the fleet and must be occasionally driven by the owner, are worth slightly less: the latest sale was for about $700,000.
The secondary market in medallions and its private transfers began after World War II, at the starting price of $2,500. The value quickly grew, crossing the $50,000 mark in the mid-1970s. But the steepest period of growth has been over the past decade, when the value of corporate medallions nearly quadrupled.
So are we entering the tulip era of the taxicab? Could a million-dollar sale signal the beginning of the end of the great yellow cab bubble?
"No one is very good at forecasting the economic future right now, but I would say no," said Graham Hodges, a professor at Colgate who has written a history of the taxi industry. He said the investment in a medallion is comparable to purchasing an apartment in Manhattan.
"It will always make good money and pay for itself," Mr. Hodges said. "There are certain things that are just gilt-edged assets, and this is one of them."
As for the first $100,000 medallion, it was sold to a young immigrant from Hong Kong named Stanley Cheung. In 1985, he told The Times that he heard medallion values were on the rise, and if the price kept going up, he might sell. "There are things better than driving a cab," he said.
Mr. Cheung did indeed sell his medallion: in 1987, for $125,000. After paying the expenses for his cab, Mr. Cheung came out about even, according to his wife, Shirley Cheung, who was reached on Wednesday at the couple's house in Little Neck, Queens.
"One million? Oh my God!" Ms. Cheung said, when informed about the recent sale. "I don't want to hear about it. I have to sleep tonight."
Ms. Cheung laughed, and said that she was well aware that medallion values had skyrocketed in recent years. Her husband, she said, looks at the prices every once in awhile, but she tells him not to share. "It's O.K.," she said of the high value. "I just don't want to hear about it."

HEADLINE: Romney, Bachmann and the Oys of Yiddish

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: What are we to make of recent use of "chutzpah" by a couple of politicians who don't have a Jewish bone in their bodies? Also, what City Room is reading in other newspapers and blogs. 

 BODY:
 Here in New York, which probably has more Yiddish speakers than any other city in the world, including in Israel, what are we to make of recent uses of a certain Yiddish word by a couple of politicians who don't have a Jewish bone in their bodies? We're referring to the Mormon Mitt Romney and the evangelical Christian Michele Bachmann. 
 The word is chutzpah, and it has several possible connotations. Mr. Romney used a more positive one in the Republican presidential debate Tuesday night while thumbing his nose at the 9-9-9 tax plan proposed by the party's darling of the month, Herman Cain.
 "I like your chutzpah on this, Herman," Mr. Romney said, suggesting that Mr. Cain had shown audacity, even gutsiness. That was just before he went on to call 9-9-9 a lot of hooey.
 Actually, what Mr. Romney said was "hoot-spa," with "hoot" correctly rhyming with "foot," but with a hard H incorrectly used at the start. He couldn't quite manage the throat-clearing sound that is the proper way to say it. But let's give him a pass on this, as he is to the manor born and not to the manner born. 
 Mr. Romney's usage was quite different from Ms. Bachmann's. During the summer, she summoned the word to accuse President Obama of displaying gall with his budget ideas. "The president doesn't want to be confronted with priorities in spending because he has a lot of chutzpah," Ms. Bachmann said in a Fox News interview.
 The problem is that she pronounced it "choot-spa," with a "ch" as in "chump." She invited ridicule with that blooper, learning more than she ever wanted to know about the oys of Yiddish.
 The interest here, though, is in this casual dropping of the word on the national stage. That New York politicians resort to an occasional Yiddishism, whether or not they're Jewish, is an old story. But neither Fox News nor the lineup of Republican presidential candidates exactly brings to mind "Fiddler on the Roof." So is this evidence that the language, at least a smidgen of it, has been absorbed by the broader American society?
 "There's no question about that," said Samuel Norich, publisher of The Forward, a venerable Yiddish newspaper in New York that is now published as a weekly in English and in Yiddish. 
 Chutzpah "is now part of the common parlance of American English, along with a few other Yiddishisms," Mr. Norich said.
"Anybody who presumes to be 'with it,' much less urbane," he said, "is expected to know what chutzpah is and to use it."
 Unfortunately, those few other Yiddishisms can become land mines. The fact that the language has produced an impressive body of literature tends to be overlooked today. Instead, the few words known by most people, including many Jews, lean perilously toward the vulgar, usually with the speakers being clueless as to the true meaning.
 One of the best-known Yiddish words, heard daily in this city and routinely invoked to describe someone as a dope, is a crudity for penis. We won't use it here. Let's just note that you wouldn't say it if your bubbe were around. "Dreck" is often used to mean "junk"; it is, in fact, a vulgarism for excrement. "Tochis" is cavalierly tossed about for "rear end." Its meaning, too, is coarser.
 Politicians need to be more careful than most. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato learned that the hard way in his 1998 re-election campaign. He became former Senator D'Amato after showboating before a Jewish audience - sneering at his opponent, Charles E. Schumer, with yet another penis-derived Yiddish crudity that has come to mean jerk. For sure, there were other reasons that Mr. D'Amato lost. But coming across as a you-know-what himself didn't help.
 So Mr. Romney and Ms. Bachmann, take note. You have entered unfamiliar, and potentially risky, territory. Whether it's hoot-spa or choot-spa, you may want your Yiddish to start and end there. Genug shoyn. Enough already.

HEADLINE: Deloitte's Quandary: Defy the S.E.C. or China

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: The S.E.C. is stepping up the pressure on Deloitte's Shanghai affiliate, which is resisting turning over records about accounting fraud at a Chinese company. 

 BODY:
The global accounting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu is facing unwanted scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission that has put its Chinese affiliate in the uncomfortable position of trying to avoid violating China's laws on disclosing information by resisting a subpoena for its records. 
The S.E.C. is seeking a court order to enforce its subpoena against the Shanghai-based affiliate and compel it to turn over documents about a client audit. This month, it has sought to ratchet up the pressure on Deloitte. 
Meanwhile, Deloitte's accounting regulator in the United States has just unsealed a portion of an annual review that is critical of the firm's quality control over its foreign affiliates.
Deloitte has been caught up in a much larger issue regarding the role of Chinese accounting firms that review the financial statements of Chinese companies whose shares are traded in the United States, and whether those firms can be subjected to scrutiny by American regulators.
The S.E.C. began investigating Longtop Financial Technologies of China for accounting fraud earlier this year after Deloitte's Chinese affiliate resigned as its auditor because of significant problems in verifying its financial statement. Deloitte had served as Longtop's auditor since it went public in the United States in 2007 through a so-called "reverse merger," in which it took over a shell company and then listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Longtop sold more than $300 million in shares in the United States, and at its peak in November 2010 had a market value of $2.4 billion before its stock price collapsed with the disclosure of Deloitte's resignation.
Deloitte gave Longtop's financial statements a clean bill of health through 2010 and only withdrew its audit opinions in May when it resigned. In its letter to the company, Deloitte said it found "very serious defects" that included significant differences in deposit balances at banks from what the company reported and loans to it that had not been previously disclosed.
The first step in any corporate financial fraud investigation is to obtain the work papers of the auditors, so the S.E.C. issued a broad subpoena to Deloitte's Chinese affiliate for those records within days of its resignation. The misconduct disclosed in the resignation letter raises questions not only about Longtop's management but also how the outside auditors did not learn about it for so long. The S.E.C. is likely to look into whether anyone at Deloitte's Chinese affiliate participated with management in the accounting problems that were eventually uncovered, and whether the firm was as thorough as it should have been in verifying the financial statements in prior years.
The firm has resisted complying with the subpoena because it asserted that turning over its work papers could violate Chinese law prohibiting the disclosure of "state secrets," which it says includes information about the "national economy and social development." Anyone convicted of a violation could be sentenced to a long prison term.
In September, the S.E.C. filed a subpoena enforcement action in Federal District Court in Washington to force Deloitte's Chinese affiliate to turn over the documents from its Longtop audits. In a filing in the case earlier this month, the S.E.C. argued that it should be permitted to serve the subpoena on Deloitte's American lawyers along with an order requiring the firm to respond to its demand for documents without having to use a more cumbersome treaty procedure that requires working through the Chinese government, which would add months to the process.
If the court orders the accounting firm to turn over the records and it refuses, then it can be held in contempt under 15 U.S.C.  78u(c),which could result in a criminal misdemeanor conviction punishable by a fine.
The firm could also face suspension or revocation of its registration as an auditing firm in the United States by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board if its refusal to turn over records violates the agency's rules. A contempt finding by a federal court would not go over well with the regulator. Any disciplinary action could have a negative impact on other Chinese companies whose shares are traded in the United States and use Deloitte's Chinese affiliate because they might have to switch auditors.
Earlier this week, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board disclosed part of its 2007 annual review of Deloitte's United States operation that highlighted deficiencies in its quality control. One issue raised in the report is the quality of the work of its foreign affiliates because it "has no formal system in place to monitor the services its foreign affiliates actually perform."
When investors see a name like Deloitte as a company's auditor, there is a level of comfort that the firm will apply the highest standards to its review of the financial statements. But the name may imply more than is actually there if a foreign company, or the overseas operations of a multinational corporation, is audited by an affiliate that may not adhere to American accounting standards. At the least in such cases, questions can be raised about whether a foreign affiliate's work is of the same quality as that performed by Deloitte in the United States.
The issue of whether Chinese accounting firms meet the standards set in the United States is a growing concern. The S.E.C. has stopped the trading of a number of Chinese companies that issued shares in the United States by engaging in reverse mergers because of questions about the veracity of their financial statements. This move raises implications about the quality of the work performed by their outside auditors.
The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has been working with its Chinese counterparts to come up with standards for inspecting auditing firms in China, but a planned meeting between the regulators in September was canceled. The S.E.C.'s action against Deloitte's Chinese affiliate will not make it any easier to come to an agreement that would allow the United States to monitor the work of Chinese accounting firms.
Deloitte's Chinese affiliate finds itself between the proverbial rock and a hard place because the S.E.C. is unlikely to back away from a case in which American investors suffered losses based on what appears to be a rather brazen accounting fraud. And the Chinese government is unlikely to accede to allowing the auditors to respond to a subpoena that would create a precedent for other firms being compelled to disclose their work papers.
What began as a fairly routine accounting fraud investigation threatens to become a much more contentious issue between the United States and China, and Deloitte may suffer the fallout.

 BODY:
Groupon May Value Itself in I.P.O. at Close to $12 Billion | Groupon, the daily deal site, is seeking to sell shares in an offering that would value the company at close to $12 billion, several people with knowledge of the situation said on Wednesday.
Such a valuation, which is being weighed as the company prepares for an investor road show next week to pitch its initial public offering, would be a steep comedown from earlier expectations that an I.P.O. of the Internet darling could value the company as much as $25 billion to $30 billion.
But shaky stock markets in recent months have prompted the company's bankers to revise their calculations, as the broader market for offerings entered a deep freeze. Enthusiasm for Groupon has also been tempered amid sharp questions over its business model and accounting.

HEADLINE: The Late Mover Advantage in Citigroup's Settlement

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: The fraud cases against Goldman Sachs and Citigroup may have been identical, but Citigroup paid a smaller settlement and doesn't face the same highly charged outrage. 

 BODY:
Oldest children often complain that their parents treated them worse than their younger siblings. Goldman Sachs may feel the same way after Citigroup agreed to a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The two cases are almost identical, but Citigroup doesn't face the same highly charged outrage.
The allegations related to a synthetic collateralized debt obligation sold in 2007 to 15 investors. Citigroup, the charges claim, took a short position on the subprime mortgage-backed securities underlying the C.D.O., while influencing the selection of the assets. 
The settlement -- in which the financial firm agreed to pay $285 million without admitting or denying guilt -- appears to be of little concern to Citigroup investors. They're likely to be happy that the bank has put the issue to rest. 
By comparison, Goldman's settlement last year triggered banner headlines and a sharp drop in its stock. While Citigroup's deal made the front page of The New York Times, the stock ended the day down only modestly and was up slightly in premarket trading on Wednesday.
The difference doesn't have as much to do with the facts of the case as much as it does with the timing and other crucial distinctions.
According to the complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the marketing materials created to sell the C.D.O. to investors "suggested that Citigroup was acting in the traditional role of an arranging bank, when in fact Citigroup had exercised significant influence over the selection of the assets and had retained a $500 million proprietary short position of the assets it had helped select, which gave Citigroup undisclosed economic interests adverse to those of the investors." The C.D.O. lost almost all of its value within months of being sold. 
Like in the Goldman case, investors who bought the Citigroup C.D.O. were sophisticated, and the bank disclosed there was a possibility that it would be taking a short position. To show how poor an investment Citigroup peddled, the S.E.C. quoted from an e-mail sent by a C.D.O. trader that it was "dog" excrement and another by a collateral manager that "the portfolio is horrible." Just because others think it is a bad deal does not prove fraud, but it does help show that this was not the type of investment that should have been sold.
The complaint against Citigroup alleges conduct that could be considered more pernicious than the charges against Goldman. Citigroup reaped $160 million in profit from its short position. In contrast, Goldman set up the C.D.O. that helped one of its investors, John Paulson, profit from shorting the mortgage-backed securities, but the firm did not realize any gains itself.
Goldman and Citigroup settled claims that they violated two subsections of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, which only require proof of negligence. But in its initial complaint against Goldman, the S.E.C. alleged that it also violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, much more serious fraud charges. As part of its settlement, Goldman had to acknowledge that its marketing materials were incomplete, but no such admission was required from Citigroup.
Perhaps most importantly, Citigroup was able to negotiate a settlement before the S.E.C. filed its charges, something that was not offered to Goldman. By settling the case, Citigroup turned it into a one-day news event, while Goldman endured weeks of negative publicity from the S.E.C. case before it finally settled three months later.
Citigroup even received a lighter penalty than Goldman, paying disgorgement, interest and a civil penalty totaling $285 million, compared with the $550 million penalty Goldman had to pay, which the S.E.C. said was the largest in its history. The C.D.O.'s each firm sold were worth about $1 billion, so Citigroup seems to have benefited from coming later in the queue. 
Citigroup is the third major Wall Street bank to reach a settlement related to selling a C.D.O. tied to mortgage-backed securities, joining Goldman and JPMorgan Chase, which paid more than $153 million in June to settle an S.E.C. complaint. With the cases resolved, the banks have taken another step toward putting the collapse in the mortgage market behind them. And it shows how much better it is to not be the first firm sued by the S.E.C., because the settlement looks much less painful for Citigroup.

HEADLINE: How Much Do You Owe? Guess Again

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Households underreport the magnitude of their credit card debts by at least one-third, according to a New York Fed study. 

 BODY:
It would appear that Americans don't even know how much they owe.
Households underreport the magnitude of their credit card debts by at least one-third, according to a new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The difference for the average household is more than $2,000.
Only 50 percent of households reported any credit card debt, while credit card companies reported that 76 percent of households owed them money.
The paper has the discomfiting consequence of raising questions about the accuracy of the Fed's Survey of Consumer Finances, widely treated as an authoritative source. The authors compared the debt levels reported by participants in that survey with data that lenders reported to the Equifax credit bureau. They found that consumers gave accurate testimony about most kinds of debt, including mortgages and student loans, but not when asked about credit card debt.
In fact, borrowers reported owing only about 50 cents for each dollar claimed by credit card lenders.

There are plausible explanations for part of the difference. In particular, people who pay the full balance on their cards each month - lenders call such customers "convenience users" or, more colorfully, "deadbeats," because they do not pay interest and therefore are less profitable -- may not regard that balance as "true" debt, and therefore choose not to report it. The industry, however, simply reports the total volume of outstanding loans. (Lenders, after all, have no way to know which loans will be repaid at the end of the month and which loans will stay on the books.)
The authors overcorrect for this possibility by subtracting all transactions made in the last year, as if everyone paid their bills each month. They also make some other adjustments, including subtracting an estimate of the debt that consumers put on their credit cards for business purposes, on the theory that some people may also place this debt in a separate category.
Even with those changes, however, the average household reports credit card debts of $4,700, while lenders report an average balance per household of $7,134.
Why do people underreport the magnitude of their debts?
Embarrassment is an obvious candidate, but there are a couple of problems with that explanation. First, people accurately report other categories of debt, like mortgages and student loans. Of course, those are the kinds of debts people are encouraged to carry. But people also accurately report personal bankruptcies, which would seem more embarrassing. Still, it is possible that embarrassment plays a role; the authors note evidence that people tell small lies more readily than large ones, perhaps explaining why people are less willing to lie about filing for bankruptcy.
Another partial explanation: Individuals report their credit card debts more accurately than households, suggesting that people may be ignorant of debts run up by their partners. This difference, however, does not come close to explaining the magnitude of the discrepancy.
And that leaves ignorance: The possibility that Americans simply don't know how much they owe.
"Uninformedness," the paper notes (bringing a new word into existence), "could result from willful ignorance, as large credit card balances are not welcome information, from difficulty understanding the growth of credit card balances," or from other barriers to knowledge.
Interestingly, there is some evidence that underreporting has declined in recent years, perhaps as a consequence of a crisis that has forced households to pay more attention to their debts.

HEADLINE: City's Unemployment Rate Stays at 8.7%

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Over the past year, the city has added just 40,100 jobs in the private sector, for a slower rate of growth than the rest of the state and the nation since September 2010. 

 BODY:
Even with the return of more than 8,000 Verizon workers who had been striking, New York City did not add enough jobs last month to lower the unemployment rate, which remained at 8.7 percent, the State Department of Labor reported on Thursday.
Hiring in the city, which leveled off this summer after rising at an encouraging pace earlier in the year, was "quite weak" in September, said James P. Brown, principal economist at the Department of Labor. Over the past year, the city has added just 40,100 jobs in the private sector, for a slower rate of growth than the rest of the state and the nation since September 2010.
The picture was even bleaker with the lens widened to include the public sector. The number of government jobs in the city dropped by 21,000 in September, the figures showed. 
The slowdown of the last few months has erased the advantage the city appeared to have had over the rest of the country in recovering from the recession. The high-paying industries that had bounced back fast have cooled off: professional and business services shed more than twice as many jobs as usual at the end of the summer, Mr. Brown said.
Still, those industries -- which include accounting, consulting and legal services -- employ 3 percent more people than they did a year ago.
Wall Street, in contrast, added fewer jobs than usual at the start of the summer and eliminated fewer than usual in September, Mr. Brown said. The tourism-driven sector known as leisure and hospitality also was "noticeably weak" last month, he said. The information industry registered a large one-time gain because 8,100 unionized Verizon employees returned to work in late August after a two-week strike.
All told, the city has made almost no progress since June in climbing out of the crater created by the financial crisis. There are still more than 340,000 unemployed residents in the city, compared with about 3.6 million people who have jobs.
Statewide, there were about 765,000 residents without jobs, though only about half of them were collecting unemployment benefits, the Labor Department reported. The state's unemployment rate also was unchanged from August, holding at 8 percent, still well below the national unemployment rate of 9.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Democrat Is Attacked for Supporting Protesters

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans released a video trying to use Representative Steve Israel's support of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement against him. 

 BODY:
It's the time of year for candy corn and horror flicks, so mistaking a new web advertisement attacking Representative Steve Israel for a film trailer about socialist zombies would be understandable.
The National Republican Congressional Committee put out the video criticizing Mr. Israel, a New York Democrat and chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for supporting the "Occupy Wall Street" movement.
Called "Steve Israel Stands With Them," the video flashes an image of Mr. Israel with a quote from the New York Post: "Steve Israel of New York is urging party members to 'stand with' the demonstrators." The Oct. 13 column referred to a petitionrecently circulated by the Democratic committee, the fund-raising arm of House Democrats, seeking 100,000 signatures in a show of solidarity with the protesters.
A button under the video offers viewers the opportunity to "Stand Against Them" by making a donation to the House Republicans' campaign efforts.
Piecing together footage of the protests, the one-minute video portrays the protesters as violent, lawless and -- in a personal shot against Mr. Israel, who is Jewish -- anti-Semitic.
Firing back against the ad, Mr. Israel told supporters in an e-mail Thursday that Republicans were using these attacks to distract from the discussion about job creation and the economy.
"The personal attacks they've launched on me for standing with you are nothing in comparison to the hardships faced by middle-income families across America every day," he said.
But the Republicans refused to budge, sending their own e-mail on Thursday with the subject line, "sorry, we're not sorry."
"Someone at the D.C.C.C. is very upset that we would have the audacity to highlight their support for the Occupy Wall Street movement and the extreme anti-Semitic and incendiary rhetoric coming from protesters," Paul Lindsay, the communications director for the Republican campaign committee, said. "I wonder why."

HEADLINE: Huntsman's Warning on 'Too Big to Fail'

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Jon Huntsman has effectively warned against the perils of "too big to fail," and in terms his Republican colleagues must respond to, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The idea that big banks damage the broader economy has considerable resonance on the intellectual right. Thomas Hoenig, the recently retired president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, has been our clearest official voice on this topic. And Eugene Fama, father of the efficient markets view of finance, said on CNBC last year that having banks that are "too big to fail" is "perverting activities and incentives" in financial markets - giving big financial firms "a license to increase risk; where the taxpayers will bear the downside and firms will bear the upside."
The mainstream political right, however, has been reluctant to take on the issue. This changed on Wednesday, with a very clear statement by Jon Huntsman in The Wall Street Journal on regulatory capture and its consequences. Before the 2008 financial crisis, he wrote, "the largest banks were pushing hard to take more risk at taxpayers' expense." And now, he added:
More than three years after the crisis and the accompanying bailouts, the six largest American financial institutions are significantly bigger than they were before the crisis, having been encouraged to snap up Bear Stearns and other competitors at bargain prices. These banks now have assets worth over 66 percent of gross domestic product - at least $9.4 trillion, up from 20 percent of G.D.P. in the 1990s. There is no evidence that institutions of this size add sufficient value to offset the systemic risk they pose.
This message could work politically, for five reasons.
First, for anyone on the right of the political spectrum who thinks at all about the issues, this is a coherent and appealing position. Mr. Fama had it exactly right when he said, in the same interview that "too big to fail" "is not capitalism; capitalism says - you perform poorly, you fail."
"Too big to fail" is not a market-based concept; it's a government subsidy scheme - of the most inefficient and dangerous kind.
This is exactly Mr. Huntsman's theme: "Hedge funds and private equity funds go out of business all the time when they make big mistakes, to the notice of few, because they are not too big to fail. There is no reason why banks cannot live with the same reality."
Second, serious senior figures within the Republican Party have long been pointing in this direction. In 2009, for example, former Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said, "First we should just come out and say it: the financial system that led us to the brink of disaster is broken." And former Secretary of State George P. Shultz has emphasized that we should "make failure tolerable," suggesting, for example, "an escalating schedule could be required of necessary capital ratios geared to size and matched with escalating limits on leverage."
Republicans like to discuss who is and is not a true Republican. How can any true Republican condone the subsidies that underpin our biggest financial companies today?
Third, mainstream financial thinking is in exactly the same place, in terms of asserting that capital requirements for big banks should be much higher. On this issue I refer you, as always, to the work of Anat Admati and her colleagues at Stanford University.
Mr. Huntsman's position is in alignment with the strongest possible technical thinking, but he has also found a direct and easy way to communicate the right political message. Higher capital requirements for big banks are a great idea; they should help prevent financial disaster. But when such disaster occurs, we need financial institutions that can actually fail - with losses to creditors - without bringing down the entire system. Anything "too big to fail" is simply too big.
Fourth, political Republicans who favor the status quo with regard to megabanks are going to have a hard time justifying that position - including in a confrontational debate format. (Mr. Huntsman declined to participate in this week's debate among the Republican candidates, but is likely to spread his "too big to fail" message as he campaigns at town hall meetings in New Hampshire.)
In particular, Mitt Romney is very vulnerable on this issue, as he has already lined up so much support from among the biggest banks. Presumably the prospect of Wall Street donations is enough to deter some Republicans (and many Democrats) from confronting the issue of "too big to fail." But if Mr. Romney is already far ahead is this fund-raising category, there is much less to lose. And his donations must make it harder for him to explain exactly how he would ensure that even one megabank could fail.
It's not enough just to wish that big banks could fail or to promise not to support them next time. This is not a credible commitment - and the "resolution authority" created under the Dodd-Frank regulatory legislation is a paper tiger with regard to winding down the biggest banks. If the choice is global economic calamity or unsavory bailout, which would you - let alone any Republican president - choose?
Mr. Huntsman has joined the dots. There are various ways to directly address and remove the implicit subsidies that the largest banks receive. Bloated size and excessive leverage can be effectively taxed. As he said:
Eliminating subsidies would encourage the affected institutions to downsize by selling off certain operations or face having to pay the real costs of bailouts. We need banks that are small and simple enough to fail, not financial public utilities.
Fifth, the euro zone is on the verge of calamity in large part because its members built very large banks with huge implicit subsidies, and this facilitated an irresponsible accumulation of public sector debt.
During the Dodd-Frank debate last year, we heard repeatedly from people - including senators on both sides of the aisle - who believed that reducing the size of our largest banks would somehow put the rest of our private sector at a disadvantage.
Who now would like to emulate in any way the disaster that the Europeans have brought upon themselves? Mr. Romney, please explain how you would prevent our largest banks from becoming ever larger and taking on more risk, and, as they did, continuing the reckless buildup of debt throughout the global economy.

HEADLINE: Newswallah: In the English-Language Press Thursday

BYLINE: LYDIA POLGREEN


HIGHLIGHT: Top stories on Thursday. 

 BODY:
The Finance Ministry finally admitted what every economist, stockbroker and reader of the business pages has long suspected: India's growth rate will likely fall short of 8 percent this year. The global slowdown, rising oil and commodity prices and rising interest rates are to blame, Pranab Mukherjee, India's finance minister, said Wednesday. The lower expectations will have a major impact on the best-case-scenario budget presented earlier this year, which assumed the treasury would overflow with the proceeds of a white-hot economy ().
The jailed former chief minister of Karnataka, B. S. Yeddyurappa, has made a surprisingly speedy recovery and was discharged Wednesday from the hospital and returned to Bangalore's city jail. He had been hospitalized on Oct. 16 complaining of "chest discomfort," according to news reports. Even members of his own party have recently criticized the politician, who was deposed after a government report accused his government of participating in massive corruption in the state's mining industry. Politicians and celebrities who find themselves in jail often claim health problems to escape stifling cells (). 
The escalating tensions between the United States and Pakistan reached a new level with Pakistan's top general, Ashfaq Kayani, warning that the U.S. should think "ten times" before launching a unilateral attack on his nuclear-armed country. General Kayani's remarks were made at a closed-door briefing for members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defense but widely reported in the Pakistani press. Another top Pakistani defense official said that Pakistan's military posture against India is based on fear of its so-called "cold start" doctrine, in which Indian armed forces would quickly mass and retaliate in case of a Pakistan attack (). 
At the root of a drawn-out labor strike at a Maruti factory in Haryana is the "gap between aspirations of a new generation of workers and clockwork precision of a prosperous company," the writes. The article details the low salaries, stressful, fast-paced work, too-short tea breaks, expensive housing and feud over unionizing permanent workers that are fueling the strike ().
Cracks continue to widen in Team Anna Hazare, the reports. The social activist Rajendra Singh is the latest to withdraw from the top leadership of the India Against Corruption campaign, over what he described as Mr. Hazare's and Arvind Kejriwal's "autocratic" behavior and their decision to wade into politics. At issue is Mr. Hazare's fight against the candidate of the governing Congress party in a by-election in Hisar. Mr. Singh and others worried that the opposition candidate had a long record of corruption accusations. "I have been working at the grassroots level for the past 30 years and never got into politics. This kind of party politics is dangerous," Mr. Singh said ().
In other Team Anna news, one key member of the movement's leadership may have been submitting inflated invoices for flights, the reports. Kiran Bedi, a former top police official who was awarded a medal for bravery, is entitled to a 75 percent discount on Air India flights. The paper claims, based on her expense reports, that she bought discounted tickets but asked those who invited her to speak to pay full fare to her charity. Ms. Bedi told the paper that "every penny in our work is accounted for and is for the facilitation of the causes we espouse" ().

HEADLINE: Migrants from Sanity

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: While thousands of jobs go unfilled, politicians talk about death fences and illegal lawn help in the Great Disconnect over immigration. 

 BODY:
With 14 million Americans out of work, you would think somebody could answer the desperation call from farmers offering to pay $150 to anyone willing to pick fruit in the orchards of Washington State. But no, the apples hang at peak ripeness, a near-record crop, and the jobs go begging, despite radio ads and an appeal by Governor Christine Gregoire to the other Washington for help.
One thing the United States still does better than most countries is grow food. But one thing it now does worse than others is govern to solve problems. And so, the apples rot, businesses are crippled, and dreams of fresh life in a new country are dashed. This dystopian status quo exists because the simple-minded who control one of the major political parties have shut down all adult talk on the subject of immigration.
Roll the tape from Tuesday's Republican presidential debate, and there you see a front-runner, Mitt Romney, who spoke the Michael Kinsley definition of a gaffe - telling the truth by accident. It came after he was needled about the Latino man without proper papers who used to labor on the 2.5 acre lawn of the Romney estate. 
"I'm running for office, for Pete's sake," Romney recalled telling the lawn service, in words that will be replayed over and over. "I can't have illegals."

Romney was part of the shadow economy that keeps grass clipped, apples picked and chickens plucked in every part of this country. If he'd said, "Who else is going to cut my lawn?" at least he'd have started an honest debate.
Another front-runner, the pizza salesman Herman Cain, has vowed to build a multi-billion-dollar fence along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico. As he envisions it, this 20-foot-high barrier will be topped by barbed wire and fully juiced, in order to kill by electric shock all challengers - mothers with children and young men alike. 
This country has long been known for the words of the Emma Lazarus sonnet at the base of the Statue of Liberty: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." That line should bring tears to any descendant of an immigrant, which is to say most Americans. But some Republicans apparently want to replace that motto with: Kill the Mexicans.
Cain initially sloughed off this suggestion, saying it was a joke. But then he clarified it a few days later with these words: "I don't apologize for using a combination of a fence. And it might be electrified - I'm not walking away from that."
More telling - and truly chilling - is the fact that the audience at the Tea-Party-sponsored Cain speech on Saturday cheered when he initially promised to electrocute Mexicans. "The fence is going to be electrified, and there is going to be a sign on the other side that says, 'It will kill you.'" 
Now, substitute Irish for Mexicans and imagine the reaction. You simply could never say such a thing. But Latinos - they can be routinely dehumanized to appease the black-hearted base of the Republican Party. It's not hard to see how talk of killing Mexicans, for what is a misdemeanor offense, is such a dis to many of the 50 million Americans who are Latino - the largest ethnic group in the country. 
Cain's comments were the last straw for Lauro Garza, a longtime Texas Republican and fierce conservative. He quit the party this week in disgust, saying he was appalled that people cheered remarks by Cain that "advocated for the murder of innocent people." Sorry, Mr. Garza, but that's the party base of 2011, the same folks who booed a gay soldier serving in Iraq, and applauded the idea of letting a sick but uninsured man die in the hospital emergency room. 
And, just as not a single Republican candidate stood up for the soldier in harm's way who had been booed, no one on the stage in Las Vegas challenged Cain on his lethal border suggestions.
A former front-runner, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, actually had some good ideas on immigration that enjoyed - not so long ago - bipartisan support. But the stiff-shouldered, sentence-snagged, swagger-shrunken Texas governor has dropped so fast with that moderate position that he's now reduced to calling Herm Cain "brother," and assailing Romney for the Latino on his lawn. 
Meanwhile, jobs go begging: in Alabama, which passed the nation's harshest anti-immigrant law; in Georgia, where the governor suggested using convicts to work in the fields after 11,000 jobs went unfilled; and in the orchards of Washington, where the flow to the far north has diminished mainly because of the recession. 
Well then, why not hire only people with full citizenship? One farmer in Colorado, John Harold, tried doing just that, hoping to fill harvest positions with jobless locals looking for extra cash. But as my colleague Kirk Johnson reported, many of those locals did not last even a full day; they complained of the hard work in the onion fields of Colorado. 
The problem, through good times and bad, is that there are millions of jobs that Americans will not do. The solution, some combination of path to citizenship with guest worker programs, should be within the grasp of the better political minds. 
But tepid Democrats are afraid of doing anything. And some Republicans want a death fence, and will go after anyone who has an illegal on his lawn. It's the great disconnect - yet another reason why so many Americans have a higher regard for a single-celled protozoan than a politician working the stump.

HIGHLIGHT: The latest political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
President Obama wrapped up his bus tour on Wednesday in Virginia, where he used a softer partisan tone to pitch his jobs bill to troops and firefighters in Republican territory, Mark Landler writes. Mr. Obama hits the road again next week headed to Nevada, California and Colorado as the Senate prepares to vote on a $35 billion chunk of the legislation.

        
Brian Knowlton and Choe Sang-hun report that the Obama administrationplans to resume talks with North Korea next week in Geneva and has appointed an envoy to Pyongyang who has a background in nuclear issues.

        
The hostility on display Tuesday night between Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts has a long history and portends a more aggressive phase of their rivalry for the Republican nomination as the campaigns roll out ads ahead of the early caucuses and primaries, Michael D. Shear and Jeff Zeleny report.

        
Mr. Perry on Wednesday said that he supports a flat tax, highlighting another difference between him and Mr. Romney and apparently trying to mimic Herman Cain's ability to tap into voters' frustration with the complexity of tax code, Catherine Rampell and Richard A. Oppel, Jr. report.
        
Republican Party officials are worried that the tough talk about fighting illegal immigration coming from the party's presidential candidates may hurt their efforts to win back large blocs of Hispanic voters who share their conservative values, Trip Gabriel writes.

        
Ideas supported by a few of the candidates to extend or even electrify a fence along the United States' border with Mexico have raised questions about the cost-effectiveness of such measures, Julia Preston reports.

        
Nicholas Confessore writes that Herman Cain's allies have formed a "Super PAC," Americans for Herman Cain, with the goal of catching up to better-financed candidates.
Around the Web:

        
Mr. Obama may struggle to get Wall Street support for his economic policies but his campaign is flush with donations from the financial sector and even managed to collect more from employees at Mr. Romney's former company than the Republican candidate himself, according to the Washington Post. 
Happening in Washington:

        
At 8:30 a.m., the Department of Labor releases weekly jobless claims, following at 10 a.m. with data on workers' weekly earnings from May 1 to June 30 and work-related injuries and illnesses for 2010.

        
At 10 a.m., the Conference Board releases leading economic indicators for September coinciding with the National Association of Realtors' release of figures on last month's existing home sales and Freddie Mac's release of weekly mortgage rates.

        
Also at 10 a.m., the Senate Banking Committee holds a hearing to discuss the future of the 30-year mortgage before a subcommittee turns to global economic risks at 2 p.m.

        
At 2 p.m., Mr. Obama will meet the 13 recipients of this year's Presidential Citizens Medal, the second-highest civilian honor awarded by the White House, before meeting at 4 p.m. with the prime minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg.

HEADLINE: Obama Group's Web Video Attacks Romney

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney may be in a fierce battle with Rick Perry at the moment. But he's also got to worry about President Obama. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney may be in a fierce battle with Rick Perry at the moment. But he's also got to worry about President Obama.
A "super PAC" that supports Mr. Obama's re-election is set to begin showing a tough new web video Thursday morning that accuses Mr. Romney -- a multimillionaire -- of wanting people like himself to pay less in taxes than teachers, police or construction workers.
"Romney is worth as much as $250 million. But he only paid about 14 percent in federal taxes last year," the video, produced by Priorities USA Action, says. "That's less than what many middle-class American families pay. American families who are struggling to make ends meet."
The video is an effort by Mr. Obama's allies to capitalize on what they see as a weakness for Mr. Romney should he win the nomination: his wealth.
The PAC based Mr. Romney's tax bill on an estimate by Citizens for Tax Justice, a left-leaning group. Gail Gitcho, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, was asked about the estimate by Time magazine this month and declined to release Mr. Romney's tax return. "That is something they will decide should he win the nomination," Ms. Gitcho said.
After last week's New Hampshire debate, where Mr. Romney called Mr. Obama's proposal for a temporary payroll tax cut a "Band-Aid," the Democrats pounced. They accused Mr. Romney of not understanding how much the tax cut could mean for the middle class.
Now, the ad is taking even more direct aim at Mr. Romney's opposition to the payroll tax increase by linking it to his personal financial situation. 
"He doesn't see the big deal with letting taxes go up by $1,000 for hardworking Americans," the video says. "That's the Romney rule."
In response to the video, Ms. Gitcho said in an e-mail: "Mitt Romney has a tax plan that cuts taxes for the middle class. This is another pathetic attempt by President Obama's political machine to distract attention from their nonexistent record on creating jobs. Just this morning, we learned that an unprecedented 26 million people are unemployed, underemployed or have stopped looking for work - and President Obama has no plan to deal with it. Barack Obama put forward a second stimulus bill that has been rejected by Congress, and he has yet to offer any alternative."
Officials at the PAC said they would spend "tens of thousands" of dollars to place the video on social video sites as the first phase in an effort to keep the pressure on Mr. Romney. The video ends with the phrase, "It's time to repeal the Romney rule," and links to www.theromneyrule.com.

HEADLINE: Herman Cain, Hamid Karzai Knows Your Name

BYLINE: STEVEN LEE MYERS


HIGHLIGHT: The presidential campaign unexpectedly made its way to Afghanistan when Hamid Karzai brought up recent comments by Herman Cain during a meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. 

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan - The Republican presidential campaign unexpectedly made its way to Afghanistan on Thursday when Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan, brought up recent comments by Herman Cain during a meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
As reporters entered the room where the two met for the usual photo opportunity, Mr. Karzai was asking Mrs. Clinton about remarks Mr. Cain made recently in a television interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network.
"I'm ready for gotcha questions, and they're already starting to come," Mr. Cain said in the interview, which was broadcast on Oct. 8. "And when they ask who is the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan, I'm going to say, 'You know, I don't know. Do you know?' And then I'm going to say, 'How's that going to create one job?'"
Mrs. Clinton, a former presidential candidate herself, has typically avoided overtly political issues as secretary of state, but she sought to explain on Thursday.
"He's a former pizza company owner," she said to Mr. Karzai.
"Is he that?" He replied, speaking in English.
"Oh, yes. He started something called Godfather's pizza," she said.
"Yes, I see, I see," Mr. Karzai said.
Mrs. Clinton then turned to the American ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker, and went on, laughingly. "The president was saying he saw a news clip about how Mr. Cain had said I don't even know the names of all these presidents of all these countries, you know, like whatever "
"All the 'stans whatever," Mr. Karzai interjected, referring to the countries of Central and Southern Asia, including his.
"All the 'stans places," Mrs. Clinton repeated.
Mr. Karzai did not seem to take offense, displaying what appeared to be an astute understanding of campaigning in a democratic country. "That wasn't right," he said, "but anyway, that's how politics are."
Mr. Cain, riding a wave of attention in recent weeks, went on in the interview to say that "knowing who is the head of some of these small insignificant states around the world" was not critical to a president focused on national security and the economy at home.
He made clear that, if elected, he would read the briefing papers about the leader of, presumably, Uzbekistan. (The president there, for the record, is Islam A. Karimov, whom Mrs. Clinton is expected to meet during a weeklong trip that includes stops in four "'stans.")
"When I get ready to go visit that country, I'll know who it is," he said, "but until then, I want to focus on the big issues that we need to solve."

HEADLINE: Campaign Ad Barrage Begins With Paul

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Ron Paul has started a multimillion dollar television ad campaign, the first serious push by a presidential candidate this year to influence primary voters. 

 BODY:
The campaign ads are finally here.
Representative Ron Paul has started a multimillion dollar television advertising campaign, the first serious push by a presidential candidate this year to influence voters in the early primary states with pricey broadcast commercials.
Mr. Paul's campaign announced that two ads will start running immediately in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina and Nevada, joining an ad already running that touts his anti-abortion credentials.
It is the beginning of what promises to be a crush of political television commercials in those states during the next several months as Mr. Paul and his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination pour tens of millions of dollars into advertising. 
In one ad, titled "Consistent," Mr. Paul hits his rivals for failing to stay true to conservative principles. The slickly produced ad shows video clips of Herman Cain, Mitt Romney and Rick Perry expressing support for bank bailouts and economic stimulus programs.
"I've been talking about these problems for a long, long time," Mr. Paul says in the ad. "Now we are bankrupt, and we have to decide which way we are going to go."
In the other ad, Mr. Paul touts his plan to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget in a single year and eliminate as many as five cabinet agencies. The ad calls Mr. Paul a "visionary who predicted the economic crisis" and says his proposals are a "plan to restore America now."
"The absolutely positive reception of Ron Paul's 'Plan to Restore America' means we're obligated to meet an even higher standard of outreach and discussion," said Jesse Benton, Mr. Paul's campaign manager. "We thought it only right to follow with a worthy campaign advertising effort."
That effort will test the proposition that Mr. Paul's candidacy can broaden its appeal beyond the loyal following it has already built among young people, libertarians and some fiscal conservatives.
Mr. Paul, a doctor by training, remains at around 10 percent in the public polls. His second-place finish at the Iowa straw poll behind Michele Bachmann was encouraging to his supporters. But since then, they have watched as other candidates have shot past him into the lead, while he has remained essentially where he has always been.
Mr. Paul's message of fiscal restraint and smaller government, along with his call for a retreat from commitments abroad have helped him to raise plenty of campaign cash. 
Mr. Paul's campaign said this month that more than 100,000 people had contributed to his presidential bid during the third quarter, a huge number that far outpaced his Republican rivals. By comparison, Rick Perry's $17 million haul came from just 22,000 donors, his campaign said.
In the last campaign, Mr. Paul's bid was less sophisticated and his success raising money came too late to help much - in December of 2007. This time, though, the campaign is flush with cash early and is looking to spend it ahead of the first nominating contests. 
Will it help? 
Mr. Paul is often discounted by political observers as a fringe candidate whose messages are largely out of step with the majority of Republican voters, to say nothing of the broader American electorate. 
But his decision to spend millions on campaign ads will test that idea in the early states that matter. The answer may come soon enough, in surveys that will reflect whether or not Mr. Paul's support can grow significantly.

HEADLINE: Senate Plan Seeks Foreigners to Spur Housing Market

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York and Mike Lee of Utah proposed a measure that would allow foreigners who buy American homes to acquire visas. 

 BODY:
What do you do when Americans just aren't buying houses? A new bipartisan plan in the Senate offers one idea: Import people who will.
Grappling with how to stimulate the slumped housing market, two senators -- Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah -- proposed a measure Thursday that would allow foreigners who buy American homes to acquire visas.
The provision, which comes out of a bill to bolster foreign investment in the United States economy, offers foreigners a three-year, residential visa if they invest at least $500,000 into the housing market and live in a home they have bought for at least 180 days each year. 
In a conference call with reporters, Mr. Schumer said the proposal had the potential to attract a significant number of investors to the United States.
"The greatest problem in our housing market is there's not enough demand," he said.
Mr. Schumer said foreign buyers would be subject to the same stringent screenings as those seeking other kinds of visas. 
Foreign buyers would have to pay for the homes with cash, not mortgages, as well as pay taxes. With the exception of earning income by leasing properties they have purchased, these visa holders will have to apply for a work visa to work in the United States, which Mr. Schumer said would prevent them from taking jobs away from Americans. The visa would not grant them citizenship nor allow them to vote.
The proposal is based on an idea supported by Warren E. Buffett, and has been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and leading industry groups. Mr. Schumer said the Obama administration received the proposal on Wednesday and had yet to comment on it.
"My hope is that the administration will like it," he said.

HEADLINE: John Bryson Confirmed as Commerce Secretary

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: After months of delay, the Senate confirms President Obama's choice for commerce secretary. 

 BODY:
The Senate voted 74-26 on Thursday to confirm the nomination of John Bryson to be the next commerce secretary, ending a months-long struggle over President Obama's choice.
Mr. Obama nominated Mr. Bryson to replace the outgoing secretary, Gary Locke, in May. Mr. Locke succeeded Jon M. Huntsman Jr. as U.S. ambassador to China.
Senate Republicans threatened to block Mr. Bryson's confirmation unless Mr. Obama submitted long-delayed trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea for congressional approval. He did so, and Congress passed those trade deals last week.
Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee, put a hold on Mr. Bryson's nomination, preventing a vote for months. He fought Mr. Bryson's confirmation for his support of cap-and-trade legislation to reduce carbon emissions and his role in founding the National Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, in 1970.
After Mr. Bryson's confirmation, Mr. Obama issued a statement emphasizing employment and economic recovery.
 "At such a critical time for our economy, I nominated John because I believe his decades of experience both in the public and private sector have given him a clear understanding of what it takes to put America on a stronger economic footing and create jobs," Mr. Obama said.

HEADLINE: California Adopts Limits on Greenhouse Gases

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
SACRAMENTO -- Fifteen months after a similar effort died in Congress, California regulators adopted a system on Thursday for combating climate change that sets limits on greenhouse gas emissions and creates market incentives to encourage oil refineries, electricity generators and other polluters to clean up their plants.
The eight members of the Air Resources Board who were present gave a unanimous vote of approval. ''We are charting new ground here,'' said Lydia H. Kennard, a board member, just before the vote. ''The country and the world are watching.'' The plan will take effect in 2013. 
The board members seemed keenly aware that they were giving the state a policy prescription regarded as poison in some parts of the country. But in an interview before the vote, the board's chairwoman, Mary D. Nichols, invoked the state's history of national environmental leadership, suggesting that if California acted first, the rest of the country would eventually come around.
''We are staking out new ground in the battle against global warming,'' she said. ''And we are doing it in difficult times and doing it in a way we believe others will want to follow.''
More than 70 people, from environmentalists to lawyers for the petroleum industry to union members fearful for their refinery jobs, addressed the board before the vote. The air regulators have been working for four years to devise an efficient system that will avoid problems that have dogged the European carbon market, like missed targets or pollution allowances that critics found too generous.
The plan arises from trailblazing legislation signed in 2006 by Arnold Schwarzenegger, then the governor, requiring California to develop regulations that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The market incentives, known as cap and trade, are considered crucial to meeting that target.
California's ambitions are in striking contrast to those of much of the rest of the nation. A conservative political rebellion against cap and trade helped the Republican resurgence in 2010. Attacking the plan as ''cap and tax,'' opponents argued that it would impose excessive costs on energy industries in a weak economy.
In a cap-and-trade system, the government sets a cap on the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that refineries, chemical companies, cement plants and other businesses are allowed to release. It then issues permits to those companies allowing them to emit a certain amount.
Because some companies can rein in their emissions more easily or at less cost than other businesses, they can profit by selling extra permits through the market to companies that find the cost of pollution-control technology prohibitive. In theory this ensures that heat-trapping gases are reduced at the lowest possible cost.
California's nascent market already reaches beyond its borders. While most of the businesses responsible for reducing their emissions over time are based here, they can offset up to 8 percent of their emissions by buying so-called offset credits generated anywhere in the country by other ventures that cut their emissions.
Landfill operators around the Southeast have been isolating and destroying methane, for example, earning offset credits that can one day be sold on California's carbon market. Intermediaries identify projects that are reducing emissions, verify that they are successful and seek credits for them.
This offset market cushions the polluters' transition to expensive new technologies that scrub carbon dioxide from their emissions.
Yet skeptics of the program are not hard to come by. Steven F. Hayward, a specialist on environmental issues with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said he doubted that the new program would have much of a future.
''In the absence of a national program or even regional programs getting much traction, I don't think this will go far,'' he said. ''It will probably get off with a bang, with some big early trades capturing some low-hanging fruit. But then it will wither and die an ignominious death.''
In the short run, however, there have already been economic winners. While most of the 360 projects whose offsets have been approved are landfills, the biggest winner so far in this fledgling market may be Clean Harbors, a Massachusetts company whose hazardous waste disposal operation in El Dorado, Ark., has spent years destroying old refrigerants. Known as chlorofluorocarbons, the pre-1995 refrigerants are potent greenhouse gases.
According to a list of approved offset projects prepared by the Climate Action Reserve, a nonprofit organization whose standards are nearly identical to those developed by state regulators, the Clean Harbor site in Arkansas has already offset the equivalent of 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which translates to 2.3 million offset credits worth $10 to $11 each.
''The beauty of the California program is that it allows offsets from anywhere in the United States,'' said Gary Gero, president of the Climate Action Reserve. ''You don't have to pass a litmus test that you believe in climate change,'' he said. ''If you think Californians are crazy, it doesn't bar you from participating.''
The pre-1995 refrigerants, whose production is now banned worldwide because of their role in thinning the earth's protective ozone layer, would otherwise probably have been recycled into the innards of older grocery freezer compartments.
''This is a clear case where the carbon market has provided the financial incentive to make an environmental improvement over the status quo,'' said Arjun Patney, a carbon market strategist at Cargill, the agricultural and food processing giant, which markets the credits from the Arkansas operations.

HEADLINE: In Bid to Cut Costs at Some Texas Prisons, Lunch Will Not Be Served on Weekends

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Texas prison officials last month ended the decades-old practice of serving last meals to inmates about to be executed after one man ordered an elaborate feast of hamburgers, pizza and chicken-fried steaks that he did not eat.
But the 300 inmates on death row are not the only ones coping with food restrictions. 
Thousands of other inmates in the Texas prison system have been eating fewer meals since April after officials stopped serving lunch on the weekends in some prisons as a way to cut food-service costs. About 23,000 inmates in 36 prisons are eating two meals a day on Saturdays and Sundays instead of three. A meal the system calls brunch is usually served between 5 and 7 a.m., followed by dinner between 4 and 6:30 p.m.
The meal reductions are part of an effort to trim $2.8 million in food-related expenses from the 2011 fiscal year budget of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the state prison agency. Other cuts the agency has made to its food service include replacing carton milk with powdered milk and using sliced bread instead of hamburger and hot dog buns.
Prison administrators said that the cuts were made in response to the state's multibillion-dollar budget shortfall in 2011, and that the weekend lunches were eliminated in consultation with the agency's health officials and dietitians. Michelle Lyons, an agency spokeswoman, said that inmates with health problems who have been prescribed a therapeutic diet continue to receive three meals per day.
By reducing its weekend meals, Texas has set itself apart from most other state prison systems. State inmates in New York, California, Nevada, Florida and several other states are fed three times a day, seven days a week. Federal prisoners receive three meals daily, as do inmates in the county jails throughout Texas. Most states serve their inmates milk in cartons, but Texas prison officials said switching to powdered milk would save them an estimated $3.5 million annually.
Ohio and Arizona serve two meals per day on the weekends to reduce food-service costs. Georgia serves two meals per day on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, though inmates on work details receive a third meal.
Inmates' relatives and legal advocates in Texas said the elimination of milk in cartons and weekend lunches was an unnecessarily harsh cutback that had a negative effect on prison life. In August, 19 inmates at the Hutchins State Jail near Dallas, one of the 36 prisons that reduced weekend meals, signed a petition and sent it to the Texas affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union, calling the food cutbacks a violation of the federal Constitution.
''I think it's really easy to take things away from inmates,'' said Susan Fenner, executive director of the Texas Inmate Families Association. ''One inmate told me, for some of them, that's all they have to look forward to is a meal.''
Inmates are allowed to purchase chips and other snacks from prison commissaries. In prisons that have cut back on weekend meals, food from the commissaries has taken on a new significance. Prisoners' relatives said the meal reductions affect low-income inmates the most, because their families cannot afford to send money to keep them supplied with commissary snacks.
The weekend meal reduction appears to be out of step with the standards adopted by the American Correctional Association. In adult prisons, the association recommends serving three meals per day. Variations are allowed based on weekend and holiday food-service demands as long as the meals meet basic nutritional goals, but the standards do not state that the variations can be done every weekend or as a cost-cutting measure.
Daron Hall, the sheriff of Davidson County in Tennessee and the president of the American Correctional Association, said Texas prison officials had adopted a loose interpretation of the food-service standards and needed to monitor the impact of the reductions on inmates. ''I've never read the standard to mean you can do it every weekend,'' Sheriff Hall said. ''In the economic climate we're in, you're asked to do some creative and inventive things. You have to balance that with the safety and welfare of inmates in the facilities.''
Prisoners' rights advocates said that serving inmates fewer than three meals a day falls into a legal gray zone based on various cases around the country. In Texas, a state law requires inmates to be fed ''three times in any 24-hour period,'' but the law applies only to county inmates and not to state prisoners.
''We're beginning to see this more frequently, as states and counties begin to cut back on food in a short-sighted attempt to cut costs,'' said David C. Fathi, director of the A.C.L.U.'s National Prison Project in Washington. ''This is not something the Supreme Court has addressed.''
Texas prison officials said they have no legal concerns about the food cutbacks, believe that they are in compliance with the correctional association standards and stress that inmates have not reported health problems stemming from the meal reductions. ''Extensive consultation with T.D.C.J.'s health services department and system dieticians prior to implementation of this plan have allowed us to avoid any medical issues,'' Ms. Lyons said in a statement.
State Senator John Whitmire, a Democrat and chairman of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee whose outrage over last meals on death row led to the end of the practice last month, said the reductions were not a major concern to him. ''If they don't like the menu,'' he said, ''don't come there in the first place.''

HEADLINE: Local Cash Squeeze Leads Beijing to Allow Bond Sales

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Xu Yan contributed research.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- Amid worries that local governments in China may be running short of cash, Beijing gave approval Thursday to a trial program that will allow the authorities in four regions to issue bonds.
The cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen, in southern China, as well as Zhejiang and Guangdong Provinces -- all fast-growing coastal areas -- were selected to take part in the program, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Finance.
The decision comes at a time when the Chinese government is tightening credit in the hopes of taming inflation and a property bubble, and easing growth in the world's second largest economy after the United States. 
That policy has begun to sting property developers, local governments that depend on land auctions for income and small and medium sized businesses, which often rely on high interest loans from underground banks.
There are also growing concerns that the Chinese banking system may be at risk because many local governments have amassed huge debts over the past three years by using undeveloped land as collateral.
And all of this is happening at a time when analysts expect slowdowns in Europe and the United States to also be felt in China, which has a huge export industry.
But the move Thursday was largely related to China's domestic issues, and the way in which it finances much of its growth.
China restricts local governments from issuing bonds, but does allow them to set up companies that raise money using land and other government assets as collateral. The governments have been aggressive in using local government financing vehicles -- whose debts do not show up on government budgets -- to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects.
The use of local government financing vehicles intensified in China after economic growth slowed in 2008, and Beijing began encouraging government stimulus packages to ramp up growth. The plan seemed to work, driving growth up to 10 percent in many parts of the country, but also fueling inflation and soaring property prices.
Now, there are concerns that the nation's state-run lenders are sitting on top of enormous debts, and that eventually Beijing will be forced to bailout the banks and local governments.
Officially, local government debt was about $1.7 trillion, or about 27 percent of the size the national economy, at the end of 2010. But that figure does not include central government debts for huge endeavors, like the nation's high-speed rail program.
A decade ago, Beijing was forced to bail out the big state-owned banks because many state-run companies were insolvent.
Shares of the biggest Chinese lenders have been slumping in recent months, partly because of concerns that the debts may be larger than the amounts the government has acknowledged.
Chinese banks have reported a relatively minor amount of nonperforming loans on their books, but analysts and investors either do not believe the figure or expect it to grow quickly in the coming two years.
Stephen Green, an economist at Standard Chartered, wrote in a report this week that Chinese banks ''may need a pre-emptive bailout.''
''China is not suffering a banking crisis now,'' Mr. Green wrote. ''But there's growing cause for concern. The only way to avert more serious problems is a new wave of reform.''
Liu Mingkang, the head of China's banking regulatory commission, acknowledged some of these problems in a speech that was posted on the regulator's Web site this week.
''Undeniably, the problems of irregular and imprudent management and lack of supervising mechanisms that exist in local government financing vehicles have created some hidden risks,'' he said.

'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' Not a natural song-and-dance man, Daniel Radcliffe tries really, really hard as the amoral hero of this 1961 Frank Loesser musical about corporate ladder-climbing.

'Man and Boy' When Frank Langella plays good, he's fine; but when he's bad, he's a wonder. Here the actor who starred as Dracula and Nixon is charismatically amoral as a 1930s financier who wreaks havoc with other people's money. He is also the one compelling reason to see this revival of Terence Rattigan's 1963 drama, directed by Maria Aitken (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'The Mountaintop' Katori Hall's surprisingly thin new drama (which won the 2010 Olivier Award) depicts the last night in the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Samuel L. Jackson) and his encounter with a feisty motel maid (Angela Basset). Perhaps best regarded as a comfort play, a nursery-room fable for grownups (1:40). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This newly retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)
'War Horse' This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45).

Off Broadway
- 'The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs' The accomplished monologuist Mike Daisey weaves the story of the life and vision of the Apple co-founder, Mr. Jobs, into a darker exploration of the troubling economic disparities that underlie our technology-obsessed age. Smart, engaging and funny, but be warned that you might have second thoughts about purchasing that next shiny gadget (1:50).

'Any Given Monday' Bruce Graham's biting two-act comedy about the consequences of infidelity focuses on Lenny (Paul Michael Valley), who is crushed after his wife, Risa (Hillary B. Smith), leaves him for another man. Lenny's daughter, Sarah (Lauren Ashley Carter), and his best friend, Mickey (Michael Mastro), are furious at him for not being furious at Risa. Plot twists and sharp dialogue, especially Mr. Mastro's, consistently entertain before this fable reaches its cynically amusing, if wholly unrealistic, conclusion (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Daniel M. Gold)
'The Berenstain Bears Live! in Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are now onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Manhattan Movement & Arts Center, 248 West 60th Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)
'Beyond Words' In this likable one-man show, Bill Bowers tells a series of tales in mime and monologue (1:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444, urbanstages.org. (Ken Jaworowski)
- 'Cymbeline' The Fiasco Theater's charming production brings lucidity, credibility and gentle magic to Shakespeare's bulky, convoluted tale of star-crossed lovers and schemers in old Britannia, with a multifarious cast of six on a naked stage. Directed by Noah Brody and Ben Steinfeld (2:40). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Dona Flor y Sus Dos Maridos' A Spanish-language adaptation (''Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands,'' in English) of Jorge Amado's novel, a sex farce with the clarity and logic of a folk tale and the spirit of a party. Saturday and Sunday only (1:40). Repertorio Espanol at Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920, repertorioespanol.com. (Saltz)
'Dreams of Flying Dreams of Falling' The latest pitch-black comedy from the prolific Adam Rapp is a flashy farrago of a play about dirty deeds in a swank Connecticut dining room. Christine Lahti and Reed Birney lead the fine cast (1:25). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, atlantictheater.org, ticketcentral.org. (Isherwood)
- 'The Judy Show: My Life as a Sitcom' The writer and stand-up comic Judy Gold may not have realized her dream of starring in a sitcom about being a 6-foot-3 Jewish lesbian mother of two on the Upper West Side, but she has squeezed several seasons' worth of wry observations about life, career and family into this consistently funny 80-minute monologue, complete with her own droll spins on some classic television theme tunes. For anyone who misses Mary Richards, Maude, Laverne and Shirley, the Bradys, the Partridges and other familiar faces that populated small screens in decades past (primarily the 1970s, but the late '60s, the '80s and the early '90s also get a look), this will be better than an uninterrupted evening of YouTube indulgence (1:20). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
- 'The Lyons' The actress Linda Lavin and the playwright Nicky Silver slyly reinvent that creaky archetype, the smothering, belittling Jewish mother. This play, Mr. Silver's best in some years, also reinvents Mr. Silver's eternal theme of the American family as a sick joke. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes an excellent Michael Esper and Dick Latessa (2:00). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Motherhood Out Loud' A compendium of sentiment-enriched scenes and monologues about the joys and agonies of being a mom. If that sounds appealing, the show is probably for you. If not, not (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (Isherwood)
'The Rap Guide to Evolution' A rapper from Canada with a master's in medieval and Renaissance English literature, Baba Brinkman has been a fixture at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in recent years with his hip-hop takes on Chaucer and on oral epics like ''Beowulf'' and ''Gilgamesh.'' In this entertaining 2009 Fringe First award-winner, he tackles Darwin with humor, sharp analytical skills and contemplative social insights, drawing parallels between natural selection and developments in rap that put a whole new spin on Mobb Deep's ''Survival of the Fittest'' (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555, sohoplayhouse.com. (Rooney)
'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they're reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Silence! The Musical' An ''unauthorized parody'' of the grisly movie with the Hannibal Lecter character crooning noxious songs and Jenn Harris giving a hilarious sendup of Jodie Foster's intense Clarice Starling. Not as funny as it needs to be (1:50). Reopens on Wednesday at 9th Space Theater at P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, East Village, (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Isherwood)
'Sleep No More' Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths' career as a movable orgy. The result suggests what might have happened if Stanley Kubrick (of ''The Shining'') had designed the Haunted Mansion at Disney World (2:00). The McKittrick Hotel, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, sleepnomorenyc.com. (Brantley)
'Traces' An energizing evening of acrobatics from the Montreal troupe Seven Fingers. Think of it as cirque du cabaret, in which a group of distinctive talents get to show off the physical equivalents of individual song stylings (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Voca People' This show features space aliens, but it's really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, despite some overamplification. But most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song -- the Doors' ''People Are Strange'' is a highlight -- do things reach their full potential (1:30). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'We Live Here' Amy Irving plays a needling mother of the bride in Zoe Kazan's play, about a family wedding that stirs up a long legacy of pain. Ms. Kazan, best known as an actress (''The Seagull,'' ''Angels in America''), can write viable dialogue, but the play is schematic and inauthentic.

'A Felony in Blue, or Death by Poker' Daniel Gallant's drama about an unusually high-stakes poker game among five mob bosses chugs along and is practically over before it starts.

(Eric Grode)
'The Greenwich Village Follies' Doug Silver and Andrew Frank's musical revue about the history of the Village is enthusiastically played and has a few nice numbers, but it feels slapdash and not nearly polished enough to pay proper tribute to its dynamic neighborhood.

'Mama, I Want to Sing' A largely new cast (seeded from the Gospel for Teens program in Harlem) gives full-throated life to this long-running gospel musical. Quibbles about the thin plot and questionable acting go out the window with each and every tune -- and there are plenty of them. Saturday only (2:00).

'Nightlands' Racial and sexual tensions percolate in Sylvan Oswald's empathic if cluttered memory play, set in North Philadelphia in the early 1960s. The shrewdly conceived characters outnumber the melodramatic flourishes, but only barely (1:45). Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101, here.org. (Grode)
- 'Southern Comfort' The 2001 Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize-winning documentary was not an obvious contender for musicalization. But Julianne Wick Davis and Dan Collins have fashioned an affecting folk-bluegrass show out of the tenderly observed chronicle of a surrogate family of transgender friends in rural Georgia. As the female-to-male Robert Eads, suffering from ovarian cancer in a cruel paradox of nature, Annette O'Toole is tremendously moving, while Jeff McCarthy brings touching awkwardness to Robert's male-to-female girlfriend. The songs at times push a little hard for their emotional peaks, but the entire cast displays an affinity for the material under Thomas Caruso's sensitive direction, and the authenticity of the story elevates this unconventional, sad-sweet musical (2:15).

HEADLINE: Separatists Halt Violence To Advance Basque Goals

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid.

 BODY:
LONDON -- After more than 40 years of violent struggle for independence in the traditional Basque homeland in Spain and France, the separatist group ETA declared a unilateral end to its campaign of bombings and shootings on Thursday, saying it wished to seize a ''historical opportunity to reach a just and democratic resolution to an age-old political conflict.''
The group's announcement of ''the definite cessation of its military activity,'' and its appeal for a ''direct dialogue'' with the governments in Madrid and Paris, came in the form of a written statement and an accompanying video posted online, which were sent to news organizations. 
The renunciation of armed struggle went a step further than previous cease-fires the group has declared, and often broken, over the years. It was perhaps an acknowledgment that the group had been badly weakened by a crackdown by Spanish and French security forces.
Spanish leaders, facing a debt crisis and severe austerity measures, welcomed the rare bit of good news with relief and cautious optimism.
''The state of law today triumphs,'' said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. ''Our democracy will be one without terrorism, but not without memory,'' he added, recalling the 829 people killed by ETA over more than four decades.
Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the opposition Popular Party, called the announcement ''good news,'' with the caveat that ''the tranquillity of Spaniards will only be complete when the full dismantling of ETA has occurred.''
In fact, the statement fails to meet many of Spain's longtime demands -- ETA did not say it would disarm, dissolve or renounce the goal of independence -- and experts cautioned that many problems would have to be resolved before peace could be secured.
Far from dissolving, ETA, which is considered a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States, made it plain that it saw itself, and its political wing, as a major players in future negotiations on a tangle of complex issues arising from the prolonged violence.
Those issues include demands for the release of hundreds of Basque militants imprisoned in French and Spanish jails, including top-ranking figures from the leadership of ETA and Batasuna, a banned political party that has been closely associated with ETA. Just as thorny will be issues relating to the disarming of ETA and the decommissioning of its arms and explosives, the experts said, and the reintegration of former militants into everyday life.
The declaration also appeared to fall short of guaranteeing that the armed struggle would never resume.
The ETA video showed the statement being read in Spanish by one of three ETA activists seated at a table flanked by Basque nationalist banners, wearing black berets and capes, and white masks. Intermediaries with recent access to ETA leaders identified the three as members of the group's General Command.
The commanders emphatically reasserted the goal of independence, and at the end of the video joined in traditional ETA rallying cries delivered with clenched-fist salutes. ''The fight for independence for the Basque homeland goes on!'' they cried.
Another concern centered on the fact that the announcement was made in what amounted to a political void. Mr. Zapatero's Socialist government and the center-right Popular Party, a strong favorite to win a general election on Nov. 20, appeared to have played no part in the negotiations leading to the announcement. The Popular Party has strongly opposed any quick peace deal, insisting that ETA not only renounce its violence and disarm, but also dissolve on terms to be negotiated with the authorities in Madrid.
Instead, the declaration followed an appeal to ETA by a group of informal peace negotiators who met this week in San Sebastian, the political center of the main Basque homeland in Spain. The group included Kofi Annan, the former secretary general of the United Nations; Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former Norwegian prime minister; and Gerry Adams, the leader of the Irish nationalist group Sinn Fein, which has long had ties to ETA and has itself managed a metamorphosis from armed to political struggle.
The group issued a communique on Monday, saying it was ''time to end, and possible to end, the last armed confrontation in Europe.''
Although home to fewer than 3 million of Spain's 46 million people, the Basque region has a disproportionate economic importance as a center of industry, mining and culture. Bilbao, one of Spain's largest cities, with close to a million people, has a Basque majority, and is home to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, one of Europe's most celebrated centers for modern art. San Sebastian is world renowned for its cutting-edge cuisine.
But Spanish economists have estimated the investment lost in recent years because of the violence at more than a billion dollars. Spain and France have deployed thousands of anti-terrorist police officers, as well as undercover intelligence agents. Until ETA's power was undercut by the security crackdown, it was common for businesses to have to pay a hefty ''revolutionary tax'' to the militants.
ETA has made a succession of previous cease-fire declarations that have been quickly abandoned, most egregiously in 2006, when a truce with the Zapatero government collapsed amid failed negotiations and ETA militants mounted a car bomb attack at Madrid's main international airport, killing two people.
Against this history, some Spanish commentators said the declaration amounted to a recognition by ETA's commanders that the group had effectively been routed by the security crackdown. With hundreds of its activists rounded up and imprisoned, some estimates have said that ETA has recently had only 50 active militants capable of mounting attacks.
ETA's statement also ignored another demand often made by Madrid, offering no apology to the victims of its attacks, many of them in bombings and shootings that have occurred outside the main Basque population centers, particularly in Spain. The statement approached the issue obliquely, saying only that ''faced with violence and repression, dialogue and agreement must characterize the new age.''
By issuing their declaration 72 hours after the peace negotiators met in San Sebastian, the ETA commanders appeared to have found a face-saving formula for acknowledging the harsh realities confronting them if they sought to continue their armed confrontation.
By issuing their demand for peace in the Basque heartland, and effectively dictating to ETA the words of its concession by calling for ''the definitive cessation of all armed action,'' the negotiators effectively made it possible for ETA's leaders to present themselves as responding to an international push for peace, rather than to the French and Spanish security crackdowns.

Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/jazz.
Rez Abbasi Trio (Saturday) Born in Pakistan but raised in California and a New Yorker since the early 1990s, the guitarist Rez Abbasi has fashioned a career out of contemporary fusions, with keen insight and fleet technique. He teams up here with the venerable drummer Satoshi Takeishi and the versatile bassist John Hebert. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $15 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)
Kenny Barron Trio (Tuesday through Thursday) Kenny Barron is the leading practitioner of an elegant, economical and rhythmically sure-footed piano style that thrives in any mainstream setting. He's likely to explore at least a few different styles here, with Kiyoshi Kitagawa on bass and Johnathan Blake on drums. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) 
George Benson (Friday) The title of ''Guitar Man'' -- Mr. Benson's new album, now out on Concord -- should be a tip-off to its purpose as a showcase for one of jazz's most famous prodigals, who hasn't lost his touch. But he also does some singing on the album, backed by a band that includes the drummer Harvey Mason, who played on Mr. Benson's 1976 commercial breakthrough, ''Breezin.' '' As always, the guitarist mingles jazz and pop with a conviction that feels stubbornly sincere. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (800) 982-2787, the-townhall-nyc.org; $65 and $85. (Chinen)
- The Checkout: Live From 92YTriBeCa, Featuring Derrick Hodge and Aaron Parks (Wednesday) Presented jointly by 92YTriBeCa and ''The Checkout,'' an hourlong radio program on WBGO-FM, 88.3, this series typically spotlights up-and-comers in a companionable double bill. Mr. Hodge, a bassist, and Mr. Parks, a pianist, emphatically fit that description -- as former members of Terence Blanchard's band, and as young bandleader-composers pursuing a porous ideal of modern jazz. At 8 p.m., 200 Hudson Street, at Canal Street, (212) 601-1000, 92ytribeca.org; $12 in advance, $15 on day of show. (Chinen)
Claire Daly Quintet (Thursday) Claire Daly, a baritone saxophonist and flutist, wrote the music on her new album, ''Mary Joyce Project: Nothing to Lose'' (Daly Bread), in honor of her father's cousin, who in the mid-1930s was the first non-Alaskan to travel by dogsled to Fairbanks from Juneau. The music, melodic and searching, was conceived by Ms. Daly with her pianist, Steve Hudson, who rejoins her here.

On Friday and Saturday he'll be a featured guest soloist with the John Hollenbeck Large Ensemble, a texture-rich big band. On Sunday he will lead his own quintet, with a veteran partner, the bassist Dave Holland, and three serious younger players: the alto saxophonist Jon Irabagon, the pianist Craig Taborn and the drummer Rudy Royston. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30. (Chinen)
Rob Garcia 4 (Thursday) On his new album, ''The Drop and the Ocean'' (Brooklyn Jazz Underground), the drummer Rob Garcia explores a sonorous but elastic brand of acoustic postbop, with several of his brightest peers: the saxophonist Noah Preminger, the pianist Dan Tepfer and the bassist John Hebert.

At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars (Friday through Sunday) In addition to being a bebop pioneer and a dazzling trumpeter, Dizzy Gillespie -- whose birthday would have fallen during this engagement -- was one of jazz's better talent scouts. That point is hammered home by the scattered alumni in this big band, including the saxophonist Jimmy Heath, the pianist Cyrus Chestnut and the bassist John Lee; standing in for Gillespie on trumpet is Roy Hargrove. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $45 cover at tables, $25 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

- Jimmy Heath's 85th Birthday Celebration (Tuesday through Oct. 30) Mr. Heath, the bebop-honed saxophonist-composer/bandleader-educator, has been enjoying a late-career eminence, but that doesn't mean he's resting on his laurels. You may have seen him recently with the Heath Brothers, or with the now-playing Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars, or with his own big band, a version of which appears here. The band will probably sound best on the back end of the engagement, but opening night offers another incentive: it's his actual birthday, and he'll be toasted by Bill Cosby, who wrote the foreword to Mr. Heath's recent memoir, ''I Walked With Giants'' (Temple University Press).

At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $15 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Ali Jackson Trio, With Jon Faddis and Special Guests (Friday through Sunday) Ali Jackson, the versatile and spirited drummer with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, leads his flexible trio (featuring the pianist Aaron Goldberg and the bassist Omer Avital) in a tribute to bebop's wily patriarch, Dizzy Gillespie. And not only does the engagement take place at the club bearing Gillespie's name, it will feature Mr. Faddis, that trumpeter's handpicked heir and still the leading specialist in the style. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an additional 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 to $35 cover, with a minimum of $10 at tables and $5 at the bar; $15 for students at select sets. (Chinen)

Steve Kuhn Trio (Thursday through Oct. 30) Steve Kuhn, a lyrical and articulate pianist, has history with both of his accomplished rhythm-section partners here, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Billy Drummond; they can be heard on an often-overlooked album called ''Temptation,'' recorded a decade ago for the Japanese label Venus. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25. (Chinen)
- Jane Monheit (Tuesday) Once dismissed in some circles as a chanteuse manque, Ms. Monheit has evolved into an excellent interpreter of the standard songbook -- and a fine jazz singer besides, especially when applying the pristine sensuality of her voice to songs of cozy reverie.

HEADLINE: A Golfer's Final, Gutsy Move

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- As summer turned to fall, Louise Friberg felt the changes in the air. In September, she left the only job she has known, joining millions of displaced workers in experiencing the discomfort of being stripped of their self-identities and the anxiety of having to reinvent themselves.
''Change is always a little bit terrifying,'' said Friberg, a one-time winner on the L.P.G.A. Tour who retired at 31, after seven seasons as a touring pro.
Since Friberg, a native of Sweden, became a member of the L.P.G.A. Tour in 2008, its competitive schedule has been eroded by the recession, making it harder for golfers outside the top 50 to earn a living. 
Friberg (pronounced FREE-berg) does not blame the disappearance of sponsors and tournaments for her retirement, although she acknowledged it probably helped hasten it. In 2008, she came from 10 strokes back to win the MasterCard Classic in Huixquilucan, Mexico, and posted two other top-10 finishes to earn $395,051.
She made $81,536 in the next three years and played in fewer events each season -- 24 in 2008, 11 in 2011.
''For me not to get into as many tournaments, at times, it was like, now what do I do with my time?'' Friberg said. ''I'm not one to practice eight hours a day. I've never been a huge practicer. It's always been easier for me to compete. There's always that extra edge that's difficult to bring into practice.''
Friberg played her final competitive round last month, at the Navistar L.P.G.A. Classic in Prattville, Ala., the last full-field event of the year in the United States. She missed the cut, as she had in her previous 10 starts.
That week, her friends on the tour threw her a retirement party at a pizza parlor near the golf course. The party's organizer, Paige Mackenzie, a former teammate of Friberg's at the University of Washington, said, ''In my opinion, it took a lot more courage to walk away than to stay.''
She added, ''I think there's a lot of other players out there that are thinking about leaving but are maybe afraid of the uncertainty of something new.''
In recent years, the tour has had two No. 1 players, Annika Sorenstam and Lorena Ochoa, retire to start families. So with tongues firmly in cheeks, Friberg's friends gave her an early pregnancy test kit as a parting gift.
The termination of a career is a trial, regardless of the circumstances. It is no less traumatic for professional athletes, who typically are younger than their retired or pink-slipped brethren, with thinner resumes and less education. Like others between jobs, they are left to figure out which of the skills they spent decades refining are transferable to another line of work.
For blue-chip athletes or white-collar workers, ''it's a very similar transition after a career or job termination,'' said Bob Tewksbury, a sports psychologist who was drafted by the Yankees and pitched for 13 major league seasons.
''There's depression, self-doubt, sadness,'' he said. ''Even if you retired by choice, there's this whole grieving process you go through because you've lost a part of yourself. You have to figure out, Who am I? What do I do? You're stripped down of everything people recognize you as. When you go through the loneliness of trying to find out who you are, you understand why people keep playing long after they've really stopped enjoying it.''
Tewksbury said he began contemplating retirement in 1994, upon realizing how much he enjoyed life away from baseball during that season's work stoppage. He continued to pitch until after the 1998 season. ''And even then, I had a lot of friends and family say: 'You look great. You could still be playing. You could really help the team,' '' Tewksbury said. ''That opens up the wound, I think. They're being complimentary to the athlete, but they're actually making the transition harder.''
Friberg, who began playing golf when she was 9, said she considered retirement at the end of 2010. The stress of tour life was causing her to grind her teeth in her sleep, and she found she was enjoying the pro-ams more than the competitive rounds. She was persuaded by friends to play one more year to see if her feelings and fortunes changed.
''A lot of people have been invested emotionally in my game,'' Friberg said. ''Everyone tried to quote, unquote, pick me up.'' She added: ''Golf's never really felt like it's who I am. It's always been what I do. When you're playing golf and it's your livelihood, it can become hard to separate the two.''
Friberg was speaking between bites of a breakfast sandwich before sunrise on a recent weekday morning. At 8 a.m., she was due at a classroom in Scottsdale, Ariz., where she was completing work for her L.P.G.A. teaching certificate.
Despite the early hour, Friberg thrummed with enthusiasm as she talked about becoming an instructor.
''Golf will beat you down, but it will also lift you up,'' she said. ''That's why I still want to live and breathe golf. Just because I'm not passionate about one side of golf anymore doesn't mean I don't still love it. I think people question my decision because they have an idealized view of being able to play golf every day for a living.''
For Friberg, the final separation came over the summer, the moment when all of her reasons for remaining in competitive golf -- the travel and the camaraderie she shared with her friends on the tour -- fell away like booster rockets and her retirement plan was propelled forward.
She was trying to qualify for the Women's United States Open, and ''the morning of the qualifier, I was hit with a wave of this is it,'' Friberg said.
''Before I teed off, I called my mother and said, 'I just needed to tell you I can't do this anymore.' And she was like, 'All right, just go out and play and we'll talk about it later.' I didn't feel sad. It was the opposite. It's like I made this decision and it became so clear it was the right thing to do.''
In college, Friberg tended to go for broke on every shot and become upset when the outcome was not perfect. As a professional, she learned to play smart and take chances when they presented themselves, which nicely sums up her exit strategy from the game.
''It's gutsy, you know, because you get comfortable out here,'' said her friend and fellow touring pro Nicole Hage. ''This is all you've known since basically you could walk, and it's scary to think if it doesn't work out, what's after golf. We don't have impressive resumes other than golf and our educational degrees, and you don't really think about a Plan B because you're focused on succeeding in golf.''
Hage added: ''So to see what Louise is doing is pretty inspiring. I haven't heard her sound so excited about something in a long time.''
Three weeks after playing her last competitive round, Friberg said, ''I'm the type of person who always looks forward, and at this point in time, I feel like I'm moving forward really fast.''

HEADLINE: As Spain Faces a Possible Recession, Criticism of Its Central Bank Is Growing

BYLINE: By RAPHAEL MINDER

 BODY:
MADRID -- The Bank of Spain was seen as a beacon of rigor and caution at the start of the financial crisis. But now that the Spanish economy is facing the possibility of slipping back into recession, it is facing accusations of mishandling problems in the banking sector and being too slow to address the collapse in the real estate market.
Much of the recent criticism from politicians, economists and investors has been aimed directly at the central bank governor, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, for not standing up to vested political and banking interests, particularly when they kept the central bank from forcing failing banks to close.
The main opposition Popular Party has recently led the charge against the central bank, ahead of a general election on Nov. 20 that is expected to return the party to power with a parliamentary majority, according to opinion polls. 
Earlier this month, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, the Popular Party's parliamentary spokeswoman, said at a press briefing that the next government should impose ''a profound reform'' of the Bank of Spain, applying stricter ''technical criteria'' in selecting its top officials. She also said the central bank should bear responsibility for the ''unethical'' behavior of some managers of the collapsed savings banks, known as cajas.
A few days later, Spanish prosecutors started a corruption investigation into payments, including salaries, made to directors of Caja Mediterraneo, which required a bailout of 2.8 billion euros, or about $3.85 billion.
In a e-mail response to questions, the central bank stressed that its role was to supervise the solvency and not salary arrangements at a bank. Mr. Fernandez Ordonez declined to comment.
Beyond its handling of troubled banks, the Bank of Spain has recently been facing the same accusation that has dogged the Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero since the start of the crisis: that, having cheered the fact that Spanish banks kept away from subprime assets in the United States, it then underestimated the damage that could result from their property lending at home.
''The Bank of Spain misunderstood both the economic and the financial crisis,'' said Fernando Fernandez, a professor at the IE business school in Madrid and former chief economist of Banco Santander.
''They simply didn't seem to realize that a bursting of the real estate bubble here would have a very serious impact on the banking sector, even though that had been the case in the past,'' he said.
''It would be a mistake to press for his resignation,'' Mr. Fernandez said, ''because this would create additional damage to the image of the Spanish economy, despite the fact that I think he has not been a very good governor.''
Last year, when Spain's troubled public finances and saving banks first drew the ire of investors, the central bank was among the few Spanish institutions to retain the strong confidence of investors and economists.
The central bank had won plaudits for limiting the banks' reliance on risky, off-the-balance-sheet derivative transactions. It was also praised for imposing buffers against excessive lending. While the extra measures helped, they were not designed to contain the spillover from the euro-zone sovereign debt crisis, which, combined with a property bubble, left its banks exposed to potential losses of 168.8 billion euros, according to the stress tests carried out by the European Banking Authority last July.
''The credibility of the Bank of Spain, which was very high coming into the crisis, has declined significantly,'' said Luis Arenzana, a Madrid-based partner of Shelter Island Capital Management, an asset management company.
''The technocrats at the Bank of Spain are top-caliber people,'' he said. ''But the governor has been too weak, especially when dealing with politicians.''
Mr. Fernandez said the central bank should have used its mandate to intervene in cajas as soon its inspectors had unearthed major problems -- rather than delay by two years in some cases and try instead to engineer mergers that gave such cajas and their politicians more time to sink into trouble.
''Had some of the banks been liquidated then,'' he argued, ''there would not still be so much mistrust among investors about the balance sheets of all our institutions, and the ultimate cost to taxpayers would have been far less.''
The Bank of Spain said in its e-mail that using public money to take over a bank should always be the ''last resort'' for a supervisory authority. In the case of Caja Mediterraneo, it noted that until March the caja had been in merger talks with another entity. The talks collapsed but, if successful, ''would have resolved its viability problems,'' it said.
At the end of September, the central bank's governor declared the process of recapitalization of Spanish banks completed, after the 4.75 billion-euro bailout of three more cajas that had failed to meet capital requirements set last February.
The central bank has also emphasized its efforts in tripling the level of compulsory provisioning against doubtful property loans. Over all, Spanish banks have set aside 105 billion euros in provisions.
However, with a deepening euro crisis, a stagnant economy and Spain's real estate prices expected to fall further, analysts insist that Spanish banks will ultimately still need between 40 billion and 100 billion euros in additional capital.
Last year, the government and the Popular Party agreed to speed up the consolidation of the cajas in order to cut their number to about 15 from 45, under the supervision of the central bank.
As an independent institution, the central bank should have insisted, however, that ''the first thing that was needed was to get the cajas out of the hands of the politicians'' who control them, according to Juan Jose Toribio, a professor at the IESE Business School. ''The opposite was done, with the consolidation coming first and then an attempt to convert them in real banks, which is still problematic and under way.''
Mr. Toribio, who began as an economist at the Bank of Spain in the 1970s, said the bank had since become ''a much more professional entity.'' But, he added, ''the experience of the recent months shows a lack of agility.''
Meanwhile, the Popular Party's recent criticism has raised speculation that, if elected next month, it would demand that Mr. Fernandez Ordonez resign before the end of his mandate next July. ''If the new government removes the governor, I think it will be cheered by the commercial banks and spark some fear among the savings banks,'' said Mr. Arenzana, the portfolio manager.
The central bank's handing of the crisis has not reflected lack of independence or professionalism, but the bank should also be faulted for recently ''hurrying into some things,'' according to Alfonso Garcia Mora, director general of Analistas Financieros Internacionales, a financial consultancy based in Madrid.
In some cases, he said, its poor timing probably reflected a failure to take into account the broader European context, notably the bank's decision to have Spain submit the largest contingent of banks to European stress tests, even as Germany avoided putting some of its troubled banks under such scrutiny.
''Transparency is a great thing, but it isn't always helpful if it isn't adopted by others,'' he said.

Stocks closed relatively flat Thursday as investors, struggling with uncertainty surrounding the coming European summit meeting on the debt crisis, sought direction from corporate earnings.
Leading indicators sagged but then moved into positive territory after comments by French and German leaders eased market concerns. The leaders said the euro zone needed a new operating method for the rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, and scheduled a series of meetings over the next few days to try to reach a consensus.
Investors are hoping European Union leaders will move toward a solution as early as this weekend, a crucial factor for stocks to break out of their trading range. 
''It's a Ping-Pong game -- people have been burned by reacting to individual news stories only to have them refuted, withdrawn or contradicted,'' said Stephen Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco.
''Next week we will get something more definitive but at this point, to react to these individual whispers and news stories has been a fool's game,'' Mr. Massocca said.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 37.16 points, or 0.32 percent, to 11,541.78. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.51 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,215.39. The Nasdaq composite slipped 5.42 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,598.62.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 8/32, to 99 15/32. The yield rose to 2.19 percent, from 2.16 percent late Wednesday.
The S.& P. 500 has struggled after reaching the top end of a two-month trading range at the 1,230-1,250 level, and progress on Europe's debt woes is critical to breaking out of that range.
Investors are also closely watching the developing earnings season. According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 109 companies in the S.& P. 500 that have reported earnings, 70 percent have topped analyst expectations.
''The focus is starting to be more domestic. Here and there are some questions about the directions of earnings,'' said Mr. Massocca.
Ingersoll Rand posted lower quarterly earnings, and its fourth-quarter profit forecast fell short of some Wall Street estimates, because of depressed housing and consumer markets.
Polycom, the videoconferencing company, plunged 25 percent to $16.33 and weighed on the Nasdaq after quarterly revenue fell well below market expectations. The company said its sales to large companies slowed, and it forecast weak fourth-quarter revenue.
On the economic data front, factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region rebounded in October and the number of Americans claiming new jobless benefits fell last week, but other data showed a drop in sales of previously owned homes last month and only a small rise in a gauge of future growth.
''The numbers we have seen today provide some hints that the domestic economy is doing a little bit better, even with the challenges that are unfolding in Europe,'' said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Commonfund in Wilton, Conn.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 6,000, to 403,000, last week, the Labor Department said. A four-week average, which smoothes out weekly volatility to give a better view of trends, hit its lowest level since April.
Initial claims dropped 25,000 between the September and October survey periods, suggesting a step-up in nonfarm employment after payrolls increased 103,000 last month.
After spiking in mid-September, jobless claims appear to have settled near the 400,000 mark that is usually associated with some improvement in the jobs market.
Separately, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's business activity index rebounded to 8.7 in October, the highest reading in six months, from minus 17.5 in September.
A reading above zero indicates factory activity is expanding in the region, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
Sales of existing homes dropped 3 percent to an annual rate of 4.91 million units in September, the National Association of Realtors said.
In another report, the Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators edged up 0.2 percent in September, pointing to continued sluggish growth. Still, it warned that the economy faced a 50 percent chance of recession whereas a month ago it said recession risks were lower than that.
The recent stream of data, including figures on retail sales and trade, suggests that output sped up in the third quarter.
Analysts estimate that gross domestic product grew at an annual pace of 2.3 percent to 2.7 percent, a sharp step up from the second quarter's tepid 1.3 percent rate.

HEADLINE: Another Can't-Miss General Manager Is Hired

BYLINE: By DAN McGRATH. 
dmcgrath@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Dan McGrath writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
Tom Ricketts has often walked a fine line between clueless and indecisive during his two years in charge of the Cubs, but the Theo Epstein hire is being hailed as a bold and imaginative move, a case of the chairman identifying the best man for a big job and doing whatever it took to land him.
Start with the salary -- $4 million a year for a general manager is unprecedented, but it's less than the Cubs paid John Grabow this season. A three-innings-a-week middle reliever is more valuable than an architect hired to renovate and run an entire franchise? Baseball's economics have always been quirky. 
Epstein's grasp of those economics is open to debate. Some Bostonians, perhaps miffed over losing him, insist he inherited a loaded team and the resources to maintain it at a high level -- there was no other way to compete in the same division as the Yankees. And Epstein, they note, wasn't always a smart shopper, spending way too much for John Lackey and Carl Crawford.
Wait, didn't he deliver two World Series titles to a cursed, luckless franchise that had been 86 years without one? Old news -- Wednesday was the third anniversary of the Red Sox' last playoff victory. And why wasn't something done about a frat-boy clubhouse atmosphere that wasn't an issue until the team imploded during a 7-20 September?
None of that carping mattered to the Cubs. They saw how Epstein built consistently good teams around homegrown talent, with enough leftover prospects to deal for top-tier additions like Josh Beckett and Adrian Gonzales. They saw his new-age, numbers-driven smarts meshing with an old-school scout's appreciation for intangibles and decided he was the man to tackle that 103-year thing. Excellent choice.
But amid the chorus of hosannas, a note of caution: We've been down this road with saviors before.
Remember Andy MacPhail? A baseball blue-blood as a third-generation general manager, he won two World Series titles with the small-market Minnesota Twins before he turned 40. Like Epstein, MacPhail was regarded as baseball's brightest young thinker when the Cubs hired him in 1994. Imagine what he'd do with the imposing resources of mighty Tribune Company at his disposal.
Not much, as it turned out. Two playoff appearances in 13 seasons. A 6-9 record in three postseason series. His cleverest critics snidely dismissed him as ''MacFail'' well before he departed under a quit-or-be-fired ultimatum in 2006.
Dusty Baker? He was the Cubs' first dugout superstar since Leo Durocher, arriving with three Manager of the Year citations on his resume, along with a World Series appearance and three division titles. What a coup for MacPhail and Jim Hendry to lure Baker here from San Francisco in 2003. It looked even better when he guided the Cubs to a 21-game improvement and a surprise division title in his first season.
But the unraveling that began in Game 6 of the 2003 National League Championship Series never stopped. Baker was fired in 2006 after back-to-back fifth-place finishes, Chicago turning against his toothpicks and his wristbands with a disdain usually reserved for reform-minded politicians or Green Bay Packers.
Lou Piniella? Now here was a manager, battle-hardened by 14 years in the Yankee pressure cooker. A World Series title in Cincinnati, and three division winners in Seattle, one coming after a record 116-win regular season that followed Alex Rodriguez's defection to Texas. Now here was a manager -- division titles in his first two seasons with the Cubs, the second achieved with the best record in baseball.
But Piniella's Cubs were 0-for-October, and he saw things getting no better after the Dodgers' first-round playoff sweep in 2008. Piniella's lack of interest was so obvious and so alarming that no one objected when he decided to head home to Tampa with six weeks remaining in the 2010 season. Some of his players offered to help him pack.
You're up, Theo.
What Ricketts wants is a complete organizational overhaul, not a quick fix. Isn't it about time? The Cubs have lacked an identity for the better part of their 103-year title drought -- why have they failed to produce a left-handed, middle-of-the-order bopper since Billy Williams left in 1975? Why don't they grasp the game-altering vagaries of Wrigley Field any better than an average fan mulling whether to grab a jacket as he's leaving for the park?
If Epstein hasn't done so already, he will assemble a cadre of young baseball scientists to design a team that can swing for the street when the wind is blowing out, or manufacture small-ball runs when it's blowing in. This team will catch the ball and throw it to the right base in support of a high-strikeout, low-walk pitching staff that also gets ground-ball outs. If there's a statue of Ferguson Jenkins in the works, it should go inside the park to remind Cubs pitchers how it's done.
This isn't going to happen overnight -- the 91-loss team Epstein inherits has one star-quality player and isn't close to the playoff-ready Red Sox squad that reached Game 7 of the A.L.C.S. in 2003, his first year as its general manager.
Patience is back in vogue at Wrigley Field, marketed as a nice complement to beer and sunshine.

HEADLINE: For These Men, Basketball Means Hope

BYLINE: By ANDY WEBSTER

 BODY:
It's impossible not to be moved watching Anne Buford's ''Elevate,'' a documentary about Senegalese basketball players given a chance to play and receive an education in the United States. 
Their journey begins in Dakar, at the Seeds Academy (it stands for Sports for Education and Economic Development in Senegal), a boarding school where top West African players can receive full scholarships to American prep schools. The film follows four: Assane, who attends South Kent School in Connecticut; Aziz, who goes to the Lake Forest Academy in Illinois and sustains a knee injury in an early game; Byago, who is initially rejected for a visa but winds up at the College of Southern Idaho; and Dethie, also at South Kent, who aspires to be a doctor but struggles with his SATs.
We see these young men struggle with assimilation -- mastering English and learning to drive, meeting girls, facing a headmaster hell-bent on sending one to Princeton -- and feel their joy on trips home. And we exult when they graduate.
But no one is more inspiring than Amadou Gallo Fall, a Senegalese man who, early in life, was discovered by a Peace Corps worker and granted a Stateside basketball scholarship. Mr. Fall, a former scout for the Dallas Mavericks, founded the Seeds Academy to nurture his countrymen. His conviction, level gaze and firm eloquence instill pride, drive and determination in his players. Mr. Fall, a coach on the court and in life, is the real champion here.
ELEVATE
Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.
Directed by Anne Buford; edited by Richard Hankin; music by Shawn Lee; produced by Ms. Buford, Chiemi Karasawa, Mark Becker and Victoria Yoffie; released by Variance Films. At the AMC Empire 25, 234 West 42nd Street, Manhattan. In English, Wolof and French, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 21 minutes. This film is not rated.

HEADLINE: Chinese Trade Case Has Clear Targets, Not Obvious Goals

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG
LIKE Detroit automakers taking on the Japanese a generation ago, the seven American solar panel makers that filed a trade case on Wednesday against China might find that a legal victory, if it comes, may not translate into business success.
In the 1970s and '80s, American car companies won a long series of trade cases to limit Japanese car imports. Japan's automakers responded by moving assembly lines to the United States, creating many new blue-collar jobs. But they kept most of the high-paying design and engineering positions back in Japan. The new factories in the United States not only shielded Japanese auto companies against most further trade protectionism but helped them stay competitive when the yen soared against the dollar.
Meanwhile, American consumers had many new, affordable choices in cars -- while Detroit continued to have trouble competing with its Japanese rivals.
Don't be surprised if Chinese solar companies try to pursue a similar path, which could benefit American consumers of solar power if it helps propel the technology beyond its current niche status. 
Chinese solar panel makers have already begun moving operations to the United States to avoid trade restrictions. With the new case, filed at the Commerce Department, some industry executives expect the Chinese industry to increase its American expansion. That could help the Chinese companies avoid import restrictions and insulate them from currency fluctuations as China allows the renminbi to appreciate gradually against the dollar.
The trade complaint, which accuses the Chinese industry of receiving unfair government subsidies and dumping its products in the United States at below cost, ''will only accelerate the setting up of solar module and solar cell manufacturing in the United States,'' said Ocean Yuan. Mr. Yuan is the president of Grape Solar, a company based in Eugene, Ore., that is a big importer of solar panels from China, Korea and Taiwan. Grape Solar has already been in discussions with big Chinese panel makers on ways to move more manufacturing to the United States.
Meanwhile, Suntech Power of Wuxi, China, the world's largest manufacturer of blue solar panels -- the most commonly used type -- has already moved some simple assembly tasks to the United States. Other big Chinese manufacturers like Yingli Green Energy and Trina are considering similar moves. A partial shift of Chinese production could help create some new and mostly blue-collar American jobs. But a broader move into the United States could turn Chinese solar panel manufacturers into even fiercer competitors with their American counterparts.
The steep tariffs sought in the trade complaint could also cause China to retaliate. The country might, for example, shift more of its hefty annual purchases of solar panel manufacturing equipment to German suppliers instead of American ones. ''It would be a travesty for the solar industry,'' said Tom Zarrella, a former chief executive of GT Solar, a New Hampshire supplier of the manufacturing equipment.
American companies like GT Solar ship a total of about $1 billion worth of products a year to China, while other American firms ship an additional $1 billion a year in raw materials to the Chinese solar companies. In the first eight months of the year, Chinese panel makers shipped $1.6 billion of products to the United States.
China's commerce ministry still had no comment on the trade litigation on Thursday, and the state-controlled Chinese news media were still ignoring the case -- signs that Chinese officials were struggling to draft a response.
The current betting by trade experts is that the American solar panel industry will win its case, which could lead to tariffs early in 2012, even if the proceedings take a year or so to play out. That is because the United States still classifies China as a nonmarket economy, which sets off special rules for the evaluation of antidumping and antisubsidy cases that heavily favor American companies. American companies have won almost all the antidumping and antisubsidy cases they have filed against Chinese companies for the last 20 years. The solar industry has clear differences from the auto industry, of course. The American solar power market totaled only $6 billion last year, with the industry employing no more than 100,000 people and possibly considerably fewer, depending on whose estimates one believes. In contrast, the United States' auto industry in the '70s had revenue in the hundreds of billions and employed more than a million people.
But while the solar industry is in its relative infancy -- solar power now contributes about one-tenth of 1 percent of the United States' electricity -- it is growing fast. The new solar wattage installed in the United States has been growing 74 percent a year since 2008, according to GTM Research, a renewable energy market analysis firm in Boston. Companies that develop solar power projects in the United States would not welcome paying tariffs on panels that might exceed 100 percent of the wholesale price.
Victory in the case could still buy the American industry time to reduce costs and improve their efficiency. That may be why shares of the biggest Chinese solar power companies, which trade in New York, fell 5 to 9 percent after the trade case was announced on Wednesday.
But setting up solar panel factories is faster and simpler than building a car assembly plant, which could allow Chinese solar power manufacturers to respond quickly.
To avoid punitive tariffs, Chinese companies would need to make solar cells in the United States and then assemble them into panels -- steps that together represent only about half the cost of a solar panel. The other half of the cost consists of a series of initial steps that result in the production of a polysilicon wafer, which the Chinese industry would probably continue to find cheaper to do in China.
Mr. Yuan said that once the necessary construction permits were obtained, it took only three to six months to build a factory that did the final step of assembling solar cells into solar panels. It takes six months to a year to build a highly automated factory to make solar cells from solar wafers.
Many American cities have already been seeking Chinese solar power factory investments, which could speed the permit approval process. Chinese state-owned banks have extended nearly $41 billion in loans and lines of credit to the country's solar panel manufacturers, according to the trade case against them. Investing even a small part of that money in factories in the United States would sharply increase capacity.
Suntech moved production of the last step in the manufacturing process from China to Goodyear, Ariz., last year. About 100 mostly blue-collar workers in Goodyear assemble panels that each have five or six dozen solar cells that were shipped in from China. The workers then add a glass cover, bolt on an aluminum frame, attach a junction box and package it for shipping.
This process has already enabled Suntech to label the solar panels as ''made in U.S.A.'' As a result, they now qualify for federal ''Buy American'' subsidies.

HEADLINE: Medallions To Run Cabs Hit $1 Million

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
10:35 p.m. Updated Two New York taxi medallions - aluminum plates that grant the right to operate a yellow cab - changed hands this week for $1 million apiece, the highest recorded sale since the city's modern livery system began.
The sale was the culmination of decades of astonishing growth for the humble medallion, which is nailed to the hood of every yellow cab in the city. When New York issued its first batch of medallions in 1937, the going price was $10 even, or $157.50 in today's dollars. 
Some perspective: The Dow Jones industrial average has risen 1,100 percent in the last 30 years. In the same period, the value of a taxi medallion is up 1,900 percent. That return beats gold, oil and the American house.
Sky-high prices and million-dollar deals seem a far cry from the medallion's early days; when World War II came around and demand for taxis dropped, many drivers simply returned their medallions to the city to avoid the annual $10 renewal fee.
''It's a lot of money, and it is an investment that someone would not make without being confident in the industry and the future of the city,'' said David S. Yassky, chairman of the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission.
The million-dollar sale was hatched earlier this year, when a taxi financing specialist, Nat Goldbetter, received a visit from an old acquaintance looking to sell two medallions bought for $80,000 apiece in the 1980s. There was an offer that valued each medallion at $975,000, but the seller was hoping for more.
With many owners reluctant to sell these days, hoping for the value to keep rising, Mr. Goldbetter figured he could find a willing buyer. The papers were signed on Wednesday morning.
''Nobody ever thought the medallion would get to this point,'' Mr. Goldbetter said from his office in Long Island City, Queens, a few hours after the papers were signed. ''It was pretty cool. It broke up the boredom of my work.''
Mr. Goldbetter, a youthful looking 67, grew up on the Lower East Side and got into the taxi business in the 1960s as a driver. He bought his own medallion in 1969 for $25,000, but sold it a few years later. ''I could have made a zillion dollars, but I did O.K.,'' he said.
Mr. Goldbetter was also no stranger to the historic: in 1985, he handled the sale of the first $100,000 medallion, a feat that earned a front-page article in The New York Times.
''It's kind of history repeating itself, only multiplied by 10,'' he said.
There are 13,237 medallions in the city; new ones, when issued, are sold at auction. But the medallion pool is rarely expanded, creating a scarcity that helps keep values high. (Many owners have objected to a city proposal that would allow livery cabs to pick up street hails outside busy parts of Manhattan, saying such a plan would lower the value of their medallions.)
Large fleets, which can control hundreds of medallions, often find it easy to secure financing to meet the high prices. Medallion sales can make for big business: the biggest lender, Medallion Financial, is a publicly traded company (ticker symbol: TAXI) and shares its skyscraper on Madison Avenue with the Rockefeller Family Fund.
Corporate medallions, like the two sold on Wednesday, do not need to be driven by their owners and can be leased out 24 hours a day. Individual medallions, which make up about 40 percent of the fleet and must be occasionally driven by the owner, are worth slightly less: the latest sale was for about $700,000.
The secondary market in medallions and its private transfers began after World War II, at the starting price of $2,500. The value quickly grew, crossing the $50,000 mark in the mid-1970s. But the steepest period of growth has been over the past decade, when the value of corporate medallions nearly quadrupled.
So are we entering the tulip era of the taxicab? Could a million-dollar sale signal the beginning of the end of the great yellow cab bubble?
''No one is very good at forecasting the economic future right now, but I would say no,'' said Graham Hodges, a professor at Colgate University who has written a history of the taxi industry. He said the investment in a medallion was comparable to buying an apartment in Manhattan.
''It will always make good money and pay for itself,'' Dr. Hodges said. ''There are certain things that are just gilt-edged assets, and this is one of them.''
As for the first $100,000 medallion, it was sold to a young immigrant from Hong Kong, Stanley Cheung. In 1985, he told The Times that he heard medallion values were on the rise, and if the price kept going up, he might sell. ''There are things better than driving a cab,'' he said at the time.
Mr. Cheung did indeed sell his medallion: in 1987, for $125,000. After paying the expenses for his cab, Mr. Cheung came out about even, according to his wife, Shirley Cheung, who was reached on Wednesday at the couple's house in Little Neck, Queens.
''One million? Oh my God!'' Ms. Cheung said, when informed about the recent sale. ''I don't want to hear about it. I have to sleep tonight.''
Ms. Cheung laughed and said that she was well aware that medallion values had skyrocketed in recent years. Her husband, she said, looks at the prices every once in a while, but she tells him not to share. ''It's O.K.,'' she said of the high value. ''I just don't want to hear about it.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 625-8369, dnadance.org; $17; $14 students and 65+; $12 for advance tickets. (Sulcas) 
Merce Cunningham Dance Company Repertory Understudy Group (Friday) Like the senior Cunningham company, this junior troupe will disband at the end of the year, and this is one of the last chances to see it. The program includes two pieces from the '60s: ''Winterbranch'' (1964) and ''Scramble'' (1967). At noon, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; free. (Jack Anderson)
Dancing Through the Light: An Autumn Celebration (Saturday and Sunday) A walking tour through the historic and beautiful Green-Wood Cemetery, presented by the Green-Wood Historic Fund and Dance Parade, includes dances of many countries performed among the trees, lakes and carriage paths. Visitors must arrive 30 minutes before each performance. At noon and 4 p.m., Green-Wood Cemetery, Fifth Avenue and 25th Street, Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn, (718) 210-3080, green-wood.com/toursevents; $15. (Anderson)
- Colin Dunne (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Dunne had international fame as an Irish step dancer and the lead in ''Riverdance'' during the late 1990s. Since then he has reinvented himself as a choreographer working in a contemporary setting, and his new ''Out of Time'' pays homage to his dance past while attempting to move into new artistic terrain. Can a traditional form find a contemporary context? It's a question that bedevils all dance governed by specific, historically shaped techniques (ballet and flamenco among them). Perhaps Mr. Dunne will make it happen. At 8 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, bacnyc.org; $25. (Sulcas)
- Eiko & Koma (Friday and Saturday, and Monday through Thursday, through Oct. 30) The Japanese artists Eiko and Koma have lived and performed in the United States for more than 40 years, and they are celebrating those decades with the Retrospective Project, which has taken performances and exhibitions all over the country since 2009. ''Residue,'' an installation and collection at the New York Library for the Performing Arts, offers videos of their performances, costumes, sets and materials, as well as a tea-house structure made from canvas, feathers, sweet rice and sea salt -- elements used in the brilliant ''Naked,'' performed this year at the Baryshnikov Arts Center. If you have never seen the strange, fascinating work of Eiko & Koma, in which life moves both glacially and with the urgent power of nature, the exhibition offers a glimpse of their magic. If you are already a fan, you'll be happily reminded why. Friday, Saturday, Tuesday and Wednesday from noon to 6 p.m. and Monday and Thursday from noon to 8 p.m., New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, 111 Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (917) 275-6975, nypl.org/lpa; free. (Sulcas)
- Suzanne Farrell Ballet (Friday through Sunday) For all those suffering from New York City Ballet withdrawal, there's a fresh influx of mouth-watering Balanchine works from this company, led by the great ballerina Suzanne Farrell and often cited as an exemplary avatar of Balanchinian choreography and style. This program features a rarity, Balanchine's 1947 ''Haieff Divertimento,'' as well as ''Meditation'' (a pas de deux created in 1963 for Ms. Farrell and Jacques d'Amboise); the pas de deux from the ''Diamonds'' section of ''Jewels''; and the magnificent ''Agon.'' Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $75. (Sulcas)
- Forsythe Company (Wednesday and Thursday, through Oct. 29) An always unpredictable and often controversial choreographer, William Forsythe offers the New York premiere of ''I don't believe in outer space,'' a sometimes comic and other times tragic dance-theater exploration of states of absence, in which 18 dancers mingle in deliberately outlandish scenes. Part of the Next Wave Festival. At 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $70. (Anderson)
James Martin Music/Dance (Friday and Saturday) ''The Enchanted Piano'' features dances to unusual piano music by four innovative composers: Henry Cowell, George Crumb, Mario Davidovsky and Maurice Wright. At 8 p.m., Manhattan Movement & Arts Center, 248 West 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 787-1178, manhattanmovement.com, jamesmartindance.org; $20, or $15 for students and 65+. (Anderson)
Morphoses (Tuesday through Thursday, through Oct. 30) This dauntless company, now directed by Lourdes Lopez, offers the premiere of Luca Veggetti's ''Bacchae,'' based on Euripides' fifth-century B.C. tragedy about the conflict between rational and irrational powers, still topical today. Thursday's performance will especially bring Euripides into the 21st century because the dance will be streamed to Zaitzeff, a bistro at 18 Avenue B, East Village, and the Casita Maria Center for Arts and Education, 928 Simpson Street, the Bronx. Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $59. (Anderson)
Anna Sperber (Thursday through Oct. 29) In ''Foreverandaday,'' movement, light and texture unite to heighten an awareness of sensation. At 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $15, or $12 for students or 65+. (Anderson)
- Wave Rising (Friday through Sunday and Thursday, through Nov. 6) Young Soon Kim, the indomitably energetic artistic director of the White Wave arts center in Brooklyn, founded the Wave Rising Series in 2006 as a way to offer a stage to emerging groups and individuals. The tightly packed programs can feel a little bewildering, but there are gems to discover there, including little-seen ensembles from other parts of the world. Performers this weekend include Lenora Lee, Tomomi Imai, Patricia Noworol Dance and Jennifer Archibald/Arch Dance (Friday through Sunday); and the Danielle Russo Dance Company, Nellie Rainwater, Claudia Anata Hubiak and, from Israel, Rachel Erdos (Saturday and Sunday). And there is much, much more: 24 companies over the three-week run of the series. At 7:30 p.m., John Ryan Theater at White Wave, 25 Jay Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 855-8822, whitewavedance.com; $20, with series packages available. (Sulcas)

HEADLINE: Number Crunching at the Apocalypse

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
There have been reports of hurt feelings among the bankers and brokers who have been the focus of public ire and Occupy Wall Street protests. And it is true that those poor, hard-working souls have been demonized and caricatured. Surely the much-reviled 1 percent does not consist of plutocrats in top hats or predators in blue suits, but of human beings just like the other 99 percent of us, albeit with more money and perhaps more to answer for.
That, in a way, is the message of J. C. Chandor's ''Margin Call,'' which does a great deal to humanize the authors -- and beneficiaries -- of the 2008 financial crisis. But the film, relentless in its honesty and shrewd in its insights and techniques, is unlikely to soothe the wounded pride of the actual or aspiring ruling class. It is a tale of greed, vanity, myopia and expediency that is all the more damning for its refusal to moralize. 
There are no hissable villains here, no operatic speeches condemning or celebrating greed. Just a bunch of guys (and one woman, Demi Moore) in well-tailored clothes and a state of quiet panic trying to save themselves from a global catastrophe of their own making. Watching them going about their business, you don't feel the kind of fury inspired by ''Inside Job,'' Charles Ferguson's great muckraking documentary on the origins of the financial crisis, but rather a mix of dread, disgust, pity and confusion.
And also, above all, admiration for an extraordinary feat of filmmaking. It is hard to believe that ''Margin Call'' is Mr. Chandor's first feature. His formal command -- his ability to imply far more than he shows or says and to orchestrate a large, complex drama out of whispers, glances and snippets of jargon -- is downright awe inspiring. The movie rarely leaves the Manhattan offices of the fictional investment bank (loosely modeled on Lehman Brothers) in which it takes place and limits its action, which consists mainly of phone calls and hurried meetings, to a frenzied 24-hour period. Within that narrow frame the gears of a complex narrative mesh with ravishing clockwork precision.
''Margin Call'' is a thriller, moving through ambient shadows to the anxious tempo of Nathan Larson's hushed, anxious score. It is also a horror movie, with disaster lurking like an unseen demon outside the skyscraper windows and behind the computer screens. It is also a workplace comedy of sorts. The crackling, syncopated dialogue and the plot, full of reversals and double crosses, owe an obvious debt to David Mamet's profane fables of deal-making machismo. Hovering over all of it is the dark romance of capital: the elegance of numbers; the kinkiness of money; the deep, rotten, erotic allure of power.
If no one in this world is patently evil, no one is innocent either. A young risk analyst named Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) may be as close as the movie comes to a hero, but it is also possible to see what happens to him as a parable of how the system corrupts and exploits its most decent and honest minions. Working late one night Peter (who we later learn has a Ph.D. in physics) glimpses a sign of the apocalypse lurking in a mathematical model. Recent volatility in the market is threatening the stability of the mortgage-based securities that have been generating most of the company's profits, and the resulting losses are likely to swallow this bank and make trillions of dollars vanish into thin air.
Which pretty much happened of course. The task Mr. Chandor sets himself is not to explain, once again, what occurred in 2008 -- though a comparison with the journalistic records suggests that ''Margin Call'' is broadly accurate -- but rather to explore the psychological pressures and ethical choices at work among those who caught an early glimpse of the abyss and then helped push everyone else into it.
Peter alerts his callow co-worker Seth Bregman (Penn Badgley) and their immediate superior, Will Emerson, a cynical soldier played by Paul Bettany. In a gangster movie Will would be the midlevel enforcer, entrusted with the dirty work but denied real authority. His superior is Sam Rogers, played by a splendidly world-weary Kevin Spacey. Sam oversees the sales force that has been peddling the bad securities, and he must now carry the bad news upstairs, through several more layers of company hierarchy.
There is a tense showdown with Sarah Robertson (Ms. Moore), who seems to have promoted the scheme that is now unraveling and who may have ignored warnings about its outcome. Eventually word of what Peter has learned reaches John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), the charming, dapper, black-hearted boss of bosses, who arrives by helicopter in the dead of night, like a vampire summoned from the crypt.
One of the running jokes of Mr. Chandor's script is that the higher a person's rank, the less he is likely to understand what the firm is actually doing. This ignorance is almost a point of pride. ''I don't get any of this stuff'' -- this line is repeated about Peter's discovery by Will, then Sam, then Sam's boss, Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) and then Tuld. In a further absurdity, one person who does get it, Peter's mentor, Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci) has just been downsized out of the company. As a security measure his cellphone has been disconnected, which means that his increasingly desperate former colleagues are unable to find him when he might be of most use.
Not that anything can really be done. The most chilling and most believable aspect of ''Margin Call'' is how calmly and swiftly its drama of damage control unfolds. A scapegoat must be found, and a survival plan worked out. The consequences are acknowledged -- those we are living with now -- and then coldly accepted in the name of a vaporous greater good. ''We have no choice.'' ''There is no choice.'' ''It's not like we have a choice.'' These phrases are uttered again and again, by people who truly believe what they are saying. Some of them may have sleepless nights ahead, but none are likely to suffer very terribly. The accomplishment of this movie is that it allows you to sympathize with them, to acknowledge the reality of their predicament, without letting them off the hook or forgetting the damage they did.
''Margin Call'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Obscene language and obscene sums of money.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption last Friday with a film review of ''Margin Call'' carried an erroneous credit. The picture, showing the actors Penn Badgley, Zachary Quinto and Paul Bettany, was by JoJo Whilden/Roadside Attractions, not by Walter Thomson/Roadside Attractions. (Mr. Thomson took the other photographs that accompanied the review.)

HEADLINE: Two Major Hospital Groups In City Explore a Partnership

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Two of New York City's major hospital organizations are exploring a partnership that would give them a large share of the city's patients and make them a formidable rival for other city hospitals in tough economic times.
A partnership between the institutions, Continuum Health Partners and NYU Langone Medical Center, could alter the balance of power in New York City health care for a generation. It could also complicate efforts to control health care costs: with reduced competition, the hospitals would gain clout in negotiating rates with insurance companies, potentially driving up costs for employers and employees across the region. 
Executives at both organizations confirmed the partnership discussions on Thursday, while saying that they were still preliminary and that the details of how such a relationship would be structured -- whether it would be a merger or short of that -- remained to be worked out.
''This is an opportunity from our perspective,'' Stanley Brezenoff, chief executive of Continuum, said. ''There is sort of a shared view of the potential that this kind of strategic alliance or collaboration could have.''
Continuum runs Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, an East Side competitor of NYU Langone; St. Luke's and Roosevelt Hospitals and the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary in Manhattan; and a branch of Beth Israel in Brooklyn.
The proposed partnership reflects a larger trend in the industry to create bigger entities -- often comprising hospitals, physician practices and community health care centers -- in anticipation of changes in state and federal health care policy. Under the new policies the networks will be paid by the government for meeting certain standards of performance, like reducing readmissions and keeping costs down.
''There is a large-scale movement in anticipation of health care reform, where size becomes more and more important,'' said Mukesh Gangwal, managing director of Huron Healthcare, a hospital consulting firm.
Manhattan hospitals have been slowly consolidating for years, with New York-Presbyterian and Continuum becoming prominent.
More recently, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health Systemtook over Lenox Hill Hospital on the Upper East Side and was chosen to run a scaled-down version of St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan in Greenwich Village, which went bankrupt and closed last year. Some St. Vincent's doctors said one reason the hospital failed was that it did not have the leverage of the chain hospitals to negotiate higher payments from insurers.
Advocates for patients reacted warily to the new proposal.
Nisha Agarwal, director of the health justice program for New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, a nonprofit civil-rights law firm, said Thursday that she would worry about Continuum's becoming more like NYU.
''NYU is virtually inaccessible to low-income and uninsured patients,'' Ms. Agarwal said. ''If that is the direction the new behemoth goes, it would be very bad for consumers.''
Many NYU doctors care for poor patients at nearby Bellevue Hospital Center, which is part of the city's public hospital system and which has a contract with NYU.
Mark Wagar, president of Empire BlueCross BlueShield, said he did not think a partnership would be bad for the insurance industry or consumers. ''I doubt very seriously and it would be a big mistake to make a merger to negotiate for more money, because it's a zero-sum game,'' Mr. Wagar said.
The State Health Department is aware of the talks, but will not get involved until there are more details that could require state approval, said Jeffrey Gordon, a department spokesman.
Mr. Brezenoff said Continuum was in the black and would bring its market share to the table: it has 26 percent of all inpatients discharged by Manhattan hospitals. NYU has a smaller share, executives said, although they could not provide an exact figure, but it draws from a wider geographic area, including some foreign patients. Continuum has an operating budget of about $2.5 billion, and NYU of about $2.7 billion.
''We're doing gangbusters at Beth Israel,'' in part because it has absorbed patients from the closing of St. Vincent's, Mr. Brezenoff said. ''We think exploring a partnership makes sense for us at this moment of strength.''
Anthony Shorris, chief of staff, vice dean and senior vice president of NYU Langone Medical Center, said there would be ''a lot of complementarity'' in an alliance of the hospital groups.
''One of the things everyone realizes is we're going to have to rationalize the delivery of health care in the country and everywhere else,'' Mr. Shorris said.
Continuum's hospitals provide much basic care, including obstetrics and emergency care, Mr. Brezenoff said. NYU, with its medical school and research as well as Tisch Hospital, the Hospital for Joint Diseases and the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, has strong programs in high-level medicine like transplants and microsurgery.
Mr. Brezenoff agreed that federal and state policy changes played a role. ''We have a fair amount of government-paid patients; Medicaid is in everybody's cross hairs in New York State,'' he said. ''There are provisions already in legislation that go to reshaping the models of health care delivery.''

HEADLINE: Times Co. Reports a Profit, Aided by Digital Subscribers

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The New York Times Company continued to attract paying subscribers to its flagship Web site in the third quarter, bolstering a new revenue stream that has helped offset a decline in advertising revenue.
The company, which reported its earnings for July through September on Thursday, posted a profit of $15.7 million, compared with a loss of $4.3 million during the third quarter last year. That translated to earnings of 10 cents a diluted share versus a loss of 3 cents a share a year ago.
Costs decreased during the quarter, falling 3.6 percent to $504.2 million. Circulation revenue grew by 3.4 percent to $237 million. 
Total advertising revenue, meanwhile, slipped 8.8 percent, to $262 million, as national and classified advertising and the company's About.com group proved particularly weak. Revenue in every advertising category was down, a sign of the challenges the industry faces in a stagnant economy.
And in a further sign of the financial uncertainty newspapers are facing, overall digital revenue, which has typically posted double-digit growth, fell 4.5 percent, to $74.8 million. That decline, in part, is because of weakness at About, which once was an engine of growth at the company but is now suffering from a change in the way Google directs traffic to informational sites.
Digital revenue at Times Company newspapers increased, but at a rate of only 6.2 percent to $50.3 million.
The company said it did not see any reason to be concerned about the overall strength of its digital advertising business in those numbers, calling it a lull that it hoped to reverse once the economy picked up.
''As the economy has gotten more squirrely, advertisers are pulling back a little bit,'' said Martin A. Nisenholtz, senior vice president for digital operations at the Times Company. ''We don't think there's anything fundamental about that. It's just simply a question of some of the very significant economic issues that have faced us.''
The company benefited from a $65.3 million pretax gain from the sale of part of its stake in the Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Boston Red Sox. It also recorded a $46.4 million charge related to a repayment of the $250 million it borrowed from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu. The repayment in August came three and a half years before it was due.
Operating profit for the quarter was $33 million, compared with $9 million a year ago. Excluding special items, operating profit grew 5.5 percent, to $65.5 million.
In the most closely watched metric of The Times's well being -- its new online subscription business -- the company reported continued growth. The Times now has 324,000 paid subscribers to the various digital editions of the paper, including e-readers and its Web site, compared with 281,000 at the end of the second quarter. Those figures do not include the 100,000 users who receive access to NYTimes.com free through a sponsorship by the Ford Motor Company.
One key question about the success of The Times's digital strategy -- whether subscribers would renew at full price once their low introductory rates expired -- was answered in part on Thursday. Janet L. Robinson, president and chief executive of the Times Company, said during a conference call with analysts that the company was seeing encouraging signs.
''The large majority of these subscribers have now advanced to paying full rates to access the Times's digital content,'' she said, though she declined to offer a percentage. ''If our experience with print subscribers is any indication, now that these subscribers have converted to full payment, it is highly likely that they will become loyal users.''
The Times said that about 800,000 home delivery customers had linked their accounts to NYTimes.com and now received access free. New orders for print subscriptions continued to increase, the company said, a rise it attributed to the free Web access that accompanies the subscriptions.
Despite charging for online access -- a move many media analysts thought would choke off Web traffic -- NYTimes.com remained the most-visited newspaper site in the world.
Online Correction: October 20, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said print subscriptions rose in the quarter. New print subscription orders and subscriber retentions rose, as did circulation revenue.
