HEADLINE: Report on Energy Impasse, With Some Improbable Views

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
In an attempt to break a deadlock on energy policy, a diverse group of environmentalists, academics and former government officials will publish a report on Wednesday that presents strategies for making the country cleaner, more competitive and less vulnerable to energy shocks.
 The strategies, intended to be the basis for action by Congress, include policies that are generally anathema to at least some of the constituencies represented by members of the group.
 It says the government should force increases in efficiency in cars and electrical equipment, stimulate global oil production, regulate greenhouse gas emissions with a trading system, rapidly expand a new method of burning coal and explore a revival of nuclear power.
 The $5 million, two-year private study, titled ''Ending the Energy Stalemate,'' is intended to be a package-deal blueprint, akin to a Ford Foundation report 30 years ago that first suggested vehicle mileage standards and a national petroleum reserve. 
 ''There are people in this group who would not have endorsed one part if not for corresponding parts,'' said William K. Reilly, a co-chairman of the study and administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under the first President George Bush in the late 1980's and early 90's. ''I'm a lifelong conservationist,'' Mr. Reilly said, ''and 10 or 12 years ago would not have imagined myself advancing the future of coal.''
 The group, the National Commission on Energy Policy, was financed by the Hewlett Foundation and other private sources. John P. Holdren, a professor of environmental policy at Harvard and also a co-chairman, said that with the pressures of the presidential election over, the combination of high prices for oil and natural gas and ''the way things evolved in Iraq'' might make the country ''more ready in principle for this sort of package.''
 The third co-chairman was John W. Rowe, chairman of Exelon, a big power company; members of the group included R. James Woolsey, a former director of central intelligence, and Martin B. Zimmerman, a vice president of Ford.
 The group's report suggests sharp increases in fuel economy requirements, and letting automakers buy and sell mileage credits in much the same way utilities now trade the right to emit pollution. It calls for a similar cap-and-trade system for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, with a price limit on the value of a ton of emissions, to avoid stunting economic growth. 
 The group advocates spending $2 billion to build one or two sample nuclear reactors using advanced technology. It also supports building electricity plants that cook coal to produce combustible gases, which are then burned in turbines like those used at natural gas plants. This approach leaves open the possibility that carbon dioxide can be captured to prevent global warming. 
 The study gives short shrift to several perennial ideas on energy. Hydrogen, championed by the current President Bush in the 2003 State of the Union speech, fails on at least two of the four criteria the commission said a new technology should have: being compatible with the existing distribution infrastructure, and being competitive with gasoline by 2020. The commission cited an estimate by the National Academy of Sciences that full development of hydrogen technology is 50 years away.
 It was not enthusiastic about corn ethanol, because its potential to replace gasoline is limited and the reduction of carbon dioxide is modest. And it costs twice what gasoline does, the report said. Another possibility, the authors said, was an emerging technology, ethanol made from the woody part of plants. 
 The report also did not stress ordering electric companies to buy more power from solar and wind plants and other renewable sources. Eighteen states have renewable energy standards, specifying a quotas for such sources; Colorado voters approved one in last month's election.

HEADLINE: Europe's Frustration Grows as Dollar Hits Another Low

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
Europe's financial policy makers issued their strongest warnings yet on Tuesday about the dangers of a swooning dollar, and the dollar promptly sank to a new low against the euro.
 The latest currency swing, which came a day after statements from Brussels late Monday by European finance ministers and the European Central Bank, illustrates the extent to which Europe has become a bystander in a global devaluation of the dollar, the world's leading currency.
 Europe's frustration that the euro is absorbing the bulk of this downward pressure has become palpable. Austria's finance minister, Karl-Heinz Grasser, said the European Union ought to ''engage in a serious and intensive debate'' with the United States over its policy toward the dollar. 
 ''I think it is unacceptable that Europe is paying the bill for major imbalances'' in the United States, Mr. Grasser said at a meeting of European Union finance ministers in Brussels.
 The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, declared, ''all major countries and economic areas must play their part more actively in reducing global imbalances.'' Mr. Trichet has described recent exchange-rate swings as unwelcome and even brutal.
 Although the statements prompted a brief rebound of the dollar against the euro, the rebound later evaporated as traders reverted to their prevailing assumptions that the United States is ready to tolerate a weaker dollar, and that the European Central Bank is not ready to intervene in the market.
 After falling to $1.339 in trading in New York on Monday, the euro bounced back to $1.346 -- a record -- on Tuesday. The dollar recovered somewhat in later New York trading. 
 The European Central Bank has been mum about possible intervention, though one of its governors, Axel A. Weber, president of the Bundesbank in Germany, said at his year-end news conference here that ''interventions are a tool that are always available to central banks.''
 Still, currency traders remain skeptical that the bank will intervene, especially since it is not likely to gain the support of the Federal Reserve. So far, it has stuck to less and less effective statements of concern.
 ''Europeans were brought up in the fundamentalist tradition that interventions are bad,'' said Norbert Walter, chief economist of Deutsche Bank. ''They are viewed as a waste of taxpayers' money.''
 Mr. Walter predicted that the euro would gallop past $1.35, which is viewed as the next psychological milestone. He said currency traders were determined to see the euro trade at least 25 percent above its equilibrium level versus the dollar, which would imply a rate of $1.40.
 European leaders blanch at such rarefied trading levels because they fear the euro will price their exports out of the American market. Europe's economic recovery has been fueled mainly by exports, but there is evidence of a slowing in shipments from Germany and other countries.
 The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, said in remarks broadcast by German television that the European Central Bank ''must design its interest rate policies and its intervention policies in such a way that growth in Europe is fostered, rather than the opposite happening.''
 Mr. Schroder, who is visiting China this week, is getting a firsthand look at the vagaries of global markets. He has been able to celebrate the signing of a clutch of lucrative trade deals, including a 1 billion euro ($1.34 billion) deal for Chinese airlines to buy 23 Airbus passenger planes, and a 350 million euro ($469 million) order for Siemens to supply locomotives. 
 But Beijing's reluctance to let its currency, the yuan or renminbi, float against the dollar or other currencies is one reason the dollar's decline against the euro has been so swift and deep. The Bank of Japan and other Asian central banks have also intervened to curb the rise of their currencies.
 Mr. Schroder, flush with deals for planes and for trains, has not pressed the Chinese leaders to change their policy.
 Europe's problem, analysts say, is that it is the third person in a two-person play: the United States, with its ballooning budget deficit and trade gap with Asia, and the Asian countries, who are largely financing the American debt by converting their dollars into Treasury bills.
 ''The big drama is between the United States, on the one hand, and the emerging markets, on the other hand,'' said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ''What can Europe do?''

HEADLINE: A Call To Arms

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: TALLINN, Estonia 

 BODY:
With Iraq still in upheaval, I thought I'd lend President Bush a hand and visit some of our loyal partners in the ''coalition of the willing'' to drum up more troops.
 As Mr. Bush pointed out in a presidential debate when John Kerry complained that the U.S. was going it alone in Iraq, we have 30 countries standing with us in Iraq. Actually, by next month we'll be down to 27, but if each of those nations sent 5,000 additional troops, we would nearly double the foreign forces in Iraq. 
 Oops. Estonia, this lovely postage-stamp-size member of our coalition, has armed forces with a grand total of only 4,000 troops.
 Still, I tried.
 In his splendid office in the picturesque old quarter of Tallinn, Prime Minister Juhan Parts told me how much Estonians treasure American support. So I suggested that Estonia show its appreciation by sending, say, 1,000 more troops to Iraq.
 The prime minister looked stricken.
 ''Estonia is small,'' he said, arguing that sending 55 Estonian soldiers to Iraq wasn't bad for a country the size of his. He added: ''Concerning public opinion here, of course, nobody is for war -- this is quite obvious -- and 60 percent were not very much in favor of Estonian participation. We contributed as much as we can at this moment.'' 
 My mission had suffered a setback.
 One has to respect the contributions of countries like Estonia, which has already had two soldiers killed and 15 injured. Maj. Sten Reimann, who recently returned from a posting in Iraq, said that each Estonian soldier wondered before going out on patrol each day, What am I doing here? His own answer, he said, was that bringing security to Iraq is a worthy goal.
 Many others I interviewed offered a more troubling answer. A student named Sven Kukenelk put it this way: ''It's like an investment for us.''
 By this logic, Estonia invests troops in Iraq, and then the United States will be morally bound to rescue Estonia if it gets in trouble with Russia.
 Triin Tael, who was out with her baby along the cobblestone streets of Tallinn, said that many Estonians considered the U.S. and Russia to be equally bad. But, she said, they want to cultivate ties with distant Washington to protect them from neighboring Moscow.
 ''It is in our interest to be friendly to the U.S.,'' she said, ''because we are hoping that the U.S. and NATO will protect us if Russia attacks.'' 
 So, on the basis of those 55 soldiers in Iraq, the U.S is now committed to using its full economic and military force to back Estonia?
 ''Yes,'' she said. ''That's exactly what we think.''
 It was my turn to look stricken.
 Estonia's contribution is not unusual. Eight of our partners in Iraq have fewer than 100 soldiers there.
 I'm afraid that my campaign to assist Mr. Bush in raising troops is, so far, proving no more successful than my past missions to help Mr. Bush find W.M.D. in Iraq or Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. No wonder Mr. Bush never calls, never writes.
 I started my present search for troops in Ukraine. The departing dictator, Leonid Kuchma, sent 1,600 troops to Iraq, apparently in the hope that Mr. Bush would ignore the tendency of Mr. Kuchma's opponents to end up dead. 
 These days, Ukraine's pro-democracy leader, Viktor Yushchenko, is promising to pull Ukraine's troops out of Iraq. A Ukraine that is responsive to public opinion, it seems, will not be a member of our coalition.
 And that's the problem with our coalition: it's mostly made up of leaders counting on rewards, rather than of nations that are really behind us. Tony Blair genuinely believes in the Iraq war as a matter of principle, but the other members of the coalition are mostly opportunists trying to buy good will in the Bush administration.
 That's because a White House that proved immensely sensitive to public opinion in Ohio has been oblivious to public opinion abroad. To his credit, Mr. Bush has tried to mend relations lately, but the damage is done: Americans are dying in Iraq, largely on their own, because Mr. Bush's bulldozer approach has so alienated potential allies. 
 But don't give up. I'll continue my mission on behalf of Mr. Bush by traveling to two more giants in our coalition: Latvia and Lithuania. Will I find more troops for Iraq? Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: With Little Fanfare, Spitzer Says He Will Run for Governor in 2006

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
Eliot Spitzer, the two-term New York State attorney general who has gained a national reputation uncovering corrupt practices throughout the financial and insurance industries, said yesterday that he would run for governor in 2006, and pledged to fix what he called the ''crisis'' of New York's dysfunctional government.
 Mr. Spitzer's announcement might have been a formality, since he long ago signaled his intention to run, but it served to firm up his position nearly two years in advance as the likely Democratic nominee, making it easier to raise money, line up endorsements and build momentum.
 Mr. Spitzer decided to forgo the pomp and ceremony of a formal announcement, opting instead to sit behind his desk in his Manhattan office and make personal telephone calls to reporters, telling them that he had decided to enter the race. He had spoken to party leaders earlier. 
 ''I believe,'' Mr. Spitzer said, ''that the state is at a moment of crisis, where our economy is hemorrhaging jobs, we are increasingly laden with taxes and debt, we have a government that is unaccountable and dysfunctional and is failing to address the critical issues.''
 Mr. Spitzer's announcement, and the excitement it is generating among Democratic Party faithful, demonstrates how much New York's political landscape has changed since the Republican governor, George E. Pataki, defeated Mario M. Cuomo a decade ago. Today, Mr. Pataki is in his third term, mired in what is widely considered a gridlocked state government that has been tainted by corruption scandals . Mr. Pataki also suffered an embarrassing defeat this week when his fellow Republicans in the State Senate voted to override his veto of a bill to increase the minimum wage.
 Mr. Pataki said yesterday that he had not decided if he would run again. If he chooses not to try for a fourth term, political consultants said, there is no obvious frontrunner to take his place, except for Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has not indicated any desire to do so. 
 ''I believe in the democratic system and the more the merrier,'' Mr. Pataki said when told about Mr. Spitzer's plan. ''I haven't made a decision; I'll make one at the appropriate time, but I just hope that we can continue to focus on governing and moving the state forward. The elections are two years away and hopefully as we get closer to the elections the campaigning will start, but now we'll continue to govern.''
 Mr. Spitzer, 45, a former Manhattan prosecutor, first ran for attorney general in 1994 but lost in the primary. He ran again in 1998 and won in a very close contest against the Republican incumbent, Dennis C. Vacco. He easily won re-election in 2002. The path to the Democratic nomination was cleared two weeks ago when Senator Charles E. Schumer decided against running.
 Rarely has the dominating theme of a race for higher office emerged so far in advance, but there already is a consensus among politicians and strategists that the issue in 2006 will be who can fix the problems of Albany, where the Legislature and the executive branch have been chronically unable to agree on some of the most pressing issues of the day, from passing a budget on time -- it has been late for 20 years in a row -- to deciding how much money should go to New York City schools, a decision ultimately made by the courts. (The governor and the Legislature, however, did reach an accord yesterday on reforming the Rockefeller-era drugs laws.) 
 In discussing his candidacy, Mr. Spitzer addressed Albany's problems head-on, insisting yesterday and in a recent interview that his experience as attorney general should prove that he has been willing to challenge the status quo and take on vested interests -- even those of friends.
 ''I am friends with many people, with many investment bankers, with many insurance brokers, I'm friends with hedge fund guys,'' Mr. Spitzer said in an interview on Friday. ''I have not, and nobody thinks I will, change my views on what government should do or how it should do it, based on friendship or politics. It just is not the way I function.'' 
 Overhauling what ails Albany is not a new issue. When Mr. Pataki ran against Mr. Cuomo in 1994, he, too, railed against the practice of ''three men in a room'' where the governor, Assembly speaker and Senate majority leader negotiate budget deals behind closed doors, with individual lawmakers cut out of the process. Mr. Pataki vowed to do all he could to get a budget passed on time, and he called for statewide ballot referendums on major issues. But like Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Pataki has often found himself bogged down by the realities of Albany.
 Mr. Spitzer's challenge would be to convince voters he can transfer the skills he has honed as a prosecutor and attorney general, where the law and lawsuits have been his levers of influence, to the full-body contact of state politics. 
 Despite his recent troubles, Mr. Pataki is still viewed as a strong candidate, having forged many solid political relationships for himself, if not the party. His already strong fund-raising ability would get a boost from those Wall Street interests angry with Mr. Spitzer. Even Democratic consultants say that Mr. Pataki remains a formidable political player, who has enlisted support ranging from the Conservative Party to 1199/S.E.I.U., the health care workers' union, which has traditionally supported Democrats. 
 ''He is a proven vote getter,'' said Philip J. Friedman, a Democratic consultant. ''He is somebody who is nimble, somebody who is obviously at a low point in his political career right now. But he could come back from that. I would never count him out.''
 Mr. Pataki and Mr. Spitzer have so far refrained from taking shots at each other, and they must still work together with Mr. Spitzer as the lawyer for the state. But Republicans yesterday said Mr. Spitzer did not follow through on his promise in 1998 to fight for changes in the way Albany does business -- and accused him instead of grandstanding.
 ''I remember seeing stories early on that he talked about reform, but what has Eliot Spitzer done?'' said Stephen Minarik, the new state G.O.P. chairman, who predicted that Mr. Pataki would beat Mr. Spitzer should the governor run again. ''All of a sudden, now that he is going to run for governor, he is returning to the reform movement. Where does he stand on the Legislature's budget, where does he stand on Medicaid cost containment?''
 Mr. Spitzer did not get into specifics about how he might handle some of the problems facing the state, but he said he would move quickly to remedy some of the operations of state authorities, which have been criticized for conducting business out of public view. Mr. Spitzer also suggested that he has trouble with Mr. Pataki's idea to expand to five from three the number of Indian-run casinos authorized in the Catskills. ''I have said for years that casino gambling is an appropriate piece of our economic development program, but it is a piece,'' he said. ''Anybody who sees it as a golden goose that will support all the iconic needs of the state is completely misunderstanding what can be done with casino gambling.''

HEADLINE: Automakers Sue to Block Emissions Law In California

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
Toyota, General Motors and seven other automakers filed suit on Tuesday to block California's new greenhouse gas regulation, which was approved by the state in its final form in September.
 The suit sets up a battle between automakers and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. Although Mr. Schwarzenegger is a fan of the Hummer, an S.U.V. with prodigious greenhouse gas emissions, he has promised nonetheless to defend the regulation, which was signed by his Democratic predecessor, Gray Davis. 
 The regulation -- the first of its kind in North America -- would require automakers to cut by roughly 30 percent the greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks sold in the state by the 2016 model year. The industry is suing in federal court in Fresno, Calif., contending that California's regulation is pre-empted by Washington's authority to regulate fuel economy. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks are a function of fuel economy. 
 ''Federal law is designed to ensure a consistent fuel economy program across the country,'' said Fred Webber, the chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the lobbying group that filed the suit Tuesday with several car dealers. 
 In an interview last week, Terry Tamminen, California's cabinet secretary and a top adviser to Mr. Schwarzenegger, said the governor ''supports the greenhouse gas bill.'' Mr. Tamminen added that the governor had said that ''he intended to fight the expected court challenges.''
 Automakers said Tuesday that greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy should be handled by Washington, though the industry has also lobbied vigorously against significant increases in fuel economy standards by Congress.
 Largely because of the rise of sport utility vehicles, the average fuel economy of new vehicles sold in the United States has declined since the late 1980's, driving up greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the country's oil consumption. 
 ''The auto industry is claiming that no action should be taken on the federal level to clean up cars; now they're claiming no action should be taken at the state level,'' said Daniel Becker, global warming policy director at the Sierra Club. 
 In a letter to top managers Tuesday, William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, said he was still committed to addressing climate change. Mr. Ford has been outspoken on the issue in Detroit, and his company has internally laid out a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over a much longer time frame, by 2030. But ''the prospect of 50 different requirements in 50 different states,'' he said in his letter, ''would be nothing short of chaos.'' 
 Automakers mainly fear the prospect of two efficiency requirements: one from Sacramento and one from Washington. California already has the unique authority under the federal Clean Air Act to set its own air quality rules, because the state's smog-battling rules predated those of the federal government. 
 Other states have the discretion to choose California's air rules over those of Washington, and seven Northeastern states, including New York, do so. Under the new regulation, a fifth of the nation's auto market could have far stricter efficiency rules than the rest of the country. 
 The industry contends that California's new rules would add about $3,000 to the average cost of a new vehicle. State regulators have said that the added cost would be closer to $1,000, which would be more than made up for over time by saving fuel.
 Automakers have also said they would probably react by restricting their sales of large sport utility vehicles and other inefficient vehicles in California. 
 ''This regulation would limit consumer choice and increase vehicle prices,'' said Jim Press, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Toyota's United States sales operation. He added that among Toyota's current models, only the Prius hybrid car and the manual transmission version of the Echo compact car would be able to comply with the regulation. 
 ''The rest of our cars and trucks would have to be completely re-engineered or eliminated,'' he added, in a statement. In other settings, Toyota has indicated that it plans significant expansion of its hybrid vehicle offerings across its lineup over the next decade. 
 Environmentalists expressed disappointment that Toyota, which has heavily advertised its environmental intentions, was party to the suit, though the move was expected. 
 ''I think it's very disappointing that Toyota is joining,'' said Russell Long, president of the San Francisco-based Bluewater Network, which drafted the original proposal. 
 In addition to Toyota and General Motors, the other automakers in the alliance that filed the suit are Ford, DaimlerChrysler, BMW, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Porsche and Volkswagen. Honda and Nissan are not part of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and did not join the suit. Both companies said they opposed the regulation and were mulling their options.
 ''We have very serious reservations to the state-by-state approach to regulating climate change,'' said Ed Cohen, Honda's vice president for government and industry relations. 
 Smog-forming pollutants from cars have been regulated for decades, but the California law would be the first in North America to address automotive emissions of the gases linked by many scientists to global warming trends. 
 ''I think the state is going to lose,'' said Kevin P. Holewinski, a lawyer at the law firm of Jones Day in Washington, which is representing a utility involved in a global warming suit brought by the attorneys general of several states this year. 
 The law, he said, would ''effectively establish a fuel economy standard.'' While catalytic converters act as filters of tiny smog-forming particles, there is no similar device to mitigate global warming gases, so reducing them is largely tied to improving fuel economy.
 David Doniger, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, ''It's not uncommon in the modern world for two laws that have different purposes to operate side by side and have some connection to each other when they are implemented.''

HEADLINE: Loans to Soldiers May Get Scrutiny

 BODY:
Two Democratic lawmakers urged Congress yesterday to explore the business practices of high-cost lenders operating on the fringes of the nation's military bases. 
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York asked the Senate Armed Services Committee, on which she serves, to hold a hearing early next year on lenders who "charge exorbitant interest rates" to service members. 
Her request was made in a letter to Senator John Warner, Republican of Virginia, the committee's chairman. 
 An analysis by The New York Times, published yesterday and cited in Senator Clinton's letter, showed that at least one of every four military families have used the expensive short-term instant loans -- known as payday loans -- with annual interest rates that can exceed 780 percent.
 Representative Rahm Emanuel, an Illinois Democrat, also has asked the House Committee on Financial Services to hold hearings on the lending practices.

HEADLINE: Upgrade for Blind Borrowers of Audiobooks

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
LIKE many Americans who are blind, when Lucille Uttermohlen doesn't feel like curling up with a bulky book in Braille, she turns to audiobooks that come from the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, part of the Library of Congress.
 ''When I lost my vision when I was 16, I was so happy to find out that there was a program that still allowed me to read,'' said Ms. Uttermohlen, who is now 50 and practices family law in Monticello, Ind.
 But the technology used by the National Library Service for people like Ms. Uttermohlen has more in common with the era of ''Starsky and Hutch'' than it does with the age of downloaded digital information. Most of the service's 600,000 users rely on four-track cassette tape players that were designed in the 1970's. While advanced for their time, the players are bulky (they're deliberately rugged to help them withstand repeated trips through the mail), have finicky rechargeable batteries and often vary in sound quality. 
 Terri Uttermohlen of Baltimore, Lucille Uttermohlen's younger sister, who is also sightless, abandoned the system about a year and a half ago.
 ''I found the tapes frustrating at times,'' Terri Uttermohlen said. ''The sound quality isn't consistent. And I also found myself getting all excited at the end of Side 4 but forgetting where I set down the box containing Side 5.''
 The library service has been frustrated, too. But now, thanks in part to the changing economics of the electronics industry, it has decided to switch to a digital system over the next four years. 
 ''We wanted something that's really tough, something that's really easy to handle and something we can afford,'' said Michael Moodie, the National Library Service's deputy director. ''We really didn't have that until this summer.''
 That, Mr. Moodie said, was when price predictions for flash memory reached a point that fit with the library's budget.
 ''Flash is wonderful,'' Mr. Moodie said. ''It had all the requirements we need for the last four or five years except price.''
 Mr. Moodie said the service, which was established in 1931, has a long history of technology innovations.
 Its first audiobook, issued in 1934, was also the world's first 331/3. r.p.m. long-playing record. (The service has a special exemption from copyright laws that allows it to record books and periodicals without royalty payments.) Columbia records did not introduce the first LP for musical recordings, using a slightly different technology, until 1948. But because the Library of Congress distributed 98 percent of the recordings through the mail, the bulk and weight of even LP technology was a problem. A user wanting to hear ''Gone With the Wind,'' for example, was confronted with 80 records. In 1958, that stack was reduced by the introduction of 16 2/3 r.p.m. records. The last gasp of records came in 1973 with 81/3. r.p.m.
 In the 1980's the service avoided a digital technology that most of the world adopted, compact discs. ''CD's would have been a step backward,'' Mr. Moodie said.
 The first strike against CD's, he said, was that they are limited to 74 minutes of audio. Because the library's mono tapes contain four completely separate audio tracks and play at a slower speed than conventional cassette players, they hold up to six hours. Handling CD's without scratching them or loading them into a player the right way could be difficult for some blind people.
 The next steps in converting to flash memory will be designing a player and setting technical standards. Unlike most digital audio players, the library's device must have controls that can be easily manipulated by users with arthritis. Because data representing voice recordings can be compressed more than music, Mr. Moodie said the new flash memory cards, which will use a standard U.S.B. connection, will easily hold a single book regardless of length.
 Terri Uttermohlen said that when the library service's new system is available, she will give it a try. In the meantime she gets her digital audiobooks through a different method. She downloads text, either from the Library of Congress Web Braille server or from Bookshare, a subscription Web site for disabled people that offers books in a variety of formats, including a digital form of Braille. She then uses a speech synthesis program in a hand-held computer to play the books back as audio.
 One advantage to this approach, she said, is that the computer can read at a very rapid, if mechanical, pace.
 ''I often find the human readers are too slow,'' she said. 
 One drawback, however, is that many of the publications in Bookshare are scanned from print editions using computers, leading to problems with unusual book designs or typography. Cookbooks, in particular, can be a challenge. 
 ''When it says 'Bake at 2,500 degrees,' you know that it has read the degree symbol as a zero,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Lockout in N.H.L. Pushes Businesses to the Brink

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting from Detroit for this article.

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
The neighborhood is so dark and lonely these days that the owner of the Cobblestone bar, literally in the shadow of the HSBC Arena, felt the need to install bars on the windows. There are so few customers now, that the Cobblestone no longer serves draft beer: the kegs go bad before they are empty.
 In Columbus, Ohio, the insurance and financial services company Nationwide has spent $500 million to build an arena for the city's National Hockey League team, the Blue Jackets, and the business district around it, has recently had to halve the rent for nine restaurants until the team returns to the ice.
 And near Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, which calls itself Hockeytown in its loyalty to the hometown Red Wings, another passel of businesses are suffering. Anthony Bruce, the manager of a popular bar, Mac's on Third, said he could lose his livelihood. 
 ''We're still paying the place off,'' he said. ''Our final mortgage payment is due in March and we're not sure if we're going to make it.''
 It has been nearly three months since owners of the 30 National Hockey League franchises locked out their players, saying that because most of the teams are losing money the players must accept a salary cap. 
 The lockout has begun to take a financial toll. On Thursday, the two sides are scheduled to meet for the first time since Sept. 9, a week before the lockout began, a lonely, hopeful sign for a season that appears all but lost. Games through Jan. 18 have been canceled; so has the All-Star Game in mid-February. 
 It may be true that in New York and Los Angeles, where hockey is not the center of the entertainment universe; or in places like Denver and Chicago, where the hockey teams share an arena with a pro basketball team and other events, the effects of the lockout are somewhat muted. But in the many smaller cities that are reliant on hockey to enliven downtowns at night, the loss of a season is a significant blow. 
 The city of Detroit, for example, estimates that it receives $10 million in direct revenue from hockey games over the course of a season, from sources including parking, public transportation, concession sales at Joe Louis Arena and a surcharge on Red Wings tickets. And according to David Littmann, the chief economist for Comerica, a financial services company that has its headquarters in the city, the hockey season can pump as much as $85 million into the local economy.
 And though Detroit will survive, said Albert Fields, the deputy chief operating officer for the city, many small businesses may not.
 ''We really do feel bad for the businesses,'' Mr. Fields said. ''There's tax revenue and everything, but these are people's lives.''
 Indeed, Detroit is like a lot of places where the financial hardships of the hockey lockout are focused on specific neighborhoods, but the other frustrations are widespread. This may be especially true in Buffalo, where there are some 65 ice rinks in and around the city -- ''They're like 7-Eleven's,'' said Thomas Kucharski, president and chief executive of Buffalo Niagara Enterprise, a regional development organization -- and hockey runs in the local blood.
 ''The lockout does tend to temper aspirations for economic development around the waterfront,'' Mr. Kucharski said. ''But at this point if you ask me, 'Are you dying without hockey?' I'd ask you, 'Emotionally or economically?' Emotionally we're all dying.''
 In fact, people here said that as the lockout continues, the emotional and economic difficulties it has engendered are melding into a widespread disgust. 
 ''I'm extremely angry,'' said Erin Bullwinkle, 23, who works as a waitress at the Pearl Street Brewery, a restaurant near the HSBC Arena, to help pay for college. A fan who said she is ''obsessed with hockey,'' Ms. Bullwinkle said that with business down, it takes her five extra hours a week to earn the money she made last season. 
 That does not bother her so much, she said. What does bother her is the seeming selfishness of the players. ''The fans pay their wages, and who's going to want to come and see them if they don't understand how they're hurting us?'' she said. ''Anger doesn't explain it. It's more just disappointment at other human beings.'' 
 Things are likely to get worse. The early games of the season are generally those with the poorest attendance, as many Buffalo sports fans are still focused on the Bills of the National Football League. In addition, though the weather this fall has been mild by Buffalo's standards, in the generally bitterly cold and snowbound months of January and February, the Sabres have traditionally been the one thing able to lure people out of their houses and downtown. Even on a snowless evening in December, Bernard Brown, who manages four parking lots around the arena, could look at his vast, nearly vacant empire and declare, ''It's a ghost town.'' 
 He looked almost mournful. ''I think there was supposed to be a game tonight,'' he said.
 The Sabres, who entered the N.H.L. for the 1970-71 season, actually have not had all that much success. They have made it to the Stanley Cup finals only twice and lost both times. The franchise went bankrupt in 2003, along with its owner, Adelphia Communications, and was operated by the league until it was purchased three months later by B. Thomas Golisano, the billionaire owner of the Rochester-based Paychex Inc., and a former New York gubernatorial candidate. 
 But in spite of these troubles, the Sabres, like the Red Sox in Boston and the Packers in Green Bay, Wis., have become integral to the city's sense of itself and to its image. 
 Along with the Bills, they have been a selling point for attracting new companies to the area as, in recent years, Buffalo has made an earnest effort to revamp its image as an industrial city in hapless decline. The economy is being transformed from manufacturing-based to research- and technology-based; some 450 biotech companies are now situated in Niagara and Erie counties. By virtually all accounts, the future is brighter here than it has been in decades. 
 That is one reason resentment among fans is so strong; it is as if the Sabres are suddenly a drag on the city's potential prosperity. 
 ''I have my business perception and I have my personal perception,'' said Steve Calvaneso, who owns three restaurants and a men's store in downtown Buffalo and who is contemplating a run for mayor. One of his restaurants, City Grill, is only a few blocks from the arena, and he said he was losing $1,500 to $4,000 in sales every game night, which could add up to, he said, $100,000 for the season. 
 ''My business perception is, yeah, there's an effect,'' Mr. Calvaneso said. ''My personal perception is that owners and players, who feed off the working-class people of this city, are complaining about their meager salaries of $3 million. I'd like to see them sit out the whole year, let the whole league dissolve and start over again. Let them get back in touch with the fans.''
 Last week, the waterfront neighborhood where the arena is currently the main draw got a significant boost when Bass Pro Shops, the outdoor equipment retailer, announced that in 2007 it would open a mammoth store in the area, a 250,000-square-foot complex including a boat showroom and interactive entertainment with the potential of becoming a regional tourist destination. Ostensibly, it would bolster the appeal of the arena, but with no professional hockey being played now or in the foreseeable future, the idea has taken hold that the Bass store may not be the Sabres' local collaborator, but their replacement. 
 And if hockey represents the past in Buffalo, what does that say about the sport over all?
 ''The significance of this lockout here is far less for its economic impact than for its quality of life impact,'' said Andrew Rudnick, president of Buffalo Niagara Partnership, a 3,000-member umbrella group for local businesses that functions as a chamber of commerce. ''And this is a comment on how fragile the sport is. One of the potential outcomes is that people will just forget about it.''

HEADLINE: Many Britons Sour on Private Pension Experiment

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
Adair Turner, a senior Merrill Lynch banker here who once led Britain's main employer group and has now been given responsibility for overseeing a wide-ranging review of the country's retirement benefits, has some advice for the Bush administration as it moves forward with its own plans to overhaul Social Security.
 His cautionary words on introducing private accounts to the old-age pension program are noteworthy because, in essence, Britain has been there, done that.
 Like the United States, the British face a substantial gap between the amount taxpayers are expected to contribute to financing pensions and the benefits that retirees are scheduled to receive. Without changes, Britain runs the risk of a $110 billion gap in its pension system by 2050. Yet previous efforts to tinker with the country's tangled web of government and private benefits have produced what a commission headed by Mr. Turner called ''the most complex pension system in the world.'' 
 It was precisely the impulse in Britain to mix the government retirement plan with the private pension market that led to much confusion and substantial financial losses for pension funds and savers in recent years. If anything, the result has been to press many savers back into the government system and away from private experiments.
 ''We would start by saying, 'We wish we had started with your problem,''' Mr. Turner said, referring to what British experts see as attributes of the American system: strong population growth and a readiness to work longer into old age, which make changes less pressing than they are here. Indeed, Mr. Turner said, compared with British National Insurance, the American system looks far more robust. 
 That is hardly the emphasis in Washington. President Bush has said he wants to add voluntary personal investment accounts to Social Security, allowing workers to switch part of their payroll taxes into stocks and bonds for their retirement.
 Mr. Bush has not said precisely how this would be achieved. But he has indicated that a starting point might be proposals from a commission three years ago, with Daniel Patrick Moynihan as its co-chairman, who supported the idea of personal accounts.
 As in Britain, Washington's intention is to address a solvency problem that is expected to intensify in the next few decades as the baby-boom generation reaches retirement age, requiring future workers to shoulder a greater burden to support retired people. 
 That kind of problem is compounded in Britain, and to a greater extent in much of Continental Europe, by birth rates lower than those in the United States -- meaning that a prospectively smaller number of taxpayers will be supporting a larger number of pensioners living longer lives.
 Britain took the first steps to try to deal with its problems in the late 1980's, when a government-sponsored program began offering millions of Britons the chance to set up what were called personal pensions -- similar to the private accounts that President Bush has suggested should be an alternative, in part, to Social Security for future retirees.
 But, according to a report in October by the British government's Pensions Commission, led by Mr. Turner, many changes in the system ''appeared to make sense at the time'' but ended up creating ''bewildering complexity in the state system, in the private system and in the interface between them.''
 Not only that, the looming crisis in government pensions here has coincided with a fundamental shift in the privately run workplace pensions that once guaranteed many middle-class Britons a comfortable retirement.
 ''The occupational pension scheme was one of the great successes of the 20th century,'' said Andrew Fleming, a spokesman for the National Association of Pension Funds. ''The danger is that it's not going to be there in the 21st century.''
 The catalog of problems is a long one, but the conclusion is straightforward: government spending is projected to shrink, in real terms adjusted for inflation, by 26 percent for each pensioner over the next four decades, according to the Pensions Commission report. But some 12 million of Britain's nearly 60 million people are not putting enough aside in private pension plans to offset that decline.
 ''There's an argument that those who are retiring now are a golden generation,'' Mr. Fleming said, ''because roughly three-quarters of Britain's 11 million pensioners are able to augment the state pension of roughly $200 to $400 a week with a private pension. But going forward, the danger is that a significant proportion will face an underfunded retirement.''
 The message, according to Mr. Turner, is simple: Britons will have to work longer, pay more taxes and save more for their old age if they are to have comfortable retirements. 
 ''We must now make adjustments,'' the commission report said, ''to public policy and/or individual behavior which ideally should have been started in the last 20 to 30 years.''
 Under the effort to introduce greater reliance on private accounts, all British taxpayers continued to contribute to the basic government pension plan. But better-paid workers were permitted to opt out of a supplementary government plan and to withdraw funds from company-sponsored retirement packages.
 The idea -- similar to Bush concepts now -- was to avoid a huge gap in pension financing by creating personal investment accounts that, in theory, would generate higher returns on private investments, while lowering the burden on the government.
 The result, though, was a scandal in which insurers and financial advisers were fined after charges that they sold private pension arrangements without adequately informing clients of the risks. Compensation payments by the big financial institutions that sold the private funds now total about $27 billion.
 Indeed, Mr. Turner said, one piece of advice he would offer to American pension managers would be to be realistic about the expectations for the rates of return from private accounts.
 Mr. Fleming of the National Association of Pension Funds added that the private pension providers, stung since by scandals related to life insurance policies linked to mortgages and other products, are still worried that they could be in trouble for misleading sales tactics if they urge people to opt out of the government program.
 The trend, therefore, is for more people to choose to go back into the government plan, further reducing the amount of money for private retirement savings.
 Many company pension funds in the 1990's were so well padded that the companies opted to offer early retirement packages to reduce payrolls rather than force layoffs. All that changed when the stock markets began falling in 2000, and the prevalent form of British company pension -- offering the equivalent of a guaranteed percentage of an employee's final salary -- became too expensive for the companies.
 Many businesses have closed such ''final salary schemes'' to new entrants, instead offering pension plans where the company guarantees only a contribution to private pensions, in effect moving closer to 401(k) plans in the United States.
 In Britain, though, such arrangements tend to be restricted to high-paid workers; among the lower paid, the complexity of the government pension regimen can act as a disincentive to private savings of whatever size.
 Under the British system, the government program is made up of three main components: a basic pension, various means-tested pension credits and a supplementary pension related to mandatory contributions from some earnings. Efforts toward smaller, private pension programs for the lower-paid workers, called stakeholder pensions, have generally fallen flat.
 The means-tested portion of the government pension is intended to ensure that those paid least are guaranteed a minimum level of support in retirement. But it acts as a further disincentive to saving.
 ''The issue for tomorrow's pensioner,'' Mr. Fleming said, ''is this: Why should I save in private schemes if the state is going to bail me out anyhow?''

HEADLINE: Those lofty reported returns show that hedge funds are more skilled at managing data than managing money, a study says.

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger. 
Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
HEDGE funds have grown at supersonic speed. In 1990, about $50 billion was invested in hedge funds; today, the amount is estimated at $1 trillion. 
 Does superior performance explain the rapid growth? No, says Burton G. Malkiel, a professor of economics at Princeton University, and Atanu Saha, a managing principal at the Analysis Group, a consulting firm. The researchers recently completed a study that challenges the often-made claim that hedge funds, in general, produce lofty returns. 
 Hedge funds are a diverse set of investment funds that typically cater to wealthy clients and institutions. The funds pursue various strategies, like holding both long and short positions, and often employ substantial leverage. Their fees are usually much higher than those charged by mutual funds or other financial assets. 
 Data on the performance of hedge funds comes from indexes like the CSFB/Tremont Index or the Van Hedge Fund Index. Those indexes are generated by companies that advise investors and operate funds. 
 ''Hedge funds in aggregate,'' Van Hedge Fund Advisors boasts on its Web site, ''in most multiyear periods, have provided both superior returns and lower statistical risk than the S.& P. 500 or mutual funds.'' 
 The catch, according to Professor Malkiel, is that the information on performance is voluntarily provided to the organizations who track the funds. Because a good record helps attract investors, funds have a tendency to start reporting results only after they have achieved some success. Funds that are losers right out of the gate may never be represented in the database. 
 Furthermore, when funds start reporting, they have the option of ''backfilling'' their data, or providing information on returns for previous months. If a fund was successful in preceding months, it has an incentive to backfill its data to increase its attractiveness to investors. 
 This process creates a ''backfill bias,'' because better results are overrepresented in the database. It is as if the Boston Red Sox waited until 2004 to report their World Series success, while the Yankees started in 1923; both franchises would look like smashing successes. 
 By analyzing statistics from TASS Research, which is owned by Tremont Capital and has perhaps the most comprehensive data on returns, Mr. Malkiel and Mr. Saha have shown that the backfill bias is substantial. The returns that were backfilled for a given year were 5.8 percentage points higher than the returns of other funds whose results were contemporaneously reported for that year. 
 ''I think there are a lot of people in the financial community who have a vested interest in showing only those pieces of data that help them sell products,'' said Professor Malkiel, who is also a director for the Vanguard Group. 
 Another problem he noted, called survivor bias, is a tendency for funds to stop reporting their monthly returns when they suffer losses and are on the verge of closing. Long-Term Capital Management, for example, did not report its losses to any of the database services from October 1997 to October 1998, a period when it lost 92 percent of its capital. (Long-Term Capital never reported to the TASS database.) 
 Looking only at the past returns of hedge funds that are in existence today -- that is, the surviving funds -- it does appear as if hedge funds do produce generous returns. But this is tantamount to judging the success of a war by ignoring all the casualties.
 Mr. Malkiel and Mr. Saha have found that the funds that cease reporting their data, so-called dead funds, tend to have weak returns in the months before they cease reporting. The average annual return for dead funds was 7.4 percentage points less than that of surviving funds for the same years. 
 And hedge funds have a tendency to die -- more than 10 percent stop reporting to the database each year. Although it is possible that some of these funds withdrew because they were so successful that they no longer desired further investors, the researchers found that smaller and underperforming funds were the most likely to cease reporting -- not a profile of successful funds that were turning away business. 
 Using data from 1996 to 2003, Mr. Malkiel and Mr. Saha found that correcting for backfill and survivor biases reduced the average annual return on hedge funds, after deducting fees, from 13.5 percent to, at most, 9.7 percent, which is almost three percentage points less than the return on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for that time period. 
 The lower return could be justified if hedge funds helped to diversify portfolios by providing an investment that did not move in lock step with other investments, and the researchers did find that hedge funds do not move closely with the stock market over time. 
 Yet they also found that choosing a particular hedge fund entailed considerable risk because the funds exhibited enormous variability in performance in any given year. The best funds perform extraordinarily well, but the worst ones perform extremely poorly, with the spread between the best and worst greatly exceeding the spread between the best and worst equity or bond funds in a typical year. 
 ''Clearly, there is a risk in investing in hedge funds that is far greater than the risk of investing in the other asset classes,'' the researchers said. 
 Even the so-called fund of funds hedge funds, which try to diversify risks by investing in other hedge funds, display nearly as much variability in performance across funds in a given year as is exhibited across the entire universe of mutual funds. Moreover, from 1995 to 2003, the average fund of funds yielded only a 7 percent annual rate of return after deducting fees, well below that of the average mutual fund. 
 Picking a good fund is also dicey because there is little persistence in performance from one year to the next. The chance that a hedge fund that performed in the top half of the universe of funds in one year would do so again the following year is no better than 50-50, which raises the question of how the funds can command such high fees. 
 Most hedge funds will be required to register and provide data to the Securities and Exchange Commission beginning in February 2006. While some people have argued that the S.E.C. already has too much to do, it would seem that collecting and disclosing information on performance is a small burden for the commission, and a great potential benefit to investors. 
 ''As a free market person, I think markets work better when there is fuller and more accurate information,'' Mr. Malkiel said.

HEADLINE: Buying Bowl Tickets Is a Game in Itself

BYLINE: By Kevin McKenna; Michelle Slatalla is on vacation.

 BODY:
SO your favorite team just claimed a berth in one of college football's top bowl games. What are you going to do next?
 You're going online, of course.
 As if December weren't already fraught with shopping madness, fans of dozens of colleges whose teams will be playing over the holidays -- preferably in a marquee game somewhere in the Sun Belt -- are scrambling to come up with the connections and the cash that will land them in the stadium.
 Now, many could have avoided this predicament and been assured of choice bowl-game seats by purchasing their team's season tickets. But for fans who lacked such foresight, the Web provides a number of ways for ticket sellers and ticket buyers to find one another. And even for those just browsing, it offers the most transparent of insights into the sports-ticket economy. 
 Your shopping may take you to city-specific online bazaars like craigslist.org, the vast auction domain of eBay, or dedicated ticket marketplaces like stubhub.com or ticketsnow.com. Even a search-engine query can turn up leads. 
 Wherever you start, just eliminate the words ''face value'' from your vocabulary. ''There is NO direct relation,'' notes a disclaimer at TicketsNow, between ''the price listed on our Web site and the price printed on the ticket.''
 And how. For evidence, you need look no further than the Orange Bowl game on Jan. 4 in Miami, matching No. 1 Southern California against No. 2 Oklahoma. (My interest in this one is more than academic: I'm a graduate of U.S.C.) Because the Orange Bowl was designated more than a year ago as this season's national championship game, tickets have been officially sold out for weeks. Many were guaranteed to those who bought tickets to last year's (non-championship) game.
 ''Buying a ticket to a national championship game shouldn't be easy,'' said Joe Hornstein, media relations manager for the Orange Bowl Committee. Online, though, there is certainly a market, with prices reflecting both the game's stakes and the potential profits to be had by ticket holders who may never have planned to attend. 
 In the tidy, efficient marketplace that is StubHub, whose sellers include individuals and ticket agencies alike, there were more than 200 sellers on Tuesday evening offering a total of nearly 1,300 Orange Bowl tickets. A number were in lots of up to 20 tickets together. (Sites like StubHub and TicketsNow hold no tickets themselves, but merely serve as a mechanism for buyers and sellers to connect and provide some guarantees, taking fees from both sides to manage the transaction.) 
 Sorting by price at StubHub quickly allows you to establish a high and low end (from $2,942 apiece for two club-level seats on the 50-yard line, down to a mere $353 for a single ticket in the corner of the upper deck). Sorting by location can expose potential inconsistencies in pricing (seats for $2,059 in Row 19 on the 25-yard line, but others for a mere $1,765 one row lower -- hmm, a potential bargain?). 
 That $2,059 price, by the way, is not so arbitrary as it might sound. StubHub charges sellers a 15 percent fee, so the ticket holder was apparently looking to clear $1,750 per seat. Less obvious is how that $1,750 relates to the face value of the ticket, $195. Given Florida's seemingly tough scalping laws, which restrict the markup on resale of a ticket to $1, how do you get to four figures?
 For one thing, the seller may not be in Florida. In addition, so long as the tickets are offered as part of a package with something else included, that ''something else'' (a hat, a parking pass) can have a premium value attached to it. 
 ''A package can consist of anything as simple as transportation to the game,'' said Todd Lokken, vice president for marketing at TicketsNow, a listing service for licensed brokers that calls itself the largest online ticket marketplace. Orange Bowl seats at TicketsNow are typically packaged with a transportation voucher for taxi or limousine service to and from the stadium, he said. 
 But many of the Orange Bowl tickets being offered online don't specify a ''package,'' so it's worth raising the question, if not an eyebrow, in weighing a purchase. (EBay, by the way, provides a calculator that can determine if scalping laws apply to either the sale or the purchase of a ticket, depending on the locations of the buyer, the seller and the event.) 
 If you have your eye on another game, you'll be encountering similar market forces but accordingly different price ranges. There are plenty of tickets available to top games like the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, featuring No. 3 Auburn ($195 to $1,352 at StubHub.com), and the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz. ($85 to $660). The Rose Bowl is a different story. Because the bulk of its tickets (face value: $125) started going out only this week, the market emerged late. Many seat locations at TicketsNow and StubHub are listed as TBD, or to be determined, which doesn't keep them from being priced as high as $1,295. (''Should be great seats,'' a $520 listing noted, ''but nothing guaranteed yet.'')
 Whichever game you're aiming for, there is a fundamental issue for the online ticket buyer: How do I know I'll get my ticket? TicketsNow and StubHub guarantee that you will receive the tickets you selected (TicketsNow promises ''a comparable or better ticket'' or a refund). Having been an occasional seller at StubHub, I've found that its easy shipment system (through FedEx) and its escrow system for payment (through PayPal) can both expedite and secure delivery. 
 At eBay, bidding has the potential to yield a bargain (or maybe not: one seller's lot of four Orange Bowl seats was bid up from $5 to $1,800 within 24 hours last week), but you have to put your trust largely in the seller's feedback record, and perhaps your credit card's buyer protection. And at a site like Craigslist, your confidence level will be entirely a function of the seller's pitch.
 Nonetheless, browsing among the postings at Craigslist may be the most entertaining way you'll shop for bowl tickets, or anything else. In the Orange Bowl search, my eye was drawn to an offer at miami.craigslist.org (''Price Negotiatble -- $600,'' it said, making up in ambiguity what it lacked in spelling). 
 ''Since I always come through for people who need tickets, I decided to put two very special tickets up,'' it began, adding, ''These seats I am practically giving away are in the club level.'' (To be more precise, ''2nd row on the isle.'')
 Posted a month ago, the listing went on to tout the game's potential matchups and concluded by noting: ''It is the holidays coming. Very good Christmas or Hanukkah gift.'' 
 Alas, my e-mail query to the seller last week failed to produce a response as to whether those very special tickets were still available. Still, it gave me a thought. 
 My advice is to go online, find the best tickets you can -- and then drop a hint to a well-heeled friend, perhaps that fellow alum who did so well in life. Because those tickets could, after all, make a very good Christmas or Hanukkah gift.

HEADLINE: Rising Dollar Helps Shares Gain Despite Higher Oil Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Investors resumed their December rally yesterday, looking past higher oil prices and focusing instead on building up their portfolios before the end of the year. A stronger dollar and a brokerage firm upgrade of General Electric added momentum to the buying.
 Although a barrel of light crude oil closed at $41.94, up 48 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Wall Street appeared unconcerned. Oil futures had vacillated between $41 and $42 a barrel after the Energy Department said fuel inventories were higher than Wall Street expected. 
 Investors were encouraged as the dollar gained against the Japanese yen after Japan's government reported slower-than-expected economic growth in its most recent quarter. Analysts had been concerned that the weak dollar could lead to a decline in foreign investment.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 53.65 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,494.23. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 5.74 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,182.81, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 11.45 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,126.11.
 Analysts reported more money flowing into mutual funds and other investments, thanks to the stock rally that started in November. The extra money should push stock prices up before the end of the year, as long as oil prices stay relatively low and there are no negative surprises in earnings forecasts or economic data.
 ''I've been saying for the past half a year that things would pick up after the election, and they did. I still think that works, even with what we've seen this week,'' said Brian Bruce, director of global investments at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston. ''The natural direction at this point for the rest of the year is up, assuming that you don't get some unknown factor that comes in and sends it the other direction for a few days.''
 Sirius Satellite Radio fell sharply in heavy trading after two Wall Street firms lowered their ratings on the stock. The shares closed at $6.90, down $2.11, or 23 percent.
 Analysts at both Smith Barney and Bear Stearns said the company's recent flood of positive news had made the stock too expensive. In October, the company signed a five-year contract with Howard Stern.
 Despite a disappointing earnings forecast, Merck made strong gains. The company warned that its 2005 profit would be lower than analysts expected because of the withdrawal of its Vioxx arthritis drug from the market earlier this year. The forecast could have been worse, however, analysts said. Shares of Merck rose 80 cents, to $28.69, as it reaffirmed its 2004 earnings targets.
 General Electric climbed 40 cents, to $35.71, after analysts at Lehman Brothers upgraded the company's stock to overweight from equal-weight, citing the potential for double-digit earnings growth in 2005.
 Texas Instruments lost 96 cents, to $24.05, after it narrowed its 2005 earnings and revenue forecasts, which still fall within Wall Street's estimates, but said 2004 earnings remained on target.
 I.B.M. confirmed the sale of its personal computer business to Lenovo of China for $1.75 billion, part of I.B.M.'s shift away from hardware toward more profitable software, service and consulting businesses. I.B.M. was up 55 cents at $96.65.
 United States computer makers were mixed on the news. Dell gained 55 cents, to $41.86, while Hewlett-Packard fell 6 cents, to $21.02.

HEADLINE: Small Pro-Independence Party Is Gaining in Taiwan Opinion Polls

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
With three days remaining until legislative elections on Saturday, the streets here echo with slogans belted out from truck-mounted loudspeakers belonging to the Taiwan Solidarity Union, the smallest but fastest growing of Taiwan's main political parties.
 The T.S.U., as it is known, favors immediate steps toward greater independence from mainland China. It has benefited from a strong and unexpected surge in opinion polls here in the last two weeks. 
 The party wants a new constitution that would make it clear that Taiwan is separate from the mainland. The party is also calling for changes to the flag, the national anthem and other symbols of Taiwan's heritage as part of China. ''We can help Taiwan be a more normal country,'' said Lee Shang-ren, the director of the party's policy center.
 The policies are anathema to Beijing, which has threatened war if Taiwan moves too far toward independence. But they are also alarming to Washington, which does not want a conflict now in this part of the world, especially while large numbers of American soldiers are in Iraq and while the United States is seeking Beijing's help in dealing with North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
 The Taiwan Solidarity Union is too small to play a leading role in the 225-member legislature. It now holds 12 seats, and recent polls suggest that it may have 17 to 20 seats after Saturday's elections.
 But growing support for the party has forced President Chen Shui-bian and his governing Democratic Progressive Party to tilt further toward independence as well, a trend that could be a harbinger of increased tensions across the Taiwan Strait.
 Mr. Chen won two presidential elections by promising voters that he would stand up to Beijing more than would the Nationalist Party, which ran Taiwan for the half-century after the Nationalists lost the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949. The Nationalists, now the main opposition party here, still favor eventual political reunification with the mainland.
 Mr. Chen has slowly widened the political gap between Taiwan and the mainland through steps like the national referendum held in March on increasing defense spending if Chinese missiles continue to be pointed at the island. But he has stopped short of the more confrontational measures favored by the Taiwan Solidarity Union, partly because of American pressure.
 Hsiao Bi-khim, one of the Democratic Progressive Party's most popular lawmakers and a former spokeswoman for the president, said that some of her party's most pro-independence supporters were campaigning for the Taiwan Solidarity Union this year, and that this was forcing President Chen to shift his stance as well.
 ''I guess the fundamentalists are a bit disappointed in our administration'' for not having moved Taiwan even further in the direction of independence, she said in an interview on Wednesday night in a minivan on the way to a campaign stop. ''The T.S.U. has made him feel compelled to consolidate our traditional supporters.''
 Hours before a T.S.U. rally on Sunday, Mr. Chen unexpectedly announced that he wanted to change ''China'' to ''Taiwan'' in the name of state-owned enterprises like China Telecom. He also proposed to change the name to Taiwan on the economic and cultural offices that it maintains in more than 70 countries, including the United States, that recognize Beijing instead of Taipei.
 Beijing has said little in response so far, but a State Department spokesman in Washington criticized the proposed name changes.

HEADLINE: Japan's Once-Booming Recovery Near a Standstill

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
Japan's once-robust recovery slowed to a near standstill in the third quarter as consumer spending weakened more than expected, according to revised figures released Wednesday. 
 Adopting a new method of calculating output, the government revised third-quarter growth to an annual 0.2 percent from a previous 0.3 percent. The new method is intended to eliminate distortions caused by rapidly falling prices of high-technology items, like cellphones and computers.
 Using the new calculation, the government also said that the economy shrank in the second quarter, declining an annual 0.6 percent instead of rising 1.1 percent as previously reported. 
 The revised figures were weaker than economists expected and well off the 6 percent pace of the first quarter. The data sent the yen sharply lower, hitting a low of 104.99, from 102.97 on Tuesday. But later in New York, the yen appeared to have recovered, trading at 102.89. 
 The revised numbers were consistent with a string of recent economic figures showing Japan's recovery has lost momentum, dogged by slowing export growth and weak consumption.
 ''We haven't seen any evidence of things turning around yet,'' said Peter Morgan, an economist at HSBC Securities (Japan) Ltd.
 Although strength in technology stocks this year suggests investors are optimistic on the prospects of Japan's all-important electronics industry, there are other, more worrying signs, he said. ''I've basically focused on exports as the lead indicator for the economy, and so far we don't see exports picking up,'' he said. 
 The biggest reason for the slower growth announced Wednesday were large revisions to consumer spending. The government said Wednesday that private consumption grew at an annual rate of just 0.9 percent -- compared with an initial estimate of 3.7 percent. Other recent data has shown that the incomes of most workers were unchanged or have fallen slightly compared with last year, while employment conditions have deteriorated. 
 Despite the new numbers, Japanese policy makers said that the recovery would continue, if at a slower pace than earlier in the year.
 ''The economy is going through a small adjustment while staying on an expansionary trend, and we won't change the view with today's numbers,'' Heizo Takenaka, economic and fiscal policy minister, told reporters, according to Bloomberg News. 
 Japan's economic data has been notoriously prone to corrections. It is not unusual for the government to reverse itself on positive growth figures and later say that the economy shrank. 
 Aiming to eliminate those surprises, the government changed the way it measures economic growth and adopted a calculation, similar to one used in the United States, that more accurately gauges the impact of large price falls in things like electronic gadgets. Those items have consistently dropped in price in recent years. 
 Although there is no doubt that prices over all have been falling for years in Japan, the old G.D.P. calculation tended to overstate the pace of the decline. The growth figure that economists and investors focus on is so-called real G.D.P., or growth after accounting for changes in the prices of goods and services. Normally, the rate of inflation is subtracted from nominal growth to get real growth. But when prices are falling, deflation is added to nominal growth to come up with real growth. Therefore, under Japan's old method which overstated deflation, real G.D.P. also tended to be overstated. 
 Although many economists say the new calculation should produce more accurate figures, the frequent revisions to past figures have cast doubt on the latest figures. 
 ''The revisions have become a joke,'' Richard Jerram, an economist for Macquarie Securities wrote in a note to clients. ''The release does not help to resolve the question of how much growth has slowed. Japanese G.D.P. is such a rapidly moving target it is hard to make a sensible comment on the latest version of history, as it is likely to change repeatedly in the future.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Board Close to Backing a Bidder for ATA Airlines

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
The federal board that was created to oversee loan guarantees to airlines after the Sept. 11 attacks is about to play a crucial role in determining the next phase of industry competition. 
 The Air Transportation Stabilization Board is preparing to endorse its choice to purchase some or all of the assets of ATA Airlines, the nation's 10th-largest airline and a unit of ATA Holdings, which sought bankruptcy protection this fall.
 As such, the board's staff members and its advisers have been in a position that brings to mind Don Corleone at his daughter's wedding in ''The Godfather.'' 
 Over the last few weeks, executives of various airlines have visited them, placed numerous phone calls and sent detailed proposals in hopes of winning the board's favor. 
 The board's sway over ATA, a low-fare airline, is certainly not what Congress envisioned when it created the three-member loan board to oversee $10 billion in money for the struggling industry. And it is a situation that neither the airlines nor the government finds comfortable.
 ''I think it's a bit awkward for everybody,'' said Joseph Leonard, the chief executive at AirTran Airways. It struck a tentative $90 million deal for some of ATA's operations this fall, but the bankruptcy court said it would consider other bids. 
 Gary C. Kelly, the chief executive at Southwest Airlines, said, ''It's definitely unwieldy.'' Southwest also expects to place a bid.
 Mark Dayton, the board's executive director, insisted that no matter what the board recommended, ATA and a federal bankruptcy court should decide what was best for the airline. 
 ''Though it looks on the surface like we have a lot of control, we are trying to stay in the background and let the private parties determine the outcome,'' Mr. Dayton said yesterday. 
 The initial courting concludes tomorrow when bids for the assets of ATA must be filed in Indianapolis. The offers will be opened next week, setting off an auction during which the bids can be modified. A decision is due next Friday.
 In addition to Southwest and AirTran, another low-fare airline, America West, is expected to bid, as are several investment firms. None of the nation's traditional airlines have expressed an interest, however.
 The outcome will change the shape of competition among low-fare airlines, whose share of the airline market has risen to nearly 25 percent this year from 6 percent in 1990. ''It's a significant moment for our industry,'' Mr. Leonard said.
 The board is involved because ATA owes $140 million on a package of federally backed loans, secured by the airline's cash and collateral like airplanes, gates, routes and other assets. Given that, the board's endorsement will be a significant factor in deciding who gets control of the airline's assets. 
 Mr. Dayton's comments aside, a hands-off approach is impossible, said Jan K. Brueckner, a professor of economics at the University of Illinois. 
 ''Once the government starts down the path of guaranteeing large sums to the airlines, it's inextricably wrapped up in these issues,'' Professor Brueckner said.
 The matter is complicated by the different bids. AirTran is vying to buy ATA's 14 gates at Chicago Midway airport, plus operations at La Guardia and Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington. That would leave ATA with its Indianapolis home base, as well as flights on the West Coast, and its military charter business.
 Southwest, meanwhile, is interested in half a dozen of ATA's Chicago gates, to go with the 19 it already has there. America West has said it wants to bid for all of ATA, although a spokeswoman said yesterday that the airline had not made a final decision. 
 ''It's not apples to apples, it's apples to oranges to grapes to pears,'' Mr. Dayton said. ''Everyone is coming in with different valuations and priorities.''
 From a financial point of view, the most attractive bidder would clearly be Southwest, which is expected to be the only profitable company this year among the nation's airlines. 
 Rather than send lawyers or finance experts to plead the airline's case, Mr. Kelly, the chief executive, walked the loan board's staff through the company's bid at a recent meeting. 
 ''It's important for us to understand what their needs are and for them to understand how we're thinking about a potential bid,'' he said.
 Southwest's plan would give it 25 out of 43 gates at Midway, making it by far the airport's dominant player. But that could give pause to the Justice Department, which will be involved in the matter because of antitrust concerns.
 AirTran officials, meanwhile, have been talking to the board's staff for weeks, said Mr. Leonard, trying to ''show them the benefit to ATA and the industry with our plan.''
 But AirTran's offer is not enough to cover the outstanding balance on ATA's federally backed loans. Assuming that ATA used some of the proceeds to run its operations, ATA would still owe the government the difference, only it would have to pay it from a smaller operation.
 An America West bid would create a big low-fare player, but it could raise government eyebrows, too. America West owes $123 million on its loan guarantee package, and the government also holds warrants that it can exchange for America West stock. Further, America West needs the loan board's permission to bid for ATA, which had not yet been granted as of yesterday.
 For his part, Mr. Dayton envisioned that several of the airlines ultimately could team up to make joint bids, dividing up the assets and presumably the burden of the outstanding loans. Once the offers have fallen into place, the board will make its pick, he said.
 Mr. Leonard said he knew the board's endorsement would be based on more than just routine business concerns.
 ''At the end of the day, they've got to look out for the taxpayer first, and the airline second,'' he said of the board.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Chart: ''Why ATA Has Suitors''ATA Airways is the nation's 10th largest airline, with its main operations in Indianapolis. What makes the airline attractive to potential bidders?LOCATION -- ATA has flights to major destinations, including Chicago, New York, Washington and Hawaii. America West wants to be in more leading markets.GATES -- It is difficult for airlines to acquire gates at major airports. Either they must strike agreements with federal and local governments and with airport authorities, or they have to buy gates from other airlines. This is a major reason AirTran is interested in ATA.COMPETITION -- Buying all or part of ATA would reduce the competition among low-fare airlines and would allow an airline like Southwest to dominate some airports, including Chicago Midway.

HEADLINE: Bastion of Cockfighting Is Under Pressure to Ban It

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: SOCORRO, N.M. 

 BODY:
First it was the actress Pamela Anderson who angered New Mexico's cockfight enthusiasts.
 In a letter to Gov. Bill Richardson in October, Ms. Anderson expressed support for a proposal to forbid cockfighting throughout the state, declaring, ''The whole country is watching, especially Hollywood, which your office actively courts for the film business.'' The letter was released by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and was quoted in newspapers all around New Mexico, one of only two states, with Louisiana, that have not banned cockfighting. 
 Next it was the HBO talk show host Bill Maher, who wrote in a public letter in November: ''Cockfighting let's see, blood, violence and illegal gambling -- sounds more like a Scorcese film than a sport. If this is how you treat your athletes, no wonder you don't have a major league baseball team.''
 New Mexico may not have any major league teams, but members of the New Mexico Game Birds Association, the state's largest cockfighting advocacy group, say it is proud of the sports it does have. One is cockfighting, a practice, particularly popular among Hispanics, that is believed to have originated in ancient Greece and Persia, pitting gamecocks against each other with metal spurs attached to their legs. The birds often fight to the death.
 Massachusetts was the first state to ban cockfighting, in 1836, and has been followed by 47 others. But New Mexico's ''galleros,'' as cockfighting practitioners here call themselves in Spanish, are determined that their state will not be next, even as they face their strongest challenge yet from animal rights activists and some celebrity friends.
 ''I oppose abortion, but I'm not going to tell Pamela Anderson or even my daughter not to get one -- it's their choice,'' said Louisa Lopez, who operates one of New Mexico's largest cockfighting pits, the Gentlemen's Arena Game Club, on the outskirts of Socorro, a small town south of Albuquerque. ''So who are these outsiders telling me what to do? Who are they to come here with their ideas of what's right and what's wrong?''
 Even the most fervent galleros -- or cockers, as they are called in English -- acknowledge that their opponents are on a roll. In November, the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to Oklahoma's cockfighting ban, enacted in 2002. That choice by the justices placed New Mexico and Louisiana in the cross hairs of groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and Animal Protection Voters. 
 The activists' efforts appear to have touched a nerve, however, with people in New Mexico's cockfighting pits, its Legislature and even the governor's office. Many are unhappy with what they perceive as meddling by outsiders.
 ''I'm officially undecided on the issue, but I don't believe it merits the attention it's received,'' Governor Richardson said in an interview. ''Every time it's introduced it distracts from pressing issues like access to health care or drunk-driving fatalities, serious problems affecting our population.''
 ''But it goes beyond distraction sometimes,'' he said. ''Some of the implied threats coming from these Hollywood personalities are condescending and insulting.''
 New Mexico's cockfighting season gets under way in December and usually lasts through July. The new season coincides with what is expected to be the reintroduction of a bill in the Legislature to ban the sport; hence the noticeable increase in lobbying activity by Ms. Anderson, Mr. Maher and other opponents.
 Many of the estimated 10,000 New Mexicans who breed gamecocks describe cockfighting as a part of the state's culture, dating from Spain's colonization of this part of the Southwest four centuries ago. Ronald Barron, president of the New Mexico Game Birds Association, noted that it was a practice shared with other former Spanish possessions where it remains common, like Puerto Rico, Guam, Mexico and the Philippines.
 ''We're a wild frontier kind of state,'' said Mr. Barron, a former oil field worker, ''and some of the people who come here like the physical beauty of the place, but they frown on the people.'' 
 ''I find this ironic and a little sad,'' he said, adding that cockfighting generated about $50 million a year for New Mexico's economy.
 Cockfighting has never been for the faint of heart. It is usually associated with frenzied gambling, as the anthropologist Clifford Geertz pointed out in his classic essay on the sport, ''Notes on the Balinese Cockfight.'' Purses in New Mexico can reach more than $10,000, making the loss of a prized gamecock, bred through generations of pedigree to fight to the death, a risk that most galleros are prepared to take. 
 Nor is cockfighting the only practice involving roosters that some outsiders would find shocking. Another, common in some Hispanic villages or Indian pueblos until a couple of decades ago, was ''correr el gallo,'' the rooster pull, in which the bird was buried up to its neck in a dirt mound and men on horseback competed to uproot it. The rooster was usually killed in the process.
 To be sure, many New Mexicans do not agree that cockfighting should be preserved, or even portrayed as a part of the state's heritage. Martin Chavez, the mayor of Albuquerque, has called it barbaric.
 ''The idea of putting razor blades on the feet of these birds and allowing them to tear each other up is obscene,'' the mayor said.
 Though Mr. Chavez supports a ban, he acknowledges that earlier efforts to enact one have been accorded little importance, with the required legislation handed off to freshman lawmakers as a way of testing their mettle with one of the state's more fragile issues.
 Some legislators suggest that a statewide ban is not needed, since individual counties have the power to adopt their own. In fact, 13 of them have already done so, making cockfighting a misdemeanor. Making the practice a felony, which would be expected under a state ban, might prove too delicate a matter in the 20 counties that now consider it legal, particularly along the Mexican border, where it is most prevalent.
 ''I've seen rooster fights used to determine who's running for school board or who's coming out on top in a disputed cattle sale,'' said Benjie Regensburg, a legislator from the northeastern town of Cleveland who is an outspoken opponent of a ban.
 Mr. Regensburg said a poor state like his had issues far more important than whether to forbid cockfighting.
 The sport's critics, he declared, ''say it's brutal, but these are people who value the life of a rooster more than a human being.''


CORRECTION-DATE: December 11, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about a debate over whether to ban cockfighting in New Mexico misspelled the surname of the film director whose work was cited by the talk show host Bill Maher in a gibe about the ''blood, violence and illegal gambling'' of cockfighting. He is Martin Scorsese, not Scorcese.

HEADLINE: A Secretary for Farmland Security

BYLINE: By Victor Davis Hanson. 
Victor Davis Hanson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, was a farmer for several years and is the author of ''The Land Was Everything.''

DATELINE: Fresno, Calif. 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH'S selection of a new secretary of agriculture, Gov. Mike Johanns of Nebraska, comes as American agriculture is at a dangerous crossroads. Despite government subsidies and technological advancements, the United States could soon become a net importer of food for the first time in about 50 years. 
 In part because of Nafta and globalization, consumers often find that it is cheaper to eat tomatoes from Mexico or dried fruits from Asia or Africa than what is grown a few miles away. Meanwhile, especially in the fast-growing states of the South and West, medium-sized farmers find that selling their land is more profitable than cultivating it. Here in the San Joaquin Valley, amid some of the richest farmland in the nation, new houses dot the vanishing agrarian landscape.
 The Freedom to Farm Act of 1996 proved laughable. Although it was supposed to reduce government interference in agriculture and let farmers make more of their own decisions about what to plant, the law never really succeeded in weaning anyone off anything the government had to offer. The present administration sent $13 billion to roughly 700,000 American farms in 2002.
 Apparently the idea behind such subsidies was that globalization had allowed foreign farmers -- with inexpensive labor costs, few environmental regulations and little government oversight -- to dump cheap produce on the American market. That flood promised not merely increased competition, but the ruin of American agriculture altogether.
 Oddly enough, however, some producers that were most hurt by globalization -- growers of fresh, processed and dried fruits and vegetables -- received almost no subvention, and it is their farms that are most likely to be lost to residential development. Meanwhile, as the dollar falls and the world economy heats up, the market for subsidized American beef and dairy, soybeans, cotton and grains is on the upswing. This development calls into question the need for the billions paid out to profitable American agribusinesses in a time of war and deficits.
 As the next secretary takes office, he should consider both the changing role of American agriculture and the consequences of its decline. Subsidies are neither necessary nor desirable. They belie conservative faith in free markets, are distributed inequitably and are fiscally indefensible.
 In a time of global environmental interdependence and anxiety over security, we should insist on far more careful screening of imported food from all government agencies, and demand that our most productive farmland not be lost to suburbanization. Agricultural autonomy is not reductionist protectionism, but a way to avoid the type of petroleum dependence that has left us vulnerable to blackmail by illegitimate and dangerous regimes abroad.
 Mr. Johanns, who grew up on an Iowa family diary farm and is a former Democrat, should understand that answers are not to be found simply in more subsidies and huge export incentives to vertically integrated megafarms. Our farming future is far more complex than that. Agriculture is more than just feeding people; it is the historic center of bedrock American social and cultural values.
 As he assembles his staff, the new secretary should look to hard-nosed conservative farmers, in and out of government, both Democrats and Republicans, who would find ways to preserve farmland, promote local farmers markets, emphasize sustainable agriculture and rebuild rural communities. In this most dangerous period in our nation's history, agriculture remains our most precious resource.

HEADLINE: Steering California's Fight on Emissions

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
Fran Pavley, a soft-spoken, retired schoolteacher who went into California politics, probably never thought she would find herself defending the environmental credentials of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
 But these days, she has been a driving force behind a new battle against global warming. Last month, Ms. Pavley, a Democratic assemblywoman from Agoura Hills, visited Ottawa to seek Canada's help in pressing automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions. There was some skepticism from the press. As one local journalist put it, ''Doesn't your governor drive a Hummer?'' 
 Yes, Ms. Pavley gamely explained, but she was there with the Schwarzenegger administration's support, and the governor had even recently requested and received a special hydrogen-fueled Hummer built by General Motors. By the end of her visit, two top government ministers said they were poised to adopt their own tough plan. 
 It is safe to say Ms. Pavley, who drives a fuel-efficient Toyota Prius, has the auto industry's attention. 
 On Tuesday, automakers sued to block legislation she sponsored that would require a roughly 30 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks sold in California by the 2016 model year. 
 ''It's the most challenging regulation that's ever been proposed,'' Thomas C. Austin, a top industry consultant, said in describing its impact on the auto industry. Last month, Robert A. Lutz, General Motors' vice chairman, bemoaned the notion of a single state's trying to regulate global warming, a theory he has doubts about.
 ''What are they going to do,'' he said, ''put a bubble over California?''
 But Ms. Pavley, 55, says that California, as one of the world's largest auto markets, has an obligation to lead the way in North America. 
 ''Almost all nations, with the exception of ours are fully committed to reducing the impact and understand the consequences of not doing so,'' she said. 
 After 28 years in education, most recently teaching American history to eighth graders, Ms. Pavley said the linkage of climate change to worsening smog and increased rates of asthma was most troubling to her among a number of potential complications of global warming. 
 ''It's just critically important to California and the Central Valley and all the kids, with asthma skyrocketing,'' she said, mentioning the San Joaquin Valley, which is the state's prime agricultural region.
 Environmentalists see Ms. Pavley's legislation as the only current hope for curbing automotive greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, and by extension, reducing American oil consumption. The Bush administration has declined to join most other industrialized nations in adopting the Kyoto agreement on reducing global warming emissions.
 It is also in the early stages of rewriting fuel economy rules for sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in a way that it has acknowledged could actually increase oil consumption and make trucks less efficient. ''We're looking to state and other friendly jurisdictions to move the ball forward,'' said Daniel Becker, the director of the Sierra Club's global warming program in Washington. 
 The Pavley plan could put several states on a much different course from Washington. California has the unique authority to set its own air quality standards because they predated the federal Clean Air Act. Other states have discretion to choose California's air rules over those of Washington. As if the industry was not aghast enough at the nation's largest auto market adopting such a regulation, seven Northeastern states are following California and are likely to adopt the Pavley plan. And then there's Canada.
 ''The potential market force of Canada combining with California and the seven New England states,'' Ms. Pavley said, ''that would be 30 percent of the automobile market in Canada and the U.S. combined.''
 Pressure from so many regions, she said in an interview shortly before the industry filed suit this week, might ''convince the automobile manufacturers to work with us, to send in their engineers and not their lawyers.''
 For now, it's the lawyers. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars are largely a byproduct of their fuel economy, so regulating emissions like carbon dioxide would indirectly require automakers to improve fuel efficiency significantly. Since the federal government has sole authority to regulate fuel economy, Toyota, G.M. and several other automakers contend in their lawsuit that California is stepping on Washington's turf. 
 ''It's pre-empted by federal law,'' said Eron Shosteck, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a lobbying group which filed the suit. ''It's something that needs to be done at the national or international level.''
 California lawmakers say the regulation is focused on harmful emissions and is well within the state's authority. 
 ''We have the legal ability to do this under the Clean Air Act,'' Ms. Pavley said. 
 Environmental groups say the regulation can be met with technology already available and not even as complex as the kinds of hybrid electric vehicles made by Toyota, Honda and Ford. 
 Automakers say they will have to stop selling some of their largest sport utility vehicles in the state. Domestic automakers rely on big truck sales and could be particularly vulnerable. Industry experts say the regulation will add about $3,000 to the upfront cost of the average car or truck. State regulators say it will cost far less, about $1,000, and be more than made up for over time by spending less at gas stations. 
 Stephane Dion, the Canadian environmental minister, said soon after his recent meeting with Ms. Pavley that the Big Three automakers, which have a substantial presence in Canada, were not helping themselves by letting Asian competitors lead innovation.
 ''The company taking the most market now is Toyota,'' he said, ''so I think it's an indication that it's the first movers who are winning in this world.''
 Ms. Pavley's interest in politics blossomed during a 15-year tenure as the part-time mayor of Agoura Hills, a small suburb west of Los Angeles in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains; her assembly district includes well-known Malibu residents like Barbra Streisand and Tom Hanks. Three weeks into her first term in 2001, she was approached by a small environmental group, Bluewater Network, which drafted the bill and was shopping for a sponsor. 
 ''We couldn't get anyone else,'' said Russell Long, the group's executive director. ''I don't think she had any idea of the controversy and the high visibility this bill would engender.''
 Ms. Pavley, who has a master's degree in environmental planning, concurs. Auto dealers and lobbying groups campaigned against it and ran print ads and radio spots claiming it would lead to higher gas taxes, lower speed limits and fees on gas guzzlers -- all proposals prohibited in the final language of the legislation. Two Los Angeles disc jockeys even led a caravan of S.U.V. drivers to Sacramento and heckled government officials outside their offices with a megaphone.
 ''They would jam phone lines in the offices with all their listeners,'' Ms. Pavley said. ''They could generate a couple hundred phone calls an hour.''
 The legislation, which passed in 2002 and was signed by Mr. Schwarzenegger's Democratic predecessor, Gray Davis, has the backing of the current governor, who has been shoring up his environmental credentials. The final details of the regulation were approved in September by the California Air Resources Board, which is appointed by the governor. 
 ''He hopes the car companies will see the light,'' said Terry Tamminen, California's cabinet secretary and a top adviser to the governor, in an interview last week. Mr. Tamminen is also a friend of Ms. Pavley's and was a co-host of one of her first political fund-raisers. 
 ''She has really tried to keep the temperature down, even though automakers and car dealers have been a little hysterical about the potential outcomes,'' he said. ''She tries to be respectful, but like a good schoolteacher, she doesn't hesitate to correct people's misimpressions.''

HEADLINE: SNOW TO REMAIN TREASURY'S CHIEF, WHITE HOUSE SAYS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Edmund L. Andrews, Elisabeth Bumiller and Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
President Bush asked Treasury Secretary John W. Snow on Wednesday to remain in his job, the White House said, after weeks in which Republicans close to the White House had talked openly about his impending departure and said administration officials were interviewing possible successors.
 While White House officials did not say how long Mr. Snow might stay on, the announcement came after Mr. Bush and his top aides determined they had to put a stop to an embarrassing public breach over who should occupy the nation's most central economic policymaking post, several officials said.
 With the dollar hovering at historic lows against the euro and Mr. Bush preparing for a two-day meeting next week to lay out economic strategy for the next term, one senior administration official said that ''this was no time to send a signal of uncertainty.'' 
 Scott McClellan, Mr. Bush's press secretary, said that the president told Mr. Snow, a former railroad executive, last Thursday that the two men needed to meet but that the session could not be arranged for the next six days, long after Mr. Bush asked Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld to stay in his post. Mr. McClellan said that news articles quoting unidentified Republicans and administration officials about Mr. Snow's impending departure, including one in The Washington Post on Nov. 29 and another in The New York Times on Monday, did not reflect Mr. Bush's thinking.
 ''The president thinks he's done a great job,'' Mr. McClellan said of the Treasury secretary.
 But other officials said Vice President Dick Cheney had felt out or interviewed potential candidates for the job. The White House apparently did not warm to the alternatives, who included former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Gerald L. Parsky, a wealthy lawyer and venture capitalist who served as an assistant Treasury secretary in the Ford administration.
 In the endless Washington speculation games, others named as possible candidates included Wall Street veterans like Stephen A. Schwarzman and Henry M. Paulson Jr., and Mr. Bush's own chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., who was the man reassuring Mr. Snow that his job was safe.
 Mr. Snow made no comment Wednesday, but his spokesman, Robert Nichols, said, ''The secretary is honored to serve the president and help implement his economic agenda.''
 While Mr. Snow was regarded in the White House as a loyal member of the team, senior Republicans and many investors with close ties to the administration worried that he had never learned the art of talking to the markets and that he was not a forceful formulator of economic policy.
 Hours after the White House announcement regarding Mr. Snow, Anthony J. Principi, the secretary of veterans affairs, became the ninth member of Mr. Bush's cabinet to submit his resignation.
 The handling of Mr. Snow and the public uncertainty about his future was in sharp contrast with the way the other cabinet changes announced to date have been choreographed, with resignations announced one day and nominees announced just a day later. Even the most politically fraught departure, that of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, came off relatively smoothly, leaving it murky whether Mr. Powell had truly tired of the job or the White House had tired of his dissenting views. 
 But the decision about the Treasury secretary is the one the markets have been watching, because it comes at a time of considerable economic uncertainty. The dollar has fallen to record lows against the euro, and Mr. Snow's less-than-forceful comments about the administration's policy have left investors convinced the administration is content to live with a weak dollar, as a way of increasing exports and shrinking the trade deficit. 
 The dollar's steep fall has also come at a time of rising interest rates, driven by signs that inflation may be returning. That combination has many market experts and some of the Treasury's own professionals, who lived through the Latin American and Asian financial crises, concerned that Washington could be headed into another era of global financial instability.
 In the 1980's and the 1990's, in part because of its role in managing those crises, the Treasury was one of Washington's most important power centers, and a central player in the diplomacy of the nation. But in the last four years, its influence has withered, first under the leadership of Paul H. O'Neill, who was fired two years ago, and then under Mr. Snow, who has largely been seen as a salesman for White House policies.
 The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial Wednesday that no matter what Mr. Snow's fate, the White House needed to change the balance of power. ''A Treasury Department is a terrible thing to waste,'' it concluded.
 Mr. Snow has enthusiasts in Washington beyond the president, including Grover Norquist, who heads Americans for Tax Reform, a group that has embraced Mr. Bush's tax-cutting agenda. 
 ''What was so bizarre about the last 10 days,'' Mr. Norquist said, ''is that, of course, while he wanted to stay and, of course, the president wanted him to stay, somebody was leaking that he was on his way out.''
 The leaks were widespread and included signals from senior officials of the administration that it was no accident that Mr. Snow had not received the kind of presidential embrace that Mr. Rumsfeld was given. 
 As recently as Tuesday, some senior officials were questioning whether Mr. Snow had the political clout on Capitol Hill to push through Mr. Bush's ambitious economic agenda, starting with an effort to overhaul the ailing Social Security system, creating private accounts for younger workers. It will cost hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars over the next decade, and one senior official said this week that ''the debate is whether John is the right man for that project.'' 
 ''I have no idea what they're doing,'' said one senior Republican who is close to the White House and was tangentially involved in the discussions. ''I think things got out ahead of them with respect to Snow, and they've got this economic conference, and I don't know how they could have the conference without the secretary of the Treasury there. It doesn't look too pretty to me.''
 Some conservatives promoted Mr. Gramm, arguing that he had more than two decades of experience in Congressional battles over tax cuts and that he would be a tougher infighter than Mr. Snow. 
 ''He so clearly would be the right person in the right place at the right time,'' said Daniel Mitchell, head of tax policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. ''The president has to his credit taken on two very big tasks, and you better be sure that he has not just the A-team but the A-plus team.''
 Though Mr. Snow was seen by some as lacking charisma, with a tendency to repeat his basic stump speech, he rarely roiled the markets with gaffes about exchange rates and never even hinted at disagreements with the administration's broad goals. That was in sharp contrast to his predecessor, Mr. O'Neill, who got off to a bad start as treasury secretary by expressing doubt about the need for big tax cuts, opposed Mr. Bush's decision to put temporary tariffs on steel imports and then participated in the writing of a book highly critical of the administration. 
 Mr. Snow had made it clear to associates in the past that he did not plan to stay for Mr. Bush's entire second term. By staying on for at least part of the term, Mr. Snow hoped to play a bigger role in setting the agenda for taxes and Social Security, administration officials said.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Chief Signs Press Law Some See as Aimed at His Critics

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela signed a new law on Wednesday that would permit the government to censor news reports.
 Advocates of press freedom said the measure was aimed at silencing the most defiant critics of Venezuela's leftist government.
 The new law, vaguely worded and open to wide interpretation, prohibits scenes of violence and sex during daylight hours, which government officials say is necessary to shield children from harmful broadcast programming. But that provision, critics say, would allow the government to ban news reports of violent protests or government crackdowns. 
 The law, which outlines 78 possible infractions, also stipulates that the news media cannot put out reports that endanger national security or incite disruption of public order.
 ''This law is so vaguely defined, with so many clauses and so broad, that it is like a loose-fitting strait-jacket on a patient, one that can be easily tightened when necessary,'' Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, said by phone from Washington.
 The law details rules governing violence, sex and lewd language in programming, measures that Teodoro Petkoff, a newspaper editor and political analyst, says would normally lead to few objections. Infractions are punishable with fines.
 But Article 29 of the 35-article piece of legislation, Mr. Petkoff says, is ''venomous,'' permitting suspension of a broadcaster's license for a range of broadly defined violations.
 ''It is sufficiently vague, sufficiently broad, so that anything fits in there,'' said Mr. Petkoff, a former leftist guerrilla who edits Tal Cual, an irreverent Caracas daily. ''This is a dangerous article.''
 The government, however, insists that the law is necessary to tame fiercely anti-Chavez broadcast stations whose owners and managers form a radical wing of a coalition of antigovernment groups that has tried to oust the president through a coup and four economically devastating national strikes.
 The private media in Caracas blacked out coverage of the uprising that reinstalled Mr. Chavez in power two days after his overthrow in 2002, in an effort intended to save the interim government of Pedro Carmona that briefly took power. And after Mr. Chavez won a recall referendum, which his opponents engineered last August, the press maintained for weeks that he had won through fraud even as the charge appeared increasingly baseless after international monitors declared the result legitimate
 Faked reports damaging to the government are not unusual, and typical programming usually features long lines of antigovernment leaders, rarely impartial observers. 
 ''This law is now beginning to liberate the people of Venezuela from the dictatorship of the private media owners,'' the president said Tuesday in a fiery speech.

Air Board Near Decision On Bidder for ATA Assets
The Air Transportation Stabilization Board is preparing to endorse its choice of an airline to buy some or all of the assets of ATA Airlines, which is in bankruptcy protection.

HEADLINE: The Suicide Supply Chain

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
From what I can tell from the new organizational flow chart for U.S. intelligence that Congress adopted yesterday, it is a god-awful combination of new titles and jobs at the top, without clear lines of authority to the people on the ground. One thing I've learned from 25 years in the newspaper business (which is just another form of intelligence gathering) is this: Whenever you add a new layer of editors on top of reporters, and don't get rid of some of the old layer of editors, all you get is trouble. You get less intelligent.
 The right way to improve U.S. intelligence is to get more people on the ground who speak the languages we need and who can think unconventionally. If that sounds blindingly obvious to you, it is, but it is precisely the shortage of such people that explains to me America's greatest intelligence failure in Iraq -- a failure we are paying for dearly right now. You see, we didn't invade Iraq too soon. We actually invaded 10 years too late. 
 Let me explain: America's greatest intelligence failure in Iraq was not the W.M.D. we thought were there, but weren't. It was the P.M.D. we thought weren't there, but were. P.M.D., in my lexicon, stands for ''people of mass destruction.'' And there were far more of them in Iraq than anyone realized. The failure of U.S. intelligence to understand what was happening inside Iraqi society during the decade-plus of U.N. sanctions that preceded our invasion is the key to many of the problems we've encountered in post-Saddam Iraq. 
 The U.N. sanctions pulverized Iraqi society -- a society already beaten down by an eight-year Iran-Iraq war, the war over Kuwait and some 30 years of Saddam's tyranny. As Saddamism and sanctions chewed up the Iraqi people during the 1990's, many people of talent left. Before the war, the Bush team told anyone who would listen that Iraq had the most talented secular elite in the Arab world. And it was right. The only problem was that during the 1990's many in that elite moved to Amman, Damascus, Beirut, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain and Cairo, where they worked as professors, music teachers and engineers.
 Meanwhile, back in Iraq, those who had no access to Baath Party privileges got steadily ground down. Many Iraqi youth, unable to connect with the outside world and unable to find jobs at home, turned to religion. Saddam encouraged this with a mosque-building program. By wrapping himself in an aura of Islam, Saddam also hoped to buttress his own waning legitimacy. So Wahhabi religious influence flowed into the Sunni areas from Saudi Arabia, as Iranian religious influence flowed into Shiite regions.
 You know all those masked Iraqi youth you see in the Al Jazeera videos, brandishing weapons and standing over some foreigner whose head they are about saw off? They are the product of the last decade of Saddamism and sanctions. Those youth were 10 years old when the U.N. sanctions began. They are the mushrooms that Saddam and the sanctions were growing in the dark. The Bush team had no clue they were there.
 These deracinated, unemployed, humiliated Sunni Iraqi youth are our biggest problem today. Some clearly have become suicide bombers. We can't say what percentage, because, unlike the Palestinians, the Iraqi suicide bombers don't even bother to tell us their names or do a farewell video for mom. They not only are ready to commit suicide on demand, but they are ready to do it anonymously. That bespeaks a very high level of commitment or psychosis, or both.
 I would estimate that U.S. forces have been hit with over 200 of these human missiles, and we still are not sure how they are recruited and deployed. What we are facing, I think, is a crude underground suicide supply chain -- a mutant combination of Wal-Mart and Wahhabism. 
 Its organizers appear to use word of mouth, and the Internet, to recruit suicide bombers from Iraq and the wider Muslim world. These bombers are ferried down the supply chain to bomb makers in the field, who get them wired up and deploy them against U.S. and Iraqi targets tactically.
 This is not haphazard. These bombings are timed for maximum effect. That means the insurgents are quite confident about their supply of bombers. It's just like Wal-Mart's supply chain: you buy an item in a Wal-Mart in Arkansas, and another one is immediately made in China. In Iraq, you deploy a suicide bomber in Baghdad, and another one is immediately manufactured in Mosul or Riyadh.
 When we have people in U.S. intelligence who can explain how that organizational flow chart works, I'll feel safer.

HEADLINE: A city seeks to sell itself, complete with a brand-identity campaign.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
IF the Super Bowl is America's annual midwinter festival of commercialism, it is only appropriate that the city playing host to the next one is introducing its first branding campaign.
 The campaign, which is to begin today, is intended to promote Jacksonville, Fla., where Super Bowl XXXIX will be played on Feb. 6, as a place to live and work. The campaign, in development for almost a year, is being timed to take advantage of the interest in Jacksonville generated by the coming Super Bowl, which has not been played there before.
 The multimedia campaign, being created by the Dalton Agency in Jacksonville, is indicative of a trend that is remaking a formerly prosaic category of advertising and marketing. Jacksonville is joining cities like Pittsburgh and states like Kentucky and Oregon that are seeking to speak with a single, brand-like voice for governmental departments like tourism, economic development, agriculture, commerce and education. The goal is to extend the idea of brand identity beyond its traditional role in selling consumer goods. 
 In this instance, the brand is ''Jacksonville. Where Florida Begins.'' In the logo, a shining sun replaces the ''o'' in Jacksonville. It was announced last night at the annual meeting of the Jacksonville Regional Chamber of Commerce by John Peyton, the mayor of Jacksonville, under whose direction the campaign was developed.
 In an interview on Wednesday during a visit to New York, Mayor Peyton, who took office in July 2003, said the genesis of the branding campaign was his experience with his family-owned business, the Gate Petroleum Company, whose holdings in seven Southeastern states include gasoline stations, convenience stores, real estate and construction materials. Gate, founded in 1960 by Mr. Peyton's father, Herbert, has been described as the largest privately held corporation in Florida.
 ''One thing I know from my background is that brand is everything,'' Mayor Peyton said. ''We spent decades cultivating a brand that has served us well.''
 With Jacksonville, by contrast, ''every agency -- the Chamber of Commerce, the convention and visitors bureau, the film commission, the sports commission -- has a different slogan,'' he said. ''We spend more than $20 million a year on uncoordinated marketing efforts, and this is meant to deploy that in a more focused, very consistent way.''
 To create the unified brand identity, Dalton, which was paid $91,000 by the city, undertook research across several fronts.
 ''We did a competitive analysis of 13 other cities, a lot of them in the Southeast, that we compete with for conventions, tourism, business and economic development,'' Jim Dalton, president and chief executive of Dalton, said in a telephone interview yesterday. The cities included Birmingham, Ala.; Charlotte and Raleigh, N.C.; and Tampa, Fla.
 ''We also did a media audit, a review of how the media reported on Jacksonville,'' he said, ''and we did focus groups and a survey.''
 The findings were somewhat surprising, Mr. Dalton said, because people said they ''were much more aware of Jacksonville'' than had been expected -- both because of the coming Super Bowl and because of the Jacksonville Jaguars football team, which began playing in 1995 -- ''but they didn't know where we were, or anything about us.''
 ''We'd overcome our identity crisis,'' he said, ''but we hadn't done a good job of explaining who or what we are.''
 The research told Dalton executives that a brand identity for Jacksonville ''needed to have Florida in it,'' Mr. Dalton said, not only to answer the geographic riddle but also to capitalize on the positive brand identity that already exists for Florida, despite the hurricanes this year.
 ''Florida is still a desirable place, and we have a lot of what Florida has to offer,'' he said. ''We tested 'Where Florida Begins' with some groups and they got the double meaning, that we're the first major city when you cross the border and we're also where it all starts.''
 The quest for a brand identity has attracted considerable attention within Jacksonville. Dalton, City Hall and local media have received scores of unsolicited suggestions for logos that ranged from plain (''Sun city of the South'') to put-on (''Like Mayberry, only bigger''). Some sounded as if they might have been written by George F. Babbitt (''Florida's crown jewel'') and some by the Grinch who stole Christmas (''Giant cockroach capital of the South'').
 Many residents believed the brand identity ought to refer to the bridges of Jacksonville, which is often called ''the river city'' because its downtown is divided by the St. Johns River. The National Football League made ''building bridges'' the theme of Super Bowl XXXIX and included a bridge on the game's logo. 
 ''Bridges are certainly not unique to Jacksonville,'' Mayor Peyton said in explaining why he preferred ''Where Florida Begins.'' ''The research told us that is where we have to hang our hat,'' he added, ''because that is where the positives are.''
 The media schedule for the brand-identity campaign is being worked out, Mayor Peyton and Mr. Dalton said. Prototypes for print advertisements and billboards have already been produced. And of course visitors to Jacksonville, taking part in the weeklong series of events that will culminate with the Super Bowl, will be greeted by copious reminders of ''Where Florida Begins.''
 An important element of the campaign is a new Web site (wherefloridabegins.com), which will serve as a Jacksonville portal, directing computer users to places like the official city Web site (www.coj.net) and the site for the convention and visitors bureau (jaxcvb.com). 
 Perhaps, if the brand identity takes root, Jacksonville may no longer need well-meaning measures like one Mr. Dalton described about a woman who recently moved there from Chicago: ''The day she left, at her going-away party, her co-workers gave her a cake with a map of Florida -- and a candle to show where Jacksonville is.''

HEADLINE: In Tardy Albany, A Torrid Finish

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
Something unusual happened in Albany this week: Things actually happened. 
 State lawmakers voted to raise the state's minimum wage to $7.15 an hour, overriding Gov. George E. Pataki's veto. Then the governor and the Legislature made up and reached compromises on two issues that have long eluded them: reducing some of the longest sentences meted out under the Rockefeller drug laws, and allowing the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on Manhattan's West Side to double in size. 
 The burst of activity ended a session that many had feared would go down as the least productive in memory, and it was partly a reaction to the gridlock that plagued Albany for much of the year. The three men who run the state -- Governor Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno -- all blinked, and all three gave up some of what they wanted in order to get a few big things done, to try to dispel the mounting criticism that state government is paralyzed. 
 That criticism -- from civic groups, business groups, elected officials, editorial pages and voters -- has begun to change the dynamic in Albany. The leaders of the Legislature, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno, are having to contend with their own members calling for changes in the legislative rules in ways that could weaken the leaders. And Governor Pataki faces the threat that Albany's problems could become an albatross around his neck as he weighs his future. His main potential rival, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, opened his own campaign for governor on Tuesday, declaring the state and its government in ''crisis.''
 So the three leaders decided that the best answer to the criticism of Albany was to show the public the spectacle of lawmakers actually making laws, and the executive vowing to execute them. But if the sudden break in the Albany logjam was motivated in part by growing cries for reform, the manner in which it was broken was eerily familiar with the traditional end-of-session rush. After meeting intermittently since January, they went from being stuck in traffic to speeding.
 The leaders negotiated secret deals behind closed doors. The lawmakers passed them without waiting for the three days of public debate required by the State Constitution. The advocates who later complained that the changes to the drug laws did not go far enough never had a chance to weigh in on the final bill. The financially troubled state agreed once again to circumvent the constitutional requirement that voters approve all borrowing by using state authorities to borrow at least $1.2 billion to pay for the Javits Center. And to sweeten the deal, lawmakers from outside the city were promised $350 million for ''economic development'' projects that have not even been identified.
 Still, there was a palpable sense of relief among elected officials -- and outsiders -- that something had finally gotten done in the Capitol. ''All in all, it was an eventful day,'' a somewhat surprised-sounding Governor Pataki announced Tuesday evening.
 Mr. Silver beamed as he explained how deals came together, rather than issue recriminations over how they fell apart. He said the legislators purposefully kept negotiations on the drug laws quiet. ''While we have kept this on the front burner,'' he said, ''a number of times I suggested let's not tell anybody that we're still negotiating this because we're embarrassed by the failure to produce a result.'' 
 Mr. Bruno said he had been motivated in part by the desire to answer the public criticism with action. ''There's a lot of criticism in this world of ours about gridlock,'' he said, explaining the burst of activity and the end of a session that was supposed to end in June. ''And it's a question of who's right and who's wrong, and nothing gets done. So it's time for us to change all that. So from our perspective, we're trying to send a message that we understand the public's reaction to gridlock.'' 
 The leaders of some civic groups said they feared that the state's leadership might think that by finally passing laws that affect people's lives, they might quiet calls for opening up the process in Albany by giving rank-and-file lawmakers greater roles, holding public hearings and issuing reports on major legislation, and ending the practice of rushing big bills through the system without any public debate.
 Barbara Bartoletti, the legislative director of the state's League of Women Voters, said she hoped the legislative leaders did not think they would be able to forestall efforts to open the process merely by showing that they can make progress. 
 ''If they think that, they're mistaken,'' she said. ''It was much, much too little. They changed the Rockefeller drug laws, they didn't reform it. And they certainly did nothing on budget reform -- the governor twisted their arms right out of their sockets on budget reform.''
 Indeed, to get work done on other priorities, the Senate decided to postpone action on the main issue that many of its members campaigned on in November -- overhauling the budget process that has yielded late budgets for 20 consecutive years. Their problem was that almost all of them had campaigned for re-election in November as budget reformers, and after Governor Pataki vetoed their bill to change the budget process, they had pledged in writing to override his veto this week. So they agonized over their course of action for more than five hours on Tuesday. 
 Mr. Bruno said that his fellow Republicans in the Senate had been unanimous in wanting to override the governor's veto. But he urged them to hold off, because he believes that negotiations with the governor on a new budget measure will prove fruitful and because overriding the governor two days in a row could have imperiled their efforts to reach compromises on issues like the Rockefeller drug laws and the Javits Center.
 In the end, after a heated conference, they agreed. But it was not easy, several Republicans said, especially for upstate Republican senators who have been battered for passing so many late budgets, and for whom the changes to the drug laws could be something of a liability, opening them to attacks for being ''soft on crime.''
 Mr. Bruno said he may call the Senate back later this year to take up budget reform again, and similar measures. The Assembly has been debating rules changes and reform measures of its own. 
 Of course, the most powerless groups in Albany are the minority parties in each house of the Legislature. One of them, the Senate Democrats, held a hearing on Wednesday on rule changes it would like to see. Senator Liz Krueger, of Manhattan, said she had to hold the hearing in a meeting room at the state's convention center because she was denied permission to use any of the Legislature's three hearing rooms in the Legislative Office Building. It was hard on Wednesday afternoon to see why, as two of the rooms sat dark and empty during her hearing, and a third appeared to be having some minor repairs done.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Increase; Import Prices Jump Higher

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
Jobless claims rose again last week, government data showed Thursday.
 In another report, import prices excluding petroleum posted the largest increase in 10 months, a possible early warning on inflation from the weaker dollar. And wholesale inventories rose sharply, which some economists said would help economic growth in the fourth quarter. 
 A Labor Department report said the number of Americans filing initial claims for jobless pay grew last week to 357,000. 
 Analysts had forecast that first-time claims for unemployment benefits would decline to 335,000 in the week ended Saturday from 349,000 the previous week, which was shortened by Thanksgiving Day. 
 A Labor Department official said an increase in claims in the week after a holiday was typical. 
 The four-week moving average of filings, which smoothes weekly fluctuations to provide a better picture of underlying trends, advanced 4,750, to 341,250.
 In a separate release, the Labor Department said that the price of imported goods in November rose 0.2 percent, slightly more than expected.
 Wall Street had forecast a 0.1 percent increase after a revised 1.6 percent gain in October. Export prices were up 0.3 percent compared with a 0.7 percent gain in October. 
 Prices of imports, excluding petroleum, increased 0.7 percent last month after declining 0.1 percent in October. It was the largest increase since January's 0.8 percent gain. Over the last 12 months, import prices excluding petroleum have risen 3.4 percent, the strongest gain since September 1995. 
 The Labor Department said higher natural gas prices were the largest contributor to the overall gain in nonpetroleum import costs. 
 Import prices can be influenced heavily by the foreign exchange value of the dollar, but the currency's two-year slide has had only a modest impact. Stiff competition has kept costs in check. 
 Prices of imported motor vehicles were up 0.2 percent from October and have increased 2.1 percent since November 2003. Consumer goods prices excluding autos rose 0.1 percent last month and 0.4 percent from a year ago. The Commerce Department said inventories at wholesalers rose 1.1 percent, more than twice what analysts had forecast.

HEADLINE: Borrow, Speculate and Hope

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com; Bob Herbert is on vacation.

 BODY:
''The National Association of Securities Dealers,'' The Wall Street Journal reports, ''is investigating whether some brokerage houses are inappropriately pushing individuals to borrow large sums on their houses to invest in the stock market.'' Can we persuade the association to investigate would-be privatizers of Social Security? 
 For it is now apparent that the Bush administration's privatization proposal will amount to the same thing: borrow trillions, put the money in the stock market and hope.
 Privatization would begin by diverting payroll taxes, which pay for current Social Security benefits, into personal investment accounts. The government, already deep in deficit, would have to borrow to make up the shortfall. 
 This would sharply increase the government's debt. Never mind, privatization advocates say: in the long run, they claim, people would make so much on personal accounts that the government could save money by cutting retirees' benefits. Financial markets won't believe this claim, as I'll explain in a minute, but let's temporarily grant the point.
 Even so, if personal investment accounts were invested in Treasury bonds, this whole process would accomplish precisely nothing. The interest workers would receive on their accounts would exactly match the interest the government would have to pay on its additional debt. To compensate for the initial borrowing, the government would have to cut future benefits so much that workers would gain nothing at all.
 How, then, can privatizers claim that they could secure the future of Social Security without raising taxes or reducing the incomes of future retirees? By assuming that workers would invest most of their accounts in stocks, that these investments would make a lot of money and that, in effect, the government, not the workers, would reap most of those gains, because as personal accounts grew, the government could cut benefits. 
 We can argue at length about whether the high stock returns such schemes assume are realistic (they aren't), but let's cut to the chase: in essence, such schemes involve having the government borrow heavily and put the money in the stock market. That's because the government would, in effect, confiscate workers' gains in their personal accounts by cutting those workers' benefits. 
 Once you realize that privatization really means government borrowing to speculate on stocks, it doesn't sound too responsible, does it? But the details make it considerably worse.
 First, financial markets would, correctly, treat the reality of huge deficits today as a much more important indicator of the government's fiscal health than the mere promise that government could save money by cutting benefits in the distant future. 
 After all, a government bond is a legally binding promise to pay, while a benefits formula that supposedly cuts costs 40 years from now is nothing more than a suggestion to future Congresses. Social Security rules aren't immutable: in the past, Congress has changed things like the retirement age and the tax treatment of benefits. If a privatization plan passed in 2005 called for steep benefit cuts in 2045, what are the odds that those cuts would really happen?
 Second, a system of personal accounts, even though it would mainly be an indirect way for the government to speculate in the stock market, would pay huge brokerage fees. Of course, from Wall Street's point of view that's a benefit, not a cost.
 There is, by the way, a precedent for Bush-style privatization. One major reason for Argentina's rapid debt buildup in the 1990's was a pension reform involving a switch to individual accounts -- a switch that President Carlos Menem, like President Bush, decided to finance with borrowing rather than taxes. So Mr. Bush intends to emulate a plan that helped set the stage for Argentina's economic crisis.
 If Mr. Bush were to say in plain English that his plan to solve our fiscal problems is to borrow trillions, put the money into stocks and hope for the best, everyone would denounce that plan as the height of irresponsibility. The fact that this plan has an elaborate disguise, one that would add considerably to its costs, makes it worse. 
 And maybe the fact that serious financial experts, the sort qualified to be Treasury secretary, understand all this is the reason why John Snow has just been reappointed.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. CONSIDERS PROPERTY DEALS TO REDUCE DEBT

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE and MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
In an effort to raise more than $1 billion, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority wants to sell or lease for commercial use many of its 14,000 properties, including train stations, commuter parking lots and maintenance yards.
 The move to raise money comes as the agency, struggling to deal with a growing fiscal crisis, is expected to vote next week to increase fares. In a separate step to help the authority, state officials are also considering taking up to $1 billion a year in sales tax revenue that goes to New York City and instead giving it to the authority, people briefed on their discussions said yesterday.
 As part of its proposal to raise money from its huge portfolio of properties, the authority is looking to hire a real estate consultant and broker to review its landholdings and buildings and draw up a plan for marketing them to developers and business owners. The agency has already solicited proposals to renovate a handful of historic train stations in the suburbs to accommodate retail shops and offices, similar to what it has long done at Grand Central Terminal. 
 At the Hastings, Pelham, Port Chester, Spring Valley, Tarrytown, Tuckahoe and Yonkers stations on the Metro-North Railroad, for example, the authority wants to retrofit the entire buildings for commercial use, with the exception of space for a ticket booth, rest rooms and a public waiting area. The authority said the distinctive antique stations, some with tile or slate roofs, offer businesses an ''excellent opportunity to quickly create an acknowledged presence in each community.''
 In an 11-page request for proposals from real estate consultants that was issued last month, the authority said it was also interested in promoting development opportunities at other stations and parking areas on the Metro-North and Long Island lines, as well as ''all rail yards, fan plants, substations, bus depots'' and other properties belonging to the New York City Transit system. 
 The attempt to generate revenue from its vast real estate holdings is the latest example of unorthodox steps pursued by the transportation authority and government officials to deal with a growing financial crisis that has forced the authority to consider a mix of fare increases and service cuts when its board meets next week.
 Katherine N. Lapp, the authority's executive director, said in an interview this week that by turning its attention to real estate, the authority hopes to raise $1 billion for its capital budget from the sale of property and air rights over authority-owned yards, as well as money for its operating budget from the stepped-up leasing of train stations for shops and offices.
 ''Given this agency, and the demands we have to meet, no stone can be left unturned,'' Ms. Lapp said. ''A billion dollars is a real aggressive target. But it is possible. We've got to try, and that's what this request for proposals is all about.''
 The $1 billion goal, she said, includes estimated profits from the sale of air rights over rail yards in Brooklyn for a basketball arena for the Nets and on the West Side of Manhattan for a football stadium for the Jets. But Ms. Lapp said she could also envision, for example, selling parcels of surplus property for commercial development along the 1,000 miles of right-of-way the authority controls near commuter rail lines and bridges.
 By committing the proceeds of property sales to its capital budget, which finances the construction or improvement of physical assets, the authority would not be narrowing the multibillion-dollar gaps projected for its operating budget in the next few years. But it would allow the authority to avoid going further into debt by using the cash to pay for capital improvements, such as the purchase of new subway cars. 
 The authority's plan to raise fares and impose service cuts to close deficits in its operating budget has angered rider advocates and politicians, who say the state and city must increase their subsidies for mass transit and the authority should do more to cut administrative expenses. Any additional income from leases and rentals, which currently total roughly $200 million a year, would help balance the operating budget.
 Unlike some of its earlier initiatives, like the idea to sell naming rights, the real estate plan has elicited mostly positive reactions. Andrew Albert, who represents the New York City Transit Riders Council on the authority's board, said the transportation authority needs to seek all possible remedies for its fiscal quandary.
 ''It's probably a good idea,'' Mr. Albert said. ''They are facing a tremendous shortfall, and anything they can do, shy of cutting service or safety, it seems to me is prudent to do.''
 Roger A. Lowenthal, a senior vice president of the Greenberg Group, a real estate consulting service in Hewlett, N.Y., said there would be a limited number of retailers interested in renting space in a small suburban train station, although larger transit hubs, like Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central, are more attractive. At most stations, he said, the customer base is ''the breakfast crowd'' in the morning, rather than at night, when commuters are in a hurry to get home and would not take the time to hang around and shop.
 ''At the smaller stations, you have a steady base of Monday-through-Friday traffic, but it is limited because you're only going to get the people who go in and out of that specific station by train,'' Mr. Lowenthal said. ''From a retailer's perspective, it's a small percentage of the potential.''
 At the Pelham station, the authority recently signed a lease agreement with Houlihan/Lawrence, a Westchester County real estate company that is opening an office in a 500-square-foot part of the building that once housed a taxi stand. Stephen Meyers, the company's president, said Houlihan/Lawrence was paying for renovations needed for the new office, in keeping with requirements of the State Historic Preservation Office.
 ''Opening an office in a train station is definitely a little different, but that's part of the attraction,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''We saw it as an excellent opportunity to have an incredible presence in town, because so many people come through the train station every day.''
 While the plan to generate revenue from agency properties was devised by authority officials, Gov. George E. Pataki has also asked his administration to explore options to raise money for the agency. Although the administration has not signed off on any plan, one of the options they are weighing calls for taking $1 billion worth of the city's sales tax, which had been used to pay off the city's remaining debt from the 1970's, and giving it each year to the authority. 
 That money is no longer needed to pay off the remaining 1970's debt, since the State Legislature agreed in 2003 to pay it off over the next 30 years to help the city recover from the economic aftershocks of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks -- a move that Governor Pataki vetoed, and then unsuccessfully sued to stop after his veto was overridden. 
 And that part of the sales tax -- one percentage point -- is set to be phased out in 2008, when the law that shepherded the city through the fiscal crisis of the 70's expires. But the city is counting on getting the tax extended in its future financial plans.
 So if the money were to be diverted to the agency before or after 2008, it would have the effect of blowing a $1 billion hole in the city's budget, which is already facing multibillion-dollar shortfalls.
 Aides to Governor Pataki emphasized that while the administration is weighing many options, it had not settled on any plans or proposals yet. ''The governor hasn't made any decision, and there are any number of proposals out there,'' said Lisa Dewald Stoll, the governor's communications director. 
 But several people said that aides to the governor had mentioned the proposal to use the sales tax in recent discussions about how to carry the M.T.A. through its current crisis. 
 Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, declined to comment on the preliminary proposal. 
 But a city official said he had a hard time believing Governor Pataki would support such a plan. ''The bottom line is it would create a $1 billion hole in the city's budget,'' the official said. ''I don't think the governor's office would be interested in doing that.'' 
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who oversees the transit agency as the chairman of the Assembly's committee on corporations, authorities and commissions, said he was troubled by the proposal to get city taxpayers to bear the burden of keeping the transit system afloat.
 ''The governor has no right to punish the people of New York City to keep the transit system of New York City in good repair,'' he said.
 Last week, the agency's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, who was appointed by Governor Pataki, outlined his own proposal to increase a half-dozen business, real estate and fuel taxes to raise $900 million a year to help pay for the authority's five-year rebuilding program. His proposal got a cool reception in Albany.

HEADLINE: Greek Myths Expose Achilles' Heel of Europe's Common Currency

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
IT is when the stakes are highest that the numbers are most likely to be manipulated. That was proved in the United States by the corporate frauds that proliferated during the boom of the late 1990's, as the markets offered phenomenal rewards to companies -- and to option-rich executives -- who showed rapid growth in sales and profits.
 And now that lesson is being driven home in Europe. The difference is that it is not the governments that are belatedly waking up to fraud and trying to prevent future occurrences. In Europe it is the governments that stand accused of manipulating the numbers. 
 First, the European Commission suspects that Greece substantially understated both its debts and its deficits as it qualified to adopt the euro. Now we learn there are questions about Italy's reported figures back to 1997.
 It is not encouraging that this went on for as long as it did without anyone outside of government seeming to notice. There was much moaning about the lack of watchdogs to keep Enron and WorldCom honest, but there were investors who questioned their numbers, and those questions eventually had an impact.
 But in Europe secrecy prevailed. European statisticians who doubted Greece's numbers never went public with their questions. We are told that the commission has been questioning Italy for five months, but in a genteel way that did not let the public in on what was happening until someone leaked a document to The Financial Times. 
 If Italy's reported deficit figures for the last six years are correct, it is hard to understand why its national debt is as large as it is. But even before Italy explains, the European Commission is trying to minimize the problem. ''I am not expecting big revisions of the Italian figures,'' said Joaquin Almunia, the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs.
 In one sense it does not matter, because Europe can do little. It is threatening to sue Greece in the European Court of Justice, but all it is demanding is a promise to behave in the future. If Greece used fraud to enter the euro zone, the obvious penalty would be to boot it out of that zone until it really qualifies. But that is not on the table. Indeed, there is no legal way for any country to drop the euro.
 This brouhaha illustrates the limited but significant amount of sovereignty that members of the European Union that use the euro have given up. To adopt the euro, countries promised to limit their budget deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product, but the European Commission had very limited abilities to check to see if the numbers were accurate, and no real recourse if they were not. 
 Giving up that sovereignty was needed because establishing the euro reduces the role of the foreign exchange markets in policing excessive budget deficits. Had Greece been caught fudging its numbers to this degree when it had the drachma, that currency no doubt would have plunged on the news of the fudging. But the euro is strong these days, thanks to a weak dollar caused in part by (accurately reported) large budget deficits in the United States. 
 Many have doubted whether the euro could endure without more economic coordination among the nations, and some supporters of the common currency hope that it will lead to a federal Europe, with countries giving up most of their sovereignty. But the expansion of the European Union to 25 countries this year, with talk of adding Turkey later, makes a federal Europe far less likely.
 And that in turn adds to the importance of getting an effective way for Europe to control its finances and assure that a cascade of deficits do not destroy the currency as each country blames others for the problem. The Greek and Italian problems show just how far Europe is from finding a stable and credible way to deal with that issue.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Approves Budget, With Spending Set at 2004 Level

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey plans to spend $4.5 billion on operations and improvement projects in 2005 and an additional $4.1 billion on improvements in the following two years, according to a budget its board approved yesterday. 
 The Port Authority's commissioners, who are appointed by the governors of the two states, also approved, without any public debate, a plan to spend $280 million renovating Terminal B at Newark Liberty International Airport.
 Some of the money for that project is expected to come from a 50 percent increase in a fee charged to departing passengers at the three airports the agency operates. Officials hope to get federal approval to raise the fee on July 1 to $4.50 a ticket, from $3, they said. 
 The 2005 budget contains $1.7 billion to fix up transportation centers around the region, including $100 million to start building a permanent station for PATH trains at the site of the World Trade Center. 
 The budget is roughly equal to last year's, despite an expected $27 million increase in security costs and a slight decline in federal funding in 2005. 
 ''We need to establish our ability to manage our own business,'' said Anthony R. Coscia, the agency's chairman. He and other officials of the agency said they were proud to be ''holding the line'' on spending without reducing service or eliminating proposed improvements.
 The agency plans to borrow $1 billion in 2005 and expects to spend $609 million, more than $1 for every $5 of operating revenue, to service its debt.
 It also plans to find ways to cut other expenses to offset those rising costs without raising tolls on bridges or tunnels or fares on PATH trains in 2005. Mr. Coscia said he did not know how far beyond next year the agency could put off raising the price of commuting. Other transit operators, like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, are expected to raise fares.
 One way the Port Authority will save money will be the elimination of about 75 jobs from its work force of about 7,000, said Paul Blanco, the agency's chief financial officer. He said much of the agency's personnel savings would come from eliminating supplemental staff and consultants.
 But the proposal for Terminal B presented to the commissioners showed that the modernization plan would create 1,800 temporary jobs and 700 permanent positions. That project, intended to prepare the airport to accommodate 45 million passengers a year by 2021, up from 32 million this year, would begin in 2006 and be completed in 2009.
 ''It's to basically provide departure capability at the facility to match existing arrival capability,'' Mr. Coscia said.
 The Port Authority, which has its own police force that patrols the PATH, bridges and tunnels, expects to spend $355 million on security next year, up from $328 million in 2004. Kenneth J. Ringler, the agency's new executive director, said he could not divulge why those costs were rising.
 Mr. Ringler's staff also presented to the commissioners the outlines of a 10-year strategic plan to address the changing economy of the New York region. That plan was based on a projection of an influx of 2.4 million residents in the next 20 years. By 2025, it showed, the 17 counties the agency serves in southern New York and northern New Jersey would be home to 19.4 million people and 11 million jobs.

PERSON: THEODORE KHEEL

HEADLINE: From Labor to This Land, Ever the Mediator

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
HIS back is crooked and his pace is getting glacial, but no way will Theodore Woodrow Kheel, the labor lawyer and mediator whose resume contains a throwaway line about his participation in the resolution of more than 30,000 disputes, surrender to infirmity like a typical 90-year-old. No cane for him. 
 That would be crying uncle. Mr. Kheel, who props his reading glasses on his forehead like a pair of headlights and retains significant portions of his original hair and teeth, never cries uncle. Interesting, considering he has spent a lifetime persuading labor and management to do just that. 
 ''I've got spinal stenosis, which is something that, if you are lucky to live long enough, you get,'' he says, tartly parsing the pros and cons of longevity. Sitting takes the edge off, so he does plenty. But his mind stays on the prowl: ''You keep moving so you don't have time to stop and think about things that have changed about which you might have regrets.'' Like losing his wife late last year after 66 years of marriage. Dwelling on it makes his eyes water, so he doesn't. 
 He does not recommend retirement, either, which is why he shows up daily at his gargantuan wooden desk at the Paul, Hastings law firm in Midtown, where he is ''of counsel'' but spends most of his time shepherding, and bankrolling, a handful of environmentally oriented foundations. The auspicious aim of this late-in-life environmentalist is fixing the world, starting with New York City, or at least leaving it healthier by way of a truce between economic development and nature. Consider it the ultimate mediation.
 ''I want development and I want to protect the environment,'' he says. ''I want them both. The mediator is a friend of enemies. Your goal is agreement. It's a form of enlightenment, really, a religious ethic.''
 There probably are not many acts as exhilarating as giving away a million dollars, but Mr. Kheel did precisely that last week with a grant enabling the City University of New York to establish the Institute to Nurture New York's Nature at its Queens College campus. His pet cause, sustainable development, and his pet foundation, Nurture New York's Nature, will be cornerstones of the curriculum.
 ''Sustainable development is a brilliant resolution of the most serious problem facing the world,'' he says. ''In the long run, the destruction of the environment through industrial development is more serious than terrorism.'' 
 The CUNY event announcing the creation of the institute was one of several high-profile engagements on his winter agenda. 
 Last weekend he gave a cocktail party honoring the visiting president of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernandez. Mr. Kheel, who made multimillions of dollars from a ''quixotic'' investment in six miles of waterfront jungle there 35 years ago, now is an owner of the Puntacana Resort as well as an international airport, and he has the president's blessing for a Dominican-American cultural exchange project. 
 On Wednesday he held a holiday party for the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude, his longtime clients, to celebrate the culmination of ''The Gates,'' an art installation in Central Park that officially opens in February after 25 years of negotiations with the city. Mr. Kheel initially discouraged the artists from hiring him in 1979 because of his poisonous relationship with Mayor Edward I. Koch. When Mr. Koch sought his removal as the city's official arbiter of transit disputes after a 33-year tenure, Mr. Kheel, no slouch in the grandstanding department, threatened to run for mayor. He still dislikes Mr. Koch. Same goes for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which he has despised since it built the World Trade Center. Even legendary mediators can't like everybody. 
 Mr. Kheel, who in 1999 wrote the book on conflict resolution, ''The Keys to Conflict Resolution: Proven Methods of Settling Disputes Voluntarily,'' and was described by Business Week as a ''master locksmith of deadlock bargaining,'' wryly describes himself as ''superannuated.'' 
 President Bush doesn't summon him to Washington the way Lyndon Johnson did 40 years ago when a railroad strike loomed. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg doesn't pick his brain about touchy transit union negotiations over dinner at the ''21'' Club like Mayor Robert F. Wagner did. Mr. Kheel points out, for the record, that he paid the dinner tabs and the mayor covered the tips: ''He got all the thank-yous from the waiters and captains and busboys, and I got the bill.'' 
 HE still wines and dines the occasional politician, but instead of playing peacemaker to labor and management, he has turned to something a little more cosmic: nature versus human sprawl. His conversion to environmentalist occurred when he attended the United Nations-sponsored Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. It is his hope that the CUNY institute, and his other foundations, will be his surrogate and legacy when he is gone. When you're 90, wealthy, driven, have served four presidents and were named for two others, legacy matters: ''I have no intention of ever retiring.'' 
 Beyond sacrificing his squash game to a hip replacement and forsaking the empty family home in Riverdale for an apartment near the office, his only voluntary concession to age is sartorial. Since turning 80, he skips suits and ties in favor of offbeat get-ups anchored by Bohemian black turtlenecks; no wonder Christo and Robert Rauschenberg hired him. He's colorful, and surely the only guy in this fancy skyscraper on East 55th Street decked out in a mustard-and-cranberry-colored leisure suit. He even pulls it off. Break-the-mold types often do.

HEADLINE: Movie-Within-a-Movie, Mixed In With the Movie

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
The barely watchable buddy comedy ''L.A. Twister'' is so sloppily put together it bungles its recycled movie-within-a-movie conceit. Its fatuous pals, Lenny (Zack Ward), an unemployed actor who moonlights as a limo driver, and his best friend, Ethan (Tony Daly), a plumber left suicidally mopey after his wife deserts him, decide that the only way to break into films is by producing their own. 
 The product they create thanks to a last-minute windfall is the same B-movie comedy we're watching of their Hollywood misadventures. Excerpts from that product, ''Lenny and Ethan in L.A.,'' starring themselves (naturally), are crudely woven into the ''real'' story. It isn't easy to tell the ''real'' from the fictional, which is one of the comedy's unproductive jokes. 
 Both versions rely on stale, sexist sitcom cliches: the monstrously obese, female casting agent who manipulates young actors into sexual service by promising them juicy roles; the pretty starlet married to a rich, monstrous financier; the Christian cuties who live next door and play strip Scrabble; the thuggish entrepreneur who boasts, ''I know people who know people who know people'' and who later reneges on his financial promises; the actress whose screams of ''Yes, yes, yes!'' while winning at backgammon must be the umpteen-thousandth rip-off of Meg Ryan's yelps in ''When Harry Met Sally.'' 
 Even after he softens in the arms of Mindy (Jennifer Aspen), a classically trained actress married to a karate instructor, Mr. Ward's Lenny is an intensely disagreeable character: a stupid, selfish jive-talking ferret. Mr. Daly's dead-eyed Ethan suggests Keanu Reeves on Thorazine. 
 ''L.A. Twister'' is the first feature film directed by Sven Pape. Its aim is inches above the gutter.

'L.A. Twister'

HEADLINE: Museum Puts Life, Truth and, It Hopes, Sales in a Wine

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

DATELINE: MONTALCINO, Italy 

 BODY:
With a wine as famous as the Brunello di Montalcino made here -- and with a million tourists who come each year because of it -- you might expect the museum that opened in this ancient Tuscan hill town in November to be a shrine to luxury and prestige. But the exhibits are more ordinary: how local cobblers or dressmakers lived; a rustic pitchfork carved from a branch; records of Jews who settled in this part of Tuscany at least since the 13th century. 
 ''Maybe you like Brunello, maybe you don't,'' said Stefano Cinelli Colombini, one of the top producers of the wine, who is opening the museum at his winery here, Fattoria dei Barbi. ''But Brunello is unique. What we want to show is the connection between the wine, the territory and this culture. Brunello was created here by these people, who wore these dresses, who used these tools. Brunello cannot exist without them.'' 
 Sounds simple enough, but like the wine itself, it's a little more complicated: Mr. Colombini's quaint museum is also a craftier version of the sales pitch that Italian wine producers throughout the country's varied regions are making to revive the sagging demand for Italian wine: that, as some of them say, you are buying Italian culture in a bottle. 
 In the last few years, Italian wine exports have fallen by about 10 percent, a problem caused by a mix of the ever weaker dollar against the euro, which makes European products more expensive abroad, and continuing competition from good, less expensive wine from countries like Chile, Australia and South Africa. High costs in Italy -- and, some argue, greed on the part of winemakers -- makes cutting prices difficult. 
 So the Italian wine industry is deep in a campaign not to compete directly on price or quality, but to emphasize what is distinct, and distinctly Italian, about its wine: how certain Italian wines go with Italian food; the life and history in the places, like here in Montalcino, where wine is made; the almost uncountable strains of grapes particular to Italy.
 ''Ottavianello!'' declared Umberto Benezzoli, a wine expert, as he swirled a glass at a conference of more than 1,000 winemakers in Turin in October. ''Personally, I'd never heard of it until yesterday. It was on its way to extinction!''
 Ottavianello, it turned out, is the name of an obscure grape that a wine producer from the southern region of Apulia, Academia dei Racemi, found neglected in its vineyard -- and decided to turn into a varietal wine of its own, rather than blending it with others. The company's exports to the United States, an important market, have dropped in recent years from 30 percent of what it produces to less than 10 percent, and like other winemakers at the conference, it is looking for an edge by selling wine that could come only from Italy. 
 ''This kind of grape tastes of our territory,'' said Cosimo Spina, 43, the company's winemaker, whose hands were stained purple. ''You can't say the same of cabernet. That's French. It can't represent us.''
 The notion of marketing Italy as a land of unique history and culture is not exactly new. (James Joyce, living unhappily in Rome, once likened the nation's hawking of its past to a man ''exhibiting to travelers his grandmother's corpse.'') And, certainly, it is no guarantee of success. The almost fetishistic devotion to Tuscany among foreigners has not faded, but wine sales still have dropped. Some experts say that what Italy really needs is a more organized effort to cut prices and to simplify for foreign drinkers an already too complicated range of wines. 
 ''People are put off,'' said Michele Shah, a wine consultant and writer who helped organize the Turin conference. ''They don't know what they are drinking.''
 Here in Montalcino, sales do not seem to be an immediate concern for Mr. Colombini, even if this question of culture and wine certainly does. 
 It was a change in that culture that first inspired the museum two years ago. Montalcino, a town nearly emptied after a distant highway built in the 1960's replaced one that had enriched it since Roman times, has been flooded in the last two decades with outsiders as Brunello developed into one of Italy's best and most expensive wines, fetching $50 a bottle and up. Half of the 300 producers of Brunello, he said, are foreigners, as are half the town's 5,000 residents. 
 ''We had more or less an invasion,'' Mr. Colombini said. ''Now our problem is to save the tradition and character of our community and to share our culture with the newcomers.'' ''We want them,'' he added. ''But we need them to be a part of our culture.'' 
 So with the help of residents who scoured their attics, he collected 10,000 photographs of old Montalcino; the contents of typical houses of middle-class families and workers; tools from blacksmiths, cobblers (especially important on a stop along the old Roman road) and, of course, winemakers. 
 The new museum, which also will include a room for a bottle each from the 300 producers of Brunello, this month, provides a further attraction for a winery that already draws some 50,000 visitors a year. 
 Those are numbers that few Italian wineries can boast, yet each claims a local grape and a unique tradition in pressing, aging and bottling it. Italian vintners are banking on that singularity to attract new drinkers, shape tastes and, they hope, eventually lift sales. 
 ''It is impossible to think of the wine without the culture that generated it,'' Mr. Colombini said. ''That's the mistake of most technicians. They think that a wine is like a wheel, like a car you can build anywhere. They think wine is a technical thing. But it's not true.''
 ''You can produce a superb cabernet anywhere,'' he added. ''It's not a problem. But you can't produce this wine somewhere else.''

HEADLINE: Social Security: We Count on It

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 It should hearten me when Paul Krugman says Social Security needs no major changes for generations to come, as I do not stand to collect my first check until 2049. His conclusion relies on the trust fund, which is an accounting set-aside that lacks assets of its own to generate self-sustaining income.
 When benefits exceed the payroll tax receipts in 2018, as projected, the program's funds become a finite resource. From there, demography is destiny: a ballooning cohort of retirees will be dependent upon a relatively stable working-age population.
 Economists across the political spectrum say that our pay-as-you-go system is creating a huge legacy deficit. College students like me have begun to discover that our savings would be better stashed in our mattresses than sliced off our paychecks.

Two of the Ford Motor Company's most senior executives retired on Thursday in a sign that the company's deep financial crisis has abated, though serious challenges remain. Both men were succeeded by close colleagues in moves that had been rumored for some time. 
 Almost three years ago, Ford's chairman and chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., turned to a small group of longtime managers to resuscitate the company after posting a $5.5 billion loss in 2001. One of those executives, Sir Nicholas V. Scheele, 60, the president, will retire on Feb. 1. He will be succeeded by a close friend, James J. Padilla, 58, who is chief operating officer. Mr. Padilla will have both titles. 
 Allan Gilmour, 70, who was the company's vice chairman for finance, will also retire on Feb. 1. He came out of his first retirement at Mr. Ford's request in 2002. His current duties will largely be assumed by Don Leclair, 52, Mr. Gilmour's recent successor as chief financial officer, who will become an executive vice president. 
 Ford returned to profitability last year, and its earnings are expected to increase this year, but both Ford and its domestic rival, General Motors, have been weighed down by soaring health care costs and declining market share, particularly as Asian competitors have increased their offerings of sport utility vehicles and trucks. 
 ''If I look back and compare it with three years ago, I do feel pretty gratified,'' Sir Nicholas said. ''Then I look at it compared to where I'd like us to be and I'm pretty humbled. I'm schizoid about it.''
 ''Nobody better rest on their laurels for more than a nanosecond,'' he added. 
 Sir Nicholas is the chancellor of the University of Warwick in England, and he said he was eager to become more involved there. 
 ''It was only founded 40 years ago,'' he said. ''It doesn't have a foundation. I'd like to be a part of trying to assure that it gets that foundation.''
 Mr. Gilmour will return to his home in Vermont, where he and his nephew own a Ford dealership. 
 Among other things, he helped restore order in Ford Credit, the company's lending division and the main source of its profits. He has also spent the last several months broadly examining what Ford can do to mitigate its health care costs. 
 Asked whether he had found a solution to the nation's health care problems, he said, ''not fully, but as soon as I do I'll call.''

HEADLINE: Chip Maker Spurs Rally, Helping Shares to Modest Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded from early losses yesterday, closing higher after better-than-expected earnings from National Semiconductor eased investors' concerns over higher unemployment and rising oil prices.
 National Semiconductor's 22 percent increase in quarterly profit also offset poor sales from two other chip makers and helped technology shares achieve small gains. 
 The markets headed substantially lower in early trading because of troubling economic data before the chip maker reported its earnings. 
 ''You saw the markets just turn right around after National Semi released their figures,'' said Keith Keenan, vice president of institutional trading at Wall Street Access.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 58.59 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,552.82. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 6.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,189.24, while the Nasdaq composite index added 2.90 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,129.01.
 The rise in unemployment claims -- to 357,000 last week, an increase of 8,000 -- added to concerns lingering from Friday's disappointing job creation report. Wall Street expected the Labor Department to report 335,000 new claims.
 Crude oil futures rose for the second consecutive day. A barrel of light crude for January delivery settled at $42.53, up 59 cents.
 ''There isn't any conviction out there right now on the part of investors,'' said Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer at LPL Financial Services in Boston. ''They don't have the conviction that profits have staying power into 2005. They don't have much conviction that the economy's going to grow at a decent clip.''
 The good news from National Semiconductor, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, helped the Nasdaq move into positive territory. Technology stocks started the session lower after Xilinx and Altera, the two biggest makers of programmable chips, each reported a larger drop in sales than had been expected. National Semiconductor gained 79 cents, to $16.79, while Xilinx fell $1.01, to $29.72, and Altera decliined $1.73, to $20.47.
 Other chip companies lost ground. Intel declined 25 cents, to $22.76, and Advanced Micro Devices was down 80 cents at $22.10.
 The telecommunications equipment maker Ciena increased its sales forecast for the current quarter by 20 percent, and posted a lower-than-expected loss for the last quarter. Ciena climbed 54 cents, to $2.88.
 The home builder Toll Brothers surged $6.88, to $60.99, after profit increased 93 percent in the quarter and the company surpassed earnings forecasts by 25 cents a share.
 McDonald's gained 28 cents, to $31.78. It said sales at stores open at least a year rose in November.
 DreamWorks Animation SKG, in its first quarterly earnings report since going public, exceeded Wall Street profit forecasts by a penny a share, but it pushed back the release of ''Shrek 3'' by six months, to May 2007. DreamWorks Animation dropped $2.51, to $37.69.
 Costco Wholesale slid 80 cents, to $48.10, after it reported quarterly sales and earnings that were in line with Wall Street expectations, but its future guidance remained cloudy.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 8/32, to a price of 10026/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.15 percent from 4.12 percent on Wednesday.
 Following are the results of the auction of 10-year notes:

HEADLINE: Corporations In Brazil Shed Stay-at-Home Tradition

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
When Brazil began opening its economy in the early 1990's, companies worried that they would end up being pummeled on their own turf by deep-pocketed foreign rivals.
 It appears that those fears were overblown. Not only are many of Brazil's biggest companies riding high at home by deftly using their knowledge of the nation's huge domestic market to fend off competition from abroad, they are also increasingly flexing their muscles on the international stage. Many of them are buying assets and building factories in foreign countries that just a decade ago seemed out of reach to many in Brazil's traditionally inward-looking corporate sector. 
 Perhaps nowhere is this latter trend more apparent than in North America, where a growing number of Brazilian businesses are setting up shop and selling everything from cement and steel to airplanes and orange juice. For some of these companies, expanding into big consumer markets like Canada and the United States is crucial to continued growth, since they already have a dominant position at home. For some, it is a way to increase their revenue in dollars while also skirting trade barriers, like import tariffs and quotas. And for all these companies, expanding abroad offers access to cheap credit -- a scarcity in Brazil, where interest rates are among the world's highest. 
 ''If you compare a good Brazilian company to a company that is located in the U.S. or Europe, doing the same thing with the same operations and the same production facilities, then the Brazilian side probably has the advantage of having lower labor costs and maybe energy costs,'' said Peter Badura, general manager of Banco WestLB do Brasil, the Brazilian unit of the German bank WestLB. ''But on the other side, the capital cost is killing them.''
 By buying assets in more developed economies like the United States, Mr. Badura added, Brazilian businesses are essentially ''selling themselves as a non-Brazilian company, as a company that is generating cash flow that is not sensitive to the Brazilian government, to the Brazilian legal system or the Brazilian currency.''
 The need for affordable credit was cited last month by Grupo Votorantim, Brazil's largest diversified industrial conglomerate, when it announced it would buy two cement plants in the United States from Cemex of Mexico for $400 million. The acquisition will be the latest of several purchases by Votorantim's cement unit, Votorantim Cimentos, which has said it is actively pursuing new opportunities in ''mature and stable markets like the United States'' with hopes of doubling its operations outside Brazil by 2007.
 Votorantim made its first foray into North America in 2001, buying the Toronto-based St. Mary's Cement Inc. for $680 million. Last year, it acquired a 50 percent stake in a Florida company, Suwannee American Cement. Over all, Votorantim Cimentos has 25 plants and more than 8,000 employees in Brazil and North America.
 One of the first Brazilian companies to set its sights on the North American market was Grupo Gerdau, a family-run steel maker based in the country's southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul. Gerdau, which got its start as a nail manufacturer in 1901 and is now Brazil's No. 1 producer of long-rolled steel, made its debut in the Northern Hemisphere in 1989, when it bought Courtice Steel of Ontario. A decade later, the group pushed into the United States, acquiring Ameristeel, a financially distressed steel company based in Florida. 
 Gerdau has recently moved aggressively to bolster its United States presence. Last month it completed the acquisition of the Minnesota-based North Star Steel, which it bought from Cargill Inc. for $266 million, adding four long-steel minimills and three wire rod processing plants, in five states. And in late October it announced plans to buy Gate City Steel and RJ Rebar, which are based in Indianapolis and together have seven concrete reinforcing steel operations in Alabama, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. In all, the Toronto-based Gerdau Ameristeel Corporation now has 14 mills in Canada and the United States, and is North America's fourth-largest steel producer.
 For Gerdau, which also has units in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, expanding outside Brazil was a way to keep growing while also dancing around trade restrictions on steel imports, especially in the United States.
 ''We've always been big exporters here in Brazil,'' said Jorge Gerdau Johannpeter, the group's president. ''But the American market had restrictions.''
 ''So to achieve our objective of becoming a big player in the global steel industry,'' he added, ''we decided we had to focus more on the United States.''
 Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, a flat-steel producer based in Rio de Janeiro, has also taken aim at the North American steel market, buying Heartland Steel of Terre Haute, Ind., in 2001. And Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the Brazilian mining giant known widely as C.V.R.D., has a 50 percent stake in California Steel Industries, the leading producer of flat-rolled steel in the western United States. 
 Last month, C.V.R.D., the world's largest producer and exporter of iron ore, a crucial ingredient in steel, was busy denying reports that it was in talks over Noranda, a big diversified mining group based in Toronto that has been on the block for some time. Such speculation died down while the Canadians negotiated exclusively with the China Minmetals Corporation, but resurfaced after Noranda said in mid-November that it was open to new bids. 
 C.V.R.D., however, has made no secret of its desire to keep expanding overseas. ''Having operations abroad is an absolute necessity for our business,'' said Fabio Barbosa, C.V.R.D.'s chief financial officer, adding that ''if there are opportunities out there that fit into our growth strategy and generate value for our shareholders, we will pursue them.''
 Trade barriers have encouraged some of Brazil's biggest orange juice companies to buy processing plants in the United States, a move that allows them to sidestep steep import duties on foreign orange juice. In 1996, Sucocitrico Cutrale, Brazil's largest citrus grower and juice processor, acquired a plant in Auburndale, Fla., from Coca-Cola's Minute Maid division. A year later, another Brazilian juice company, Citrosuco Paulista, bought a plant in Lake Wales, Fla. These companies now control enough of Florida's processing industry to influence prices for bulk juice from concentrate.
 Another kind of restriction led to a recent decision by Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer known as Embraer, to build a factory on American soil. To be eligible for lucrative Pentagon and homeland security contracts in the United States, Embraer started in August to convert a defunct military base in Jacksonville, Fla., into an aircraft assembly operation.
 The company was already part of the team led by the Lockheed Martin Corporation that won an $879 million Pentagon contract last summer for United States Army surveillance planes. 
 Under the partnership with Lockheed, Embraer will use the Jacksonville plant to build the aircraft that will be converted into surveillance planes under the Army's Aerial Common Sensor program. 
 Embraer says it hopes the plant will also snare homeland security and other specialized military business, like border and maritime patrolling.
 ''The fact that we've been considered a valued supplier for the American armed forces,'' said Mauricio Botelho, Embraer's chief executive, ''that is going to open a lot of other doors for us.''

HEADLINE: Raises and Longer Workweek For Doctors Employed by City

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Under a contract settlement announced yesterday by union and city officials, doctors employed by city agencies and hospitals will receive pay raises in February of roughly 6 percent in return for working more hours, in addition to their annual raises.
 The settlement with the Doctors Council, the union representing 1,250 doctors who work in city agencies and for the Health and Hospitals Corporation, will retroactively cover the period from July 1, 2002, through June 30, 2005. It addresses annual raises as well as the increased hours. 
 Under the deal, the doctors will receive a $1,000 cash payment upon ratification of the contract and wage increases of 3 percent after the first year of the contract, 1 percent after the second year, and the possibility of another 1 percent increase based on other productivity measures. In return for working an extra two and a half hours each week, doctors at city hospitals will also get raises of 5.79 percent, and doctors at city agencies will get additional raises of 6.2 percent.
 City officials said the settlement was similar to recent contracts negotiated with District Council 37, the city's largest municipal union, and other labor groups. District Council 37 members agreed to lower starting salaries and to fewer sick days, holidays and vacation days for new workers in return for a contract that promises them a 5 percent wage increase over three years and the possibility of an additional 1 percent.
 But some of the city's most powerful unions -- the police, the firefighters and the teachers -- have rejected raises equal to those in the District Council 37 contract, saying they are not an acceptable option for their own members. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the doctors' increases were being financed through the increased hours.
 ''When it comes to labor contracts, I would like very much to pay our municipal work force more,'' he said. ''I believe that is the way to encourage the work force to continue to improve the services that the public gets, but the fact of the matter is, if you're going to do that, we have to generate the savings in real, hard cash.''
 Mayor Bloomberg suggested that the doctors' settlement could serve as a model in the contentious negotiations with the United Federation of Teachers, ''but so far, the teachers' union has not come up with any of the savings that would let us generate moneys to pay them over the pattern,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Nor have they come up with any of the reforms that we believe is necessary to improve the school system.''
 Randi Weingarten, president of the teachers' union, said that it had proposed productivity savings, but that its ideas had been ignored or rejected by city officials. ''So it is not accurate to say that we have not been flexible and responsive to their concerns,'' she said.
 Dr. Barry Liebowitz, president of the Doctors Council, said his union agreed to the settlement because most of his members had responded positively to a questionnaire last year asking whether they were willing to put in more hours. 
 ''I believe you'll start to see more patients being seen in a more economical way,'' he said, ''and this also gives us a chance to recruit and retain doctors for our hospital system.''

HEADLINE: Secretary Snow

 BODY:
As the search for someone to replace Treasury Secretary John Snow dragged on, Republicans close to the White House openly dissed him. Then, on Wednesday, the president reappointed Mr. Snow. To justify the surprise decision, a senior administration official said, ''This was no time to send a signal of uncertainty.'' 
 Well, it's no time to send a signal of business as usual, either. The economic legacy of the first Bush term is dauntingly bad. The stock market is lower, despite tax cuts aimed at spurring investment. The dollar is way lower, and fears of a free fall are mounting daily. The federal budget has swung from a surplus to a $412 billion deficit, mainly because of misguided and excessive tax cuts. The deficits in trade and international investment are at never-before-tested levels, nearly triple what most economists consider sustainable. Job creation has been weaker than at any time in modern memory. Incomes are stagnant, failing in most months to even keep pace with inflation. And no -- count 'em, zero -- policy reversals are on the horizon. 
 As if that's not bad enough, Mr. Snow's reappointment also sends a disturbing, though not surprising, message about policy making. Like other secretaries in the Bush administration, Mr. Snow's main job has been to promote policies -- not make them. To the extent that this administration has engaged in making economic policies (to wit, ''tax cuts above all'' and ''deficits don't matter''), the policies have come from the president's inner circle.
 Mr. Snow, like so many others around President Bush, is nothing more than a messenger. Congress knows it. The financial markets know it. Our trading partners know it. It strains the imagination that the White House couldn't find a fitting Treasury secretary among the Wall Street mavens, former politicians and other professionals who were considered for the post. It's more likely that none were suited for the real job on offer: cheerleader. 
 This all bodes ill for the economy. Domestically, the president is committed to largely replacing Social Security with private retirement accounts -- although doing so would require the Treasury to borrow at least $1 trillion. Mr. Snow's reappointment neatly avoids the Senate confirmation hearings that would be required for a new appointment, as would the probable reappointment of Joshua Bolten as the director of the Office of Management and Budget. A major opportunity to vet Mr. Snow's professional opinions and to probe for -- dare we suggest? -- misgivings, is lost. 
 Internationally, the situation is even worse. Mr. Snow is squarely behind the administration's apparent weak-dollar policy. If the dollar's decline sharpens, is Mr. Snow capable of cooperating with our trading partners to manage the downward trajectory? It's kind of hard to be unilateral when you need China, Japan and Europe to accomplish your goals. 
 The economy won't really improve unless Mr. Bush starts to listen to people who will tell him things he does not want to hear, like the fact that the only lasting fix for the weak dollar is fiscal discipline to reduce the budget deficit. Mr. Snow is not that person. Most ominously, the right person for that job doesn't exist -- and couldn't get hired -- in this administration.

HEADLINE: Armor Scarce for Heavy Trucks Transporting U.S. Cargo in Iraq

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and ERIC SCHMITT; Thom Shanker reported from Washington for this article and Eric Schmitt from New Delhi. Reporting was contributed by John F. Burns in Baghdad, Iraq; John Files in Washington; and Michael Moss and Leslie Wayne in New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
Congress released statistics Thursday documenting stark shortages in armor for the military transport trucks that ferry food, fuel and ammunition along dangerous routes in Iraq, while President Bush and his defense secretary both spoke out to defuse public criticism.
 Soldiers confronted Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on Wednesday with complaints that the Pentagon was sending them to war without enough armored equipment to protect them. One soldier who challenged Mr. Rumsfeld was apparently prompted by a reporter traveling with his unit. [Page A18.] The commander of American ground forces in the Middle East responded Thursday to the complaints with a vow to provide armored transportation into Iraq for all troops headed there. 
 ''The concerns expressed are being addressed, and that is, we expect our troops to have the best possible equipment,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And I have told many families I met with, we're doing everything we possibly can to protect your loved ones in a mission which is vital and important.'' 
 The House Armed Services Committee released statistics on Thursday showing that while many Humvees are armored, most transport trucks that crisscross Iraq are not. 
 The committee said more than three-quarters of the 19,854 Humvees in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait carry protective armor, which can vary in quality. The most secure are factory-armored Humvees, and the Pentagon has received only 5,910 of the 8,105 that commanders say they need. But only 10 percent of the 4,814 medium-weight transport trucks have armor, and only 15 percent of the 4,314 heavy transport vehicles. 
 The uproar has exposed some of the most crucial challenges facing the Pentagon: how to equip and train troops for a war whose very nature has changed. 
 A resourceful insurgency has seized on an American vulnerability -- the shortage of armored vehicles -- and attacked supply lines with roadside bombs. These trucks are driven primarily by reservists, while a much greater percentage of active-duty soldiers are deployed in direct combat, and disparities between these troops have already prompted the Defense Department to begin sweeping changes in the way soldiers are trained and equipped.
 These issues gained new intensity and widespread attention because they were raised not in the safe confines of a Capitol Hill hearing or a Pentagon suite, but by a scout with the Tennessee National Guard who directly pressed the secretary of defense in the deserts of Kuwait just days before the soldier is to be sent into Iraq for a year. 
 At Camp Buehring, a staging base for American troops entering and leaving Iraq, the scout, Specialist Thomas Wilson, said his unit had been forced to dig through local landfills to find scrap metal to bolt onto their trucks for protection against roadside bombs. The incident was startling in part because of the soldier's willingness to challenge a cabinet official, but it emerged Thursday that a newspaper reporter embedded with the troops had helped orchestrate the questioning. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld, after leaving Kuwait for India, said it was valuable for senior officials to hear concerns directly from troops, but he offered no immediate changes in how the Army was reacting to the problems. 
 ''I think that it's good for people to raise questions,'' he said. ''It gives senior military leadership that has the responsibility for these matters a chance to hear them, talk to them.''
 Gone are the days when the American military could plan for fighting along dangerous front lines while relying on a relatively safe rear area for logistics. 
 ''Last year, we began to see an increase in improvised explosive device attacks against our forces, primarily against convoys that were moving throughout Iraq,'' said Lt. Gen. R. Steven Whitcomb, commander of coalition ground forces in the Middle East. ''And they began having an impact on our soldiers, a deadly impact, as we all know.''
 In a hastily arranged video news conference from Kuwait, General Whitcomb said the Army had since rushed armored vehicles to take troops into Iraq, and had hastened to add armor to others.
 ''I've got enough metal, I've got enough folks, and I've got enough time to meet our schedule that ensures that no combat unit in a wheeled vehicle goes into Iraq now that is not in an armored vehicle,'' he added. ''So we're continuing to work feverishly to ensure that they meet our requirement, and that's that nobody goes north without it.''
 Continuing shortages have prompted soldiers going to Iraq to scrounge for steel and ballistic glass, improvising shields that have come to be called hillbilly armor.
 At the transit camps in Kuwait, Army and Marine Corps drivers weld antishrapnel collars onto the hoods of their trucks, to deflect exploding debris while maintaining visibility. Sandbags are laid on the floors of Humvees, trimming the skimpy legroom from economy class to steerage. On the battlefield, there is an air of resigned acquiescence about the lack of armor, rather than bitter complaints. Among units that lack armored Humvees, the mood 20 months into the war tends more to black jokes than to recrimination.
 ''If they i.e.d. you in this thing, there won't be enough of you left to package up and send home,'' a Marine sergeant said earlier this week, as he showed embedded reporters to one of three open-backed Humvees assigned to a raid on a suspected rebel stronghold raid south of Baghdad. Among troops in Iraq, i.e.d., for improvised explosive device, is shorthand for the roadside bombs that have killed about two-thirds of Americans who have died in combat.
 At briefings, commanders resort often to an old Marine adage, ''Improvise, adjust, overcome,'' and are dismissive of complaints. 
 Yet others remain angry. ''This is a big problem that demands immediate attention, and what you saw yesterday from Rumsfeld shows that he fails to understand what goes on the ground,'' said Paul Rieckhoff, a former infantry platoon leader with the Florida National Guard in Iraq who now runs an organization called Operation Truth , an advocacy group for soldiers and veterans. ''This is a life or death situation for guys over there. Complacency, incompetency, or negligence, I don't know what other excuse there could be. But when these guys screw up, we bleed.''
 The kits to add extra protection to vehicles already in Iraq are being produced by the United States Army Materiel Command, where officials said they were scrambling to speed up the work and complete the most recent order from Iraq before the previous goal of March 2005. ''We're trying to ramp up and accelerate the process, and there is a possibility we might meet the requirement prior to that time,'' said Tesia Williams, an Army spokeswoman.
 At the same time, she defended the Army's efforts to date in armoring the Humvees used in Iraq. According to figures supplied by Ms. Williams, the Materiel Command first received orders for 1,000 kits in November 2003, followed by orders for 2,870 in December; 800 in January 2004; 2,090 in February; and 1,516 in April 2004. More orders received last summer brought the total order to 13,872, of which about 75 percent has been filled, she said.
 Only some of the work has been contracted out, mainly to a plant in Ohio run by O'Gara-Hess & Eisenhardt, a unit of Armor Holdings. The rest of the kits are being produced by civilian employees of the Army working at depots in New York and six other states, where they are using laser-cutting machines to cut steel purchased directly from two mills.
 Armor Holdings also produces armor for new Humvees, and the company said it told the Army last month that it had the capacity to increase its production to 550 vehicles a month, compared with the 450 vehicles is handling now.
 Military officers at the Pentagon expressed no surprise that it was a member of the National Guard who raised the issue with Mr. Rumsfeld. Already, the length and number of Guard tours and the number of their members killed and wounded have imposed unexpected stresses on the Guard and Reserves, whose members have not always been as well trained and equipped as active-duty members. 
 The system for training, equipping, mobilizing and deploying reservists was not ready for the historic increase in call-ups since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, officials acknowledged. The Guard and Reserves clocked nearly 63 million duty days last year, more than five times the totals recorded annually in the late 1990's. As of Wednesday, the total National Guard and Reserve personnel on duty around the world and in the United States stood at 185,019.
 Democrats in Congress rushed into the debate on Thursday, saying one of Mr. Rumsfeld's chief duties was making sure that the troops would be safe.
 Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and one of the harshest critics of the administration's Iraq policies, said troops lack some protective equipment, in part, because of the urgency with which the United States went to war.
 ''This was a war of choice, not necessity, to be waged on our timetable, not Saddam's,'' Mr. Biden said in a statement. ''And why is it that, 20 months after Saddam's statue fell, our troops still don't have the protection they need? Congress has given this administration virtually every dollar it has asked for in Iraq.''

HEADLINE: Bush Says He Won't Raise Taxes for Social Security Overhaul

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
President Bush on Thursday flatly rejected the possibility of raising payroll taxes to pay for an overhaul of Social Security, a project that is likely to cost trillions of dollars over the next several decades.
 ''We will not raise payroll taxes to solve this problem,'' Mr. Bush told reporters after meeting with trustees of the Social Security system.
 It was his most explicit declaration so far that he intended to borrow the money needed for the centerpiece of his approach, which is to let people divert some of their payroll taxes to private savings accounts. 
 By restating a seemingly non-negotiable position on taxes, Mr. Bush will have a more difficult time gathering bipartisan support for his overhaul of Social Security. Many Democrats have argued that taxes need to be raised to finance Mr. Bush's initiative in order to avoid huge increases in the federal deficit. 
 ''President Bush seems to have painted himself into a corner on Social Security because he says no tax increases and no benefit cuts for current or near retirees,'' said Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, a leading House Democrat on Social Security issues. ''The only thing he does not rule out is massive increases in debt.''
 Mr. Bush also risked running afoul of other Republicans, some of whom worry about a giant surge of new borrowing and some of whom worry about a plan that is likely to include big cuts in benefits for future retirees.
 Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who, like Mr. Bush, is an ardent advocate of private accounts, recently departed from him by suggesting that higher taxes might be preferable to soaring debt.
 And a Republican trustee to the Social Security fund, Thomas Saving, proposed on Thursday to reduce the public cost of personal accounts by requiring workers and employers to make some of the contributions from their own pockets.
 In an indication of the potential minefields ahead, Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, repeatedly refused to answer reporters' questions about how ironclad Mr. Bush's no-tax statement was.
 Asked whether the president's no-tax stance included a commitment not to lift the ceiling on payroll taxes for high-income people, Mr. McClellan refused to answer explicitly.
 Administration officials estimate that Social Security faces a long-term financial shortfall of $10.4 trillion, mainly to cover the burgeoning costs of old-age benefits as today's baby-boom generation enters retirement.
 Mr. Bush wants to replace part of the traditional Social Security program with a system of personal savings accounts, and his proposal is likely to couple that with a sharp reduction in traditional benefits for future retirees.
 Analysts estimate that the government would have to borrow as much as $2 trillion to cover transition costs over the next two decades because payroll taxes would plunge immediately while the government's obligation to existing retirees would decline slowly.
 Administration officials say that the transition costs pose no problem because the government would eventually save more in reduced future obligations than it would lose during the transition.
 ''It is merely bringing forward liabilities that the United States already has,'' Joshua B. Bolten, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told reporters on Thursday. ''I believe that the markets would take the long-term view.''
 Mr. Bush is expected to begin an opening round in the Social Security battle next week, when the White House is host to a two-day conference on economic priorities that is certain to highlight his goal for personal savings accounts.
 But Mr. Bush must still reconcile his goals on Social Security with his campaign pledge to reduce the federal deficit by half by 2009.
 The deficit hit a record of $413 billion this year, but it would have been much higher had the budget not been supplemented by an annual surplus of more than $200 billion in the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
 If the government was to let people divert part of their payroll taxes to private accounts, the budget deficit would be more than $100 billion a year higher than otherwise and the surpluses in the Social Security trust fund expected over the next 13 years would disappear.
 With that in mind, administration officials and Republicans in Congress hint that they are looking at ways to exclude the expected transition costs from the official deficit numbers. 
 ''I wouldn't view anything as a cost,'' Mr. McClellan, the president's spokesman, said. ''I would view them as savings.'' 
 Meanwhile, some Republicans who support private savings accounts say it might well be better to raise taxes than to add $2 trillion to the federal debt.
 Senator Graham said this week that he would consider raising the ceiling on payroll taxes to pay for some of the transition costs.
 At the moment, workers stop paying payroll taxes when their income for the year climbs above $87,900, and that ceiling will rise to about $90,000 in 2005. Analysts say raising the ceiling, or eliminating it, could come close to wiping out the projected shortfall in one swoop.
 ''We need to have everything on the table, and that includes taxes,'' Mr. Graham said in an interview on Wednesday. ''If you borrow money, that creates a deficit for 50 years to come. It really is a tax on the future, and it is locking the deficit into our national economy in a way that's very unhealthy as far as I see it.''

HEADLINE: Social Security: We Count on It

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman's suggestions for reforming Social Security will only enable the system to do exactly what it's been doing for 70 years: pay the average retiree the 2004 inflation-adjusted equivalent of $927 a month. Is that the best we can do? 
 The American people want real reform. And a recent Rasmussen poll found that about two-thirds of Americans support private retirement accounts when accompanied by a guarantee that everyone who wants to remain in the current system can do so and receive his promised benefits.

HEADLINE: Trade Envoy Is Favorite to Lead World Bank

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
As the musical chairs fill up for President Bush's second administration, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, has jumped to the top of the list of candidates for president of the World Bank, the largest and most influential development agency in the world.
 Colin L. Powell, the outgoing secretary of state and the previous top contender, said in no uncertain terms last week that he would not accept the job.
 And John W. Snow was extended, for now, as the Treasury secretary, removing one position that might have gone to Mr. Zoellick.
 James D. Wolfensohn, the current bank president, completes his second five-year term next spring, giving President Bush a chance to name his own person to become the spokesman for the world's poor. (By tradition, the United States names the head of the bank while Europe names the director of the International Monetary Fund; all the countries left out of the process would like that tradition changed.) 
 While Mr. Zoellick has never been considered an outspoken champion of the poor and the dispossessed around the globe, he is a rare internationalist in the administration and a tireless promoter of greater trade ties between the rich and poor nations.
 Several senior development experts who work with the bank said that among the Republican candidates being mentioned for the position Mr. Zoellick had one of the strongest resumes to take over the institution at this critical juncture.
 ''You can be sure that Bob Zoellick is a smart guy with a well-grounded view of the role of global institutions and how they work with markets,'' said Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development.
 He has competitors, however.
 The most formidable is Randall L. Tobias, the global AIDS coordinator for the White House. The former vice chairman of AT&T International and head of Eli Lilly & Company, Mr. Tobias has worked closely with Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, who was nominated by the president to be secretary of state. In his current position he has won the admiration of conservatives and international development experts.
 Peter McPherson, the president of Michigan State University, who led the first team sent to Iraq to revitalize the economy, has been under consideration for several years and has been seen in Washington an awful lot of late. If President Bush goes outside Republican circles, he could tap Stanley Fischer, a vice chairman at Citigroup and a trained economist who is the former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund.
 Those are credentials Mr. Zoellick lacks.
 ''It would be nice if the next bank president was someone with experience in development and poverty,'' said Mark L. Schneider, senior vice president of the International Crisis Group.
 But Mr. Zoellick has powerful supporters as well. He is a protege of James A. Baker, the former secretary of state and Treasury under the first President Bush. And he was one of the original Vulcans, the group of foreign policy experts who advised the current president in his 2000 campaign.
 Sebastian Mallaby, author of ''The World's Banker'' (Council on Foreign Relations/Penguin Press, 2004), a biography of Mr. Wolfensohn and the World Bank, wrote a column in The Washington Post describing Mr. Zoellick's accomplishments, including starting a new round of global trade talks aimed at helping the developing world.
 After praising Mr. Zoellick for building ''an international network and a reputation as a dynamo,'' he ended his article asking whether Mr. Zoellick would be the next president of the World Bank.
 Mr. Zoellick himself is silent.
 His spokesman is under instructions to answer that ''Ambassador Zoellick serves at the pleasure of the president and is focused on implanting the president's trade agenda.''
 Mr. Powell was much more explicit last week when he rejected any discussion of running the bank.
 ''I have no plans, and I will not be the president of the World Bank,'' he told a reporter of Radio Sawa, the Arabic-language network run by the government's International Broadcasting Bureau. ''It's not anything that has been suggested to me, nor is it something I would be interested in.''


CORRECTION-DATE: December 11, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business yesterday about the emergence of Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, as a top candidate to head the World Bank quoted a word incorrectly in a comment from his spokesman. The spokesman said Mr. Zoellick was ''focused on implementing the president's trade agenda,'' not ''implanting'' it.

HEADLINE: Internet Drug Exporters Feel Pressure in Canada

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: WINNIPEG, Manitoba Dec. 7 

 BODY:
Five years ago, a young Manitoba pharmacist fresh out of school started selling Nicorette chewing gum over e-Bay. From that modest beginning the Canadian online pharmacy industry took off, racking up cross-border sales of more than $800 million a year, upsetting United States drug companies and prompting a debate over prescription drug prices in the American presidential election.
 But now an industry that thrived on discrepancies between the country's regulated drug prices and America's higher, largely unregulated prices has run into regulatory, political and economic pressures at home that promise not just to change the business fundamentally, but possibly to drive it out of Canada altogether. 
 Canadian officials, worried about the threat of liability lawsuits and the problem of maintaining an adequate, reasonably priced supply of prescription drugs for their own population, are casting an increasingly wary eye on the industry. 
 At the same time, online pharmacies are having an ever more difficult time finding supplies because, they say, the major pharmaceutical companies are threatening wholesalers who do business with them. 
 American consumers of prescription drugs, most of whom are elderly, are not likely to notice the changes anytime soon, if at all. But as the industry casts about the world to fill its growing orders, the drugs that people think they are getting from Canada may actually be supplied by pharmacies in Europe, Australia, Israel and Latin America.
 Even in Manitoba, the birthplace of the business, regulators warned the province's pharmacists that their licenses could be suspended in January if they continued to fill American prescription orders without proper physician oversight.
 Currently, before a pharmacy can fill a prescription, a Canadian doctor co-signs an American customer's prescription, after reviewing the original doctor's diagnosis and prescribed treatment. But the practice of co-signing a prescription without examining a patient may be a violation of professional medical standards. Stiffening those requirements would remove the threat of lawsuits but, if extended to other provinces as the industry fears, also kill the online industry in Canada. 
 Canada's health minister, Ujjal Dosanjh, has raised this issue repeatedly and indicated that he would shut down the industry if he felt it was necessary. ''We will do the right thing, and if the consequence is that cross-border Internet pharmacies don't exist anymore, then that's the consequence,'' he said in a recent television interview. 
 The industry has warned the Manitoba regulatory agency that it will be held accountable for any damages. Yet this week Mr. Dosanjh backed the pharmaceutical association's position, saying, ''The practice by some doctors of countersigning prescriptions without actually having a relationship with the patient and properly assessing the patient is absolutely unethical and unprofessional.''
 The provincial health minister of Manitoba, Tim Sale, called this week for compromise, and the Internet pharmacists and the regulatory body will meet next week to seek an arrangement.
 The industry's proponents dismiss the liability issue, saying their practices are safe and pointing out that there has never been a problem with a faulty prescription or drug. 
 Another commonly expressed fear is that the online drug industry may ultimately reduce supplies for Canadians, raise prices and jeopardize the financial health of provincial governments, which finance purchases of prescription drugs.
 ''It is difficult for me to conceive of how a small country like Canada could meet the prescription drug needs of approximately 280 million Americans without putting our own supply at serious risk,'' Mr. Dosanjh said in a speech last month. ''Canada cannot be the drugstore of the United States.'' 
 A further problem the industry faces is the rapid decline of the American dollar, which is slicing into profits on some drugs by up to 15 percent this year, although prescription drugs are still cheaper here than in the United States because of price controls.
 All of these new stresses have only exacerbated supply pressures on the 270 Canadian online pharmacies -- which are essentially mail-order houses for maintenance drugs for chronic conditions like erectile dysfunction, high blood pressure and high cholesterol -- after American pharmaceutical firms began threatening to cut supplies to Canadian wholesalers last year.
 ''As an industry we are juggling between ducking fastballs thrown at us, looking at contingencies to survive and constantly upgrading our service,'' said Daniel Norman, business development officer at universaldrugstore.com, one of the largest online pharmacies.
 Sales are still increasing, though at a much slower rate than in previous years, and several of the largest online companies are making drastic changes in their business models.
 Many are opening pharmacies abroad, particularly in Britain, to shelter themselves from Canadian regulators and drug supply squeezes caused by what they describe as blacklisting by American drug companies. They note that American companies would find it much more difficult to put pressure on wholesalers in a dozen or more European countries, where drug prices are also low compared with the United States.
 CanadaMeds.com recently closed its pharmacy in Winnipeg, Manitoba's capital, but enlarged its operations in Calgary, considered to be more business-friendly. It has also formed partnerships with pharmacies in Australia, Chile, Israel and Britain this year. Others simply shop around the world for available drugs.
 ''The strong will survive and the weak will be gone,'' said Robert Fraser, director of pharmacy at CanadaDrugs.com, another industry leader that is diversifying its investments and recently acquired an interest in a mail-order pharmacy in Texas. ''The beauty of this industry is you don't have to be located in a prime area of the world these days to carry on a viable business.''
 But there have already been some disruptions.
 CanadaRx.net of Hamilton, Ontario, set up a pharmacy operation in Freeport in the Bahamas during the summer to purchase European drugs for resale in the United States. But one of its early shipments of 450 packages was seized at the Miami airport by customs agents, whose suspicions were raised by the size and provenance of the shipment. 
 While it remains illegal to import prescription drugs into the United States, the Food and Drug Administration continues to take a somewhat relaxed enforcement stance over shipments to individuals.
 No one was arrested in the Miami incident, but CanadaRx.net had to refill the prescriptions for the customers in Vermont, Wisconsin and Minnesota who had purchased the drugs not knowing where they would come from.
 ''There's pressure from every angle,'' said David MacKay, executive director of the Canadian International Pharmacy Association, a trade group representing most of the major online pharmacies. ''The screws are being tightened.''
 The changes promise to overhaul an industry that serves up to 100,000 mostly uninsured or underinsured Americans and has created more than 5,000 jobs for Canadian telephone salespeople, administrators and pharmacists. It has also brought extra income to scores of Canadian doctors who co-sign prescription orders originally signed by American doctors as they reconfirm that treatment and dosage are appropriate.
 Industry leaders are trying to ease concerns in Canada that their businesses could reduce Canadian supplies by emphasizing that they are interested only in filling the needs of uninsured and underinsured Americans. They do not want to overreach and antagonize the Canadian government by making bulk sales to American insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and state governments seeking to pass on savings.
 The online businesses remain optimistic about the prospects of their industry, at least publicly.
 ''I continue to invest heavily in our operations and our future,'' said Andrew Strempler, president of RxNorth.com, a company in Minnedosa, Manitoba, that sold more than $60 million of drugs to American customers in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, a 10 percent increase from the 2003 fiscal year.
 Mr. Strempler's company last week closed a pharmaceutical facility in Niverville, Manitoba, which it opened only a year ago to service its growing American clientele, raising fresh fears that the industry was closing down. But Mr. Strempler said that he was adding to his call center in Winnipeg and that he had just opened an online pharmacy with more than $500,000 worth of inventory in England to serve American customers.
 ''Those of us who are innovative enough will get through these challenges,'' said Mr. Strempler, 30, who got the industry started by selling the Nicorette gum.
 So far, United States officials have expressed skeptical but not wholly antagonistic views on an industry that is saving a lot of Americans money and has so far not caused any known harm. ''It's O.K. at this current level,'' the ambassador to Canada, Paul Cellucci, recently told reporters.
 Representatives of the United States drug industry, which has threatened to cut supplies to countries that re-export medicines, say the greatest threat posed by online pharmacies is from drug counterfeiting, especially in developing countries.
 ''It opens up the door for counterfeits to enter the United States,'' said F.J. Fingland, senior director of communications for the Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers Association, ''and there is nothing Health Canada can do to regulate these products.'' 
 In a June report on Internet pharmacies, the United States General Accounting Office identified few problems with the Canadian operations. But the agency found that among the operations it had looked at, ''None of the foreign pharmacies outside of Canada included dispensing pharmacy labels that provide instructions for use, few included warning information and 13 displayed other problems associated with the handling of the drugs.''
 Health Canada, the primary federal health authority, issued a report last month concluding that Canadian online pharmacies generally complied with regulations. But it did find that some pharmacies were packaging and shipping temperature-sensitive products inappropriately and selling prescription drugs ''based on prescriptions signed using rubber stamps or electronic prescriptions signed with electronic signatures.''
 Industry leaders said they were taking action to redress those concerns.

HEADLINE: Delphi to Eliminate an Additional 8,500 Jobs

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
Delphi, the world's largest auto parts maker, said Friday that it would cut nearly 5 percent of its work force, or 8,500 jobs, as it copes with the declining fortunes of its largest customer, General Motors, and the rising costs of raw materials, like steel.
 Delphi, which is based in the Detroit suburb of Troy, has already cut about 9,000 workers this year. The new round of cuts will come in both the United States and Europe. Delphi and other suppliers have been shifting their work forces to China, Mexico and other regions with lower labor costs. 
 The company also said it now expected a net loss of $350 million next year and predicted a wider loss for the fourth quarter. Delphi now expects to lose $123 million to $143 million, compared with its earlier forecast of $18 million to $32 million. 
 ''It's shaping up to be a very tough year,'' J.T. Battenberg III, Delphi's chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts Friday morning. ''We are going to have to take some action.'' 
 Delphi shares fell 34 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $8.30. 
 The job cuts are the latest blow to the Midwestern economy, which has been hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs since the 1980's. In the United States, Delphi will reduce its 51,000- employee work force by 3,000, mostly in states like Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin.
 The rest of the cuts will come in Europe, where Delphi has large operations in France, Germany, Italy and Poland. In all, the European cuts will account for about 11 percent of Delphi's work force there.
 Delphi, which was spun off from G.M. in 1999, has been diversifying its business to a variety of different automakers but still derives more than half of its revenue from G.M. 
 But the connection to G.M. has hurt Delphi of late because the automaker has been losing market share. G.M. said last week that it would cut its first-quarter production by 7 percent from its production levels in the first quarter of this year. 
 Mr. Alan S. Dawes, the chief financial officer of Delphi, said production cuts at G.M. created a new sense of urgency to take action. ''We clearly see the need to really drive hard on costs here coming out of '04,'' he said. 
 Mr. Battenberg said G.M. production cuts and sharp increases in the prices of commodities were ''very real, and they're impacting our short-term results.'' 
 Delphi has made gains in its non-G.M. revenue, which is up 19 percent over last year. Next year, the company expects to earn about 51 percent of its revenue from buyers other than G.M. 
 John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said in a phone interview that Delphi would most likely meet that goal but said the shift had a lot to do with G.M. 
 ''It's probably going to happen in part because G.M.'s business is falling rapidly,'' he said. 
 Mr. Casesa said Delphi must continue to push to diversify its revenue base as the domestic automakers struggle to hold their share of the market. 
 ''It is a matter of survival,'' he said. ''It's not a luxury.''

HEADLINE: Diverging Fortunes, Tied to the Dollar

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and SIMON ROMERO; Mark Landler reported from Cologne for this article and Simon Romero from Pennsylvania.

DATELINE: COLOGNE, Germany, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
They sit on opposite sides of the Atlantic, but the Alfred H. Schutte Company and the Markel Corporation could well be neighbors.
 Both are small family-owned outfits making industrial products used by automakers. Both are union shops, with loyal employees who have taken the lumps of an unforgiving global economy.
 Schutte and Markel share another bond: their fates are closely tied to the value of the dollar, and these days, it is proving decisive. With the dollar sinking to record lows against the euro, Markel, of Plymouth Meeting, Pa., is a big winner, while Schutte, of Cologne, is losing ground. 
 At Markel's red-brick factory near Philadelphia, Kim Reynolds, the owner, is scrambling to fill orders from Germany, Portugal and the Czech Republic, where the fall of the dollar -- which has slumped by 9.3 percent just since late August so that 1 euro now buys about $1.32 -- has allowed him to price his products, insulated wire and tubing for cars, more competitively.
 On the banks of the Rhine, where Schutte's turn-of-the-century factory churns out advanced lathes and tool grinders, a different story is unfolding. There, the surging euro has made German exports more expensive for buyers outside Europe, and Carl Martin Welcker, the owner, is losing orders for his million-dollar machines.
 ''If the euro goes to $1.40 and stays there for several years, it will cost us a lot of money,'' said Mr. Welcker, a lean, gray-haired 44-year-old who is the great-grandson of the company's founder. ''The danger is that someone will get into our niche and take the business away from us.''
 Such warnings are echoing across Europe these days, as the Continent comes to grips with the likelihood that the Bush administration will tolerate a prolonged period of weakness in the dollar. Europe fears its exports will be choked off, which could strangle its fragile economic recovery.
 In the United States, manufacturers, who have been sapped by the exodus of production and jobs to cheaper markets overseas in recent years, are rejoicing at the dollar's decline. For American exporters, the currency is a lubricant, greasing the way for their products. 
 ''This is the perfect time for currencies to move back to sanity,'' said Franklin J. Vargo, a lobbyist with the National Association of Manufacturers. ''The United States lost over three million manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2003, and it's about time we put an end to that outflow.''
 In a global economy, one country's gain can be another's loss. For now, Europe, with its freely traded euro, is bearing the brunt of the swooning dollar. The Chinese government pegs the value of its currency to the dollar, while Japan and other Asian countries have intervened heavily in foreign currency markets to stem the rise of their currencies.
 The full impact of the dollar's downward adjustment has probably not been felt yet. For one thing, it would need to fall much further to make a meaningful dent in the United States' $620 billion current-account deficit, unless there was a significant appreciation in the Asian currencies as well as a sea change in fiscal policy to close the federal budget gap, which would ease Washington's dependence on overseas borrowing.
 These days, Europeans are losing out not just to the Americans, but to the Japanese, Chinese, South Koreans and others. That is rankling leaders like Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, who remarked on a trip to Tokyo this week that Europe could learn from the interventionist Bank of Japan.
 The diverging fortunes of Markel and Schutte illustrate how fluctuating exchange rates can play havoc with a company's competitiveness, multiplying or erasing its cost advantages, often with dizzying speed. Indeed, Deutsche Bank estimates that a 10 percent decline in the dollar against the euro would reduce the cash flow of European companies by an average of 5.3 percent. 
 The pain does not fall evenly. Automobile and auto parts companies would lose 18 percent of their cash flow, according to the bank study, while media and travel companies would be scarcely affected.
 Optimists say the muscular euro will force European companies to become more efficient and increase their productivity. But exporters like Schutte, which are unwilling to cut their prices to hold on to customers, will lose market share, and end up with reduced profits -- or even losses.
 ''There is a trade-off here,'' said Paul de Grauwe, a professor of economics at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. ''Those who survive will be fit and lean, but many companies will be destroyed.'' In the case of Markel, which has 140 employees and about $25 million in sales, the weaker dollar enabled Mr. Reynolds to increase exports to 40 percent of revenue from 5 percent five years ago. That helped restore the company to profitability after years of job cuts and other austerity measures.
 Markel is part of a highly specialized niche industry that pits it against nimble producers of wire and tubing in Europe and Asia. 
 For decades, it prospered in what was known as Pennsylvania's ''fertile crescent of Teflon,'' a nod to local companies that use synthetic compounds like Teflon, developed by DuPont in nearby Delaware. By the mid-1990's, however, Markel's traditional product line and over-reliance on the domestic market had left it with deep losses. 
 Mr. Reynolds, a 55-year-old graduate of the Harvard Business School who acquired the company with his family in the early 1980's, began focusing on Europe while the dollar was still strong, seeking to position Markel as a highly skilled manufacturer that could compete on the quality of its products.
 This year, Markel will reap almost $1 million in currency-related gains. It could have made more, but Mr. Reynolds locked the company into currency contracts in 2004 that market its auto parts at $1.20 to the euro, compared with the record high of $1.34 it reached this week.
 Sales in Europe are so strong that Markel has booked nearly its entire production in the region for 2005, locking in futures contracts at about $1.27 to the euro. It is also starting to close deals for the first quarter of 2006 -- a prospect that seems to surprise Mr. Reynolds.
 ''We can't let ourselves get too excited,'' said Mr. Reynolds. ''At least we know what we're getting in case a day of reckoning arrives.''
 With his fatter profits, Mr. Reynolds is giving his salaried employees a Christmas bonus this year of cash and deposits into their retirement accounts. Bonuses are also going to hourly workers, many of them members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Some of them have been Markel employees for several decades.
 On the factory floor, talk of the dollar is linked to concerns about job security. ''I know when the euro's up, it's good for us,'' said Tom Crowder, 48, an assistant supervisor who has been at the company 27 years. ''It means we're busier filling orders. It means I'm not in danger of getting laid off.''
 Mr. Reynolds is even more vigilant than his employees in tracking currency movements. Each morning, he checks the value of the dollar against the euro and the yen. He also looks warily at China's currency, the yuan, which is pegged to the dollar at a rate of 8.2.
 ''Our gains in Europe are not large enough to make up for our losses in Asia,'' Mr. Reynolds said ruefully.
 For Schutte, the machine-tool maker, China is one of a host of trouble spots on the map. Mr. Welcker, the great-grandson of the founder, expects to book 10 percent fewer orders next year in the United States, 5 percent fewer in Japan and 15 percent fewer in China.
 ''Some customers say, 'We like what you do, but we can buy it 20 percent cheaper,''' he said.
 For Schutte, a 124-year-old firm that prides itself on state-of-the-art engineering and fine workmanship, having to compete on price is a humbling exercise. The company pioneered a design for a lathe machine more than 50 years ago, and it has since become the industry standard.
 Schutte's most sophisticated machines -- multispindle lathes that cost nearly $2 million at today's exchange rates -- are largely unaffected by the dollar. With few competitors and eager customers in the United States, China and Japan, the company has pricing power.
 But Schutte is more affected in its tool-grinding machines, which are a staple of the industry. In some cases, the shift in exchange rates is so swift that it can unravel a deal from the time Mr. Welcker shakes hands with a customer to when he secures bank financing to build the machine. 
 Unlike Markel, Schutte does not hedge its currency risk by buying futures. Mr. Welcker said his family, which owns 100 percent of the company, was not keen to dabble in what he views as speculation.
 Schutte is, in every respect, a family firm. Mr. Welcker's father still shows up at work occasionally with his dog, a bouvier des Flandres, whom he said, ''also belongs to the company.'' Portraits of the founder, Alfred Heinrich Schutte, peer down from various walls. Mr. Schutte began as an importer of American machine tools, before World War I forced him to start producing his own machines.
 Mr. Welcker is confident that Schutte will make money this year, after losing 7 million euros ($9.2 million) last year, on sales of 55 million euros ($72.7 million). After all, Europe, where Schutte generates 65 percent of its sales, is still promising.
 And taking another step back, Mr. Welcker recalled that Schutte's factory was 80 percent destroyed in Allied bombing raids during World War II. It fell to his grandfather to pick up the pieces.
 ''To rebuild the place, to save the company, was probably tougher than anything I've had to do,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Group Has a Plan to Take Over Hudson River Ferry Service

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
With New York Waterway warning of an imminent financial collapse, a group of the company's competitors drew up a plan yesterday to take over almost all of its ferry service along the Hudson River.
 Four companies that operate ferry boats and sightseeing cruises around New York Harbor sketched out how they could team up to serve most of the 32,000 passengers who ride the ferries each weekday, most of whom use New York Waterway. 
 They intend to present the plan, which would require the cooperation of government agencies and the owners and creditors of New York Waterway, to local and state officials early next week, said Tom Fox, president of New York Water Taxi.
 Receiving all that help and coordinating the operation of all of the ferries, terminals and buses that New York Waterway runs would be tricky, said Richard Turner, the mayor of Weehawken, the ferry company's home port. But he said he and other local officials would welcome any serious effort to keep the ferries running. 
 ''I think that by the end of the day Monday, the industry would have a plan to keep all of this thing going,'' Mr. Fox said. He said he had been holding talks with the operators of the two Circle Line cruises and SeaStreak America, which runs ferries from the central New Jersey coast to Manhattan.
 Mr. Fox said the group believed that it could keep all of the main routes running without raising fares if the owners of the various terminals and docks along the river would forgo the fees they have been collecting from New York Waterway. They also would need to negotiate an arrangement with J.P. Morgan Chase, the bank that loaned New York Waterway about $20 million to buy boats.
 New York Waterway is in default on that debt and, unable to secure additional financing, it is quickly running out of cash. Its president, Arthur Imperatore Jr., son of the trucking magnate who started the ferry service 16 years ago, said on Thursday that the company could shut down ''any day now.''
 Government officials on both sides of the Hudson have said that the ferries, which thousands of people used to leave Manhattan on Sept. 11 and again in the blackout of 2003, are a critical link in the region's transportation network. But no agency has come up with a viable plan to rescue the service. And the Port Authority has refused to reduce fees it charges New York Waterway.
 The best hope was a proposal hatched in Hudson County that called for the county's improvement authority to sell bonds, use the proceeds to pay off some of New York Waterway's debt and take over the ferry system. But that idea ran aground when state officials said it would require approval by each of the three New Jersey municipalities served by the ferries: Jersey City, Hoboken and Weehawken.
 When county officials abandoned their plan, Mr. Fox and his fellow boat operators began discussing a concerted effort to maintain as much of New York Waterway's system as possible.
 Mr. Fox said each of the operators had agreed to take over one or more of the routes. His company would help to manage the dock at World Financial Center, which New York Waterway had been running, and would provide service to it and to Pier 11 from Hoboken and Jersey City. The Circle Line companies would provide service from Weehawken to West 38th Street in Manhattan, the World Financial center and Pier 11, which is near the South Street Seaport.
 New York Waterway, which ran 20 different routes around the harbor, has been gradually cutting back its operations, eliminating some lines and preparing to shut down weekend service from Hoboken to lower Manhattan.
 Mr. Imperatore had warned employees that they might be out of jobs by mid-January. But when he appeared at a New York City Council committee hearing on Thursday, he painted a bleaker picture, saying that ''New York Waterway is dying'' and might not survive next week.
 Pat Smith, a spokesman for New York Waterway, said he was unaware of the competitors' plan, but added that ''if it was a real, viable alternative,'' Waterway officials would cooperate.
 ''All things can be worked out,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Japan's New Military Focus: China and North Korea Threats

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
Japan adopted plans Friday to shift its military focus away from the cold-war threat of invasion from the Soviet Union to guarding against missiles from North Korea and Chinese incursions around its southernmost islands.
 The new policy cuts tanks and artillery pieces by one-third, to about 600 of each, but greatly increases investment in missiles and forms a squadron of midair refueling planes to allow existing aircraft to attack North Korean missile sites and return home safely to Japan.
 ''Russia is a weak, almost marginalized player in the strategic military sense, while China has continued to develop its military power and North Korea has become a major focus,'' Lance Gatling, an American aerospace consultant here, said in an interview. 
 In another break with Japan's pacifist tradition, the plan calls for selectively ending a longstanding ban on arms exports. To develop a missile defense system with Washington, Japan would have to export components to the United States. 
 Japan's Constitution largely limits the military to self-defense. But in recent years Japan has broadened that interpretation, sending troops overseas for peacekeeping missions and, most recently, sending about 550 soldiers to Iraq. Japan's neighbors, particularly China and North Korea -- both occupied by Japan in the last century -- are sensitive to shifts in Tokyo's military spending.
 ''Official Japanese documents openly play up the so-called 'China threat,' which is completely baseless and irresponsible,'' Zhang Qiyue, China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said in a statement posted Friday on the ministry's Web site shortly after the military guidelines were announced here. ''China expresses strong dissatisfaction with this, and hopes Japan will do more to improve mutual trust and the healthy and stable development of bilateral ties.''
 Japan's spending plan, the result of a once-in-a-decade review, represents an effort to do better with less.
 In what a Defense Agency spokesman called the first budget reduction in memory, five-year spending is to drop to $233 billion, 3.7 percent below the average of the last five years. Ground troops will be cut by 5,000, or 3 percent; combat aircraft will be reduced by 70 airplanes, or 12 percent; and destroyers will be cut by 7, or 13 percent. The cuts came after battles with Finance Ministry officials, who demanded more social spending for Japan's aging population.
 Japan is able to restrict its military spending to about 1 percent of its gross domestic product because of its security alliance with the United States. The new guidelines reaffirmed this alliance, calling it indispensable.
 ''Given its geostrategic vulnerabilities, energy dependence and declining birthrate, Japan is hardly in a position to embark on military adventurism or expansionism in East Asia,'' Alan Dupont, an Australian military analyst, wrote this week in The Straits Times of Singapore. ''Fifty years ago, there was one Japanese for every six Chinese; by 2050, the ratio will be one to 16.''
 China, he wrote, is spending 4.1 percent of its gross domestic product on the military, compared with 3.3 percent for the United States and 2.8 percent for South Korea.
 To deal with new threats, Japan is doubling its rapid-reaction force to 15,000, forming new infantry units that will include paratroopers and helicopter-borne soldiers. According to the news agency Jiji Press, these units would be posted at 90 sites on the Sea of Japan coastline to repel possible infiltration by North Korea. 
 In the south, Japan is raising the detachment of troops stationed in Okinawa to full brigade status, about 2,500 soldiers. 
 Last month, the Maritime Self-Defense Forces went on alert when a nuclear-powered Chinese Navy submarine passed through Japanese territorial waters near Taiwan. 
 On Friday, Japan protested to China after a Chinese research vessel was found mapping the seabed in what Japan considers its exclusive economic zone, near Okinotori Island, 1,000 miles south of Tokyo.

HEADLINE: OPEC Sets Cut in Output Next Month; Oil Prices Fall

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD; Jonathan Fuerbringer, in New York, and Simon Romero, in Houston, contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
OPEC oil ministers agreed on Friday to cut production by a million barrels a day to stem a recent slide in price and called for an emergency meeting next month to consider a reduction in the group's official quota.
 Saudi Arabia and six other countries of the 11-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will trim their output starting Jan. 1, bringing the group's total production down to 27 million barrels a day, the official quota, ministers said at a meeting here.
 OPEC's decision to lower production for the first time since April came in response to oil prices that have declined 26 percent over the last seven weeks. The ministers also seemed to anticipate a decline in the growth in demand next year in the global oil market. 
 ''This is a preventive measure,'' Chakib Khelil, the energy minister of Algeria, said yesterday. ''It is enough to sharpen the market.'' 
 But the price of crude oil plunged as traders questioned the significance of the reduction and whether OPEC would stick to the cuts. Oil for January deliver dropped $1.82, or 4.3 percent, to $40.71 a barrel in New York, continuing a trend that could lead to lower prices for consumers.
 Traders said that one reason for the decline was that the production cutback would not take place until the beginning of the year and thus would not affect imports into the United States until February. Furthermore, while the move will take a million barrels a day out of production, traders were reassured that OPEC left its existing quota intact, at least for now.
 ''People are taking the OPEC decision in stride and thinking that the cutbacks will be marginal and will not be felt right away,'' said Marshall Steeves, an energy analyst at Refco, a futures brokerage firm based in New York.
 Mr. Steeves also said that much of the trading in crude oil had been characterized by what he called trend following. When oil shot to its high of more than $55 a barrel in October, he said, traders just followed the price up. Yesterday, he said, traders seemed to follow the price down. ''Selling has begotten more selling,'' he said.
 Another factor is that the recent decline has apparently persuaded many speculators, who had helped run the price up, to get out of the market.
 The slide in prices is expected to translate into somewhat lower prices at the pump over the next two to three weeks. Prices have already begun to post small declines across the country. In California, for instance, the average price of gasoline fell 4.4 cents in the first week of December, to $2.192 a gallon, and by 2.3 cents, to $1.953 a gallon, in New England, according to the Energy Information Administration.
 ''We'll start to see those pennies trickle back into drivers' pockets,'' said Kyle Cooper, an energy futures analyst with Citigroup in Houston.
 Still, it is too early to start counting on a pronounced drop in fuel prices. Gasoline is still much more expensive than a year ago, with California prices up 54 cents and New England prices up 44 cents from December 2003. And crude oil still remains more expensive than at any time before 2004, unadjusted for inflation. In fact, many oil traders are betting crude oil will climb again this winter if unusually cold weather is forecast in the United States.
 Coming into the meeting, OPEC representatives stressed that they were worried about a buildup in commercial inventories that could cause a price slump just when OPEC is pumping oil at its highest rate in a quarter-century. 
 Commercial stocks held by refineries and oil companies typically decline in the winter as crude is turned into heating oil and diesel fuel. But because of a relatively warm winter in the United States so far, inventories have been rising.
 ''We took the decision to avoid an extraordinary building of inventory levels,'' Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, said. ''Stability is what we're after.'' 
 Curiously absent from the announcement on Friday was any discussion of OPEC's benchmark price target, now set at $22 to $28 a barrel. 
 The benchmark is priced at a discount to the light crude that is traded in New York because it is made up of grades of oil that are more costly to refine. It was last at $34.29 a barrel on Thursday and has been above OPEC's target for most of the last year. 
 Some countries, like Iran and Libya, want the target raised to about $35 a barrel to compensate for this year's decline in the dollar, the currency in which oil is traded. At current rates that would translate into $43 to $45 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, the oil that is traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 The production cutback affords OPEC some breathing space, allowing time to assess where demand is headed next year while preventing what OPEC fears most, a collapse in prices and therefore government revenue. 
 OPEC's oil ministers will meet again on Jan. 30 in Vienna and will consider adjustments to the price band then, said Purnomo Yusgiantoro, the Indonesian oil minister and the current president of OPEC. 
 OPEC ministers will also look into further cuts in production, said Rafael Ramirez, Venezuela's minister for energy and mines. ''If in January there needs to be a new cut, we do another cut,'' Mr. Ramirez said.
 Jan Stuart, the head of energy research at Fimat USA, a brokerage unit of Societe Generale in New York, said: ''They've performed a pretty neat trick. They're not seen as overly greedy because they're not defending $55 a barrel. But they are defending $35, which is pretty darn high.''
 OPEC accounts for half the crude oil that is exported around the world and about a third of global production. Its members have been producing close to their full capacity to meet record high demand from the United States and China and make up for production shortfalls in Iraq.
 According to new estimates released Friday by the International Energy Agency, an adviser to oil-consuming nations, the growth in global oil demand will slow more than previously expected next year.
 The brunt of the cut decided on Friday will be made by Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, which agreed to trim its production by 500,000 barrels a day. The rest will be shared by the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Nigeria, Libya, Qatar and Algeria. 
 Three countries -- Iran, Venezuela and Indonesia -- will not participate in the production cuts because they cannot meet their production quotas. Iraq, which has not been given a quota since the 1990's, will also not take part.
 Some analysts cautioned that it would take a few days or even weeks to be sure OPEC members would actually trim production. 
 ''The cut isn't significant enough to drive prices back up to the 50's but should keep them around their current levels,'' said Neil McMahon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London. A reduction in OPEC's quota next month, ''depends on where they want to set oil prices,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''If they want to set them at $40 and above, they might have to look at the quota.''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Decline Sharply, but Shares Dip Anyway

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Concerns over the economy and potential inflation outweighed a sharp drop in oil prices, sending stocks slightly lower yesterday. All three major indexes were lower for the week as Wall Street's customary year-end rally stalled.
 Wall Street was rattled somewhat by the Labor Department's latest Producer Price Index report, which measures wholesale prices. The index rose 0.5 percent in November, far less than October's 1.7 percent rise, but still a troublesome indicator of possible inflation. 
 The sour mood overshadowed a surprising drop in crude oil futures, which came after OPEC agreed to cut oil production by a million barrels a day. The move was intended to keep prices steady, although even with yesterday's drop, they remain at historically high levels. A barrel of light crude was quoted at $40.71, down $1.82, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.60 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,543.22. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.24 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,188.00, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.94 of a point, or 0.04 percent, to 2,128.07.
 The week's trading was marked by wide swings in oil prices, a mix of economic data, and investor uncertainty that left stocks lower. For the week, the Dow fell 0.46 percent, the S.&P. dropped 0.27 percent and the Nasdaq was down 0.93 percent.
 The University of Michigan's latest consumer sentiment index reading helped keep the market's losses minimal, as the index rose to 95.7 from 92.8 in November. Economists had expected a reading of 93.2, and the index's gains bode well for increased holiday spending this month.
 The rise in wholesale prices has not yet filtered down to consumers to any great degree, which has left many companies with tighter margins and the prospects of reduced growth, or even modest downsizing. Delphi, which makes auto parts, said it planned to cut 8,500 jobs next year, with 5,500 of those cuts coming from overseas jobs. The company also reduced its fourth-quarter earnings forecasts to reflect the cuts and lower sales. Delphi lost 34 cents, to $8.30.
 A pair of potential acquisitions, while generating plenty of discussion among analysts and traders, did little to help stocks. Johnson & Johnson lost $1.06, to $60.25, on reports that it was near an agreement in principle to acquire the medical device maker Guidant. Guidant nonetheless fell $2.20, to $71.55, on the news.
 Nextel Communications slipped 5 cents, to $29.76, as media reports said it was in acquisition talks with Sprint. The wireless subsidiary of Verizon Communications was also considered a potential bidder for Nextel. Sprint shed 14 cents, to $24.14, while Verizon fell 40 cents, to $40.80.
 Southwest Airlines lost a penny, to $15.71, after it announced a $100 million bid for some of the assets of the bankrupt ATA Airlines, including six of the carrier's 14 gates at Midway Airport in Chicago. AirTran Holdings, which is also bidding for ATA's gates, fell 29 cents, to $10.70.
 St. Paul Travelers was up 24 cents, to $36.85, despite receiving a subpoena from New York's attorney general inquiring about its underwriting of professional liability insurance for lawyers. 
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 1/32, to a price of 10025/32. The note's yield was unchanged at 4.15 percent.

HEADLINE: Unions to Push for Better Pay at Wal-Mart

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. and more than a half dozen unions are planning an unusual -- and unusually expensive -- campaign intended to pressure Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, to improve its wages and benefits.
 The campaign will be highly unusual because it will not, at least at first, focus on unionizing Wal-Mart workers, but will instead focus on telling Americans that Wal-Mart -- with wages averaging between $9 and $10 an hour -- is pulling down wages and benefits at companies across the nation.
 The unions are talking of spending $25 million a year on the effort, more than has ever been spent before in a union campaign against a single company. 
 ''This isn't a campaign, this is a movement,'' said Greg Denier, spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. ''There's no precedent for this. It's a movement to confront the reality of Wal-Mart-ization. No other company has ever had the global economic impact that Wal-Mart has.'' 
 Wal-Mart has 1.2 million workers in the United States, more than any other company, but no unionized workers. It has a history of fiercely resisting unionization efforts. 
 Wal-Mart executives say that its wages are competitive with those of other retailers. But critics assert that now that it has become the nation's largest company, Wal-Mart, like General Motors of old, has a responsibility to be a model on wages and benefits.
 Christi Davis Gallagher, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, warned that higher wages could lead to higher prices.
 ''It appears the unions want to take millions of dollars in dues from their members and use them to rob average Americans of their right to pay less for the basics in life,'' Ms. Gallagher said. ''You need to ask one question: Is it fair to ask American consumers to pay higher prices to subsidize a relatively small pocket of individuals just because they are making the most noise?''
 The new effort, to be announced officially in several months, will also be unusual because most union campaigns involve just one union. Because Wal-Mart is so huge, labor leaders have concluded that several unions should work with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. on the effort.
 Among those participating are the Service Employees International Union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. Many union leaders have criticized the food and commercial workers for doing too little over the past decade to unionize Wal-Mart, but the union's new president, Joseph Hansen, has vowed to do more.
 Andrew L. Stern, the service employees' president, said: ''Wal-Mart is much too big for any one union to tackle. The Wal-Mart-ing of the economy is a threat to every union.''
 Last winter, California's three largest supermarket chains waged a 20-week labor battle, involving a strike and lockout, in which they urged the food and commercial workers union to make major concessions on wages and benefits to help the companies compete with Wal-Mart. The supermarkets emerged victorious, getting the union to agree to a lower wage and benefit scale for new hires.
 The unions plan to work with community groups fighting the construction of Wal-Mart stores and are contemplating lawsuits accusing the company of forcing employees to work unpaid hours off the clock. The unions are also planning a publicity campaign in which union members distribute fliers and hold protests at hundreds of the nation's 3,600 Wal-Mart stores.
 The unions also plan an intense effort in several regions where they might set up committees of current and former Wal-Mart workers to publicize what they consider inferior wages and health benefits. These committees might also serve as the base for future unionization efforts.
 While attending a labor conference in Japan on Monday, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, John J. Sweeney, met with union leaders from several countries that have Wal-Mart stores, including Mexico and Brazil, to strategize on how to pressure Wal-Mart. Mr. Sweeney said the unions would urge Wal-Mart to stop pressing suppliers to cut costs so low that the suppliers' workers receive low wages.
 ''We're also concerned about the 20,000 workers at Wal-Mart stores in China and about the 6 million Chinese workers who produce goods sold at Wal-Marts,'' he said.
 Mr. Stern of the service employees' union has proposed financing the campaign by using the $25 million the A.F.L.-C.I.O. receives yearly from its Union Plus credit card.
 Mr. Sweeney said, ''I'm not sure if $25 million is enough.''
 Ms. Gallagher of Wal-Mart said, ''One thing that the unions seem to miss is that Wal-Mart's ability to offer the lowest prices around is driven by a passion to drive costs out of our business at all levels,'' including information technology. 
 She added, ''While the unions want people to believe that we drive down our costs primarily through our wages or benefits, that is simply not the case.''

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''What Corporate America Cannot Build: A Sentence'' neglects a major source of the lamentable prose of many company employees: the decline of the liberal arts education. 
 Driven by economic anxieties, both parents and undergraduates often assume that the principal purpose of higher education is preparation for a particular job, which they believe is best accomplished through courses specifically tailored to that field. But my literature classes, like my colleagues' courses in history, philosophy and so on, are not mere frills. Rather -- in addition to all its other vital functions -- a liberal arts education teaches skills in reading, writing and thinking that, as your article demonstrates, are crucial to any number of jobs.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Prices Rose 0.5% in November

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Wholesale prices increased 0.5 percent in November, reflecting the biggest jump in natural gas costs since March 2003, the Labor Department said yesterday. 
 The increase in prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers came after a 1.7 percent gain in October. 
The core rate, which excludes food and energy, gained 0.2 percent. 
 Higher materials prices have so far been more of a strain on companies than consumers. The Delphi Corporation, the auto-parts supplier, yesterday cited rising costs as one reason it would cut 8,500 jobs next year. The Federal Reserve is forecast to stay on a path of ''measured'' interest rate gains, including one on Tuesday, to keep inflation from picking up. 
 Economists expected a 0.1 percent rise in the November wholesale price index. The increase in November's core rate was the smallest since a 0.2 percent drop in July, and it matched the forecast. Economists forecast that the Michigan index would rise to 93.5. 
 So far this year, producer prices are rising at a 5.3 percent annual rate, compared with a 4.1 percent increase at the same time last year. Core prices are up at a 2.2 percent annual pace, compared with a 1.2 percent gain a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Afghans' Gains Face Big Threat In Drug Traffic

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 

 BODY:
Poppy cultivation and opium production will continue to increase in Afghanistan, expanding the dangerous influence of drug lords at all levels of the government of President Hamid Karzai, a new confidential American military assessment warns. 
 In an otherwise upbeat assessment of progress in Afghanistan, the review says Taliban fighters and other militants will cement their ties to drug traffickers, and use intimidation and play on ethnic and tribal allegiances to try to undermine a government plan to offer amnesty to those who agree to lay down their arms. 
 The assessment, by Lt. Gen. David W. Barno, the top American commander in Afghanistan, was presented this week to Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld during their visit to Afghanistan. 
 At the same time, American commanders have expressed pleasant surprise at the prowess of the newly trained Afghan security forces, and are seeking to accelerate training of the Afghan Army. 
 The number of trained Afghan soldiers is projected to rise to 33,500 within a year, while the national police ranks are expected to grow to 62,000 officers, from 30,500, according to General Barno's assessment. 
 Over all, the report was largely upbeat on military, economic and political fronts. Since July 2003, it said, attacks on allied forces have declined, the power of regional warlords has diminished, militias are being disarmed, a moderate Islamic Constitution is in place, and the elections on Oct. 9 were conducted with relatively little violence and few irregularities. 
 Details of the briefing were provided by two people who have received it and who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive topics. A spokesman for General Barno, Col. Tom MacKenzie, confirmed details of the assessment. 
 The Bush administration is so concerned about the booming drug trade and the Pentagon is so frustrated with the efforts so far by Britain, which had agreed to take the lead in dealing with the problem, that the National Security Council is coordinating a new counternarcotics strategy to address issues from drug eradication to planting of alternative crops. 
 Zalmay Khalilzad, the United States ambassador to Kabul, said in a speech in Paktika Province on Nov. 21: ''The narcotics trade poses a mortal threat to Afghanistan. Narcotics pose a threat to Afghanistan's political future: drug dealers could take over the political system. Narcotics pose a threat to the economy: criminal gangs and mafia can bring the economy under their control.'' 
 Poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, the source of most of the opium and heroin on European and Russian streets, rose 64 percent this year over a year ago, the United Nations reported last month. The income from production and trafficking of opium was estimated at $2.8 billion, roughly one-third of the nation's total economy, the report said. 
 Bush administration officials say that they are working closely with the Afghan government on the issue, and that Mr. Karzai recognizes the severity of the problem. The United States announced last month that it would give $780 million to combat narcotics in Afghanistan this year.
 ''The relationship between terrorism and narcotics, and the continued threat of extremism in the region and the world at large, are a source of continued concern,'' Mr. Karzai said Tuesday in his inauguration speech. 
 Two days later, at the opening of a two-day narcotics conference in Kabul, Mr. Karzai called on his countrymen to declare a holy war against the fast-growing opium trade. 
 The Afghan president also said fighters for the Taliban and Al Qaeda, while still a threat, were not strong enough to topple his government. ''Terrorism as a force is gone,'' he told reporters on Tuesday after meeting privately with Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld.Some 17,000 American troops are conducting counterinsurgency operations throughout Afghanistan and a NATO-led force of 8,400 soldiers is providing security across the north. ''Afghanistan will never go back to the camp of tyranny and terror,'' Mr. Cheney told troops over breakfast at Bagram Air Base, north of Kabul. ''You're here to make those enemies miserable.''
 More than 70,000 Pakistani forces are deployed along the rugged 1,500-mile border with Afghanistan, where many Taliban and Qaeda fighters are thought to be hiding, and, contrary to some reports last month, American officials say there will be no slackening of Pakistan's commitment along the frontier.
 The Pakistanis ''may be repositioning, but they sure aren't pulling out,'' Gen. Peter Pace, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who spent three days in Afghanistan late last month, said in an interview. 
 In his briefing, General Barno said there were essentially three wars going on in Afghanistan. 
 The first is the hunt for Taliban and Qaeda leaders, like Osama bin Laden, which has turned up no new leads recently, military officials said. ''If anyone knew where that fellow was, they'd sure go get him,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said on Tuesday after meeting with Special Operations forces at Bagram. 
 The second campaign is against Taliban and Qaeda networks, which requires winning over the Afghan public so they will provide information on militants. 
 Lastly, the American-led coalition and its Afghan government allies are battling provincial warlords, drug traffickers and other ''centrifugal forces'' in the country, General Barno told his civilian bosses. 
 Violence continues to trouble the south and east, and Maj. Gen. Eric Olson, the deputy commander of American forces in Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last week that United States forces would soon begin a winter offensive against Taliban and Qaeda rebels in an effort to pre-empt insurgent attacks before parliamentary elections, which are scheduled for April. 
 General Barno said in his briefing that he expected Taliban and other fighters to expand their influence into areas where the allies have few or no forces. 
 For this reason, earlier this year he revamped the way troops were deployed. Rather than send troops out on specific missions and then have them return to base, American forces now live in designated sectors to establish a presence, develop contacts with local leaders and cultivate sources of intelligence. 
 But the counterinsurgency, as important as it is, ranks second to confronting the dangers posed by poppy cultivation and opium production, American officials say.

HEADLINE: On Air, Mayor Assails Anti-Stadium Ads

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Just last week, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had urged Cablevision to get into the holiday spirit and drop its vocal opposition to a proposed stadium on the far West Side of Manhattan.
 But yesterday, the mayor himself seemed to be feeling less charitable toward the company, which owns Madison Square Garden and the Knicks, as he unleashed a withering attack on Cablevision during his weekly radio show on WABC-AM.
 Mayor Bloomberg accused the company of deliberately confusing the public through a series of opposition ads declaring that city officials want to help finance the project with $600 million in public money that could be used for raises for city workers.
 ''That comes from the outrageous ads that Cablevision ran, which really are disingenuous, just lying to people, and deliberately designed to confuse people,'' the mayor said. ''It's a disgrace. That's the thing that they've done that I think is the most reprehensible of all the things that they've done.'' 
 The mayor said that it is big economic development projects like the stadium, projected to cost $1.4 billion to build, that generate additional revenues for the city so that its municipal work force can be paid. He said that the city's share of the money for the stadium, which would come from capital funds raised through bond sales, could not be used for operating expenses such as municipal employee salaries. 
 ''It is against the law to borrow money to pay our employees,'' the mayor said. ''We can't do that, it's against the law. We can borrow money to build things that generate tax revenues that pay our employees --and that's what this is about.''
 The mayor went on to suggest that the municipal unions should be ''on the forefront of condemning Madison Square Garden'' rather than opposing such revenue-generating projects. ''If some of the police and fire unions came out against it, they don't understand,'' he said. ''If we don't do this, we're going to have fewer cops, and fewer firefighters, because we're just not going to have the money.''
 The mayor also criticized Cablevision for accepting a state-approved subsidy for its electric bill for Madison Square Garden, a subsidy that has been valued at as much as $1 million annually.
 He said that such incentives were an inappropriate use of government money, and no longer necessary to keep the arena's sports teams in New York City. 
 ''I don't know why they made the deal on the electricity, but what makes it so sensitive is that the owners of Madison Square Garden -- Cablevision -- have said repeatedly that they don't think public monies should be used to subsidize building,'' the mayor said. ''And it's a little bit hypocritical to say that when you're the recipient of an enormous tax break, and as it turns out, cheap electricity. So you can't have it both ways.''
 In a sign that the battle has become increasingly personal, Mayor Bloomberg said at a news conference this week that he had stopped attending Knicks games at Madison Square Garden although he held season tickets. 
 ''I've not gone to the Knicks in a while, in case you haven't heard,'' the mayor said. 
 Charles Schueler, a spokesman for Cablevision, declined to comment and referred calls to the New York Association for Better Choices, an advocacy group that opposes the stadium. 
 Anna Levin, a member of the association, released a statement suggesting that the mayor was attacking Cablevision to draw attention away from what she called his defeat this week -- the State Legislature's decision to approve the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center without including the stadium in the legislation. 
 ''It is not surprising that he continues to duck the issues and tries to change the subject,'' she said. ''With the overwhelming majority of New Yorkers opposed to spending $600 million in tax dollars for a football stadium, the opposition is growing and momentum is clearly against the football stadium.''

HEADLINE: Variations on Power to the People

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
In the long-running Enron bankruptcy tale, one of the more intriguing sideshows involves the fate of Portland General Electric, Oregon's largest utility and the only energy-producing asset Enron actually owned. 
 The electric utility has become the object of a tug of war in which many in the city's business elite have aligned themselves with their natural adversaries, consumer groups, to fight a proposed sale to the Texas Pacific Group.
 The deal is so disliked by the economic powers here that some prefer that the city government buy Portland G.E. The opponents fear that Texas Pacific, a $13 billion private investment firm based in Fort Worth, would be too Enron-like: an absentee owner interested more in a quick profit than in delivering electricity at reasonable prices.
 They contend that customers will pay too much for electricity and that the utility will make too much profit for a regulated monopoly. They further contend that the government will not receive the taxes included in the rates paid by customers, as happened under Enron. 
 The Oregon Public Utility Commission is scheduled to hear final arguments on the Texas Pacific plan on Dec. 13. The panel has 60 days to decide whether to accept or reject the application, or add conditions. Texas Pacific representatives, who would not speak for attribution, insisted in a lengthy interview that none of these concerns were valid. Owen Blicksilver, a Texas Pacific public-relations consultant, said the firm believed that the opposition was a negotiating ploy by other companies hoping to win concessions.
 Mr. Blicksilver could identify only two business supporters of the purchase. One is a small newspaper, The Business Journal of Portland. The other is The Oregonian, a Newhouse newspaper that published an editorial favoring the deal.
 Texas Pacific, whose co-founder and managing partner is David Bonderman, has a track record of buying troubled companies, notably Continental Airlines, J. Crew and Burger King, and turning them around. Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities, which represents 32 major employers, including Intel; the Building Owners and Managers Association, an organization of major landlords; and several consumer groups have filed petitions asking the Oregon Public Utility Commission to reject Texas Pacific. The industrial users are especially worried that Texas Pacific will not invest the necessary funds to upgrade Portland G.E.'s transmission facilities, and that service will become unreliable. 
 Reliability is an especially crucial issue for Intel, the computer chip maker that is the area's largest employer and pays Portland G.E. $51 million annually for electricity.
 ''The more our members hear about this deal from Texas Pacific, the less they like it,'' said Ken Canon, executive director of the industrial users group. Mr. Canon adds that some of his biggest members would favor city ownership of the utility -- an unusual position for business leaders to adopt -- if that is what it takes to stop Texas Pacific. 
 Because Portland G.E. is a legal monopoly, the rates it charges, and how much profit it can earn, are regulated. The commission has said the profit target should be 10.5 percent of equity, but public documents suggest Texas Pacific may be able to earn more than 20 percent. 
 According to Ann L. Fisher, the lawyer for the Building Owners and Managers Association and a former Portland G.E. lawyer, Texas Pacific could make as much as a 50 percent return on its investment. Texas Pacific representatives dismissed talk of a 50 percent return as absurd, but would not reveal what they expected to earn, saying this was a private matter between the investment firm and its investors. 
 The Public Utility Commission, at the request of Texas Pacific, has required lawyers for the opposing groups to sign confidentiality agreements before looking at financial documents that, in most utility rate proceedings, would be public record. Among them are documents explaining what rate of return the parent company expects the utility to achieve.
 Jason Eisdorfer, a lawyer for the Citizens Utility Board, one of the consumer groups fighting the sale, said that for the owners of a regulated monopoly to make more than 20 percent would be ''unconscionable.'' He said business leaders oppose the deal because ''they know they will be paying too much for electricity.''
 Erik Sten, a city commissioner, said he had the votes on the five-member commission to authorize revenue bonds quickly to acquire the utility's assets, actions that would not require a popular vote. He said the city could retain existing management or hire one of two dozen utility companies that have contacted the city about managing Portland G.E.
 ''The city can run Portland G.E. better,'' Mr. Sten said, and ''charge lower rates'' because it would pay state, but not federal, taxes. He asserted that unlike Texas Pacific, the city has an incentive to make long-term investments in the utility to ensure reliable high quality electric service, which is crucial to the local economy. Kelvin Davis, the Texas Pacific partner overseeing the deal, testified that Oregon Electric was committed to investing to improve Portland G.E.'s assets. 
 Under state law a city purchase only works if Enron creditors agree to the purchase. The city could afford to pay Enron creditors a slightly higher price than Texas Pacific, Mr. Sten said. Texas Pacific is paying Enron creditors about $2.3 billion, with $935 million being debt. It would withdraw $220 million or more in dividends that Enron has not taken from Portland General Electric. Texas Pacific and minority investors, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, would put up about $525 million and an additional $650 million would be borrowed, the firm said. 
 Mr. Sten said that but for the cloud of Enron, Portland G.E. would be valued at about $3 billion.
 The Texas Pacific deal has renewed interest in the lessons to be learned from Portland G.E.'s involvement in what were two of the biggest corporate bankruptcies of their time: the 1932 collapse of the Insull Trusts and the 2001 failure of Enron. The Insull scandal, like that at Enron, involved convoluted financial manipulations that wiped out electric utility investors and prompted demands to prosecute the top executive, Sam Insull, who had been Thomas Edison's secretary. 
 In response to the Insull Trust scandal, Congress enacted the Public Utility Holding Company Act, which requires extensive financial disclosures by electric utilities and was intended to align the interests of utility company owners with their customers by making ownership local.
 Texas Pacific is seeking to avoid that law by creating a holding company whose only significant asset will be Portland G.E. The new holding company would be required to make financial disclosures and comply with other state and federal laws. Oregon's utility regulators, however, would not have the authority to inspect the books of Texas Pacific itself.
 In legal arguments, Texas Pacific's opponents describe the structure as one intended to comply with the law in name only.
 ''There is no pretense of trying to comply with the spirit and intent of the holding company act,'' said Robert McCullough, a utility consultant. He said the business interests opposing the deal did not believe that Texas Pacific would make long-range plans to modernize Portland G.E.'s electric grid. Indeed, Texas Pacific has testified that it plans to resell Portland G.E. in as little as five years.
 By acquiring Portland G.E., which collects $92 million annually to cover corporate income taxes, Texas Pacific could offset tax losses from other companies and pocket the tax money, as Enron did. 
 Without formal disclosure, how much, if any, of the taxes included in Portland G.E. rates would ever be passed on to the state of Oregon and the federal government would remain a mystery.
 The Texas Pacific representatives said they anticipated that at least $62 million of the $92 million in taxes would be paid by the intermediary company. 
 The federal and state income taxes that utility customers pay as part of their electric rates are calculated as if Portland G.E. was a stand-alone company. Since Enron acquired Portland G.E. in 1997, Ms. Fisher said, ''customers paid $667 million to cover Portland G.E.'s taxes, and that money never made its way to the government.'' She said the proper term to describe this is ''stealing our money.''
 Lee Beyers, the public utility commission chairman, has said that adjusting electric rates to reflect taxes actually paid would be ''tricky'' and could result in higher rates under some circumstances.

HEADLINE: Sprint Is Near $34 Billion Deal To Buy Nextel

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Sprint is near a deal to acquire Nextel Communications for more than $34 billion in a transaction that would further consolidate the rapidly changing telecommunications industry, according to executives involved in the negotiations.
 The deal comes as the mobile phone industry faces fierce new market pressures, with competitors seeking to keep and attract customers who can jump easily from one operator to another. 
 A merger between Sprint and Nextel would create a powerful new cellular company, with some 39 million customers. It would also mean that 74 percent of the entire cellphone market would be controlled by three gigantic operators. Cingular, which recently completed its acquisition of AT&T Wireless, is the largest in the nation, with 46 million subscribers, and Verizon Wireless, the No.2 in the market, has 42 million subscribers. 
 The boards of Sprint and Nextel are planning to meet separately on Tuesday to ratify the deal, the executives said, and they hope to announce it on Wednesday. Still, the executives cautioned that several thorny details, including a possible deal-breaking tax issue, still need to be worked out and that the deal could fall apart. 
 ''It's a marriage of survival rather than growth for Nextel and Sprint,'' said Ken Dulaney, a telecommunications analyst at Gartner Inc. ''They need each other's customers.''
 A deal would help two companies that face increasingly difficult business prospects. 
 Each is currently less than half the size of Cingular, and each could lose customers as Cingular and Verizon move aggressively with promotions and new plans that offer bundled phone services. Together they would be better able to fend off those rivals. 
 Once the transaction is completed, the combined company, which will have its headquarters in Reston, Va., where Nextel is based, and an operation center in Overland Park, Kan., where Sprint is based, would spin off Sprint's fixed-line business. 
 Under the deal, which both sides plan to call a merger of equals but in economic terms is an acquisition of Nextel by Sprint, shareholders of Nextel would receive stock and cash worth about 1.3 shares of Sprint for each share of Nextel that they own. The deal would value Nextel at about $34 billion based on yesterday's stock movements. Sprint would control just slightly more than 50 percent of the company.
 Sprint's chief executive, Gary D. Forsee, would be the combined company's chief executive, and Nextel's chief, Timothy Donahue, would become the executive chairman. The board would be split 50-50. 
 The sale of Sprint's fixed-line business and the tax implications of that move remain the last major sticking points in the transaction, the executives said. Indeed, Sprint and Nextel are planning to meet with Internal Revenue Service officials on Monday to get guidance on whether such a spinoff could be tax-free to shareholders. If it would not be considered tax-free, the transaction could be scuttled, the executives said.
 The combined company might wring savings of about $2 billion by merging operations, a central reason for the deal, the executives said. 
 As in most deals of this size, executive style and corporate culture are crucial. Nextel is a fiercely independent company, having grown out of a taxi radio-dispatch business.
 Mr. Donahue, its chief executive, is informal and direct. Mr. Forsee, by contrast, was an executive at BellSouth, a traditional phone company. 
 Two executives close to the deal noted that the personal chemistry between Mr. Forsee and Mr. Donahue had become strained over the negotiations in recent days and could cause the deal to unravel if the relationship soured.
 The differences between the companies, though, go beyond the executives. Nextel's network runs on a technology called iDEN that no other major cellular carriers use. The company has used it to develop a walkie-talkie service called Push to Talk that has proved popular with consumers and business customers.
 Sprint's network runs on the more common C.D.M.A. technology and is being expanded to carry high-speed data services, an important revenue source in future years. Nextel customers, industry analysts say, would be encouraged to turn in their iDEN handsets for phones with Sprint's technology, a change that could alienate loyal Nextel subscribers. 
 To appease them, Sprint and Nextel may be forced to use both technologies simultaneously for several years, an expensive proposition that could dilute the combined company's profitability.
 Although mergers of this size can run into antitrust problems, this deal is unlikely to cause that concern, Mr. Dulaney and others say. In October, the Justice Department approved Cingular's purchase of AT&T Wireless with relatively little comment. Sprint and Nextel combined would still be 15 percent smaller than the new Cingular. Even so, consumer groups say consolidation in the industry has left consumers with fewer choices. 
 Even with the wave of mergers during the past few years, prices have remained relatively stable, and carriers have introduced more services as well.
 While most analysts and industry executives say a Sprint-Nextel alliance makes sense and can be accomplished, they also say that Verizon Wireless could make a counteroffer to buy Sprint.
 Indeed, executives at Verizon Wireless -- which is owned by Verizon Communications and Vodafone -- held meetings on Thursday after news reports that Sprint and Nextel were in talks. 
 Executives from Verizon and Vodafone plan to reassess their options once Sprint and Nextel agree on a price, according to executives close to those companies. 
 Verizon Wireless would not comment on any possible bid or the potential for a Sprint-Nextel alliance.
 While a Sprint-Nextel deal remains the most likely combination, there is ''the potential for Verizon also making a bid for Sprint, given that fit also makes a ton of sense,'' according to Scott Cleland, an analyst at the research firm Precursor.
 Buying Sprint would vault Verizon back to the top of the industry. Verizon and Sprint use the same technology in their cellular networks, making it easier to merge the services. 
 Sprint also controls a vast national fiber network that can connect calls, a system that Verizon could use. Sprint's wireless customers, business or residential, are also attractive. On average, they spend $63 a month on their cell phones. Verizon's customers, by contrast, spend just $51.60 a month.
 Of course, Verizon Wireless may decide it is strong enough to continue operating on its own. Its revenue jumped 23 percent, to $7.3 billion, in the third quarter, and it added a record 1.7 million new subscribers. Verizon Wireless also has an industry-low 1.5 percent turnover rate.
 Shares of Sprint dropped 14 cents, to close at $24.14. Shares of Nextel dropped 5 cents, to close at $29.76.

HEADLINE: The Commerce Secretary's Other Job

 BODY:
Secretaries of commerce tend to be plucked from the business world, and for good reason. As commonly understood by the public and the presidents who appoint them, the secretary's role is to be a cheerleader for American business, to promote enterprise and trade and -- to the extent he cares to listen -- to advise the president on economic policy. That was certainly President Bush's understanding when he described his nominee, Carlos Gutierrez, chief executive of the Kellogg Company, as a man who ''knows exactly what it takes to help American businesses grow and to create jobs.'' 
 But that is only the half of it -- in budgetary terms, less than half. Fully 60 percent of the Commerce Department's budget is allocated not to economic development but to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, called NOAA. That agency not only monitors developments in Earth's atmosphere (global warming among them), but also has the primary responsibility for understanding, managing and protecting America's ocean waters.
 By all rights, these executive responsibilities alone should entitle Mr. Gutierrez to play an important role in setting the government's broad environmental policy. None of his predecessors have chosen to do so. But Mr. Gutierrez will have to be more engaged than they were, especially on oceans policy. President Bush is obliged to respond to a report by the United States Commission on Ocean Policy by Dec. 20. The report is one of two exhaustive studies in the last year -- the other was produced privately by the Pew Oceans Commission -- that found America's ocean waters to be increasingly at risk from coastal pollution, rampant overfishing and confusion among the agencies responsible for ocean health. 
 It will be Mr. Gutierrez's job to follow up on Mr. Bush's proposals and deal with a Congress that is increasingly impatient for action. There are a half-dozen bills circulating on Capitol Hill that would impose new discipline on an essentially self-regulating fishing industry, toughen laws on coastal development and reorganize the way oceans policy is made. One bill that should be of particular interest to Mr. Gutierrez would strip NOAA from his department and set it up as an independent agency with control over scores of ocean-related programs now scattered throughout the bureaucracy.
 It would be surprising if Mr. Gutierrez gave any of these issues much thought while he was running a big cereal company. But the Senate committee in charge of approving his nomination should make sure that he gets up to speed in a hurry.

HEADLINE: South America Seeks to Fill the World's Table

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: LUCAS DO RIO VERDE, Brazil 

 BODY:
Almost overnight, South America has driven a historic global shift in food production that is turning the largely untapped frontier heartland of the continent into the world's new breadbasket.
 One of the last places on earth where large tracts are still available for agriculture, the region, led by Brazil, has had an explosion of farm exports over the past decade. The growth has been fueled by a combination of market-friendly economic policies and advances in agronomy that have brought formerly unusable tropical lands into production and increased productivity levels beyond those in the United States and Europe, challenging their traditional dominance of the global farm trade.
 Sometime over the next decade or so, Brazil, which Secretary of State Colin L. Powell described as ''an agricultural superpower'' during a visit in October, hopes to pass the United States as the world's largest agricultural producer. But the trend is far broader and can be felt also in parts of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, with a deep impact on the region's economy and environment. And it has spurred a debate that has mainly focused on expansion into areas where the Amazon rainforest is thought to be jeopardized. 
 ''There has been a silent revolution in the countryside'' since the 1990's, Brazil's minister of agriculture, Roberto Rodrigues, said in an interview in the capital, Brasilia. The past four or five years in particular, he said, have been ''characterized by spectacular growth and a huge increase in demand'' abroad for foodstuffs, which has given Brazil ''the capacity to compete with anyone.''
 The global effect has been powerful. In June, the United States imported more in farm products than it sold abroad, further evidence of its eroding position. Alert to the challenge, the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation even has a presentation for its members called ''Should Brazil Give You Heartburn?'' The answer is a not-so-qualified yes.
 The competition is personified in producers like Otaviano Pivetta, 45, and Helmute Lawisch, 39. Less than 20 years ago, the two friends took turns driving 1,500 miles over mostly bone-jarring roads from their homes in Brazil's southernmost state to stake their claim in this region, which was mostly jungle then, with little in the way of electricity, sanitation or other public services.
 In retrospect, it is clear that they were in the vanguard of a fundamental transformation of global agriculture. Today, farmland stretches to the horizon. With a climate that varies little the year round, it is not unusual to have two or even three harvests a year and to see combines clearing fields with planters sowing another crop in their wake.
 The two men are now among the most successful producers in the region, and Mr. Pivetta has twice been elected mayor of Lucas do Rio Verde. Each now cultivates more than 100,000 acres, sending soybeans, cotton and pork to markets as distant as China, Russia and Pakistan. With the Southern Hemisphere's spring planting season now complete, the two farmers and scores of others like them here in Mato Grosso state are looking forward to another year of bumper crops.
 ''With the great climate and fertile soil we have here, I can't imagine any other place that gets the kind of productivity that we do,'' said Mr. Pivetta, whose family now runs a half-dozen farms here. ''Not in Brazil or anywhere else are you going to find two crops a year yielding three tons of grain an acre.''

Brazil's 'Green Anchor'
 Agriculture is now a $150-billion-a-year business in Brazil, accounting for more than 40 percent of the country's exports and creating what Brazilians call the ''green anchor'' of their economy.
 Already the world's biggest exporter of chickens, orange juice, sugar, coffee and tobacco, according to Agriculture Ministry statistics, Brazil soon hopes to add soybeans to the list, depending on what happens in that volatile market.
 With a grass-fed herd of 175 million cattle that is the world's largest, it passed the United States as the world's largest exporter of beef last year. During the first nine months of 2004, sales of Brazilian beef abroad rose 77 percent over the same period last year, leading the government to predict $2.5 billion in earnings from beef exports this year.
 Over all, the agricultural bonanza, aided in part by mad cow disease in Europe and avian flu in Asia, is likely to give Brazil a record trade surplus of over $30 billion.
 Brazil's advantages start with the availability of large amounts of cheap land, especially here in this region of well-drained tropical savanna known as the cerrado. Larger than the American grain belt but dismissed as useless for farming until barely a quarter of a century ago, the cerrado cuts across the heart of Brazil, and its vastness permits economies of scale that are the envy of producers elsewhere.
 ''What's really driving this revolution is that the Brazilians discovered how to use tropical and savanna soils that had always been considered poor,'' said G. Edward Schuh, director of the Center for International Economic Policy at the University of Minnesota. ''They learned that with modest applications of lime and phosphorus they can quadruple and quintuple their yields, not just with soybeans but also with maize, cotton and other commodities.''
 The discovery of how to enrich the soil and make it highly productive came in research at the Brazilian Enterprise for Agricultural and Livestock Research, a government agency known by the Portuguese-language acronym Embrapa. The agency's biggest successes, however, have been in modifying crops to grow in those altered soils.
 Until recently, for example, soybeans were not thought to flourish in tropical soils and climates. But researchers at Embrapa and similar private or state institutes have developed more than 40 varieties of soy specially adapted for the cerrado. Soybeans now account for nearly half of Brazil's farm exports and are the main crop in this region.
 Embrapa researchers have also developed breeds of cattle for the tropics, using a variety originally from India, as well as a ''tropical hog'' that is lower in fat and cholesterol than its American counterpart and that has a higher ham and loin yield. Perhaps most surprisingly, the Brazilians are also working on varieties of tropical wheat.
 ''One of the main reasons we believe that Brazil has a greater chance to prosper even further is that they have a very solid scientific foundation,'' said Daniel Lederman, an economist at the World Bank who specializes in agriculture. ''The concept of tropical technology is very attractive and we are learning a lot by studying Embrapa, which is at the forefront of applied agricultural research.''

Government's Helping Hand
 Changes in economic policies have also spurred the boom here. At the beginning of the 1990's, for example, Brazil lifted longtime restrictions on imports, leading to a surge in purchases of tractors, combines, fertilizers, pesticides and seeds.
 A leap in exports came in 1999, when the government devalued the currency and allowed the real, which had been trading at near par with the dollar, to float on the currency exchange market. Today, the real trades at almost three to the dollar, which means incomes for agricultural producers have nearly tripled.
 The Brazilian bonanza has been eagerly welcomed by the main international agricultural trading companies, which have been quick to seize new opportunities. In this town of 30,000, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill not only have built huge warehouses and silos along the main highway, but have also provided credit to farmers on a scale far beyond the means of the Brazilian government.
 ''It's good business for them, but we have to admit we owe a lot to the trading companies,'' said Mr. Lawisch, whose family, modest stakeholders in their home state of Rio Grande do Sul, has moved here. ''When we needed them, they supported us, and now that we are prospering, our commercial relationship continues to expand every year.''
 To counter the South American advances, the United States and Europe have increased subsidies to their own beleaguered farmers. But in a pair of landmark decisions, the World Trade Organization recently ruled that such subsidies for cotton and sugar are illegal and must be phased out. 
 The Bush administration is appealing the cotton ruling, but it is widely expected to lose, and many economists say the principle could be applied to other crops.
 All of this clearly will have an increasing impact on agriculture in the United States. Experts say some areas that are not competitive with South America may have to move from one crop to another, while others will face pressure to shift out of agriculture altogether.
 Some American and European farmers already have, and are starting to buy farmland here. Wolfgang Hudepohl, a real estate agent in Cuiaba, Mato Grosso's state capital, estimates that he has sold 60 farms to foreigners over the past few years. ''Foreigners like not only the cheap prices, but also the low production costs and the fact they are not tied down by regulations,'' he said.
 At the edges of the agricultural frontier, in states like Maranhao and Piaui hundreds of miles east of here, land is still remarkably cheap, as little as $20 an acre in some remote areas. But in places where the boom is already going full blast, like here, land prices are rising rapidly.
 ''Seven years ago, I bought 6,175 acres, and paid $125,000,'' said Jose Luiz Lorenzi, a farmer and manager of the John Deere agency here, which is the busiest in Brazil. ''Just recently I got an offer of $1.5 million for the same land. But I'm not selling. I want to buy more property myself because there is no better investment in the world than buying land in Mato Grosso.''

The Costs of the Boom
 The real estate boom has not been without social tensions and other costs, particularly to the environment, as the expansion of farm and grazing lands has accelerated Amazon deforestation. Typically, jungle is razed for conversion first into cattle pasture and then, as the agricultural frontier advances, into fields for soybeans and other crops.
 But producers in the cerrado, which is more than 1,000 miles from the coast, say they are more concerned about the lack of reliable highways, railways and barge routes, which adds to the cost of doing business. That situation, farmers say, is gradually improving, as is Brazil's ability to weather the ups and downs of agricultural markets.
 After nearly a decade of rising prices and record profits, soybean prices, for instance, have sharply dropped this year, the result in large part of a decision to curb imports and to cancel existing contracts by China, where a huge new market has emerged to satisfy the changing diet of a growing middle class.
 In the past, when Brazilian agriculture was dependent on a single crop, that would have spelled certain disaster. But Brazil has made a successful effort to diversify its exports, and has reduced its vulnerability to sudden price fluctuations for any single crop. In the 1960's, for example, coffee was responsible for 60 percent of Brazil's exports. Today, coffee is seventh on the list. 
 As a result, the watchword today for Brazilian farm producers is to diversify even further.
 ''We're entering a phase in which we're not going just to be growing things, but processing them too, turning them into finished products,'' said Eledir Pedro Techio, manager of the local credit cooperative and a soybean and corn farmer. It is also clear that further gains in production are still to come, thanks both to expansion of the agricultural frontier and higher yields. 
 Government officials estimate that an additional 50 million acres, much of it as potentially fertile as the land being tilled here now, are likely to be put into production over the next decade.
 ''There's no way you can go wrong here,'' Mr. Lawisch said. ''We're champions of production already, but we think we can do even better. We aim to feed not just Brazil, but the world.''

HEADLINE: Don't Revive the Death Penalty

BYLINE: By ANDREW CUOMO. 
Andrew Cuomo, who was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 1997 to 2001, ran for governor in 2002 .

 BODY:
CAPITAL punishment has been suspended in New York, following a state Court of Appeals ruling in June that the ''deadlock instructions'' in the death penalty law were unconstitutional.
 These instructions required a judge to tell the jury that if it failed to unanimously impose the death penalty, the defendant would be eligible for parole. The court reasoning that the fear of setting a criminal free might coerce a death penalty vote.
 Immediately after the court's decision, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, promised to cure the legal defect and quickly pass a new law. The governor put forward a bill in August. The Senate quickly followed suit. Fortunately, the Assembly leader, Sheldon Silver, announced that given the issue's profound importance, public hearings would be held. 
 The Democrats, who control the Assembly, should make it clear that they will not pass a new death penalty law. This will take courage, but it is vital that they do so: We cannot rely much longer on a progressive Court of Appeals to intercede and prevent executions, as has happened since 1995, when the death penalty was reinstituted in New York. (Mr. Pataki had vowed to reinstate the death penalty in his campaign against my father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.) As judges appointed by Governor Cuomo retire over the next few years, Governor Pataki will install more conservative court members. 
 More important, there remains no evidence that the death penalty is a deterrent to crime and plenty of evidence that it is invoked arbitrarily -- and often mistakenly. Last year, 267 inmates nationwide had their death sentences overturned or removed, according to the Justice Department. This is the largest number in any year since 1976, when the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of state death-penalty laws in a group of states. 
 Other developments since 1995 have also mirrored the growing doubts about capital punishment. In 2000, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican who had supported the death penalty, imposed a moratorium on all executions in his state, citing instances in which death-row inmates were found to be innocent. And a report issued in November by the Justice Department reveals that death sentences nationally are now at a 30-year low. 
 At the same time, cases in which DNA evidence has established the innocence of people convicted of capital crimes -- along with concerns about racial bias in death-penalty sentencing -- have further undercut support for capital punishment around the country. According to a 2004 Gallup Poll, about half of all Americans say that convicted murderers should get the death penalty. But just under half instead support a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Public opinion has been shifting toward this second option, according to the Gallup organization. The poll also showed that 62 percent of Americans believe that capital punishment does not act as a deterrent, compared with 51 percent in 1991. 
 Nor does capital punishment make sense financially. Many studies show that it is more expensive for taxpayers to pursue executions than to sentence criminals to life without parole. Indeed, New York State has spent at least $160 million pursuing the death penalty since 1995. 
 Unfortunately, the prevailing thinking in Albany is that opposition to the death penalty is ''political suicide.'' I disagree. While the public overall still favors the death penalty, public opinion in New York has been shifting. A poll conducted in 2003 by Quinnipiac University shows that a majority of New York Democrats oppose the death penalty and that a majority of all New Yorkers favor sentences of mandatory life without parole over execution. Such sentences did not exist in the state when the death penalty law was passed in 1995. 
 Leadership can change public opinion, and this shifting point of view may become even more pronounced if the Assembly Democrats wage an intense debate on the issue, informing people of the facts -- and of the shortcomings of the bills awaiting action in the Legislature. While other states are instituting safeguards against police and prosecutorial misconduct and ensuring protection for mentally ill defendants in capital cases, for example, these issues are not addressed in the governor's or Senate's proposals. 
 For the public, the debate can begin as early as this week. The first of a series of public hearings on the death penalty is to be held in New York City on Wednesday. 
 The Court of Appeals ruling that suspended the state's death penalty has given New Yorkers a window of opportunity, a moment to enact a real reform. It should not be lost.

HEADLINE: Finding a Neighborhood and a School

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
MANY people with children in New York City know about the highly regarded Public School 87 on the Upper West Side, or Public School 6 on the Upper East Side. 
 In those schools, many students test above the norm in reading and math, and their parents can be assured, in most cases, that they have access to a decent education. 
 But in those neighborhoods, the average cost of a two-bedroom co-op exceeds $1.1 million, and a condo is more than $1.6 million, according to Jonathan Miller of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. For a couple in a cramped one-bedroom apartment, or for a family moving here from, say, Omaha, they are likely to be out of reach. 
 There are suggestions, and maybe solutions, for people who want to stay in the city and send their children to public school without living in studio apartments. Several elementary schools around the city have gained attention for their innovative programs and good teachers, and many of them are in neighborhoods that are far more affordable than the Upper East Side or Upper West Side. 
 Finding space and a school may require having an open mind about what constitutes a good school and considering neighborhoods that might be unfamiliar. 
 There is a connection between neighborhood wealth and test scores, but it can be misleading. There is no question that property values are directly correlated with schools' test scores. ''They march in lockstep,'' said Ingrid Gould Ellen, deputy director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law. 
 A statistical analysis by the Furman Center tracing both English language test scores for elementary and middle school students and median house prices in 26 New York City community school districts (all those outside of Manhattan) drew ascending, virtually parallel lines.
 Median sales prices in the 26 school districts ranged from a low of $100,000 per housing unit in the South Bronx, where 22.4 percent of students in Grades 3 to 8 scored at or above grade level on the English tests, Professor Ellen said, to a high of nearly $400,000 per housing unit in the district covering suburbanlike northeast Queens, where 74.7 percent of students scored at grade level or higher.
 But that doesn't present a full picture of the talents of the teachers or principals. Teaching ''middle-income kids with highly educated parents to do well on standardized tests is quite different, and arguably easier, than working with kids whose parents didn't graduate from high school, and getting them to do well,'' said Amy Ellen Schwartz, a professor of public policy and economics at the Furman Center.
 ''Some schools do a fabulous job educating their kids even if they don't perform at the highest level, and they are not in the fanciest neighborhoods,'' Professor Schwartz said. ''There are some schools in Queens, for example, that have immigrant parents, where English as a second language is the norm, and they're doing a great job.''
 Clara Hemphill, author of ''New York City's Best Public Elementary Schools: A Parents' Guide'' (Teachers College Press), agreed. Ms. Hemphill is also director of the Web site www.insideschools.org, sponsored by Advocates for Children of New York, which offers profiles of all 1,300 schools in the city system; she and her staff have visited about 950 so far. ''We encourage people to look beyond the scores,'' Ms. Hemphill said. ''We think qualitative information is very important, but often overlooked.''
 To be sure, parents seeking the most comprehensive data on a particular school in the system can go to the Department of Education's Web site -- www.nycenet.edu/daa -- and find up to 20 pages of information on that school, including: class size, attendance, number of teachers with advanced degrees, spending per pupil, special-education enrollment, percentage of students eligible for free lunch, suspensions and, of course, test scores.
 Ms. Hemphill's books and Web site provide much of that data, but also a more impressionistic assessment of each school. 
 The profiles touch on such aspects as discipline, school uniforms, homework policy, special education services, students' work posted in the hallways, children reading while sitting on beanbag chairs or rugs, parent volunteers. Every two weeks, the Web site is updated with parents' comments.
 The Web site also gives a green check to noteworthy schools. ''We've identified schools that have all the ingredients to do well,'' Ms. Hemphill said. ''But, really, the key is a good principal. With a good principal, anything is possible. And if you have an ineffectual principal, even with a good staff, you won't have a good school.''
 Test scores are measured by a system of five stars: (*) one star indicating that zero to 19 percent of the students scored at or above grade level; (**) two stars, 20 to 39 percent; (***) three stars, 40 to 59 percent, (****) four stars, 60 to 79 percent and (*****) five stars, at least 80 percent.
 Ms. Hemphill was asked for snapshot impressions of a sampling of noteworthy schools sprinkled about the five boroughs. And local brokers were asked to assess the home market around those schools. 
 There is a link between school quality and housing prices in the city, but it is not as strong as it is in most suburbs, in part because of a looser connection in the city between home location and school attendance. 
 While most elementary and middle schools in the city are zoned, meaning any student residing in the area is eligible to attend that school, zoned schools can grant waivers to children living outside the area.
 Then, of course, scattered throughout the five boroughs are dozens of magnet and charter schools that accept students regardless of where they live. Many city high schools are not zoned and accept students based on factors other than where they live. ''So, to the extent that in the city the high school link is loose,'' Professor Schwartz said, ''we can expect less impact on property values.''
 What follows is Ms. Hemphill's list of schools -- ''It's a somewhat idiosyncratic list,'' she said, and in no way inclusive -- and information about housing prices.

THE BRONX
 P.S. 24, 660 West 236th Street, Riverdale (2004 reading scores ****), borders the parkland of Spuyten Duyvil Creek, with trails by the Hudson. ''The school's principal is well versed in special education,'' Ms. Hemphill said. ''One of its strengths is teaching kids from different ethnic groups.'' All around the neighborhood, said Susan E. Goldy, president of the real estate firm Susan E. Goldy Inc., are co-op buildings and private homes. ''There's express buses to Manhattan; the Metro-North station is 18 minutes from Grand Central,'' she said, ''or you can take a bus or walk to the subway.'' A two-bedroom co-op on Palisade Avenue is listed at $449,000. Rents for two-bedrooms are $1,200 to $1,500; three-bedrooms, $1,800 to $2,300.
 P.S. 119, 1075 Pugsley Avenue, Soundview (***), is surrounded by one-, two- and three-family homes and apartment buildings and is close to the No. 6 subway line. ''The school has a Harvard-educated principal who is knowledgeable about the teaching techniques the mayor is introducing,'' Ms. Hemphill said. ''Kids read children's literature rather than textbooks.'' Haniff Baksh of ERA Besmatch Real Estate said a single-family three-bedroom on Patterson Avenue is listed for $330,000; a two-family on Story Avenue, $385,000. Rent for a two-bedroom is about $1,075; three-bedrooms, $1,350.

BROOKLYN
 P.S. 58, 330 Smith Street, Carroll Gardens (****), ''has couches and rocking chairs in the classrooms,'' Ms. Hemphill said. ''Children as young as 5 learn violin.'' Angela Vita, owner of Vita Realty, said: ''On Court Street or Smith Street you see all the mothers with strollers. Smith Street has become a restaurant row.'' Brick or Federal-style row houses line the streets. ''A three-story, two-family on Sackett Street is listed for $995,000,'' Ms. Vita said. Rent for a two-bedroom starts about $1,800.
 P.S. 154, 1625 11th Avenue, Windsor Terrace (****), ''has a homey feel and a strong principal,'' Ms. Hemphill said. Dan Shapiro, an agent for Madison Estates & Properties, said Windsor Terrace is ''a small, close-knit community'' with colonnade-style one- and two-family homes. The average home, Mr. Shapiro said, sells in the high $600,000's to low $700,000's. Currently, a two-family house on Vanderbilt Street is listed at $679,000.
 P.S. 384, 242 Cooper Street, Bushwick (***), ''has a large immigrant population and a really dynamic principal,'' Ms. Hemphill said. ''Test scores are going up.'' T.J. Wilson of Coldwell Banker Innovation Real Estate said: ''It's a working-class neighborhood, lots of wood frames; mostly two- and three-families.'' A two-family house on Cooper Street, near the school, is listed at $440,000. Rents start at about $1,200 for a two-bedroom and $1,500 for a three-bedroom.

QUEENS
 P.S. 222, 86-15 37th Avenue, Jackson Heights, is a prekindergarten through second grade (no test scores) ''early-childhood magnet school,'' Ms. Hemphill said. ''They have two computers in each classroom even though these are little kids.'' Jim Pappas of ERA Rock Realty said the school is close to the No. 7 line and shopping on Roosevelt Avenue. ''We're at the top tier for diversity in the country,'' Mr. Pappas said, ''100-plus nationalities.'' On 34th Avenue, a two-bedroom co-op is listed for $235,000. On 88th Street, the asking price for a detached five-bedroom is $699,000. Rents for two-bedrooms range from $1,300 to $1,500; three-bedrooms, $1,400 to $1,900.
 P.S. 234, 30-15 29th Street, Astoria (****), ''is a beautiful building, curved hallways,'' Ms. Hemphill said. ''It has a strong arts curriculum.'' Kelly Lagoudis of Re/Max Today said, ''Athens Square is across the street; in the summer, they have musicians, dancers; all the people come.'' The N and R lines are a block from the school. A three-family brick house on 21st Street is listed for $799,000; a two-family on 21st Street, for $769,000. On mixed-use streets, Ms. Lagoudis said, there are apartments above and stores on the ground floor -- ''fruit stores, pastry shops with people sitting outside.'' Rents for two-bedrooms start at $1,250; three-bedrooms, $1,600.

STATEN ISLAND
 P.S. 19, 780 Post Avenue, Port Richmond (***), ''has classical music and jazz playing in the corridors,'' Ms. Hemphill said, ''student work on the walls.'' Dawn M. Carpenter, president of Dawning Real Estate, said Port Richmond has a mix of large colonials, detached ranches and bungalows and newer semiattached homes. ''A one-story, two-bedroom bungalow could start at $229,000,'' she said. ''For three-bedroom colonials, the price would be $325,000 to $359,000, which in today's market is economical for the young family. One of the newer semiattached colonials, three bedrooms, that's $459,000.''
 P.S. 6, 555 Page Avenue, Tottenville (****), is ''a beautiful facility, built in 2000,'' Ms. Hemphill said. ''One benefit of a new school is that the principal can hire a cohesive staff; you see that there.'' Tottenville, at the southern end of the island, retains rural vestiges. ''You have new homes blending with homes as much as 150 years old,'' said Robert Kelly of ERA Master Realtors. Open spaces, with stretches of cattails, border the school. The train trip and ferry ride to Lower Manhattan take 90 minutes. A detached one-family ''handyman special'' on Sprague Avenue near the school, Mr. Kelly said, is listed for $399,000; a two-bedroom condominium town house on Sprague Avenue, $289,900. ''A large two-family colonial on Amboy Road is priced at $775,000,'' he said.

MANHATTAN
 Hamilton Heights Academy, 475 West 155th Street, is a small, new school (no test scores) housed in a neighborhood school. ''It's progressive, racially mixed,'' Ms. Hemphill said. ''Parents are welcome in the classroom.'' Four-story row houses line the side streets, with co-op and condominium buildings on the avenues. ''Until 1984,'' said Willie Kathryn Suggs, principal of Willie Kathryn Suggs Licensed Real Estate Brokers, ''you could buy the most beautiful house on Hamilton Terrace or Strivers' Row for $200,000. These days, it's $2.5 million.'' A two-bedroom co-op on Convent Avenue at 149th Street is listed for $425,000. In a five-story walk-up at 152nd Street, a three-bedroom co-op is priced at $295,000.
 P.S. 126, 80 Catherine Street, Lower East Side (****), ''is a cheery building with student work all over the walls,'' Ms. Hemphill said.
 ''Parents stay with their children during breakfast.'' There are low-income housing and brownstones with storefronts in the neighborhood, said Kristine Benson of Century 21 William B. May, and pockets of new construction. ''On Clinton, there are co-op high-rises where two-bedrooms go for $675,000,'' she said. Rent for a two-bedroom at 10 Rutgers Street is $2,800. ''That's not bad; studios rent for $2,800 in other parts of the city,'' she said. ''I think people are just trying to get a piece of Manhattan, and the Lower East Side is the epitome of what's changing.''

HEADLINE: E-Dating Bubble Springs a Leak

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
ONLINE dating once seemed the perfect option for Allison Gold, a stock trader in Manhattan. It was a vast, exhilarating marketplace, humming along with the efficiency and unlimited opportunity of the financial markets of Wall Street, where she makes her living.
 Ms. Gold -- lithe, outgoing, athletic, blond -- seemed to have plenty to sell. And judging by the profiles of men on Match.com, the buy side had no shortages either. If she wanted a guy with green eyes -- and she sort of did -- she could type that requirement right into the search field alongside the desired height, income and ZIP code.
 ''At first, you're like a kid in a candy store,'' said Ms. Gold, who is 46. Hundreds of men answered her ad, and they all seemed great. ''They're perfect,'' she said, referring to the way men portrayed themselves in their profiles. ''They're all like the guys from 'Ocean's Eleven.' '' 
 Then she got a closer look. On dates, more than a few of the handsome, rugged, athletic types she thought she had been corresponding with looked more like George Costanza than George Clooney. Some of those ''single'' guys turned out to have wives.
 Feeling weary and, she said, ''jerked around,'' Ms. Gold let her paid subscription to Match.com expire, and she has turned to real-life singles mixers for professionals. ''I think I just burned out,'' she said. ''It's kind of like communism. On paper, it's a perfect system.''
 Apparently, many others have also found that the god of online dating has failed.
 ''It's clear that it's plateauing,'' said Peter M. Zollman, the founder of Classified Intelligence, a consulting company that focuses on online advertising. ''A lot of people feel like, 'I've been there, done that. I've met everybody there is to meet. I'll take a break.' ''
 Evidence is appearing that after years of rocketing growth, the online dating industry is drifting to earth. In 2002 the industry's revenues rose 73 percent over the previous year's, according to industry reports, and in 2003 they grew again by 77 percent. This year the growth has cooled, relatively speaking, to 19 percent, and tepid increases are forecast for coming years.
 ''The slowing has begun,'' said Nate Elliott, an analyst at Jupiter Research in New York.
 Many early adopters -- those quick to explore innovations -- are moving on to the next big thing, which looks a lot like the last things on the dating front: bars, real-life matchmaking services, setups arranged by friends. 
 Consumer spending on online personals dipped during the first two quarters of this year, to less than $114 million a quarter from about $117 million in the final quarter of 2003, as measured by comScore Networks, a research company in Reston, Va. ''Virtually any new industry goes through a period of rapid growth and expansion, followed by some adjustment,'' explained Daniel E. Hess, a vice president of the firm.
 This industry, apparently, is adjusting busily. In September Match .com laid off 10 percent of its work force and replaced its chief executive. Its third-quarter sales inched up 3 percent over the same period the previous year, and profits dropped 37 percent, a decrease that one executive at the company attributed to a rise in marketing costs.
 An online service called True, which started up in Irving, Tex., in January, has already slashed 60 percent of its 162 original employees, though it says it is now rehiring. Spring Street Networks, which operates the dating networks for Nerve and The Village Voice, has recently made significant staff cuts. In August MatchNet, a company in Beverly Hills that operates JDate.com and AmericanSingles.com, backed off from plans to go public.
 All of this is not to say that Internet dating as a business is on the ropes. Niche sites -- catering to elderly singles, lesbian singles, obese singles -- continue to spring up. More than 800 online dating sites now exist, according to Hitwise, a company that tracks Web industries.
 But as a heady pop-cultural revolution -- otherwise known as a fad -- the Net no longer seems to have the capacity to reinvent the world's mating rituals. A moment has passed. 
 ''There's a burnout factor that's almost inevitable in the online dating world,'' said Mr. Zollman of Classified Intelligence. In other words, either you find lasting love or you grow sick of surfing for it. At Match .com, which says it has 50 million profiles in its database, subscribers stay for only about five months on average, said Joe Cohen, the chief operating officer. (Subscriptions start at $24.95 a month.) He emphasized that about 40 percent of those who leave eventually return. 
 ''We've tried a number of things to keep them around longer,'' he said. ''But you know what? We don't really want them to stick around longer. We want them to find partners.''
 The clearest measure of a nascent weariness with online dating may be the expansion of defiantly offline dating services, some of them set up to cater to frustrated refugees from the Web.
 ''People think online dating has hurt our business when in fact it's made it grow,'' said Sherri Murphy, who operates a matchmaking service called Elite Connections in the Los Angeles area. She charges singles $795 to $5,000 to help them find mates among clients she says are carefully screened. ''Online dating is a job in itself,'' Ms. Murphy said. ''People come to us to relieve the burden.''
 As Renee Piane sees it, ''Online, there's no connectedness.'' Ms. Piane is the president of Rapid Dating in Santa Monica, Calif., one of several companies around the country that now manage ''speed dating'' parties where singles cycle through a rapid-fire series of five-minute minidates (a bit like musical chairs for grown-ups), so they can get a sense of whom they might want to date. ''You can't tell if there's any chemistry'' online, Ms. Piane said. ''With speed dating, you know in the first five minutes.''
 Ms. Piane canceled her own subscription to Match.com in May 2002, around the time she ran across, in person, an old high school acquaintance she soon fell in love with. She complained that her profile is still available on Match.com, giving false hope to hundreds of men, and said she has deleted more than 200 e-mail messages from eager bachelors in the last few weeks alone.
 Perhaps no one has been quite so literal in trying to build a business around online burnout as Ilana Eberson. Ms. Eberson, who worked at Jcupid.com, a former online dating site for Jewish singles, started a company called Real Live People Party four months ago.
 ''The whole concept is, 'Disconnect from the Internet, reconnect with real life,' because we all agree that the bloom is off the rose with online dating,'' Ms. Eberson said.
 It's not that Ms. Eberson's offline alternatives are revolutionary. So far, her company has held several singles mixers at New York bars, and she is planning to put on a scavenger hunt at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as well as a singles cruise. But she maintains that her timing is just right. After a few euphoric years mouse in hand, people are jaded about online dating, she said.
 On her company's Web site, www.reallivepeopleparty.com (yes, even offline dating services have Web sites), she started a contest in which the best tale of an ''online date from hell'' will earn free entry to a party.
 Dr. Marty Klein, a marriage and family counselor and sex therapist in Palo Alto, Calif., said: ''What always happens with new technologies, whether it's computers or cellphones, is that at first there are early adopters. Then it gets out into the commercial realm. Your grandma gets one. It's always over-hyped in the beginning, then turns out not to be the answer to everything, so some people with unrealistic expectations blame the technology. Like everything else, there's a predictable cultural curve to it.''
 Jill M. Horn, a real estate manager who lives in Manhattan, said that after divorcing in 2001 she joined about five paid dating sites. E-mail begat more e-mail. There were personality tests and phone calls.
 ''It's a lot of effort, and it's really no different from the people you meet in the offline world,'' she said. ''I'm becoming disenchanted. I've got people contacting me from North Carolina and New Mexico, and that's not going to work.''
 ''The argument is that technology is supposed to make your life easier, but that's not necessarily the case,'' she added.
 Rosie Koul is an information technology specialist for the automobile industry who lives in a suburb of Detroit. Now 34, she divorced three years ago and immediately turned to online options like Kiss.com, as many of her single friends had done.
 An expert in marketing data, Ms. Koul kept meticulous records of her online activities. Last year, in one nine-week period, her profile was browsed 4,212 times, mostly during the first four weeks after it was posted. At one point, she said she did fall in love with a man online, or at least his profile. In print, he was clever and engaging. She laughed out loud as his witty e-mail. Finally, they agreed to speak on the phone.
 Nothing.
 ''I don't know what happened in the exchange, but he was boring,'' she said glumly. ''I even went back to the e-mails to make sure I was talking to the right guy.''
 ''Having been a marketer, there's a point of diminishing returns,'' Ms. Koul added. ''Do I want to spend all these hours at my PC or out having fun and meeting people?''
 Lately, she has turned to a service based in nearby Royal Oak, Mich., called Table for Eight, which organizes intimate dinners of four women and four men, about 70 percent of whom have had their flings with online services, said Regina Stocco, the company's president.
 While most women interviewed complained that too many men just ''window shop'' online and are unwilling to consider any but the prettiest faces, Zev Guttman, 28, a mortgage banker in Monsey, N.Y., said it was men who are at a disadvantage online: it is still typically the man who has to make the first move, and it is still the woman who gets to pick and choose.
 As a result, he said, he either had to lie -- about, say, the fact that he is divorced -- or face an empty mailbox every day. ''If I write that I'm divorced, I don't have a chance of hooking up,'' he said. ''If I write that I'm single, they're not interested because they think I lied to them'' once they discover the truth.
 ''I'm just going to go back to matchmaking, or friends,'' he said.
 For every Zev Guttman who lets his screen go dark, another lovelorn hopeful will undoubtedly rise in his place. Bill Tancer, a researcher at the Redwood City, Calif., office of Hitwise, said a lot of the industry's growth will come from groups arriving late to the online singles scene, like the elderly. 
 And technology being technology, online dating continues to morph. Stuck in line at the post office? You can now pass the time hunting for a life partner, or at least a quick hookup, on your cellphone, using Match .com's mobile service. The True online service screens for both felons and cads through a partnership with Rapsheets, which reviews public records to verify that people claiming to be single in their profiles actually are. Yahoo Personals offers the opportunity to include a 30-second video clip in profiles as an opening line.
 Hey, it's almost like meeting someone.
 In a sense, the fate of online dating is probably a bit like that of singles bars. There are still singles, and there are still singles in bars. But the ''singles bar'' that caused such a frisson became a relic of the ''Looking for Mr. Goodbar'' 1970's. It became ordinary.
 That is probably one reason that online dating seems to have lost its buzz among its own Generation 1.0. ''In the last five years, it's become so mainstream,'' said Sherrie Schneider, an author of ''The Rules for Online Dating'' (Pocket Books, 2002), who remains a great champion of the practice. ''It's your boss. It's your co-worker. Every single woman in my neighborhood is on Match.com. It's like brushing your teeth.''
 And sometimes it's just as exciting.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Are at Odds, Again, This Time Over Iran

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 

 BODY:
Despite a renewed American effort to repair relations with Europe, a disagreement between the Bush administration and European leaders over how best to persuade Iran to abandon its suspected nuclear weapons program has deepened in recent weeks, diplomats on both sides say.
 The diplomats said the disagreement focused on what Europeans maintained was the crucial next step in their drive to persuade Iran to move beyond its recently agreed voluntary suspension of uranium enrichment activities to the point of abandoning them outright.
 Envoys from Britain, France and Germany gained Iran's agreement to suspend a vital part of its nuclear program last month. The accord was later endorsed by the 35-nation board of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring agency. 
 Both the European and Iranian officials who negotiated the accord said it was voluntary and temporary. Permanent cessation is subject to further talks on economic and political benefits for Iran.
 But in recent interviews, European diplomats said that to gain a permanent cessation, the Bush administration must participate in talks with Iran and signal a willingness to be a part of an eventual final accord involving economic incentives and a discussion of security guarantees for Iran.
 ''We have a deal with Iran that is not perfect,'' said a European diplomat. ''We have to develop it into a permanent suspension. But we will succeed only if we can provide a lot of carrots. We will not obtain a comprehensive deal on Iran without the United States.''
 A diplomat from a different European country said the ''biggest carrot'' that could be offered Iran would be a discussion about an eventual normalization of relations with the United States, including possible guarantees that Iran would not be attacked or subverted. 
 ''It would be very helpful if the United States also embraced this view,'' the diplomat said of the need for American involvement. But he said that when some Europeans recently raised this issue with Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser and secretary of state designate, they failed to convince her.
 A senior American official said the administration was ''deeply worried'' about the entire European approach because it could lull the United States into a false sense of security.
 Any such deal, he said, could easily be subverted or circumvented, much as North Korea did after it agreed in 1994 to freeze its production of weapons-grade fuel at one reactor, only to renege on the accord and embark on what the United States charges is a plan to produce weapons-grade fuel at another, clandestine location.
 Another senior administration official said there was also no confidence in the administration in the ability of the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor Iran's compliance even with the accord hammered out by the Europeans. 
 The official said that the Europeans had agreed to excessive limits on the agency's ability to inspect Iran's facilities and that there was the added problem that Iran might pursue weapons programs at facilities that Western experts had been unable to locate or identify.
 European diplomats, responding to these criticisms, said that while their deal with Iran was flawed, it represented the best hope for reaching an accord that would be accepted by the rest of the world, particularly Russia and China, two powerful players with economic ties to Iran.
 To get American involvement in the next phase of negotiations, European envoys said they told Iran that if it failed to comply with its agreement, they would join with the United States in referring the Iranian issue to the United Nations Security Council for possible further actions, including economic punishments.
 To some American officials, the European attitude may be well intentioned but also naive and based on a fundamental misreading of Iran's intentions. What is needed, they contend, is a unified willingness to demand action and to threaten sanctions against Iran.
 Bush administration officials add that while bombing Iranian nuclear sites or taking other sorts of military action are not being contemplated now, they are not ruled out for the future, despite the formidable logistical and political difficulties that would arise. 
 The European-American differences on the issue show few signs of being resolved soon, despite a trip this week by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to three European-American meetings and a planned trip to Europe by President Bush after his inauguration in January.
 ''The Europeans are barking up the wrong tree if they think the U.S. can bring the Iranians to the table to get an agreement on this,'' said Patrick Clawson, deputy director of the Washington Institute for Near Eastern Policy and an Iran specialist.
 ''What is needed,'' he added, ''is for the entire international community -- the Europeans, the Chinese, the Russians and the United States -- to tell the Iranians to make a deal on this or face the consequences. Right now, what the Iranians say they want from the United States goes far beyond what the administration would be willing to offer.''
 The Europeans have begun discussion of an array of economic benefits that would accrue to Iran if it headed toward a full cessation of its suspicious nuclear activities. 
 Among them, according to the Europeans, would be a reaffirmation of Iran's right to have a peaceful nuclear energy program, including access to nuclear fuel on international markets in return for an agreement to return the fuel once it is used; Iranian access to Western high technology, and discussing the establishment of the Middle East, presumably including Israel, as a zone free of all nuclear weapons. 
 American officials say, however, they are suspicious of any partial deals that do not encompass an end to Iran's support of insurgents in Iraq and to groups that carry out attacks on Israeli citizens, including Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and militant factions within the Palestine Liberation Organization.
 But European diplomats say they are prepared to enter into a discussion of these matters, and also of Iran's repressive practices at home, in what they are describing as ''phase two'' of their talks with Iran.
 ''Of course, the earlier the United States gets into the talks, the better,'' said a senior European diplomat, adding that the main incentive to Iran is to end the Western threat of economic and political isolation. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 25, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 12 about a disagreement between the Bush administration and European leaders over the way to deal with Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program misstated the name of a Washington policy institute whose deputy director, Patrick Clawson, commented that the entire international community needs to put pressure on Iran. It is the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, not Near Eastern.

HEADLINE: Iraq, Ballots and Pistachios

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: DOHA, QATAR 

 BODY:
On the flight over to the Persian Gulf, I was reading an article in The Financial Times about NATO fighting with itself over whether to send a few dozen more trainers to Baghdad to help the Iraqi Army. I couldn't help but wonder to myself: Let's see, there are now 26 countries in NATO. If each NATO country contributed just 100 soldiers, roughly speaking we could have five NATO soldiers guarding every polling station in Iraq for the January election. That would be a huge help. After all, what does NATO stand for today if not for helping to protect a free and fair election in Iraq that is being opposed by a virulent minority whose only motto is: ''You vote, you die -- elections must fail.'' Is it so much to ask that each NATO country contribute 100 soldiers for a long weekend to advance the prospect of Iraqi elections? Heck, I'll throw in the air fare myself. I have so many frequent-flier miles, I could even fly over a few hundred soldiers from European Union countries that aren't in NATO. 
 Wait a minute, did I say European Union? Do you know how many trees have been cut down to publish studies about the European Defense Initiative -- the E.U.'s quest to build a military force independent of NATO and America? Whole forests have been devoted to studies of E.D.I. So I was thinking: What does E.D.I. stand for today, if not for sending 500 E.U. soldiers to Iraq for a long weekend so that Iraqis might begin to create the first real bottom-up democracy in the Arab League?
 Wait a minute, did I say Arab League? The Arab League has been sniping at the U.S. from the minute it toppled Saddam's tyranny, constantly barking that the Iraqi government there was not representative. Well now we're trying to help elect one that would be the most representative in the Arab world, and what is the Arab League doing? Virtually nothing. Why couldn't it offer to send some Arab and Muslim soldiers to protect polling places in the Sunni towns of Iraq? 
 If only we could call the Iraqi election, ''A Seminar on the European Defense Initiative: Why NATO Is passe and E.D.I. Is the Future''; then we could get thousands of Europeans to take part. If only we could call the Iraqi elections, ''A Seminar on George Bush and Genghis Khan: Why Bush Is Worse''; then the Arab League would send so many people, we'd be turning them away. We'd be talking pay-per-view on Al Jazeera.
 Hey, look, I have no idea what sort of government the Iraqis might elect. I believe it's their first step in a thousand-mile journey to make that country something halfway decent and normal. But I do know this: There are a lot of Iraqis who would really like the chance to vote on their future, just once, and there is a virulent minority that is butchering people there just so they can never have that chance. Yes, the Bush team's incompetence in securing Iraq is a travesty. But even with all that said, is it such a hard call for Arabs and Europeans to figure out on whose side they should be? Do these people really feel good about not lifting a finger?
 ''We in Iraq have a lot of disappointment with many of our neighbors,'' Ghazi al-Yawar, Iraq's interim president, told me the other day while he was visiting Washington. President Yawar described Iraq's neighbors as sitting on a fence ''dangling their legs and munching on pistachios,'' while ''the forces of darkness'' try to rip Iraq to shreds. ''We do not understand why a vicious suicide bomber who claims the lives of innocent civilians is a terrorist in one country and in Iraq he becomes a freedom fighter,'' added Yawar, a bright and decent man. 
 The situation in Iraq is a microcosm of what is going on in the whole Middle East today. Everywhere you turn, the debate is over but the fight is not -- because determined minorities are determined to thwart the will of majorities, and the majorities are too weak or divided to push back. The vast majority of Israelis want to get out of Gaza, but a determined, potentially violent, fanatical Jewish minority has been holding them back. Among the Palestinians, the debate is over, but the fight is not. Most Palestinians clearly want an end to the conflict with Israel and a chance to live a normal life, but a determined minority from Hamas has been resisting. Most NATO countries (I hope) would prefer a decent outcome in Iraq, but a determined minority, more worried about an American success than an Iraqi failure, is holding NATO back.
 So let the record show that when Iraq finally decided to hold a free and fair election, all the bad guys decided to come and ''vote'' and all the good guys sat on the fence, dangling their legs, eating pistachios.

Why Go Now
 Strolling through the streets of Palermo Viejo, the trendiest neighborhood in Buenos Aires right now, one wouldn't guess that the city is emerging from an economic crisis. The jacaranda trees are in bloom, and well-dressed portenos (the nickname for residents of the city) pour out of new restaurants, where they can be seen smoking, drinking and laughing.
 At some of the city's hottest restaurants, it is impossible to get a reservation, even a few days in advance, and in response to the influx of foreign visitors, new hotels are opening all over town. 
 While other parts of the world are becoming increasingly expensive, because of the fall of the dollar, Americans visiting Argentina can still capitalize on a very favorable 3-to-1 peso-dollar exchange rate, which Argentina's central bank seems to be committed to maintaining. Before the brutal currency devaluation in 2001, from which the country is still reeling, the Argentine peso was linked to the dollar at a one-to-one ratio. 

Where to Stay
 The Recoleta neighborhood remains a popular destination for travelers because it is quiet, safe and central. A good option there is the 1ArtHotel, 1268 Azcuenaga; (54 11) 4821-4744; www.arthotel.com.ar, which opened in March 2004. A couple of blocks away from the heart of Recoleta's shopping district, the boutique hotel is decorated with wrought-iron doors, a spiral staircase and huge arched windows. The bright, airy lobby doubles as an art gallery (hence the name) where young Argentine artists show their work. For the first week of each month, there is a party to celebrate the work of a new artist. Rooms start at $65 a night at $3 to the Argentine peso and include breakfast. 
 In the increasingly popular Puerto Madero neighborhood, with its seductive waterfront views, well-heeled tourists have begun flocking to the 2 Faena Hotel + Universe, 445 Martha Salotti; (54 11) 4010-9000 or www.faenahotelanduniverse.com. The interior -- all black marble, red velvet and glass, festooned with white plaster unicorn heads -- looks like what might happen if David Lynch and Ian Schrager had a lovechild. It is quite striking, if a bit cold and peculiar.
 The brainchild of the Argentine businessman Alan Faena and the French hotel designer Philippe Starck, the Faena cost $100 million to build, and opened in October. (Rates range from $300 a night to $1,200 for the 900-square-foot Porteno suite.) But part of the hotel is still under construction, and amenities like the Turkish bath and the spa service will not be ready until January. Indeed, only 40 percent of the rooms are in service now. 

Where to Eat
 If nothing else, this is an Atkins-friendly country: per-capita beef consumption is the highest in the world. At a traditional parrilla (steak house), you can get a delicious cut of beef for about $3. Empanada shops abound, where little meat-filled snacks cost less than a dollar. Meanwhile, new fusion restaurants have been popping up in Palermo Viejo, featuring the work of adventurous chefs.
 After you've checked out the 3Casa Rosada (a k a the Pink House, the Argentine equivalent of the White House), in the center of town, you might feel a bit nostalgic for Argentina's Belle Epoque. Go to Argentina's oldest bar, 4Cafe Tortoni, Avenida de Mayo 825; (54 11) 4342-4328, and sit amid bronze busts of Jorge Luis Borges and paintings of Evita Peron. Grab a beer and a lomito (steak sandwich) for under $10.
 One recent addition to the Palermo Viejo dining scene is 5 Olsen, 5870 Gorriti; (54 11) 4776-7677, where the executive chef, German Martitegui, creates his signature Scandinavian-Argentine fusion cuisine in a blond-wood palace of modern design. Start with a caviar appetizer paired with samplings of various vodkas and aquavits.
 For dessert, try the molten chocolate cake filled with a hot dulce de leche core, and swimming in a white chocolate yogurt sauce. And if you ever doubted that Argentines eat dinner late, note that Sunday brunch at Olsen is served until 8:30 p.m. 

What to Do During the Day
 When you arrive in Buenos Aires, it will probably be before noon, after a long, and -- if you are in coach -- uncomfortable flight. The best way to dive headfirst into vacation bliss is to visit a day spa. At the 6 Aqua Vita Medical Spa, 1965 Arenales; (54 11) 4812-5989, in Recoleta, you can get the Aqua Luna treatment, which includes an hour massage, followed by a body-exfoliation treatment for the equivalent of $60. Two and a half hours later, you'll walk out feeling like a piece of tenderized meat. 
 The newest museum in town is 7 Malba, short for Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires, 3415 Avenida Figueroa Alcorta; (54 11) 4808-6500. Opened in 2001, the museum's permanent collection features 20th-century works from 78 Latin American artists, among them the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo and the Chilean surrealist Roberto Matta. 

What to Do at Night
 For a big, festive night of tango, try 8 El Querandi, 312 Peru; (54 11) 4345-0331, in San Telmo. The elaborate nightly show, featuring dramatic dancing and some of the best Argentine crooners you'll ever hear, includes a traditional three-course dinner (salad, beef and dulce de leche flan), and costs around $45 a person. For a more intimate setting, and a smaller check, try 9La Bodeguita del Tango at the Moliere theater, also in San Telmo, 678 Balcarce; (54 11) 4343-0777). 
 As for clubbing, 10 Opera Bay (225 Cecilia Grierson; (54 11) 4315-8666, is the place to sweat Saturday nights away. The huge Puerto Madero dance hall, built to resemble the Sydney Opera House, has a cover charge of $15. The hall is also host to an ''after office'' party on Wednesdays, starting at 11. 
 If you find yourself wandering the streets of Palermo Viejo at night, try an inventive cocktail or two at the low-key watering hole 11Mundo Bizarro, 4802 Guatemala; (54 11) 4773-1967. A place to find out about the biggest parties is www.whatsupbuenosaires.com, a site started by an American expatriate banker-turned-D.J. 

Where to Shop
 Every weekend there's a colorful hippie-ish crafts fair, 12 Feria de Arte, in Palermo Viejo's Plaza Julio Cortazar (Serrano y Honduras), where more than 40 vendors will sell paintings, clothing, handmade jewelry and home furnishings.
 The whole neighborhood is peppered with little boutiques selling the wares of new Argentine designers, where tourists can get fashionable clothing at reasonable prices any day of the week. 13 Mercer, 1686 Gurruchaga; (54 11) 4833-4587, sells trendy casual clothing for men; try on the jeans. Across the street, there's 14 Fortunata Alegria, 1739 Gurruchaga; (54 11) 4831-8197, where you can find delicate women's dresses and cute tops. 

On First Visit or Your 10th
 Take an evening walk along the water in Puerto Madero. After 100 years of disrepair, the city began a revitalization campaign for the old port in 1989, and today just about everything along the waterfront is new. 
 Head over to the promenade along the waterfront. The historic brick buildings that line the canal now house some of the finest restaurants in Buenos Aires, most of which have tables outside facing the canal, which gives a perfect opportunity to enjoy a crisp glass of Mendoza wine.
 Cross the canal by the new modern footbridge -- the Puente de la Mujer, 15or Bridge of the Woman -- designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. (The asymmetric design was intended to evoke the image of a couple doing a tango.) On the other side, you can see the lights of the city sparkling in the distance. 

How to Get There
 International flights land at Ezeiza International Airport (officially Aeropuerto Internacional Ministro Pistarini de Ezeiza), approximately 20 miles southwest of the city. From there, a taxi will cost about $25. From New York, airline prices to Buenos Aires vary, but in high season typically run in the $1,000 range for a 21-day advance-purchase coach seat on American Airlines, which flies direct from Kennedy Airport in New York. The flight is 10 hours 43 minutes. 

How to Get Around
 Cabs in Buenos Aires are abundant and cheap. Rarely will a ride through town in a yellow-and-black radio taxi cost more than $3. The more adventurous traveler may choose to use the Subte subway system, which is the oldest in South America. Trains run from about 5 a.m. to about 10:45 p.m., and rides cost less than a quarter. Maps can be found at www.subte.com.ar.

HEADLINE: With Few Luxuries, an Artist Sticks to It

BYLINE: By Colin Moynihan. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
JIM POWER was standing on St. Marks Place in front of the Great Hall at Cooper Union recently, putting the final touches on one of his dozens of pieces of public art that New Yorkers walk past daily. Mr. Power is a mosaic artist and, during the last 16 years, he has traveled a well-worn course through Lower Manhattan, using bits of glass, tile and ceramic to form intricate designs on lampposts that are meant to commemorate historic events and recognize the working people of the city. 
 Over the years, the poles have achieved a measure of popular appreciation. Four years ago, Eric Miller, a Ph.D. candidate in the folklore and folklife program at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote a 47-page paper about Mr. Power's mosaics. On Nov. 18, Mr. Power was at the Museum of the City of New York, where City Lore, a group that documents the cultural heritage of the city, presented him with an award. 
 The citation for the award referred to Mr. Power as ''New York's Mosaic Man,'' adding that he has been ''beautifying the city with distinctive, artful mosaics for almost 20 years.''
 ''This is a refurbished pole,'' Mr. Power said as he scrutinized his work on St. Marks Place. He explained that the elements take their toll on the mosaics and that they are in need of regular upkeep.
 Lately, the elements have been taking their toll on Mr. Power, too. After spending years in the East Village, bouncing from couch to couch or basement to basement -- often paying little or no rent -- Mr. Power, 57, has been on the streets for the last three months. He sleeps on park benches and in church alcoves. With him at all times are two suitcases of clothes and possessions and his 4-year-old Weimaraner, Labrador and pit bull mix, Jesse Jane.
 As Mr. Power fit small pieces into his artwork, a younger mosaic artist, Cara Jolly, paused to watch. Ms. Jolly, 26, who lives in the neighborhood and works at New York University, asked Mr. Power for a few pointers, and he happily obliged, embarking on a 20-minute soliloquy in which he rated the merits of various adhesives, showed how to fit pieces of tile into narrow spaces, and described the pole he was working on. In restoring that mosaic, Mr. Power also decided to expand it, extending the glittering design from the base of the pole to about eight feet up from the sidewalk. Mr. Power arranged tiles to spell out the names of people who had appeared at the Great Hall, and organizations that have a tie to the building.
 There was Mark Twain's name spelled out near that of Buffalo Bill's. The N.A.A.C.P. was included along with the Red Cross. Bill Clinton, one of the more recent visitors, made it onto the pole. 
 Also emblazoned on the pole was Mr. Power's Web site, eastvillage.com, which he started a few years ago with the help of friends and where he posts neighborhood photographs and updates on his activities.
 Other lamppost mosaics made by Mr. Power have similar historic and local themes. One, on Broadway at St. Marks Place, is a tribute to the New York Fire Department. Across Broadway, another one commemorates the blackout of 2003. Originally, Mr. Power envisioned 80 mosaics. So far, he has created 67.
 Mr. Power has traveled a peripatetic path. He was born in Waterford, in the south of Ireland, and moved to New York City with his family 13 years later. From 1968 until 1970 he was in the United States Army Signal Corps and repaired radio generators between Saigon and the Cambodian border. The first mosaics he saw, he said, were in Buddhist temples in Vietnam. After his discharge he was a blues and jazz guitarist, a stonemason, and a Consolidated Edison worker. But since 1988, the light pole project has been his calling and his burden. 
 ''I decided I wanted to make the city beautiful,'' Mr. Power said. ''I wanted to create a big square that tells everybody the East Village is an art colony.''
 Mr. Power used to earn good money as a stonemason, he said, sometimes as much as $2,700 a week in the early 1980's. But a succession of injuries and his determination to create mosaics, for which he receives no financing, have changed that. These days he survives with the help of friends. For years, sympathetic building superintendents let Mr. Power set up house in East Village boiler rooms, where he kept warm in the winter and helped with light maintenance. But the raffish neighborhood Mr. Power called home in the late 1980's no longer exists.
 Still, Mr. Power insists, he is resourceful and doesn't need luxuries to be happy.
 ''All I really want is for my mosaics to be appreciated, and to have the time and material to finish them,'' he said. ''That and a simple place to live for me and the dog.''
 Last month, at the Museum of the City of New York, part of his wish was granted. The other part remains unfulfilled.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Heavenly Sleep Can Be Sky High

BYLINE: By LISA KALIS

 BODY:
AT the new Setai Hotel in South Beach, Miami, each standard room will occupy 600 square feet and feature a plasma TV, Bose surround-sound DVD player, Lavazza espresso machine and Acqua di Parma toiletries. And when it opens the first of its rooms on Dec. 22, the Setai -- one of about a dozen upscale properties managed by General Hotel Management, including the well-regarded Datai in Langkawi, Malaysia -- will be the only American hotel with Dux beds. The starting rate: $900 a night. 
 In Las Vegas, the MGM Grand is opening a separate property called SkyLofts on Dec. 23. On the top two floors of its building, these 51 duplex suites range from 1,400 to 6,000 square feet. Each features a high-end entertainment system (not including the TV screen behind the bathroom mirror) and an infinity-edge tub. After the complimentary limo transfer, a butler will unpack guests' luggage and iron any clothes that have become wrinkled in transit. The rate: $800 to $10,000 a night. 
 Other recent additions to the luxury hotel front include the Singita Sweni Lodge in South Africa's Kruger National Park ($2,300 a night for one of the lodge's six suites) and Evason Hideaway at Ana Mandara, in Nha Trang, Vietnam, where each of the 54 suites has a well-stocked private wine cellar ($550 to $1,250 a night). 
 And the all-inclusive Cal-a-Vie Spa in Vista, Calif., about 40 miles north of San Diego, where guests stay in private villas with French antiques, has raised its rates for 2005 to $998 a day (up from $918 in 2004) -- a result of a continuing $10 million renovation that has included the building of a new fitness center and the reconstruction of a 450-year-old chapel that was shipped in, crate by crate, from Lyon, France, this year.
 Once thought an almost impossible extravagance for the most wealthy of travelers, the four-figure hotel room is suddenly popping up everywhere. Even the big hotel chains are getting in on the act. 
 Wyndham Hotel and Resorts is adding 67 villas to its Las Casitas Village resort in Puerto Rico, with private check-in and butler service. Of those villas, 25 are three-bedroom suites, going for about $1,000 a night, most being marketed to families. 
 ''It's an easy sell,'' said a company spokeswoman, Kathy Casper. ''Ten to 15 years ago, it was not.''
 Indeed, these high-end hotel rooms are finding plenty of takers.
 ''When you have a certain amount of money, and you've seen it all, you're looking for recognition,'' said Manvinder Puri, general manager of the Setai, which is on high-profile Collins Avenue, just up the block from the Delano, the Shore Club and the Ritz-Carlton South Beach. ''There is a huge demand for better service.'' 
 Mr. Puri said he had no concerns about charging room rates that are almost double that of his South Beach competitors, saying the difference in room size -- a standard room at the Shore Club is about 300 square feet; at the Ritz-Carlton about 375 -- justifies the higher price. 
 ''It's a market-driven phenomenon,'' said Mike Enberg, managing director of Virtuoso, a consortium of luxury travel agents. ''Affluent travelers are more willing to spend their money for experiences that fit their needs, and less willing to compromise.'' 
 Indeed, Bjorn Hanson, head of the Hospitality and Leisure Practice at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, said he expected 2004 to finish with a 10 percent increase in revenue per available room for luxury chain hotels -- the highest growth in 20 years.
 The demand for high-priced hotel rooms comes at the same time as a gradual decline in the price of first-class air fares -- a response by airlines to the reduced demand for their most expensive seats. ''Customers do not have the same emotional reaction to transport as they do to accommodations,'' Mr. Enberg said. In an American Express survey of affluent consumers (with incomes of $100,000 or more) released in July, respondents spent an average $12,650 on personal travel -- and 65 percent said they often or always flew economy.
 Executives at the Small Luxury Hotels of the World group, whose properties include the Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur, Calif., and Hotel de Vendome in Paris, say that their guests increasingly bypassed the standard rooms and booked more suites and other high-category rooms during the first three-quarters of this year, accounting for a 6 percent increase in the chain's revenues over the same period last year. And there are no signs that this trend will abate soon. 
 ''The bar keeps getting raised,'' said Lanny Grossman, director of public relations and marketing for Small Luxury Hotels. ''Hoteliers have to go out of their way to offer something different.'' 
 Mr. Hanson, of PriceWaterhouseCoopers, agrees. ''Hotels are competing to see who can come up with the most outrageous service, to really offer something special,'' he said. ''Things that were thought to be deluxe a few years ago'' -- like high-thread-count sheets, broadband Internet access and designer bottled water -- ''aren't considered deluxe anymore.'' 
 The MGM Grand planned the SkyLofts hotel after testing the market with another property, the Mansion, next door to the main hotel. The Mansion is apparently the most expensive hotel in the country, with rates of $5,000 to $15,000 a night. The 29 Mediterranean-style villas are 2,400 to 9,000 square feet, with indoor pools, private gardens and exercise rooms. Paintings by Picasso and Matisse line the walls, and meals of Chinese and intercontinental fare (not included in the rate) are available around the clock. 
 The Mansion mostly attracted international visitors when it opened in 1999, according to the MGM Grand's president, Gamal Aziz. But Americans now make up over half of the guests. In Las Vegas, he said, ''the demand for a luxury product has completely outstripped the supply.''
 Many of the four-figure hotels are in out-of-the-way locations. ''If you want to spend $1,000, you want perfect attention, perfect service and perfect privacy,'' said Marc Wilhelm, an assistant general manager of Wheatleigh, in Lenox, Mass. 
 The 19 rooms there start at $725 on weekends but most will exceed $980 in 2005 -- including $1,650 for the Aviary, which incorporates a century-old Norway spruce into the two-floor suite. 
 Some of these hotels try to soften sticker shock by throwing in a number of ''free'' extras. As Mr. Grossman, of Small Luxury Hotels of the World, said ''Even the richest of the rich want to get a deal.''
 For example, at Twin Farms in Barnard, Vt., the room rates -- $1,050 to $2,070 per night -- include three meals, afternoon tea, beverages, wine from the 30,000-bottle cellar and outdoor activities, including downhill skiing at the inn's private, six-run, 500-vertical-foot slopes. There's no check-in, since payment is handled before arrival (an escort meets guests in the courtyard), and no menus, so guests must fill out a survey on their food preferences before arrival. 
 (Having no menu doesn't seem to limit the dining options: a dish recently featured on the inn's Web site was described as ''Long Island foie gras served on a pressed salad of mesclun greens encased in a dried apple ring, garnished with steamed garden leeks and a balsamic drizzle.'') 
 Anne Black Cone, the hotel's marketing assistant, said that guests, perhaps those without a country estate to call their own, like the feel of being in a place that seems to cater to every whim.
 ''They want to come here and use it as a second home,'' she said. ''It's perceived as value for the money.'' 
 Meals (including a black-tie dinner every Wednesday and Saturday night) and activities are also included at the Point, in Saranac Lake, N.Y., where rates start at $1,250. And the Golden Door spa in Escondido, Calif., has a four-to-one ratio of staff to guests. The weeklong, all-inclusive package costs $928 a night. 
 Weekend rates start at $625 at the Lodge on Little St. Simons Island in Georgia, but, the hotel says, the two most popular rooms are the most expensive, at $1,150 and $1,200. The island can hold up to 30 guests, and family style-meals plus nature-focused activities, like bird-watching and natural history tours, are included. 
 At Little Palm Island in the Florida Keys, $1,445 -- the starting rate in 2005 for high season -- doesn't buy a phone, television or alarm clock: there aren't any in the 28 thatched-roof bungalows or two grand suites. Nor does it include meals (dinner for two can easily exceed $100). It does cover water activities like sailing and fishing. 
 Guests are ''definitely thinking about value, service and quality,'' said Little Palm's director of sales, Susan Howarth. ''Most of all, they're looking for something unique.'' 
 In November, though, the Mobil Travel Guide dropped the resort's rating to three stars from four. Shane O'Flaherty, the guide's vice president for quality assurance, said he could not comment on individual properties, but added that the difference between three and four stars is ''the human elements of service.'' (Mobil also gives three stars to the Doubletree Grand Key Resort in Key West, where rooms cost $259 a night, and sometimes less.) 
 "Obviously, it's very disappointing," said Ms. Howarth of Little Palm of Mobil's decision. She said in other rankings, ''we still seem to be at the top.''
 Is higher and higher where the hotel industry is headed? Mr. Wilhelm, of Wheatleigh, isn't so sure, predicting more options on both sides of the scale in the future. 
 ''The market will spread out more and more,'' he said. ''We'll see more cheap places in the budget range, but also more exclusive places.'' 


CORRECTION-DATE: January 16, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 12 about hotels that charge $1,000 a night or more referred incorrectly to a 6 percent increase for the Small Luxury Hotels of the World. The figure referred to the hotels' average daily room rate over the first three quarters of 2004 compared with the same period last year, not to their revenues over that period. 
An article on Dec. 12 about hotels that charge $1,000 a night or more referred incorrectly to the use of Dux mattresses by American hotels. Though the Setai in Miami Beach is the only large hotel in the United States that uses them, the manufacturer says some smaller establishments -- mainly bed-and-breakfasts -- also do. 
An article on Dec. 12 about hotels that charge $1,000 a night or more misstated the top rate at Twin Farms in Barnard, Vt. An e-mail message on Jan. 3 from the hotel pointed out that it was $2,700, not $2,070.

 Last summer, she felt it was time to really settle down. She wanted a place for the long haul -- one with plenty of space, a countrified setting and an easy commute to Midtown, where she works in commercial real estate. 
 Ms. O'Shea, 45, planned to buy a town house for $500,000 to $600,000, depending on condition. But when she found that town houses in northern Bergen County, N.J., were as expensive as single-family houses, she started looking at those, too. That puzzled her friends and colleagues. Why would she, single and unattached, want a place big enough for a family of four?
 That wasn't her attitude. Why wouldn't I? she thought.
 Since college, Ms. O'Shea had lived in Manhattan, where she went from having roommates to renting on her own to buying a one-bedroom co-op. It was a lucky break that she bought in 1996, before prices escalated. 
 In 2001, growing weary of the city, she considered buying a weekend house, but decided against it. ''I would rather have one really nice place than two semi-nice places,'' she said. So she ''traded up to something I could never afford in Manhattan -- a two-bedroom condominium with an oversize bathroom, a designer kitchen and a terrace'' in Winston Towers, a high-rise building in Cliffside Park, N.J.
 ''At that point, I thought: 'I'm into my 40's. It can't be true that the city is the best place to meet a man,''' she said. She saw the move as an expansion of her social opportunities, where she would encounter ''familiar faces'' instead of endless strangers.
 Last spring she joined a golf club in Mahwah. ''I wasn't spending a lot of time in my neighborhood,'' she said. ''I was driving into the city or up to the golf club. I was thinking: 'Do I want to settle in this neighborhood or move when interest rates were so beneficial?''' At the club, she met Donna Orlando, an agent for Coldwell Banker in Saddle River. So she enlisted Ms. Orlando to sell her condominium and help her hunt for a new place in Bergen County.
 Ms. O'Shea loved the first place she visited -- a two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath town house in the Indian Field development in Mahwah. The previous owners had done a ''designer renovation and had great taste -- the same as mine,'' she said.
 But it was already in contract for $625,000. Ms. O'Shea checked with the seller's broker several times, hoping the deal would fall through. It didn't.
 ''I was crestfallen,'' she said. ''Every other town house was never going to measure up. That tainted the whole next six weeks.''
 The area had few town houses to begin with, Ms. Orlando said. Almost everything they saw was either dated or expensive. ''Maura was going to have to fix it or pay a premium to get something nice,'' Ms. Orlando said. ''The town houses cost more than single-family homes -- $700,000. You can buy a house for $700,000. It was very depressing.''
 Ms. O'Shea did find a few other possibilities. She returned a few times to see a two-bedroom on Carriage Court in Allendale, priced at $585,000. But ''it was almost smaller than the apartment I had,'' she said. ''You wouldn't trade for a smaller space.'' 
 An acquaintance suggested she consider houses. Even Ms. Orlando, the broker, was puzzled. ''I said: 'You are going to have to cut the grass and get somebody to snowplow. A house is a big project.' It did not seem to concern her.''
 Ever practical, Ms. O'Shea saw little difference in upkeep whether she lived in a town house or a house. Instead of paying ''a fixed monthly charge for maintenance to a managing agent, you still pay for maintenance, only it's individual contractors you pay on your own,'' she said.
 Over all, she found that the houses were in better, newer condition. ''The houses were really cute, not like a town house where there's little charm,'' she said. She rejected several because of location (on a busy thoroughfare) or size (too small). ''It surprised me that a house could have less living space than a two-bedroom apartment,'' she said.
 Then, doing Internet research, she encountered a picture of a Tudor house on Brookside Avenue in Allendale. ''It grabbed me,'' she said. ''When I pulled up, I didn't think the picture did it justice. It seemed like a cottage retreat.'' The woodsy yard even had a small brook, with two footbridges that reminded her of Monet's garden paintings.
 The sellers had retired and were moving to upstate New York, having raised their two children in the house. They were asking $575,000, but accepted her offer of $550,000, exactly what she had received for her Cliffside Park condo. ''She had been through this before,'' Ms. Orlando said. ''She was not timid.''
 In mid-October, Ms. O'Shea moved in to her two-bedroom, two-bath house, which she is now renovating. ''I will use every single inch of space,'' she said. ''Single people are so spoiled.''
 Although she is sleeping on an air mattress amid the construction, ''I feel totally at home,'' she said. ''It's a learning experience and not as daunting as I thought it might be. I have lots of trees, and every leaf fell onto the lawn -- the yard was covered. Also, branches just fall off trees. I am told the trees themselves fall down sometimes, but so far, no. I hired a guy to do fall cleanup.'' 
 She's amused that her single status confounds people.
 ''I find it hilarious that everyone calls me Mrs. O'Shea and asks how many kids I have,'' she said. ''The locksmith asked, 'Are you sure you don't want to call your husband first and check before you commit to this pricing?' I said, 'No, I can make this decision myself.'''

HEADLINE: Sidelined by U.S. and Asia, Singing the Euro Blues

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
AS they bemoan the record rise of the euro currency against the dollar this year, Europeans have taken to quoting a former Texas governor. But it's not the one who is most directly responsible for the dollar's recent toboggan ride -- the one who just extended his lease on the White House.
 It is John B. Connally, who served as Treasury Secretary under Richard Nixon in the early-1970's and is remembered for telling a worried world, ''The dollar is our currency, but your problem.''
 The remark, with its swaggering tone and unilateral connotations, resonates with Europeans, whose mood these days is uncertain, angst-ridden and more than a little sullen about how their currency -- and by implication, their economic future -- seems to be a hostage to the actions of the United States. The almighty euro, far from a symbol of European prosperity, has become their latest cause for complaint. 
 Europe's discontent is of a piece with its general gloom about its prospects. Although Europeans enjoy some of the world's highest living standards, and produce some of its most coveted goods, they choose to dwell instead on their sluggish growth, declining birth rates, aging societies and eroding competitiveness, compared with the dynamism of the United States and Asia. 
 It is tempting to chalk the sour mood up to an innate European tendency toward world-weary pessimism. But experts say it reflects something more troubling, a deeper lack of consensus about the future of the European Union. Disagreements over a new constitution, growing doubts about admitting Turkey to the club, turmoil within the newly appointed European Commission -- all speak to a splintering of public opinion.
 ''This might be a function of Europe's peculiar political culture,'' said Niall Ferguson, a professor at Harvard specializing in financial history. ''They find it difficult to take concerted action on an international level, whether it is Iraq or the dollar.''
 Europeans have a hard time even making up their minds about whether they want a robust currency. Four years ago, when the euro sank against the dollar, there was lots of anguished talk about its failings.
 Currency weakness is a problem for countries that depend on imports for essentials like oil, and have a lot of foreign debt to repay; many small and developing nations fit that description. But for developed countries, currency strength can be a bigger problem, making it harder for companies and workers to compete in the global marketplace. A euro scaling record highs against the dollar is nice for affluent French and German tourists bargain-shopping on Fifth Avenue. But back home, it will depress tourism, exports and economic growth, and drive up unemployment.
 With some of Europe's largest economies showing signs of relapsing, the trans-Atlantic finger-pointing has begun. The cynical view here is that the Bush administration is ready to let the dollar keep falling for two reasons: a determination to help American manufacturers, even if it means slamming America's trading partners; and an unwillingness to confront its own yawning trade and budget deficits.
 At a time when the United States and Europe are already circling each other like feuding spouses, some here predict that the White House's dollar policy will be the next spark for a family argument.
 Austria's finance minister, Karl-Heinz Grasser, says it is ''unacceptable that Europe should pay the bill for major imbalances in the world economy, especially the current-account deficit and the budget deficit in the United States.''
 It takes two to create an imbalance, of course, and the creditors in this case are the Asian exporters, who fill American shopping malls with goods, and convert their vast hoards of dollars into Treasury bills, financing Washington's deficits. ''The Europeans are sitting there as a passive third-party in a great financial transaction between the United States and China,'' Professor Ferguson said.
 Taken together, the 12 nations that share the euro currency import roughly as much as they export, which means they have ''neither added to the world economy nor subtracted from it,'' said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ''In that sense, Europe is an innocent bystander.''
 THERE is something illogical in the idea that the euro zone -- the world's largest trading bloc, with 450 million people producing more goods and services each year than the United States does -- would have to stew on the sidelines. In truth, Europe's powerlessness is for the most part an illusion.
 Europe has many tools that it could still use to curb the rise of the euro. As a quick fix, the European Central Bank could intervene in the foreign currency market the way the Bank of Japan does to keep a lid on the yen. Or it could lower interest rates, which might have the added benefit of getting somnolent consumers to spend more.
 Beyond that, European leaders could finally get serious about overhauling their economies, opening up labor markets and reforming health care and pension systems. That could restore momentum to countries like Germany, which will grow barely 1 percent this year. ''The Europeans could offer more, if they were more reform-minded,'' said Norbert Walter, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank.
 That leaves the European Central Bank, which has not budged on its key interest rate for the last 18 months. Such constancy, which once looked like discipline, now looks to some critics like a lack of nerve. Looser money could pump up domestic consumption and help right the global imbalances.
 ''Anybody who thinks this problem can be solved purely by the United States tightening its belt is fantasizing,'' Professor Ferguson said. ''A sluggish Europe is as big a problem as the U.S. deficit.''
 It's past time, he said, for Europeans to shake off defeatism and behave like people with a world-beating currency. If they rise to the challenge, they might even be rewarded with a healthy decline in the euro.

HEADLINE: Don't Revive the Death Penalty

BYLINE: By ANDREW CUOMO. 
Andrew Cuomo, who was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 1997 to 2001, ran for governor in 2002 .

 BODY:
CAPITAL punishment has been suspended in New York, following a state Court of Appeals ruling in June that the ''deadlock instructions'' in the death penalty law were unconstitutional.
 These instructions required a judge to tell the jury that if it failed to unanimously impose the death penalty, the defendant would be eligible for parole. The court reasoning that the fear of setting a criminal free might coerce a death penalty vote.
 Immediately after the court's decision, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, promised to cure the legal defect and quickly pass a new law. The governor put forward a bill in August. The Senate quickly followed suit. Fortunately, the Assembly leader, Sheldon Silver, announced that given the issue's profound importance, public hearings would be held. 
 The Democrats, who control the Assembly, should make it clear that they will not pass a new death penalty law. This will take courage, but it is vital that they do so: We cannot rely much longer on a progressive Court of Appeals to intercede and prevent executions, as has happened since 1995, when the death penalty was reinstituted in New York. (Mr. Pataki had vowed to reinstate the death penalty in his campaign against my father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.) As judges appointed by Governor Cuomo retire over the next few years, Governor Pataki will install more conservative court members. 
 More important, there remains no evidence that the death penalty is a deterrent to crime and plenty of evidence that it is invoked arbitrarily -- and often mistakenly. Last year, 267 inmates nationwide had their death sentences overturned or removed, according to the Justice Department. This is the largest number in any year since 1976, when the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of state death-penalty laws in a group of states. 
 Other developments since 1995 have also mirrored the growing doubts about capital punishment. In 2000, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican who had supported the death penalty, imposed a moratorium on all executions in his state, citing instances in which death-row inmates were found to be innocent. And a report issued in November by the Justice Department reveals that death sentences nationally are now at a 30-year low. 
 At the same time, cases in which DNA evidence has established the innocence of people convicted of capital crimes -- along with concerns about racial bias in death-penalty sentencing -- have further undercut support for capital punishment around the country. According to a 2004 Gallup Poll, about half of all Americans say that convicted murderers should get the death penalty. But just under half instead support a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Public opinion has been shifting toward this second option, according to the Gallup organization. The poll also showed that 62 percent of Americans believe that capital punishment does not act as a deterrent, compared with 51 percent in 1991. 
 Nor does capital punishment make sense financially. Many studies show that it is more expensive for taxpayers to pursue executions than to sentence criminals to life without parole. Indeed, New York State has spent at least $160 million pursuing the death penalty since 1995. 
 Unfortunately, the prevailing thinking in Albany is that opposition to the death penalty is ''political suicide.'' I disagree. While the public overall still favors the death penalty, public opinion in New York has been shifting. A poll conducted in 2003 by Quinnipiac University shows that a majority of New York Democrats oppose the death penalty and that a majority of all New Yorkers favor sentences of mandatory life without parole over execution. Such sentences did not exist in the state when the death penalty law was passed in 1995. 
 Leadership can change public opinion, and this shifting point of view may become even more pronounced if the Assembly Democrats wage an intense debate on the issue, informing people of the facts -- and of the shortcomings of the bills awaiting action in the Legislature. While other states are instituting safeguards against police and prosecutorial misconduct and ensuring protection for mentally ill defendants in capital cases, for example, these issues are not addressed in the governor's or Senate's proposals. 
 For the public, the debate can begin as early as this week. The first of a series of public hearings on the death penalty is to be held in New York City on Wednesday. 
 The Court of Appeals ruling that suspended the state's death penalty has given New Yorkers a window of opportunity, a moment to enact a real reform. It should not be lost.

HEADLINE: Even if Just a Bauble, Luxury Counts for Holidays

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON; Cathy Horyn, Ruth La Ferla and Rachel Horner contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
As the silver-lined elevator at Bergdorf Goodman lifted the woman with the carefully manicured hair to the couture level on Thursday afternoon, she spoke into her cellphone: ''I've finished shopping -- almost,'' she said, looking down at her bags. ''No, not a van. I think a Town Car will be quite big enough, thank you.''
 On East 57th Street, two young Englishwomen were bustling along the crowded sidewalk, carrying Burberry bags. Debbie Drake, 20, a personal assistant at a British Ford plant, said she had never defined herself as a luxury shopper -- until she came to New York. With the dollar weak against the British pound, the $200 for three Burberry T-shirts for her brother for Christmas, and $30 for a plaid hair ''bubble'' to go around her ponytail were exceptional bargains. ''It would have been triple in London,'' she said.
 The luxury market, which, only a few years ago, was struggling, has come back with a bang for the holidays. ''Right now, luxury is the only game in town,'' said Dana Telsey, a retail analyst with Bear, Stearns, who tracks the performance of high-end merchandise. 
 With the weaker dollar, tourists from Paris, London and Tokyo have descended upon the United States market for their holiday gift shopping, retail executives say. And even many Americans in the market for gifts with an elegant label seem unfazed at the higher prices they have to pay, merchants say. 
 Robert H. Frank, the author of ''Luxury Fever'' and an economics professor at Cornell University, talked about the cascade of influence from high-income luxury shoppers ''down to people like us.'' And this Christmas, Americans he surveyed about their choices, no matter what their incomes are, said they wanted to buy ''special'' gifts for Christmas. Luxury is no longer a matter of price if it is a $1,000 handbag or a $200 jar of face cream or a $50 dog collar with the right brand stamped on it. For some, it just must be the most expensive thing of its type -- witness the $30 hair scrunchie.
 This holiday season, shoppers and merchants say, it has become ever more apparent: the face -- and faces -- of luxury are changing in the United States. 
 As traditional department stores like Lord & Taylor and Macy's struggle to push sales slightly ahead of last year's holiday season, merchants like Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, along with brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Chanel, are prospering. A few months ago, it was a case of extremes: Wal-Mart on one end of the yardstick of success, Neiman on the other. 
 Since Thanksgiving, however, Wal-Mart's shoppers, stung by high gasoline prices, failed to buy as much as expected, and analysts started worrying about the future of the mass-marketers. Only Target, with its status tea kettles and cheap designer fashions, has lived up to expectations -- but only just.
 At Bergdorf's, meanwhile, sales climbed 15 percent for the three months ended in October, and executives said, are strong in the current quarter. Sales at Neiman Marcus were up 8.3 percent in November. Nordstrom's, a midpriced department store that has successfully managed to label itself a luxury emporium, has also done well. Six months ago, analysts were worrying about the luxury sector, but those fears seem to have subsided for now. ''Tell me where the stock market will be in a year,'' said one, ''and I'll tell you whether luxury is vulnerable.''
 Two years ago, even the wealthy were not in the mood to buy. Now, high-end designers say, customers queue for one-of-a-kind embroidered jeans for $400. Also standing in line are shoppers who, five years ago, might never have walked through Tiffany's stainless steel doors. 
 At its Manhattan flagship store on Fifth Avenue, Myron Miller, 60, a retired photographer, bought a Tiffany silver key chain with a frog on it as a holiday gift for his wife -- for $258. ''Not that the key rings from Tiffany's are any better,'' he said, bringing smiles to the luxury marketers' hearts, ''but a gift from Tiffany's just makes people feel good.''
 Jewelry items, especially $40,000 watches and bracelets with emeralds and sapphires, are soaring this holiday season, as are furs. Dennis Basso, a furrier based in New York, seemed surprised that, so far this season, a dozen customers have clamored to buy his Russian broadtail coats with beaded and feathered hems, for $55,000. And the weather has been warm.
 Gucci has bounced back as its operating profit rose $221 million from February through July 2004 over the same period in 2003.
 Barneys New York, which specializes in selling designer names like Armani and Balenciaga, has also turned around. And if anything, Barneys' buyers underestimated the demand for certain items. The other day, the Madison Avenue store was sold out of $225 cashmere-lined leather gloves -- except for size 7 1/2.
 Last Thursday, Allison Lester, an executive with Citigroup in Knoxville, Tenn., bought a pair of $165 sunglasses -- and a fur coat at Macy's. ''I'm rarely extravagant,'' she said, ''but the coats were on sale at a good time.''
 Around the holidays, some people come to New York just to shop for luxuries for presents and for themselves. While Manhattan has streets of high-end boutiques, ''we have Mall of America,'' grumbled Tracy Cronin, 29, a leasing agent from Minneapolis. She just bought a $415 plaid handbag. ''I view it as a treat for myself,'' she said.
 The demand for fripperies, from $165 sunglasses to $24,000 sable scarves, seems to surprise even their makers. Richard Lambertson, a partner in Lambertson Truex leather goods, spent three hours last Thursday chatting with customers in the Neiman Marcus in Boca Raton, Fla. From 1 to 4 in the afternoon, he sold 25 handbags, seven made of alligator, starting at $2,500.
 Vivian Van Natta, the vice president of Chado Ralph Rucci, a Seventh Avenue fashion house, said that trunk show clients in Palo Alto, Calif., were arriving ''in their yoga clothes, and they buy duchess satin infanta gowns'' for close to $30,000.
 In Chicago last week, Wright, a five-year-old auction house that specializes in 20th century decorative arts, held its first ''Branded Luxury'' sale, featuring Hermes handbags, gold cigarette boxes, E. Goyard steamer trunks and Vuitton valises, all made from 1900 to 1970. The auction, said the owner Richard Wright, brought in more than $500,000. 
 Estimates of the world's luxury market range from $90 billion to $200 billion, but retail analysts agree that the United States has about a 20 percent share. In America, the luxury market is growing 4 percent to 6 percent, according Marshal Cohen of the NPD Group, a researcher, who pegged the United States market at $42 billion, excluding food and cars.
 This rise comes at a time when the rest of the retail environment is stagnant, or in certain sectors, losing ground. ''The luxury business is rising faster than the general economy and faster than the apparel business,'' said Richard E. Jaffe, a retail analyst with Legg Mason.
 Luxury is growing, he and other analysts said, in part because the baby boomers are beginning to inherit money -- and boomers have demanding taste. ''It's the pervasiveness of the brands,'' he said. 
 Daniel LaLonde, the chief executive for watches and jewelry in North America for LVMH, the world's biggest luxury conglomerate, said business is booming in the United States. Still, Mr. LaLonde said luxury watches -- those that cost more than $500 -- make up only 10 percent of the total watches sold in America; in Europe, it is twice that percentage. At the same time, sales of Tag Heuer watches, one of the company's brands, is up 40 percent here.
 While the gray-haired woman in the elevator at Bergdorf's can be said to represent the traditional wealthy shopper, less-affluent, often younger shoppers, are on the prowl for brands like Coach, Burberry and Cole Hahn.
 Just five years ago, Coach, identified with the kind of heavy leather shoulder bags, and Burberry, with its trademark trench coats lined with plaid, were both moribund brands. But under the leadership of Lew Frankfort at Coach, and Rose Marie Bravo at Burberry, both brands have become what the marketers call ''accessible luxury.''
 Instead of the $3,000 paid for a Louis Vuitton handbag, or the $9,000 for a Hermes Birkin bag, shoppers are seeking a $368 Coach bag, or a $195 Pucci print hat.
 This concept, of accessible, or affordable luxury is driving the high-end market now, analysts say. 
 Tory Burch, a New York society figure, has just introduced her own line of clothes, which have been bought by Bergdorf's, Neiman's, Saks Fifth Avenue and other retailers, she said. But she did not choose to sell her collection at designer prices -- she chose a ''sweet spot'' from $175 to $600 for the bulk of her collections. ''My friends don't consider themselves luxury shoppers,'' she said this week, ''although they like a lot of luxury brands. They have a lot less loyalty to one designer. They like mixing price points and designers.''
 Sometimes, Mr. Frank said, merchants deliberately advertise something that is so expensive they don't sell any -- and don't plan to. One example may be the his-and-hers robots Neiman Marcus featured last Christmas, luxuries with price tags of $450,000 apiece. They didn't sell any -- but the robots got a lot of publicity, and shoppers then must have thought a $125 box of candy was a bargain.
 ''They did the same thing at Victoria's Secret,'' Mr. Frank said. ''One year they had Claudia Schiffer with a $1 million diamond-encrusted brassiere,'' he said. ''A guy might have said: 'Isn't that ridiculous!' But that made the holiday special, the $150 bra, seem prudent.''
 So this Christmas, shoppers who can't afford the $4,860 leather Pucci print suit, may fancy instead the $195 Pucci printed hat.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday about strong holiday sales in the luxury retail market misstated the location of a Neiman Marcus store in Florida, where a leather goods maker sold 25 handbags in three hours, at prices starting at $2,500. It is Fort Lauderdale, not Boca Raton.

HEADLINE: The Last Time You Used Algebra Was . . .

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
IN the 1986 movie, ''Peggy Sue Got Married,'' Kathleen Turner, an unhappily married wife and mother, magically returns to relive her senior year as the most popular girl at Buchanan High.
 She leaves a math test blank, and when her teacher (described in the screenplay as ''an officious little creep'') demands an explanation, answers: ''Mr. Snelgrove, I happen to know that in the future, I will never have the slightest use for algebra. And I speak from experience.'' 
 Audiences and critics loved the line, presumably because they too rejoiced in knowing that they had never, ever used the quadratic formula again. (Disclosure: I squeaked by in calculus while never really grasping it, and can no longer help my ninth-grade daughter solve equations with two variables. The toughest math I tackle now is calculating a tip in a moving taxi.)
 Last week, the United States proved, yet again, that its mathematical literacy is abysmal. In a survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, it ranked 28th out of 40 countries in mathematics, far below Finland and South Korea, and about on a par with Portugal. 
 The survey tested simple, ''everyday'' skills like estimating the size of Antarctica or footsteps in the sand. Nonetheless, as in past comparisons, American 15-year-olds did rather better than students in Mexico, Indonesia and South Africa, and substantially worse than those in rich countries, especially Asian ones. 
 These annual humiliations produce two consistent reactions.
 One set of experts grouses that the surveys are unfair: average American students are compared to distant elites; Americans play sports and hold jobs; foreign countries impose national standards while America believes in local school boards. 
 Another set gloomily predicts that math malaise will ultimately gut the economy, frequently citing an estimate that American businesses waste $30 billion a year on remedial training. (In 1990, the elder President Bush announced an expensive plan to have American students lead the world in math by the year 2000.)
 But there is also the Peggy Sue school of thought, which asks: So what?
 In all but the most arcane specialties (like teaching math), the need for math has atrophied. Electronic scales can price 4.15 pounds of chicken at $3.79 a pound faster than any butcher. Artillerymen in Iraq don't use slide rules as their counterparts on Iwo Jima did. Cars announce how many miles each gallon gets. Some restaurant bills calculate suggested tips of 15, 18 or 20 percent. Architects and accountants now have spreadsheets for everything from wind stress to foreign tax shelters. The new math is plug-and-play.
 True, those calculators and spreadsheets and credit card machines need to be programmed. But, in between bouts of visa restrictions, American universities successfully import thousands of math whizzes each year because jobs await them, and the tiny percentage of American-born students who do Ph.D. work equal the world's best.
 In math, as in chess, countries that produce the most grandmasters per capita -- like Hungary and Iceland -- not only don't rule the world, they don't even rule chess. Sheer power counts, as it did in chess for the Soviets. America may lose math literacy surveys, but it dominates number-crunching in every sphere from corporate profits to supercomputers to Nobel prizes. 
 So is it necessary that the average high-schooler spend years nailed to the axes of x and y?
 Maybe not, said Robert L. Park, former director of the American Physical Society, an independent group of physicists, who teaches at the University of Maryland.
 ''As a teacher, I'd like to think it's going to have a huge payoff,'' he said. ''But I'd like to know the answer.''
 He once calculated that a third of the Americans who won Nobel prizes were born abroad, and said that an open-door policy benefited both sides: American universities get well-trained, driven students, and they in turn flourish in the more creative atmosphere here.
 Bob Moses, who developed the Algebra Project in Cambridge, Mass., focuses on the other end of the spectrum: poor blacks and Hispanics who are the first in their families to aspire to college. ''No one is going to pay you because you can do division,'' he said, but added that without a grasp of the concepts his students would be ''serfs in the new information age,'' stuck in dead-end jobs as surely as illiterate Europeans were forced to the bottom of the job heap by the Industrial Revolution.
 Most experts point out that careers in science or computers require mathematics, even when it is not a real job skill but a filter for the lazy or stupid, as passing freshman physics is for pre-med students. (Disclosure: me, for example.) Physics requires calculus, calculus requires algebra and trigonometry, and so on. One must start early.
 In the age of Googling and spell-checking, noted Diane Ravitch, the education historian, the ''so what?'' question could be asked about learning virtually any subject.
 ''But a democratic society demands an educated populace,'' she said. ''Why spend hundreds of billions on public education if we're going to sling it over our shoulder?''
 But the best defense -- the first to get beyond the utilitarian argument -- came from a certain Miss Collins. She is my daughter's math teacher at a school where there are no boys to distract or intimidate calculating young women. 
 ''If you ask the girls,'' she said, ''they'll say it's another hoop they have to jump through to get into a good college.'' 
 She feels otherwise.
 ''What we do isn't exactly what mathematicians do,'' she explained. ''And I know more alums here become artists than become mathematicians. But kids don't study poetry just because they're going to grow up to be poets. It's about a habit of mind. Your mind doesn't think abstractly unless it's asked to -- and it needs to be asked to from a relatively young age. The rigor and logic that goes into math is a good way for your brain to be trained.''


GRAPHIC: Drawing (Drawing by Monica Aichele)Chart/Diagram: ''A Math Test Designed for Real Life''In a survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 15-year-olds from different countries were asked to answer questions that measured their abilities to answer ''problems with a real-life context.'' Here, sample questions from the 2003 test.1. The picture shows the footprints of a man walking. The pacelength P is the distance between the rear of two consecutive footprints.For men, the formula, (n divided by P) = 140, gives an approximate relationship between n and P where,n = number of steps per minute, andP = pacelength in metersBernard knows his pacelength is 0.80 meters. The formula applies to Bernard's walking. Calculate Bernard's walking speed in meters per minute and in kilometers per hour. Show your work.Answer: n = 140 x .80 = 112.Per minute he walks 112 x .80 meters = 89.6 meters.His speed is 5.38 or 5.4 km/hr.2. Circle the one figure that fits the following description: Triangle PQR is a right triangle with right angle at R. The segment RQ is less than the segment PR. M is the midpoint of the segment PQ, and N is the midpoint of the segment QR. S is a point inside the triangle.

HEADLINE: The Kings of Sweet and Sour

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN

 BODY:
IN a small cluttered room in a Canal Street basement, Wei Yao sat at a rickety table and proofread a Chinese menu. Red pen in hand, he fixed misspellings (''loster'' to ''lobster'') and revised the list of dishes, consulting notes supplied by his client. Fried cheese got struck out. The price of sashimi rose $2.
 Upstairs, Mr. Wei's boss, Nelson Xu, a youthful 42-year-old with a thick black brush-cut, was reminiscing about a New Jersey restaurateur, one of the various eccentric clients he has encountered in his 15 years of designing and printing Chinese menus. ''Usually in restaurants, they serve General Tso's Chicken,'' Mr. Xu said. ''But he wrote down 'General Lee.' Our guys said, 'That's the wrong spelling.' He got the proof and he wrote it again -- 'General Lee.' So I asked him why.'' Turned out that the restaurateur was a former soldier whose last name was Lee. 
 Mr. Xu is the owner of Jin Printing, one of New York's larger printers of Chinese menus, and he told the story while standing just outside the long room full of presses that is the hot, noisy heart of his company. As Mr. Xu walked about, compulsively clearing jammed sheets from the machines that print 100,000 menus a day, men in tank tops oiled cogs and daubed rollers with ink. At the center of the room sat the company workhorse, a 35-foot-long press that spat out menus at a rate of three per second, drawing paper from a giant roll 40 inches in diameter. 
 Come to Chinatown's Market Street any morning, and these rolls can be seen everywhere, being trundled out of trucks and into storefronts. Market Street, where Mr. Xu has an office, is the heart of the Chinese-menu industry. That such an industry exists in the nation's capital of Chinese restaurants is not surprising, but what is surprising is that their clients are far-flung. Thousands of Chinese restaurants east of the Mississippi, and even many west of it, have their menus designed and printed by one of the 15 or so large shops on or near the two blocks of Market between Monroe and Henry Streets, just below the Manhattan Bridge.
 Samples displayed on the shop windows proclaim the printers' reach: one store, A-Graphic Printing, features menus from Sandy, Utah; Ripley, Miss., and Bamberg, S.C. These menus tend to feature exotically un-urban directions (''Come visit us near Sunnycrest Mall!''), and advertise features seldom seen in New York Chinese restaurants, like Italian food and all-you-can-eat buffets.
 Each shop looks basically the same: a row of tired young people typing frantically at mismatched computers; a clattering press in back; and every spare foot filled with boxes or customers. 
 The frenzy is palpable. ''They're always moving,'' said Jay Baez, a UPS deliveryman who has had the Market Street route for 10 years. ''They bring the stuff to my truck in a heartbeat. They work so hard, they have no time for anything.'' 
 And the pace has quickened in the past decade. The number of Chinese takeout places has increased during that period, and many Chinese restaurants have turned to ''flyering,'' or leaving menus, on doorsteps and in lobbies to promote themselves. ''An American restaurant, 10,000 menus, they print it, and they can use it for two, three years,'' Mr. Xu said. ''Chinese people, they print 10,000 menus, and it lasts two, three months.'' 
 The growing demand for menus has attracted more printers; the total in Chinatown has jumped from fewer than 20 to about 50. ''There are too many printers,'' said K.Y. Chan, of GM Printing, a former menu maker who has moved largely into mainstream printing. ''It's a junk job market; they're undercutting each other and they don't care. They just make up the shortfall by hard work.'' 
 The economics are challenging. In the past 15 years, the price of 10,000 menus has dropped to $230 from $320, Mr. Xu said, while in the last five years the price of paper has risen 25 percent. 
 Business is also tougher because restaurant owners are tougher. Decades ago, most owners were Cantonese and financially comfortable. Now more restaurateurs are from rural Fujian province, often desperately poor, and unwilling to pay an extra dime for their menus. 
 Selling to the Fujianese has meant changing designs as well as business practices. ''Cantonese people like black and white,'' Mr. Xu said. ''The Fujianese people like colorful; they like busy.'' Brandishing a four-color menu full of boxes and photo insets, he added: ''It looks crowded. The owner of the restaurant, they feel scared, so they like the menu crowded to give them a safe feeling. They look at it and they say'' -- he assumed a look of paternal pride -- ''Oh! that's my business!''
 MOST Chinese menus today are designed in the Fujianese style and look very similar to one another. Almost every restaurant uses the same photograph of sesame chicken, for example, right down to the floral-patterned china. 
 But each house has its distinctive touches. Mr. Xu favors a certain photo of a pagoda, surrounded by water, which a friend brought back from China on a clip-art CD; the image tends to appear on his menus in a round frame below the restaurant's name. Menus printed by Sino Graphics often feature huge, loving photographs of buffets. 
 These flourishes are so distinct that experienced designers often know who printed a menu without reading the fine-print credits. When Mr. Xu was shown a menu from the Cup and Saucer Luncheonette, he looked it over and said: ''That's Double-G Graphics. They're the most beautiful printer. Even the back-side pictures are high resolution.'' 
 Nevertheless, a menu's most important features are sometimes all but invisible. Lily Han, owner of ML Graphics, said she slips tiny eccentricities into her menus to catch those who try to copy her designs. Ms. Han refused to describe those oddities, but she and an employee, Eva Wong, were eloquent on another topic, the wide cultural gap between Chinese restaurateurs and their American customers. 
 ''In Chinese characters, eight is a lucky number,'' Ms. Wong said by way of example. ''It means, 'make more money.''' So Chinese restaurant owners may name a chicken dish ''Lucky 88.'' 
 To an American, such a name is meaningless. But explaining this fact to Chinese restaurant owners is fruitless. ''They insist,'' Ms. Wong said. ''It has to be that name.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Wants to Block Iran's Nuclear Ambition, but Diplomacy Seems to Be the Only Path

BYLINE: This article was reported by Thom Shanker, Eric Schmitt and David E. Sanger, and was written by Mr. Sanger.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 

 BODY:
The Bush administration says the prospect of Iran's obtaining a nuclear weapon is ''intolerable,'' and from the White House to the State Department, officials express considerable skepticism that Europe's efforts to negotiate quietly an end to Iran's nuclear activities will succeed. 
 Yet, though President Bush threatened Iraq before the war there, he has said almost nothing about the possibility of resorting to military action in Iran.
 That may reflect the fact that Pentagon war planners, reviewing available options, say there are no good options for Mr. Bush -- or for Israel, which has expressed even greater alarm about a nuclear-armed Iran if negotiations fail.
 Almost unanimously, these planners and Pentagon analysts say there are no effective military ways to wipe out a nuclear program that has been well hidden and broadly dispersed across the country, including in crowded cities. Confronted with intelligence evidence, Iran admitted to inspectors last year that it had hidden critical aspects of its civilian program for 18 years, and even today there are questions about whether all of its nuclear-related sites are known. 
 The Bush administration has talked about the possibility of going to the United Nations to seek sanctions against Iran if a recent accord with the Europeans falls apart, as a similar agreement did last year. But the Iranians themselves are aware of the whispers about military strikes, many of them fueled by Israeli officials who view the threat as much more urgent than the Europeans do. 
 Even so, such talk may amount to little more than bluffing in a high-stakes diplomatic game that the deputy secretary of state, Richard L. Armitage, recently described as ''kind of a good-cop, bad-cop arrangement,'' with Washington playing the bad cop. But a senior European official related a conversation in which Iranians deeply involved in the talks warned that any military action would be futile. 
 The official said the Iranians boasted that ''they can rebuild the facilities in six months,'' using indigenous technology. He also said they believed that after any military action to slow Iran's program, they could ''develop a weapon as a national cause, with more consensus than now.''
 Senior officers and Pentagon officials confirm that war planners, in particular Air Force targeting teams, have updated contingencies for dealing with Iran's nuclear ambitions, as they periodically do. But they immediately emphasize that this does not reflect any guidance from the civilian leadership to prepare for military confrontation.
 Instead, they say, it is part of an effort ordered by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to begin a constant process of refreshing contingency planning throughout the world, an effort partly inspired by the outdated plan for invading Iraq that had to be rapidly dusted off and radically rewritten before the war there.
 ''Military planning always continues,'' said one senior officer based in the Middle East. ''We are constantly updating plans.'' 
 But interviews with military planners, Pentagon policy makers and academic experts drew a unanimous sentiment that the challenge in 2005 would be to contain the situation so that neither the United States nor Iran took a misstep or miscalculated, bringing on military action.
 The Iranians remember Osirak, the site of a lightning Israeli airstrike against an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981 that set back Saddam Hussein's nuclear ambitions by a decade. American and European intelligence officials say Iran has taken the lesson to heart, spreading its nuclear facilities around the country, burying some underground and putting others in the middle of crowded urban areas. 
 For example, the International Atomic Energy Agency last year found centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, behind a false wall at the Kalaye Electric Company in a densely populated corner of Tehran, where there would be no way to conduct a military strike without causing major civilian casualties. ''They are not about to make the same mistake Saddam did,'' a senior administration official said.
 Thus the military options range from the bad to the unimaginable.
 None guarantee success, military planners say. Many risk causing not only casualties but a political crisis in the Middle East. The planners, many of them involved in the war against Iraq, argue vehemently that Iran presents a growing proliferation problem better approached through diplomatic channels than by airstrikes, Special Operations missions or an all-out invasion.
 ''There's no big war plan on the shelf,'' said one administration official involved in the planning process. 
 Part of the caution appears linked to the realization that while Iran's nuclear facilities are far more advanced than Iraq's ever were, the administration has yet to prove that Iran is secretly planning to build a weapon. The country has opened many of its sites to international inspectors, though there is still wrangling over whether the agency will be able to visit two military sites that some experts suspect could house a parallel, secret military effort to produce uranium. 
 If such sites exist, they would violate the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which Iran has signed and which requires that all of its facilities must be solely for civilian use. So far, the inspectors have asked to see only one of the sites, and Iran has not indicated whether it would provide access. 
 The director general of the international agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, has carefully stopped short of declaring that Iran is seeking a weapon, though recently he noted that Iran ''tried to cheat the system.''
 But whether it is a civilian program or something more nefarious, Iran is using an approach to developing nuclear fuel through the enrichment of uranium that is far easier to hide than the approach that Iraq took two decades ago.
 So there is no central plant like Osirak to bomb.
 ''Osirak is not a paradigm,'' said Robert S. Litwak, director of international studies at the Woodrow Wilson Center here. ''It was an exceptional case, in which all of the conditions for success came together. Israel had accurate intelligence on the target, collateral damage effects on the nearby population were judged minimal because the nuclear core had not yet been loaded into the reactor, and Saddam Hussein then had no capacity to retaliate directly against Israel.''
 In Iran today, said Mr. Litwak, who worked on proliferation issues as a National Security Council staff member in the Clinton administration, ''none of those conditions pertain.''
 That view is echoed at the senior levels of the military. ''Iran takes great care to protect its technology and production/storage capability with multiple layers of security, hardening and dispersal,'' said one Air Force general with experience in the Middle East. ''All this complicates identification, targeting and execution.''
 Analysts of the Iranian political scene also point out that many in the American government view a growing and energized Iranian civil society, in particular the young and women, as an agent of change toward a democratic Iran.
 News of the energy agency's restrained action helped Iran's stock market, which had suffered over fears that the nuclear dispute could result in a military confrontation with Israel or the United States. Any American military strike on Iran, these analysts say, would cancel any positive feelings these people have toward the United States, and probably galvanize support for the more militant Islamic leadership.

HEADLINE: How Consultants Can Retire on Your Pension

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
NINE years ago, William Keith Phillips, a top stockbroker at Paine Webber, met with the trustees of the Chattanooga Pension Fund in Tennessee to pitch his services as a consultant. He gave them an intriguing, if unusual, choice. They could pay for his investment advice directly, as pension funds often do, or they could save money by agreeing to allocate a portion of its trading commissions to cover his fees. Under a commission arrangement, Mr. Phillips told the trustees, the fund would be less likely to incur out-of-pocket expenses, leaving more money to invest for its 1,600 beneficiaries.
 Seven and a half years later, Chattanooga's pension trustees discovered just how expensive that money-saving plan had been. According to an arbitration proceeding they filed against Mr. Phillips, the agreement cost the fund $20 million in losses, undisclosed commissions and fees. And since 2001, Chattanooga has had to raise nearly $3.7 million from taxpayers to keep the $180 million fund fiscally sound. 
 The Chattanooga trustees fired Mr. Phillips in 2003 and, last October, filed arbitration proceedings against him, UBS Wealth Management USA, formerly the Paine Webber Group, and his new firm, Morgan Stanley. The case, which is pending, accuses the consultant of, among other things, fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. The commission arrangement was central to the problem because it put Mr. Phillips's interests ahead of his client's, the fund said in its complaint. 
 ''The very important and in many ways unique relationship that a pension fund board has with its consultant is based on trust,'' said David R. Eichenthal, finance officer and chairman of the general pension plan for the city of Chattanooga. ''To the extent that Phillips breached that trust, we thought it was important for the pension fund to do everything possible to hold him accountable for the results.''
 Pension experts say the Chattanooga case is hardly rare among retirement funds. The Securities and Exchange Commission is concerned enough about conflicts of interest among consultants who advise pension funds on asset allocation, selection of money managers and other investment matters that it is conducting an industrywide inquiry. The results of the S.E.C.'s investigation are expected soon, and enforcement actions may follow. 
 Aubrey Harwell, a lawyer for Mr. Phillips, declined to make him available for this article. Mr. Harwell said: ''No.1, these are allegations and not proven facts. And No.2, the performance during the days that Keith Phillips was consulting were well beyond the benchmarks.'' Details of the commission arrangement, he added, were fully disclosed to the pension fund. But this is not the first time a pension client has sued Mr. Phillips. In 2000, the Metro Nashville Pension Plan filed an arbitration based on similar accusations. That arbitration was settled two years later, with UBS paying $10.3 million to the pension fund.
 As financial services conglomerates have added a wide array of operations in recent years, the possibility of conflicts of interest has also grown. And nowhere are the conflicts more potentially lucrative -- and more obscure -- than in the management of pension assets. 
 ''Recommendations to pension funds regarding asset allocation, money manager selection and securities brokerage policies are frequently driven by undisclosed financial arrangements,'' said Edward A.H. Siedle, president of Benchmark Financial Services Inc., in Ocean Ridge, Fla., and a former lawyer for the S.E.C. ''Pensions often accept that poor investment performance is attributable to unfortunate investment assumptions when, in fact, more sinister forces were at work. Investment performance often is compromised as the result of conflicts of interest, undisclosed financial arrangements, excessive fees and fraud.''
 An estimated $5 trillion sits in thousands of pension funds across the nation, run for the benefit of private company, state or municipal workers who rely on the funds for retirement income. Some funds are huge, with billions of dollars under management, and are overseen by a board of finance professionals. Many, however, are tiny, with just a few million dollars invested. These funds are often run by volunteers less versed in the ways of Wall Street.
 Pension fund boards typically hire a consultant to advise them on investment strategies and the hiring of money managers. Problems can crop up when these pension consulting firms, which have a fiduciary duty to the fund, put their own interests first. 
 JUST as pension funds come in many sizes, so, too, do the consulting firms that serve them. Some are one-person operations while others work within a large financial-services firm. Among the biggest companies in pension consulting are Mercer Inc., a unit of Marsh & McLennan, and Callan Associates, a privately held company based in San Francisco. 
 In recent years, however, Wall Street firms have played an increasingly large role in the world of pension consulting. Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley are all big in this field. 
 The potential for conflicts is greatest at firms with brokerage or trading operations, pension authorities say, and it almost always involves how the consultants are compensated. 
 The trouble is, much of a consultant's pay can be hidden from view. The Chattanooga complaint said Mr. Phillips and his colleagues controlled and manipulated the information given to the pension board, keeping it in the dark about excessive fees and conflicts inherent in the recommendations they made to the fund. Mr. Phillips's reports on the pension fund's performance were misleading, the complaint said, because they did not take into consideration all of the fees and commissions it paid. 
 Only when the Chattanooga board began considering rival consultants to advise it in 2002 did Mr. Phillips acknowledge the conflicts of interest in his previous arrangement with the pension fund, the complaint said. Arguing that the Chattanooga board should keep him on, Mr. Phillips said that under a new agreement conflicts would be removed, according to the complaint, and that there would be ''full and fair disclosure of all brokerage practices and relationships.'' Money manager recommendations would be ''based upon performance rather than revenue,'' he said, according to the complaint. 
 Mr. Phillips ultimately lost the Chattanooga account to the Consulting Services Group of Nashville, an independent consultant with no brokerage firm operations. 
 A spokesman for UBS said that the firm believes the case has no merit. ''We are defending ourselves vigorously,'' he said. 
 A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said: ''The Chattanooga Pension Board was a sophisticated and knowledgeable investor that was advised by its own counsel about all aspects of its relationship with us. Morgan Stanley acted properly and is confident that the board's claims will be rejected by the arbitrators.''
 The compensation of consultants is so complex because it can come from many sources. ''There are more ways for people to be compensated in the financial business than most people realize,'' said Joseph Bogdahn, principal of Bogdahn Consulting L.L.C., an independent consultant in Winter Haven, Fla. ''The only way that you can determine if your consultant is truly independent is to audit their tax returns and their financials.'' 
 Mr. Bogdahn said he recommends that pension fund trustees ask their consultants to open up their books to show how they are paid, and by whom. He says he makes his financial statements available to his clients. 
 Because they have a fiduciary duty to their clients, consultants are required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest in their operations. But when they have affiliations with firms that conduct trades for the pension funds they advise, these relationships can undermine the fiduciary duty. Some consultants try to get around this by hiring money managers who agree to direct their trades through the brokerage firm with which the consultants are affiliated. 
 Arrangements like the one in Chattanooga are the most common method used by pension consultants to ensure that commissions will go to them. In their contracts, they require the pension funds to pay their fee through commissions on trades steered to their brokerage units. This is known as directed brokerage, commission recapture or a soft-dollar arrangement.
 Ultimately, pension experts say, the commissions steered to the brokerage firm in such an arrangement are often worth far more than the upfront fee that is typically quoted by the consultant for his services. Pension fund trustees do not always receive a full accounting of the transactions and the commissions they generate. So the trustees do not know how much more they are paying as a result of the arrangement. 
 For example, during its years with Mr. Phillips, Chattanooga wound up paying his firm $2 million in commissions and cash payments, an average of $270,000 annually. If it had paid the upfront fees quoted by Mr. Phillips, the fund would have paid $154,000 a year, on average, the lawsuit said. As a result of the commission arrangement, Mr. Phillips and his colleagues misappropriated more than $870,000 in undisclosed and unjustified fees, according to the complaint. 
 When consultants steer trades to a particular firm, a pension fund can pay dearly in other ways, too. Money managers are supposed to provide best execution -- the most favorable price -- on their clients' trades. But when a brokerage firm is guaranteed to receive most or all of a fund's trades, it need not work as hard on the execution of those trades as a firm that is competing for the business. Execution costs can skyrocket.
 A letter sent to a public pension client last January by Rittenhouse Asset Management Inc., a money manager in Radnor, Pa., described the matter succinctly: ''Because we trade through your advisor, we have not selected broker-dealers or negotiated commission rates for your account and cannot actively ensure that directed brokerage terms are in your continuing best interests. Although cost is only one component of best execution analysis, many directed brokerage accounts pay effective rates of commissions that are higher than client accounts that do not have directed brokerage arrangements.''
 Rittenhouse said it made this disclosure because industry practices were changing and the firm wanted to remind its clients of their specific arrangements. 
 The potential for conflicts is driving some pension fund trustees to switch to independent consultants who have no brokerage firm affiliations and are therefore not tempted to ask money managers to steer trades to them. Michael Brown is a battalion chief of the fire department in Dania Beach, Fla., and a member of the police and fire pension board; the funds had $22.6 million in assets as of last December. For many years, the board employed Merrill Lynch Consulting Services in Jacksonville, Fla., as its pension consultant. But earlier this year, the board replaced Merrill with an independent consultant that did not have a brokerage unit in its operations. 
 ''I think they did a good job,'' Mr. Brown said, referring to Merrill. ''But a lot of stuff had come out over the last year with reference to your big corporate money managers and consultants being at the same company. We thought it would be a better idea to have an independent consultant.'' 
 Merrill Lynch Consulting Services in Jacksonville counts almost 100 pension funds in Florida as its clients. At the end of 2003, they included the $80 million fire and police funds of Cape Coral, the $40 million police fund of Fort Myers, the $26 million police fund of Miramar and the $27 million fire and police funds of Vero Beach.
 Pension consultants sometimes recommend that their smaller clients buy mutual funds. What a pension's trustees may not realize is that their consultant can receive compensation from the mutual fund companies on these trades. 
 In 2000, at the advice of Merrill Lynch Consulting, the city of Sunrise, Fla., put $10.4 million of its pension assets into three international mutual funds with similar stock holdings. The pension fund bought shares worth $3.7 million in one fund, $3.1 million in the second and $3.6 million in the third. 
 Merrill Lynch Consulting received commissions of 1 percent on each purchase from the mutual fund companies. But mutual funds often discount their commissions on larger trades, so if the fund had put all $10.4 million into one of the international mutual funds, Merrill Lynch Consulting would have received 0.69 percent. 
 ''Sunrise, not Merrill Lynch, selected the money managers from recommendations we provided,'' said Mark Herr, a Merrill spokesman. ''During the five years we provided consulting services, Sunrise finished in the top quartile or quintile for results when compared to its peers.''
 Brokerage commissions are not the only source of revenue for many pension consultants. They also receive payments from money managers who attend annual conferences at luxurious resorts set up by the consultants. The conferences are billed as opportunities for money managers to meet pension plan officials, but critics describe them as pay-to-play mechanisms. They contend that the money managers recommended by consultants to pension funds tend to be only those who paid to attend the conferences.
 Earlier this year, CRA RogersCasey, an investment consultant in Chicago, held two conferences, one at the American Club in Kohler, Wis., near two famous golf courses, and the other at the Kingsmill Resort in Williamsburg, Va. Celebrities often appear at CRA RogersCasey conferences: past speakers have included Gen. H.Norman Schwarzkopf; James Carville, the political consultant; and Robert B. Reich, the former secretary of labor. The cost to attend varies. At the conferences this year, ''new members'' paid $40,000 while return guests were charged $35,000 to $37,500. 
 MONEY management firms that have attended past conferences of CRA RogersCasey include AIG Global Investment, Citigroup Asset Management, Strong Capital Management, Putnam Investments and Bear Stearns Asset Management.
 Matt McCormick, director of marketing at CRA RogersCasey, said that it would continue to sponsor conferences. ''Our clients tell us that they add value,'' he said. ''They tell us they have a very good comfort level that there is no impact or influence on our independent advice.''
 Earlier this year, Mercer said it would stop conducting conferences. Callan Associates said it was continuing to hold its meetings. ''An important part of our business model is educating all clients on their fiduciary responsibilities,'' a Callan spokeswoman said. 
 Pension consultants aren't the only ones holding conferences where money managers can hobnob with pension officials. Robert D. Klausner, a lawyer at Klausner & Kaufman in Plantation, Fla., whose firm provides legal counsel to many pension funds in Florida and elsewhere in the south, runs similar meetings. 
 Klausner & Kaufman's sixth annual client conference was in March at the Hyatt Regency in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Among the eight companies that paid to sponsor the 2003 conference were Merrill Lynch and Davis Hamilton Jackson & Associates, a money manager based in Houston that Merrill often recommends to its pension clients. 
 According to documents detailing the various advisers to police and fire pension funds in Florida, Mr. Klausner's firm provides legal advice to 19 funds. Twelve of them employed Davis Hamilton as a money manager, or Merrill Lynch Consulting as a consultant, or both. Mr. Klausner did not return calls seeking comment.
 Davis Hamilton appears often among the pension fund clients of Merrill Lynch Consulting, even though the firm has produced less-than-stellar returns in recent years. Davis Hamilton has managed the Lake Worth Police Officers' Pension Fund, for example, and for the six years ending in 2003, it beat its benchmark index only one-third of the time. For the year ending 2003, the police fund's overall return, including both stocks and bonds, ranked in the bottom 26 percent of the peer group used by Merrill. 
 A trustee at a public fund in Florida, who asked for anonymity because he feared reprisals from the firms involved, said his fund is advised by Merrill Lynch and has employed Davis Hamilton. Although the money manager's performance has been lackluster in recent years, this trustee said Merrill Lynch continued to recommend that the pension fund retain Davis Hamilton. The trustee said he was concerned that Merrill's support of Davis Hamilton had to do with the fact that Davis Hamilton steers ''virtually all'' of the pension fund's trades to Merrill. 
 Davis Hamilton did not return calls seeking comment. Merrill's spokesman said: ''We do not require any client or any manager to direct its trades to us. The choice always belongs to the client.'' 
 The Merrill spokesman added: ''We don't pay to play. We don't have conflicts of interest that injure or work against our clients. We fully disclose our fees face up on the table. The only reason we do well is because we provide excellent work for our clients.'' 
 Trustees of the city retirement system in San Diego are in a battle over the practices of Callan Associates, one of its consultants. Diann Shipione, a volunteer trustee and a financial adviser, has called for the consultant's resignation because of payments Callan has received from money managers it has recommended to the fund. 
 For example, Ms. Shipione said, one of the money managers recommended by Callan had only two full years of experience and a performance ranking in the bottom 30 percent of its peers nationwide. Only after she questioned the recommendation did it emerge that Callan had a significant economic relationship with the money manager, she said. 
 Callan's spokeswoman said the performance of the San Diego pension fund spoke for itself. For the five years ended Sept. 30, she said, ''San Diego was in the top 1 percent of our public fund universe and was in the top third in each of those five years.'' She added that in a typical year, less than half the investment managers recommended by Callan were its clients.
 But Ms. Shipione said: ''These pay-to-play practices are systemic. A consultant's advice should come in the form of an objective recommendation, but in reality it may be the result of self-serving economic gain. Pension trustees need information about the business of investment consultants and their sources of revenue. It would at least give us information with which to test the consultant's objectivity.'' 
 Indeed, among the documents requested of pension consultants by the S.E.C. in its investigation are a full accounting of the compensation received by consultants, not only from their pension plan clients, but also from the money managers they recommend. 
 Mr. Siedle, who investigates money management abuses on behalf of pension fund clients, said these funds could be easily defrauded because they had no procedures in place to detect and prevent wrongdoing. ''The greatest threat to pensions today is the widespread unwillingness to confront the truth about how investment firms have profited at the expense of funds and take corrective action,'' he said.
 Gary Findlay, executive director of the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System, said his organization had tackled the problem of conflicted consultants by using a consultant that receives no revenue beyond the direct fees it charges the fund.
 ''Our consultant has no relationship with a broker dealer and they sell no services to money managers,'' Mr. Findlay said. ''One of the things that we rely on from our consultant is to provide us with guidance on the basis of undivided loyalty. Their interests are aligned with our interests only, and I do believe that's what it's all about.''

HEADLINE: Arab and Western Ministers Voice Different Priorities

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: RABAT, Morocco, Dec. 11 

 BODY:
Foreign ministers from the Arab world met with leaders from the West on Saturday at a conference dedicated to advancing political change in this region. Instead, Arabs vented their frustration with American support for Israel.
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in an opening statement to the group, spoke of efforts to make ''participation in political and public life more inclusive'' -- the ostensible subject of the conference.
 Nonetheless, one by one, representatives of 20 Arab states talked largely about economic development and the ever-present thorn in debate here, the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
 ''For too long,'' said Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi Arabian foreign minister, ''the Arabs have witnessed the Western bias toward Israel.'' 
 Mr. Powell repeatedly insisted that ''we cannot hold up reform'' while waiting to settle the Palestinian issue. Nonetheless, the conference's final statement declared that ''support for reform in the region will go hand-in-hand with support for a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict.''
 The perception that the United States gives undue American support to Israel underlies almost every political discussion with the Arab world. When Vice President Dick Cheney visited the region in 2002, with the goal of winning support for the Iraq war, he instead heard from almost every country that the Israeli-Palestinian dispute must be resolved first.
 The Forum for the Future, as the conference was called, was the culmination of two years of effort to advance President Bush's vision of bringing democratic change to the Arab world. The United States and Western European nations have been planning and talking about the event since the Group of 8 summit meeting in June. 
 The highly choreographed, three-and-a-half hour event was supposed to be closed to the public, with the exception of a few opening statements, most of them from Western leaders. But Moroccan officials failed to turn off the audio feed to the press room. As a result, the Arab foreign ministers inveighed against the West apparently unaware that several dozen journalists were listening. 
 Foreign ministers and other officials from 20 Arab states sat quietly, many with sullen expressions while European and American officials spoke first during the public session about the need for change. But then, also as part of the public session, Amr Moussa, secretary general of the Arab League, set the tone when he asked, ''How can this partnership'' between the Middle East and the West ''be achieved without settling the Palestinian issue?''
 Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, also speaking when the session was supposed to be closed, added that ''progress in the Middle East peace process will lend all reform and modernization efforts unprecedented momentum.''
 Libya's deputy foreign minister, Hassaouna al-Shawish, also complained about the continuing fighting in Iraq, saying the ''continued bloodshed'' there ''makes it difficult for us to go forward.''
 Many officials in the West argued that the Arab states continue focusing attention on Middle East peace to distract the public from problems at home.
 Even before the Arab leaders arrived here, several Arab officials said, many states looked upon this conference with distrust and concern that the United States might seek to impose its views on the region. 
 The leak of a Bush administration planning document early this year, saying the administration hoped Western nations would push Arab states to democratize, angered leaders here and fed the public mistrust.
 Since then, American and European officials have repeatedly insisted that they do not intend to impose solutions; any changes must come from within the nations involved. In addition, most of the initiatives proposed dealt with business, not political, issues. 
 Recognizing the political hurdles he faced, Mr. Powell told the delegates, ''Now is not the time to argue about the pace of democratic reform or whether economic reform must precede political reform.'' 
 Mr. Powell also alluded to the debate over Middle East peace when he added, ''Increasing opportunities for all citizens, especially women, should not be put on hold to deal with other concerns.''
 Speaking to reporters on the plane en route to Morocco, he was more direct. ''We can't keep pointing to the Middle East peace process as the reason we don't undertake reform efforts that are needed by these nations,'' he said.
 In that briefing, Secretary Powell also said he believed that the conference could be judged a success based only on the fact that all the Arab leaders had agreed to attend.
 At the end of the event, Mr. Powell and Muhammad Benaissa, the Moroccan foreign minister, said the delegates had agreed to pursue new programs to combat illiteracy and provide financing for small businesses, among other financial initiatives. 
 A program called the Democracy Assistance Dialog managed by Yemen, Turkey and Italy, briefed the convention on its plan to hold meetings in one another's states on subjects like women's rights and freedom of the press beginning next year. And a group of nongovernment agencies spoke about their aspirations and plans.
 Even before the event began, it was clear that many here did not share the Western enthusiasm for democratic change.
 In a Zogby poll published two weeks ago, most of the 2,600 respondents in five Arab states said they were more interested in expanding employment opportunities than in political change. Their second most serious concern was resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
 The poll results indicated that true political change like expanding democracy and promoting open political debate ranked ''at the list's bottom,'' the Zogby organization said. 
 Some views of Western intentions were darker. A cartoon atop the front page of The Economist, a Moroccan newspaper, this weekend showed a fully armed American soldier pointing his weapon at a wounded Arab on the ground. The soldier, paraphrasing a recent remark by Mr. Powell, said, ''I hope that we can come to an understanding of the need for reform and modernization'' in the Arab world.''

HEADLINE: A New Way to Hedge Your Home's Paper Profit

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
IF you have owned a home for several years, you may be sitting on a sizable increase in equity. And if you are worried that the run-up in housing prices can't last much longer, you may think the only choice is to call a broker, rent a moving van and head for the (less expensive) hills. 
 But through an increasing number of new investments, you may be able to limit future erosion of your home's value.
 Macro Securities Research, a company affiliated with Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist, has reached an agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to list pairs of derivative instruments that are essentially index funds linked to home prices in certain markets. One instrument in each pair will rise as its market index rises; the other will rise as the same index falls. That will let investors bet on the direction of housing prices. Similar, but less sensitive, vehicles are being offered by HedgeStreet, a firm in San Mateo, Calif., that offers small-scale derivatives speculation online. 
 For homeowners looking for alternatives to the risks and complications of derivatives trading, there are also insurance policies that pay out if home prices fall, but they are only available in certain areas, and the conditions for collecting are highly restrictive.
 In fact, none of these approaches are likely to provide anything close to a perfect hedge, eliminating all risk of loss. And while the options available to nervous homeowners are growing in number and sophistication, some advisers warn that they may provide minimal protection from the vicissitudes of the real estate market.
 But other, simpler strategies may help you prepare for a softening of the market, they add. One is to avoid variable-rate mortgages before any serious increase in interest rates -- an event regarded as a possible trigger for a reversal in home prices.
 Macro Securities hopes to list its instruments in Chicago before such a reversal, but the exchange's announcement this month was short on details, like a starting date. Mr. Shiller, the company's chief economist, said that his securities would track home price indexes in cities yet to be chosen, although strong candidates include New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, he said.
 The minimum investment for the securities and the amount of leverage built into them are also not yet known. A one-percentage-point move in the index, he said, may produce a change of two percent or three percent in the value of the securities. 
 An important feature of the Macro securities, he said, is that they will come in twos -- one moving in tandem with the index and the other in the opposite direction. Having a single index fund would require a hedger to sell short, raising the theoretical prospect of an infinite loss. (That could happen only if housing prices rose to infinity -- not a far-fetched idea to many people who are looking to buy a co-op in Manhattan.)
 Another set of derivative products linked to home prices was introduced in October by HedgeStreet, which specializes in online trading of pint-sized contracts it calls ''hedgelets.'' Each is a yes-or-no wager that a housing index will be in a certain range on a given date within three months. After that period, the contracts expire, and losing bets are worthless.
 There are three residential property bets, representing percentage moves in an index whose level may be higher, lower or even with the recent trend in home price movements, for each of six cities: New York, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego.
 But the value of each contract is a paltry $10, and they are infrequently traded, at best, so unless you live in a matchbox, it would be difficult -- and very expensive -- to buy enough of them to provide a practical hedge.
 Russell Andersson, a vice president of HedgeStreet, said that the products were new and were still seeking an audience. He conceded that their three-month life span was too fleeting for use by many homeowners and said that HedgeStreet was planning to introduce vehicles that would trade much like futures contracts and last for one and three years.
 ''With a combination of these two products, you can hedge out very aggressive short-term movements as well as longer-term movements,'' Mr. Andersson said.
 Mr. Shiller says his approach to defending against price declines is meant to be useful even for people with modest incomes. ''We're looking for a vehicle with widespread acceptance,'' he said. The device of two separate funds is one way to gain it, in his opinion. ''It means there is no loss beyond the initial outlay, no margin calls,'' he said.
 That may not be true if leverage is built into the instruments, as Mr. Shiller envisions. But homeowners looking for further protection may consider borrowing against their equity, knowing that it will rise enough to make up any decrease in the fund's value, he said. Should home prices fall, the value of the fund that is inversely correlated to the housing market will rise, mitigating the loss. 
 ''Volatile markets are increasingly becoming a part of our lives,'' Mr. Shiller added. ''The home market itself is becoming more volatile. We're in the biggest real estate bubble in history, I believe.
 ''We haven't seen a swing down yet, but it could be coming,'' he warned. ''There are people with big houses and big mortgages who are going to feel the pinch.''
 Jonathan Golub, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management in New York, agreed. The culprit in a downturn, he believes, will be big mortgages, more than big houses. Variable-rate mortgages, in particular, could be a problem. 
 When interest rates are low, buyers can afford more house for the same monthly payment, said Mr. Golub, who himself is a renter in Manhattan. He said that any holder of a variable-rate mortgage must understand that ''if interest rates drop, the house is worth more to me, and vice versa; if rates rise, I'm toast.''
 Burned on both sides, too, because the higher mortgage payments tend to depress home prices. ''You get hit with a double whammy,'' he said. ''The cost of carrying goes up and the value goes down.''
 NATIONWIDE, he noted, home prices rose 7 percent a year, on average, from 1999 to 2003, roughly double the rate for rental prices. Over the previous 15 years, the two rose more or less in tandem, with one outpacing the other for a while before the pattern reversed.
 Mr. Golub says he expects home prices to hold up until mortgage rates rise further, so there is time for homeowners to prepare. His advice is to ''lock down that fixed-rate mortgage.''
 As for the hedging vehicles being offered, he has doubts about their utility for most current and prospective homeowners. ''The adviser who would sell them won't be able to understand them,'' he said. ''They're the kind of thing you see pushed at the top of a market.''
 For someone considering buying a home now, ''the smart thing to do is rent,'' he said.
 ''It probably does not make sense for someone who owns a home and plans to stay there to sell it and rent it back,'' he added. ''But what probably makes sense is for that first-time homebuyer or guy planning to retire to Florida to rent instead of buy.''

HEADLINE: The Pinochet Money Trail

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: Santiago, Chile 

 BODY:
GEN. MANUEL CONTRERAS is a religious man. A bas-relief of the Last Supper hangs on his dining room wall, not far from a thick, leather-bound Bible that rests on a table. As the former head of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's secret police in Chile, General Contreras is also a controversial man. A large silver plate, given to him by Argentina's intelligence services, sits on a shelf, a few feet from the Bible.
 The inscription on the plate reads June 1976, the same month and year that General Contreras and other South American intelligence chiefs, according to declassified United States intelligence documents, authorized assassinations of exiled political dissidents in a wide-ranging conspiracy known as Operation Condor. Although General Contreras denied the existence of such a plan in a recent interview in his hillside home here, the plot has been amply documented in the United States intelligence records. 
 General Contreras's past banking activities have been documented, too. According to a declassified 1979 State Department memo, he opened a ''secret bank account'' at Riggs Bank in Washington in 1966, when he was a young soldier based in the United States. The State Department report noted that General Contreras's balance at Riggs was as high as $26,000 in the mid-1970's. In the interview, he said he was sure he never kept more than $1,000 at Riggs and that it was common for members of the Chilean army who were based in the United States to have personal accounts at the bank.
 But General Contreras was less certain about funds Riggs held for his former boss, General Pinochet, whose accounts are among those at the center of a sweeping money-laundering investigation of the bank. The sums involved -- as much as $8 million, according to an assessment by the United States Senate -- have left even General Pinochet's staunchest allies wondering about their origin. 
 ''The problem with Pinochet is that he got quite a lot,'' General Contreras said. Army wages were very low, he said, even for someone as senior as General Pinochet.
 Does he believe that the general accumulated his riches fairly?
 ''I don't know,'' said General Contreras, shaking his head. ''I don't know.''
 As Chile's strongman from 1973, when he overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected civilian president, to 1990, General Pinochet presided over a purge of political opponents and the creation of a police state. But he also laid the foundations for what has become Latin America's most stable and promising economy -- all, as the general's supporters have claimed, without ever stealing a dime.
 In the United States, however, Senate investigators published a lengthy report in July that detailed multimillion-dollar accounts that General Pinochet and his wife, Lucia, held at Riggs. The funds were disguised and moved around the globe for years with the cooperation of Riggs officials, said Senate investigators, even after he was detained in London in 1998 and held under house arrest on Spanish court accusations of human rights abuses and genocide.
 Regulators fined Riggs $25 million earlier this year for failing to comply with bank secrecy laws, and a criminal investigation of the bank and its executives for possible money laundering is under way at the Justice Department. No Riggs officials have been charged with wrongdoing, although a former executive is the subject of a grand jury investigation of possible bank fraud.
 In Chile, the fact that General Pinochet secreted large sums of money in other countries has forced a reassessment of his legacy and prompted scathing headlines questioning his integrity. The Chilean Congress has established a commission to determine if the Riggs accounts contain stolen government funds, an investigation that is moving apace with a separate judicial inquiry and a tax evasion investigation.
 ''Let's not kid ourselves,'' said Juan Pablo Letelier, chairman of the Chilean congressional commission and son of Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean foreign minister who was assassinated in Washington as part of Operation Condor. ''Obviously, no public servant, even one who is head of state and commander in chief of the army, amasses that kind of wealth in this country, based on public income only.''
 Exactly how the general supplemented his modest salary -- never more than about $40,000 a year as president -- with foreign bank accounts holding millions of dollars remains unknown. His financial adviser has told the Chilean press that the general's fortune could be as much as $15 million and that all of it was accumulated legally, through shrewd investing.
 Chilean government officials have openly ridiculed that explanation. The general's own sworn financial statements, released in recent weeks by United States Senate investigators and approved by a senior Riggs executive, indicate that he received large ''commissions from service and travel abroad'' during his nearly 25 years as Chile's ruler and military chief.
 The statements are based on documents that Riggs has furnished to federal regulators. They show, for example, that in 1976 General Pinochet received a $3 million payment stemming from official duties involving the United States. And from 1974 to 1997, according to the documents, General Pinochet received payments totaling at least $12.3 million in connection with official duties involving China, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Spain and Britain. 
 It is unclear from those documents exactly what or who were the sources of some of those payments. The Chilean president's office said late last week that the documents were stamped by the Chilean defense ministry but that the government is investigating their origin and authenticity to see if General Pinochet may have forged them. 
 Based on the examination of other documents, Chilean officials said in interviews that General Pinochet, now 89, participated in lucrative real estate deals and may have received some of his biggest riches as a result of a wave of industrial privatizations engineered by his administration. Those transactions benefited numerous members of General Pinochet's government, the Chilean military, a core group of businessmen who were his avid supporters and his former son-in-law. 
 Chilean authorities -- like their counterparts in Russia, Argentina and other countries where a select group benefited disproportionately from privatization of formerly state-owned companies -- are examining whether the general received kickbacks from insiders involved in the privatizations.
 ''We have not yet uncovered proof'' of bribes or kickbacks, in part because of missing records, said Carlos Montes, chairman of a Chilean congressional committee reviewing the privatizations. ''But our hypothesis is the same that you hear repeated until exhaustion in the rest of Chilean society: that those who benefited the most from the privatizations were generous with General Pinochet.''
 FOURTEEN years after he stepped down as dictator and six years after he ceded his post as commander in chief of the Chilean military, General Pinochet, still inspires fervent devotion among his loyalists. Three former senior military leaders who strolled into General Contreras's home during the interview agreed that any cash General Pinochet held abroad were emergency reserves, not stolen funds.
 Other sometime supporters, though, have had their faith in the former dictator shaken. General Contreras's wife complained in the interview that she and her friends sold their jewelry to help raise money for General Pinochet's legal defense in the late 1990's, only to learn through the Riggs investigation that he had much more money than they ever knew or even suspected.
 General Contreras, who said the secret police kept its own funds at the Bank of New York during the 1970's because ''the C.I.A. told us that was a good bank,'' asserted that his former boss was ''just one man'' and that the entire Chilean military should not be suspected of financial improprieties simply because General Pinochet was now on the hot seat.
 According to the 1979 State Department memo, American authorities initially examined General Contreras's account at Riggs Bank as part of their investigation into the murder of Mr. Letelier and his assistant, Ronni Karpen Moffitt, whose car was blown up by a bomb as it approached the Chilean Embassy in Washington. But the memo said that it was impossible to determine the source of General Contreras's funds because officials at Riggs had destroyed all the relevant records. Riggs declined to comment on the Contreras accounts.
 MORE than two decades after those bank accounts were scrutinized, funds that Riggs maintained for General Pinochet are proving to be equally murky and difficult to trace. That the general held such funds is at odds with the Chilean military's own stated traditions. A 1989 financial disclosure form that General Pinochet gave Riggs said: ''The honesty of public servants corresponds to one of the essential principles that applies to all institutions the members of the 'junta' represent.''
 As General Contreras himself said, his former boss's wealth appears to be quite large for a man who spent his entire professional life as a soldier and public official. General Pinochet's financial adviser, Oscar Aitken , said that he believes his client's $15 million fortune is the result of an unusual amount of high-level hand-holding. The general's accounts ''were personally managed by Joseph Allbritton'' Mr. Aitken told El Mercurio, a Santiago newspaper, in September, referring to Riggs's former chairman and chief executive. 
 Mr. Aitken described Mr. Allbritton, who remains the single largest shareholder of Riggs, as ''Pinochet's biggest admirer in the banking world,'' and Senate investigators in the United States have found numerous examples of his intervening personally on the general's behalf over the years. Mr. Allbritton, Mr. Aitken said, ''promised, and delivered, rates of return that doubled General Pinochet's capital every three years.'' 
 A Riggs spokesman said that Mr. Allbritton did not personally manage the general's accounts and that the two men met in person on only two occasions. ''The comments published in the El Mercurio newspaper are fundamentally wrong and materially inaccurate,'' the spokesman said. 
 Riggs's own records indicate that most of the general's accounts were earning interest of only 2 percent or 3 percent. The general's lawyer, spokesmen for his nonprofit foundation and individual members of the foundation's board either declined interviews or did not respond to repeated requests for interviews about his finances.
 ''If a high-level public servant tells you he is going to accumulate $10 million to $15 million by the time he is 65 years old, you need to denounce him to the authorities, because most likely he is stealing,'' Nicolas Eyzaguire, Chile's finance minister, told reporters here recently. ''The only way to have achieved those high rates of return,'' he added, would be ''if Pinochet himself and his children were financial geniuses, something which is very doubtful.''
 In the United States, federal investigations of Riggs's management of the general's funds suggests that the bank was more interested in masking the existence of his accounts than in producing high-octane financial returns. Riggs, according to American investigators, did not inform regulators, as required, about the existence of the accounts when asked about them four years ago. Moreover, the bank, in a maneuver that it has conceded was improper, changed the names on the accounts of the general and his wife from ''Augusto Pinochet Ugarte & Lucia Hiriart de Pinochet'' to ''L. Hiriart &/or A. Ugarte,'' ensuring that computer searches for Riggs accounts with the name ''Pinochet'' would not find them. While banking at Riggs, the general also went by the names Ramon Ugarte and Daniel Lopez, two of the aliases that General Pinochet's financial and legal advisers said he used.
 General Pinochet became a Riggs client in 1985, according to bank records. Before that, he apparently used Citibank. ''In 1964, my father opened an account at Citibank, which was closed in the 1980's,'' one of the general's sons, Marco Antonio, said in a recent interview with a Chilean newspaper. ''In 1984, that bank asked him to close the account, saying that they no longer wanted to have him as a client.'' Citigroup, Citibank's parent company, declined to comment. 
 Riggs seemed less concerned about doing business with the dictator. When the bank reviewed the propriety of maintaining the general's accounts after his arrest in Chile in 2001, a memo prepared for Steven B. Pfeiffer, a Riggs board member, observed that the general's indictment ''describes with excruciating detail in over 270 pages the facts and lists thousands of people who were assassinated, tortured or disappeared during Mr. Pinochet's tenure.'' Still, Riggs kept the accounts open. 
 Some of the Riggs funds, according to Senate records, were registered in the Bahamas under two corporate shells, the Althorp Investment Company and Ashburton Company Ltd. The mailing address for one of the general's Riggs accounts, it turns out, is a park in downtown Santiago, across the street from military headquarters.
 WHILE Riggs threw various cloaks around the general's accounts, the spigots filling them have drawn renewed scrutiny in Chile. In addition to the outsized fees and honorariums that General Pinochet may have received from his activities abroad, Chilean officials are now examining whether the general expropriated large sums from government ''reserved expenditure'' accounts used to carry out covert operations and investigations. General Pinochet's supporters, including members of his own family, have suggested that the reserves may be legitimate sources of the Riggs funds, but others say no.
 ''If, as some have maintained, one source of Pinochet's wealth is reserved expenditure accounts of the army or the presidency, then we are facing an extreme irregularity,'' said Mr. Letelier, the head of the congressional commission. ''Reserved expenditures have to do with policy actions, and in no case can the person in charge of the military or the presidency just stick that money in a drawer or in his own pocket. That is absolutely illegal.''
 The Chilean authorities are also focusing special attention on privatizations of former state-owned companies in sectors like steel, electricity, mining and telecommunications, with an eye to uncovering financial gains the general might have secured through those transactions.
 The most lucrative privatizations were from 1985 to 1990, when it was clear that the Pinochet government's days were numbered and when even some military officials questioned the wisdom of rapidly selling companies in industries vital to Chile's national security and economic well-being.
 Privatizations were largely controlled and overseen by a small group of senior Chilean military officials and civilian cabinet members and economic advisers, a number of whom later got shares and high-paying positions at the very companies they helped to privatize. Even the general's family rode the privatization wave.
 When General Pinochet seized power on Sept. 11, 1973, Julio Cesar Ponce Lerou was just one of many ambitious young Chileans; he had just graduated from forestry school. Today, he is one of Chile's richest people and president of a mining company that controls the some of the world's largest deposits of nitrates, iodine and other minerals and chemicals.
 Mr. Ponce Lerou's rise to wealth and prominence has all the trappings of a Horatio Alger tale -- with cozy family and government connections added to the mix. At the time of the coup, he was married to General Pinochet's daughter, Veronica, and at various times not long after, he was both president of the government agency that supervised the privatization of all state-owned companies and the military dictatorship's representative on the board of the company he now heads, called Soquimich.
 Mr. Ponce Lerou led a group of investors who acquired Soquimich at what investigators now describe as a rock-bottom price. After the fall of the Pinochet dictatorship and the restoration of democracy in 1990, an inquiry conducted by the comptroller general's office concluded that the state had sold parts of the Soquimich conglomerate for less than a third of their fair market values at the time.
 ''It is obvious that Ponce Lerou's family ties and public posts helped him to put together the prosperous economic state that he enjoys today,'' said Maria Olivia Monckeberg, author of ''The Looting of the Chilean State by the Economic Groups,'' a book that is a critical history of the Chilean privatizations. ''He created a network of relatives and business partners that came to occupy the highest posts in some of the most important state companies, not just Soquimich, but also the state-owned copper and steel companies.''
 As a result, Mr. Ponce Lerou, who did not respond to repeated requests for interviews, is among 38 Pinochet relatives whose business activities are being investigated by Chilean authorities in connection with possible money laundering and tax evasion. Also among those under scrutiny are General Pinochet's five children, who have various business interests of their own; his wife, who controls two important charities; as well as grandchildren, siblings and cousins.
 Mr. Ponce Lerou was first in the public eye in 1978, when he was 32. Despite his youth and inexperience, he was named president of a state-owned cellulose company that the military government planned to sell to private investors. Mr. Ponce Lerou guided the company through its privatization; thereafter, his rise was meteoric. In short order, he secured the presidency of two other major state-owned enterprises, and by 1983 was the general director of the agency in charge of supervising the privatization program.
 Later that year, though, Mr. Ponce Lerou resigned from all of his public posts, including the presidency of the board of Soquimich, after Chilean authorities charged him with ''illicit enrichment'' in connection with the acquisition of ranches and animal herds. He spent the next three years fighting the charges and was eventually acquitted. He then returned to the business world in time to partake in Soquimich's 1988 privatization.
 As head of Soquimich, Mr. Ponce Lerou has overseen the company's expansion into immensely profitable new lines of business. Other members of the various boards running the conglomerate include Mr. Ponce Lerou's brother; Gen. Guillermo Letelier Skinner, Mr. Ponce Lerou's former deputy at the state development agency; and Hernan Buchi Buc, who, as Chile's economic minister in the late 1980's, played the main role in determining which groups would be awarded control of state companies being privatized, including Soquimich.
 Today, Soquimich's shareholders include foreign investors like the Bank of New York and Citigroup. But the largest block of stock remains in the hands of a holding company called Pampa Calichera, which Mr. Ponce Lerou controls. 
 Mr. Montes, the Chilean congressman examining irregularities in the privatization process, said Soquimich was only one of several companies being investigated. Another privatization that Mr. Montes is reviewing involves one of Chile's largest companies -- an electricity giant called Enersis, on whose board Mr. Ponce Lerou also served.
 Chile privatized Enersis in 1988; a year later the company snapped up a large stake in another Chilean electricity concern, solidifying its presence in the electricity market. In 1997, a Spanish company, Endesa, paid $1.5 billion for 29 percent of Enersis -- a sale that enriched the company's chief executive, Jose Yuraszeck Troncoso, and six other senior Enersis executives who, according to press accounts at the time, were collectively paid about $350 million for a special class of shares they owned.
 Other Chilean investors complained that Enersis executives ceded too much to Endesa in exchange for a lucrative payoff. El Mercurio labeled the transaction ''the scandal of the century.'' 
 Mr. Yuraszeck had been involved in privatizing Enersis as a member of the Pinochet government before he secured Enersis shares for himself and joined the company. Public disapproval of the Endesa deal forced Mr. Yuraszeck to resign, and Chilean securities regulators initially fined him the modest sum of $34,000 for failing to adequately supervise the transaction. In July, however, he and others were fined $75 million, a penalty he is now appealing.
 In an interview, Mr. Yuraszeck denied any wrongdoing and said he had made no donations to General Pinochet. His Enersis profits, he said, were entirely proper because the company's management had guided it through a large and successful expansion. ''Everyone did well'' as a result of the sale to Spanish interests, he said. ''Some did better than others, but all shareholders prospered.''
 But Mr. Montes said government examiners believe that Enersis was originally sold to private owners, including Mr. Yuraszeck, at far below its market value and that the transaction was far from transparent.
 MR. YURASZECK was not the only member of the Pinochet government to join Enersis. Carlos Caceres, a former senior minister in the government whose signature appears as a witness on General Pinochet's 1989 financial statement, served on the Enersis board in the late 1990's. Mr. Caceres, along with two other prominent Chilean businessmen, Hernan Guiloff and Hernan Briones, became important financial supporters of General Pinochet when he was arrested in Britain in 1998, according to The Financial Times.
 Mr. Caceres, Mr. Guiloff and Mr. Briones declined to comment about their relationship with General Pinochet or the nature of the Chilean privatizations. Mr. Briones is the director of the Pinochet Foundation, a charitable body; Mr. Guiloff and Mr. Caceres are members of its board.
 On its Web site, the foundation states that its mission is the promotion of the general's legacy and the preservation of Chilean culture and history. When the United States Senate released its report on Riggs in July, spokesmen for the Pinochet Foundation and the general's lawyers said that one source of the former dictator's wealth was ''donations'' from grateful businessmen. The businessmen's identities were not specified.
 Mr. Montes said in an interview that he and his investigators face high hurdles in carrying out their examinations of the Pinochet-era privatizations. He and his team would not be the first to have such problems. In the early 1990's, after General Pinochet was forced to step down as president but while he still commanded the armed forces, the Chilean government began an inquiry into the privatization process. But that examination was quietly shelved after some investigators were beaten by assailants who were never identified and other investigators received threats over the telephone.
 ''I can't tell you the magnitude of what went on'' in the privatization process, ''because we do not yet have all the information we need to be able to determine that,'' Mr. Montes said. ''Just to be able to get an organized investigation going is an achievement,'' given that vital records of the privatizations have yet to be found, he added.
 ''They should exist,'' he said. ''But if they do, they are scattered all over, so we have not yet been able to do even a basic inventory or a registry of what happened.''
 Whatever the challenges of the past, the scandal has given fresh impetus to those seeking a full accounting of the financial underbelly of the Pinochet era. Even the general's closest family members are not off limits, something that was unthinkable just a few years ago.
 Some members of the Chilean Congress are calling for an investigation into two charitable groups, the Center for Mothers and the September Foundation. General Pinochet's wife, Lucia Hiriart, has headed both organizations. She also figures prominently in the investigation of possible money laundering at Riggs and is a Pinochet Foundation board member. Other members of Congress are demanding inquiries as to whether one of the general's daughters, also named Lucia, pressured the state insurance agency to steer contracts to companies associated with her and then diverted profits from those deals into an offshore account.
 Another unresolved financial controversy involving the Pinochet family is known as the ''Pinochecks scandal.'' In the last phase of the dictatorship, General Pinochet authorized government payments totaling more than $3 million to another son, Augusto Jr., to buy him out of a failing arms company -- sparing the son from large financial losses.
 But when the civilian government that later came to power ordered a full investigation of the deal, military troops swarmed the streets and threatened a rebellion. Eventually, the inquiry was shelved and no action was taken against Augusto Jr. 
 Augusto Jr., who at one time trademarked his father's name for use on branded credit cards and wines called ''Captain General'' and ''Don Augusto,'' was recently convicted of fraud in a case involving stolen cars.
 For General Pinochet himself, the days when his name might have graced a fine bottle of wine have passed. Instead, his name is now more closely associated with a once prominent United States bank: Riggs. 
 ''What's really interesting about it is that Pinochet said that what he did he did to save the country and he said he was not simultaneously looting the treasury; he said he was the honest dictator,'' said the writer Ariel Dorfman, a Chilean exile who is a professor at Duke University. ''But looting, and hiding the loot, is deeply ingrained in dictatorships.''

HEADLINE: With Hockey Fans Silent, the N.H.L.'s Players Union Shows It Is Listening

BYLINE: By SELENA ROBERTS. 
E-mail: selenasports@nytimes.com

 BODY:
DURING his savvy strategy of passivity, Commissioner Gary Bettman could let public apathy do the devil's work for him as the National Hockey League spiraled silently toward its third month of a lockout.
 He didn't have to belittle his league, not when a poll in The Hockey News revealed that only 56 percent of Americans even knew the N.H.L. had faded to black. He didn't have to rail about the gluttony of players, not when the lunch-pail fan base already blamed the catered-to stars.
 Bettman could preserve his voice of doom when others were speaking volumes. As the Coyotes' Brett Hull recently told The Arizona Republic, ''I think there's no question that the fans are going to lose interest because the game that's not being played right now wasn't that exciting to begin with.'' As an editorial in The Globe and Mail of Toronto on Nov. 6 explained: ''By locking down major league hockey nearly a month ago, you've shown us something. We can live without it.'' 
 For weeks, this public indifference was Bettman's leverage, with fan silence as his support system. How could the union protect the box-office salaries of its stars when the box office didn't have a line of fans panting to get in? How could the union justify A-list money to a Ranger like Bobby Holik if his celebrity couldn't swing him a table at Nobu?
 The union boss Bob Goodenow had to do something to undermine Bettman's ability to parlay the N.H.L.'s irrelevance into a negotiating tool. On Thursday, Goodenow stirred up the suffocating dead air by unveiling an offer that rippled with shock value.
 Salary rollbacks, Goodenow proclaimed. To his credit, it was a monster concession from the union, perking up jaded followers who had wondered if the union possessed an ounce of economic or social awareness. 
 Suddenly, Goodenow had placed players in the same sort of sacrificial roles as the union pilots across the United States who had absorbed pay cuts to keep airlines flying. And he had turned players into sympathetic symbols instead of examples of excess by putting 24 percent of each goon, rookie and journeyman's salary into the pockets of beleaguered owners. 
 ''Let me be clear on this,'' Goodenow said. ''This is no grandstanding ploy. This is no P.R. move.''
 This denial was glorious, one dripping with grandstanding moves and this simple P.R. ploy: rouse the dormant fan base while putting the pressure on Bettman to counter with a good-faith proposal when bargaining resumes Tuesday.
 It's a smooth move by Goodenow on the surface because his celebrated plan begs for attention but does not address the one systemic issue Bettman covets most: cost certainty, as in a potential salary cap. 
 Goodenow's calculated offer preys on the quick-fix addictions of undisciplined owners who, with a little extra money in their wallets, will only toss it into a wishing well of roster stars.
 The union's blueprint for a resolution does nothing to eliminate payroll disparity between the league's big spenders and its coupon clippers. Goodenow has proposed a luxury tax, but it is certain to be ignored by icon collectors like the yachtsman and Rangers overseer James L. Dolan, providing an uneven playing field when a romantic small-market team like Calgary tries to re-sign its beloved Jarome Iginla.
 The union did not move toward Bettman's cost-certainty-or-bust mandate, but Goodenow did move in the right direction by recognizing, if begrudgingly, the fragile financial state of a niche league. With a third of the season vanished, the union finally acknowledged the league's dire fiscal reports, ledgers it once bashed as fuzzy math.
 Why the wait for a revelation? Perhaps the union leadership didn't count on the protracted public apathy toward the N.H.L. in the United States and especially in, of all places, Canada, where baby booties have skate blades. 
 It seems Canadians are a lot like the Whos of Whoville: After the N.H.L. leaders slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant, and took every Modano, Sakic and Wade Redden, Canadians gathered around the ice rinks, the big and the small, and watched junior league hockey without commercialism at all.
 ''What's not to like?'' The Globe and Mail said to its readers. ''Some might call it reconnecting with the simple pleasures. Some might call it a return to reality. It turns out that reality is not such a bad place. Even on a Saturday night.''
 This contentment with the true meaning of hockey has been working against the union because it validated the owners' argument that player salaries are out of line and out of touch with the league's reality.
 The public wasn't arguing. For months, this was Bettman's leverage. Unlike N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern, who will probably use the league's Ron Artest image issues against the union during its collective bargaining, Bettman hasn't had to sully his league to court public opinion.
 Who was in Goodenow's corner? The baseball union god Donald Fehr -- one of the more polarizing leaders in sports. With the lockout dragging, Goodenow had no time for a hard-line Fehrism. He needed to reach out to the owners and, just as important, to the N.H.L.'s alienated loyalists. 
 He responded with a salary-slashing deal that ignored the core issues but provided a moment that hard-working fans could embrace and that even Bettman could appreciate.
 ''The magnitude of the rollback is what you need to get our economics back in line as a starting point,'' Bettman said. ''To me, it's an acknowledgment of our economics.''
 For Goodenow, it was an acknowledgment of the quiet reality that public indifference had become Bettman's ally.

HEADLINE: Mystery Cloaks Firing of Iranian Couple

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: MORGANTOWN, W.Va. 

 BODY:
May 5, the day that changed Aliakbar and Shahla Afshari's lives, began like most others. They shared coffee, dropped their 12-year-old son off at Cheat Lake Middle School here, then drove to their laboratories at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a federal agency that studies workplace hazards.
 But that afternoon, their managers pulled the Afsharis aside and delivered a stunning message: they had failed secret background checks and were being fired. No explanations were offered and no appeals allowed. They were escorted to the door and told not to return.
 Mrs. Afshari, a woman not prone to emotional flourishes, says she stood in the parking lot and wept. ''I just wanted to know why,'' she said. 
 Seven months later, the Afsharis, Shiite Muslims who came from Iran 18 years ago to study, then stayed to build careers and raise three children, still have no answers. 
 They have been told they were fired for national security reasons that remain secret. When their lawyer requested the documents used to justify the action, he was told none existed. When he asked for copies of the agency's policies relating to the background checks, he received a generic personnel handbook. 
 Without any official explanations of why they failed their background checks, they came up with their own theory: their attendance, more than five years ago, at two conventions of a Persian student association that has come under F.B.I. scrutiny, once with a man who was later investigated by the bureau.
 The Afsharis' case comes at time when immigrants from many nations, but particularly Islamic ones, are facing tougher scrutiny from government agencies. 
 Unable to clear their names or find new employment in their field, the Afsharis on Thursday resorted to that most American of recourses: they sued the institute and its parent agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services, demanding back pay and reinstatement or the chance to appeal. 
 The Afsharis, who passed background checks when they were hired -- he in 1996, she in 1997 -- were not even aware of the new reviews until they were told that they had failed.
 In their suit, they do not question the government's right to conduct background checks. But their lawyers contend that the Kafkaesque nature of the process -- in which the rules were unclear and perhaps unwritten -- has made it impossible for them to defend themselves.
 ''How can we expect the people of the Middle East to emulate our democratic ideals abroad when we fail to apply those ideals to people like the Afsharis here?'' asked Allan N. Karlin, a lawyer in Morgantown who, along with chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union in West Virginia and Washington, is representing the couple.
 The Centers for Disease Control has said the Afsharis were not singled out because of their ethnic background, asserting that other Iranians and Muslims have faced similar background checks and passed. The agency also notes that the couple, who are not citizens and do not have protected Civil Service status, could have been fired at any time.
 But the agency has declined to say anything else about the case and did not respond to questions about its policies on background checks. ''All I can say is the Afsharis are no longer employed by C.D.C.,'' said a spokeswoman, Kathryn Harben. 
 Federal employees have always faced routine background checks, typically when they are hired. But experts say that since the Sept. 11 attacks, checks at certain agencies, including the disease control centers, have become more frequent and tougher as the government attempts to identify potential security leaks or spies with access to classified or dangerous materials.
 Those tougher checks seem to have focused on immigrants from certain countries. A C.D.C. document obtained by the Afsharis shows that the recent background checks on them were ordered because they came from a ''threat'' country, Iran.
 But what is most confounding to the Afsharis is how the government could consider them threats in the first place. Neither had access to classified documents or worked with banned biological or chemical toxins. 
 Moreover, none of their research was secret, much of it having been published in scholarly journals or presented at academic conferences.
 Mr. Afshari, 52, who has a doctorate in industrial engineering, built equipment to study the health effects of things like asphalt fumes, human saliva and dust particles. One of his inventions helped analyze the sound of the human cough. He also worked with commercially available lasers and ultrasound equipment.
 Mrs. Afshari, 43, who has a master's degree in occupational health and safety, worked in a laboratory that researched allergic reactions to common items like latex gloves and hand cleansers. 
 Handling classified documents or banned toxins requires a higher security clearance than the Afsharis possessed. Indeed, neither of them had ever applied for such clearances, which entail more intensive background investigations than the standard checks conducted on most federal workers.
 Paradoxically, federal law grants people who apply for such clearances more rights than the Afsharis were given, experts say. Under cold-war-era regulations, people who fail such clearances can request internal documents explaining the reasons and are entitled to hearings where they can present a defense. 
 ''What we have here is a brand-new, ad hoc, secret system,'' said Kate Martin, director of the Center for National Security Studies, a civil liberties group, referring to the checks that led to the firings.
 Friends and former colleagues say the Afsharis, though practicing Shiites who shun alcohol and worry about the permissiveness of American society, are anything but religious firebrands.
 Mr. Afshari, a gregarious, chatty, bearlike man, was known to bring kosher turkeys to Thanksgiving dinners at Jewish homes and spend weekends repairing colleagues' cars for nothing. When his daughter, Azadeh, now 22 and a first-year student at West Virginia University's dental school here, decided to stop wearing a head scarf a few years ago, he did not protest, friends said.
 The Afsharis' two eldest children, who were born in Iran but consider themselves Americans, have become well-known figures in Morgantown. Azadeh was a dean's list student, a campus government leader and a finalist for homecoming queen last year. Her brother Hamed, 21, a senior at the university, is also an honor student and a member of the student government. Their youngest child, Amin, 12, was born in America.
 Robert C. Creese, a professor of engineering who was Mr. Afshari's doctoral adviser at West Virginia University, described Mr. Afshari as a pacifist who was appalled by the devastation wrought by Iran's decade-long war with Iraq. Mr. Afshari's younger brother was killed by mustard gas in that conflict. 
 ''I fear a serious mistake has been made by C.D.C.,'' Dr. Creese said in one of nearly two dozen letters delivered to the agency that former colleagues have written to protest the Afsharis' firings.
 The Afsharis contend that their only link to the student group under federal scrutiny, the Muslim Students Association (Persian Speaking Group), is that they took their children to national conventions in Chicago in December 1998 and Washington in December 1999. 
 Senior officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including the former director Louis J. Freeh, have said the group, sometimes referred to by the Farsi name Anjoman Islamie, is made up largely of anti-American fanatics, maintains close ties to the government of Iran and has been used as a front for Iranian intelligence. But it is not on the State Department's list of banned foreign terrorist organizations, and it operates openly in the United States. 
 The Persian student group is independent of the larger Muslim Students Association, a mainly Sunni group.
 To the Afsharis, the conventions were an opportunity to speak Persian, eat Iranian food, attend workshops on Islam and meet other Iranian-Americans at a time of the year when many Americans were celebrating Christmas.
 ''We loved it because it was a chance to meet kids from our culture,'' Azadeh Afshari said. ''We pushed our parents to go.''
 Mr. Afshari said the F.B.I. became aware of his family's trips to the conventions after an agent interviewed him in late 2001 about an Iranian friend, a graduate student who had been active in the association. The man, Shahab Ghasemzadeh, was deported for immigration violations last year, Mr. Karlin, the Afsharis' lawyer, said. 
 In a statement to an immigration court last year, an F.B.I. agent said Mr. Ghasemzadeh ''may pose a long-term threat'' to the United States because of his association with Anjoman Islamie. As evidence, the agent said Mr. Ghasemzadeh had attended the group's conventions (he went to one of them with the Afsharis), and had helped Iranian-Americans vote in Iranian elections. 
 It remains unclear if Mr. Afshari's friendship with Mr. Ghasemzadeh was the reason he failed the background check. But if it was, the Afsharis' lawyers say, his firing would be a case of guilt by association and a violation of the First Amendment rights they enjoy as legal permanent residents.
 ''This looks suspiciously like the witch hunts of the 50's, this time targeted against Muslim Americans,'' Ms. Martin of the Center for National Security Studies said.
 Two weeks ago, Mr. Afshari's unemployment benefits ran out. He has not found work, and the family is now living on savings and credit cards. Mrs. Afshari has begun dental school with Azadeh but says she does not know if they can afford the tuition.
 Mr. Afshari has become sullen and withdrawn, his children said. Though his father in Iran is ill, Mr. Afshari has decided not to visit him, fearing he will not be allowed to return to the United States.
 ''Everybody has a sense of pride about their parents,'' Hamed Afshari said, breaking into tears. ''And then someone disrespects them like that and it hurts so bad because there is nothing you can do.''
 The case has also affected the Afsharis' friends, who say they remain mystified and angry about the way the couple has been treated.
 ''I've told Ali's story to a lot of people,'' said Travis Goldsmith, a computer engineer who worked with Mr. Afshari. ''They don't believe that this could happen in this country.''

HEADLINE: A Chance for Baseball to Settle Its Drug Score

BYLINE: This article was reported by Lee Jenkins, Juliet Macur and Bill Pennington and written by Mr. Jenkins.

 BODY:
During a year that baseball would like to forget, the scene was set for its free fall. Players had testified in front of a federal grand jury about their drug use, revealing the sport's dirty underbelly. In the clubhouses, players could access piles of stimulants as if they were candy, according to the founder of the players union.
 Major League Baseball wanted a mandatory drug-testing policy, but the players union balked. The commissioner took a hard-line stance, proclaiming, ''We've got to eliminate illegal substances from the game.'' The consequences were grave. Players died because of their drug abuse.
 But this is not a description of baseball in 2004, when a steroid scandal continues to sully the sport and high-profile players like Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi are essentially accused of cheating. It is a portrait of baseball in 1985, when a different drug scandal -- this one involving cocaine -- shook the sport. 
 Now, as baseball finds itself struggling to control the steroid issue, its past serves as a cautionary tale: the sport has come face to face with drugs before and failed to act because of reluctance by the union and because of owners unwilling to point fingers at their own players.
 ''This was all exposed back in 1985,'' said J. Alan Johnson, who as a United States attorney in Pittsburgh prosecuted the cocaine case, in which 19 major leaguers testified or were implicated and in which one person, Curtis Strong, a caterer, was convicted of selling cocaine to players. ''I thought what we did was going to have a big impression. I always assumed that baseball was going to do something, but the ball was really in their court. Certainly, we now have another problem, and even though the drugs are different, it is basically the same subject.''
 Peter V. Ueberroth, the baseball commissioner in 1985, pushed for a strict drug-testing policy as a result of the Pittsburgh case, and 11 players were suspended for cocaine use. But no such policy ever emerged. 
 This time, after reports of the testimony of Bonds and Giambi in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative steroid distribution case, Commissioner Bud Selig is trying to put in a testing policy similar to the one used in baseball's minor leagues. The new testing regimen, though, may still not be as tough as the ones employed by the Olympics or by the National Football League, and it still may not include drugs like amphetamines or cocaine.
 In the 19 years since the Pittsburgh trial, baseball paid little more than lip service to its drug issues. But in 2002, as reports of steroid use mounted, the players union and the owners finally agreed to the sport's first mandatory drug testing. The collective bargaining agreement stipulated that testing for steroids in the first year, 2003, would be conducted anonymously and without penalties, and that if more than 5 percent of the players tested positive, a somewhat tougher policy -- with penalties and possible disclosure of violators' names -- would be put in for 2004 and 2005.
 Five percent to 7 percent of the 2003 tests were positive, and baseball entered the next phase of the program. Still, as players testified in the Balco case and the public outcry grew, Selig renewed calls for a tougher policy, and the union agreed to consider reopening the drug clause in the labor agreement that expires at the end of 2006.
 The Major League Baseball Players Association, the most powerful union in professional sports, had never agreed to reopen a clause. That it appears ready to do so now and, in conjunction with Selig, to toughen drug-testing measures indicates that steroid use has the attention of everyone in baseball. 
 ''A lot of people have turned a blind eye to this for a long time, but it's a people issue,'' said pitcher Al Leiter, who has been active in the union throughout his 19-year major league career. ''It's about health. It's about the commissioner not having a grieving widowed wife in his office saying, 'Why didn't you do something?'''
 Leiter's comments reveal why today's circumstances appear to be different from those in 1985. Players generally did not lobby for the prohibition of recreational drugs in the mid-1980's. But steroids are believed to change the competitive balance in the game, and many major leaguers are pushing for more testing because they are tired of playing on an uneven field. If the union is to represent a majority opinion of the players -- and one can assume that most players are not taking steroids -- there is reason to believe that stricter testing is in the members' interest.

The Will to Crack Down
 Drug testing in baseball was first seriously proposed in 1983, after as many as 20 players representing nine teams were implicated in a cocaine case in Kansas City, Mo. That case led to federal prison terms for four Royals players from that season: Willie Wilson, Willie Aikens, Jerry Martin and Vida Blue.
 In 1984, when Bowie Kuhn was commissioner, the owners and the players reached an agreement on reasonable-cause testing: an owner could have a player tested if there was reasonable cause to believe he was taking drugs. The focus of the agreement was cocaine; marijuana, amphetamines and alcohol were excluded. But the owners, who were reluctant to test their own players and unable to persuade the union to agree to testing, threw out the policy in October 1985.
 Oddly, the same clause was resuscitated in the 2002 collective bargaining agreement, and owners have been just as leery of using it.
 ''When I finally got sober and came out of treatment, the first thing I said was, 'Why haven't I ever been drug-tested?''' said Dickie Noles, one of the major league players identified as cocaine users at the Pittsburgh trial in 1985. ''All my friends told me, 'If anybody should be tested, it should be you.'
 ''I still feel that drug testing is the greatest deterrent to using drugs. Without a proper policy, you're looking at insanity. I can't say enough about what the union has done for me, but come on, let's take the lawyer mentality out of this. Far too many players have ruined their careers not to put a strong drug policy in place. It's appalling to me. Everyone else has one. Why not us?''
 Marvin Miller, the founder and executive director of the players union for 18 years, says he remembers walking through various clubhouses and seeing uppers and downers laid out ''like jelly beans'' by club employees.
 ''Who supplied them?'' Miller asked. ''Certainly not the players union. We didn't make much progress in the early 1980's because it wasn't seen as an issue. The owners definitely weren't pushing it. You take one look at the history of this and any reasonable person would conclude that they are just playing to the gallery with this idea that they want stricter testing.''
 From 1986 until 2002, about the only way a team could take recourse was if a player was arrested on drug charges. Several New York baseball stars, including Dwight Gooden, Darryl Strawberry and Steve Howe, were in and out of drug rehabilitation, but their teams could never test them. When Howe was suspended in 1992 after a drug-related arrest, the union fought the decision by Fay Vincent, then the baseball commissioner.
 ''The issue was very difficult,'' Vincent said. ''They came at you from all sides. I tried, I think we all tried, to do something about a written drug policy. But there was never anything written.''
 Major league executives, whose teams were often torn apart by drug use, had the least power to act. Ballard Smith was president of the San Diego Padres when they advanced to the 1984 World Series. Two key players on the team, Alan Wiggins and Eric Show, developed addictions. They were let go and later died as a result of their drug abuse.
 ''The will just wasn't there to do anything about it,'' Smith said. ''Drugs really cost our team, but apparently they weren't big enough to where it was costing the other owners. Right or wrong, the drugs were perceived as not affecting performance, not affecting winning or losing, and not affecting economic implications. Baseball was treated like any other business. If it doesn't hurt you economically, why bother to change it? I have thought a lot about this recently, and I hope fans are getting upset. This is a real opportunity for baseball to solve a common problem.''

Government Involvement
 If players and owners cannot come together now, the federal government may try to force them. President Bush mentioned steroids and baseball in his State of the Union address last January and put one of his closest associates, Roland Betts, in charge of monitoring summertime discussions between Selig and Donald Fehr, the executive director of the union. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, promised on Dec. 3 to introduce legislation if baseball did not have a new drug-testing policy in January.
 Other legislators have also shown an inclination to intervene. Two Republican congressmen, John E. Sweeney of New York and Tom Osborne of Nebraska, were among the co-sponsors of a bill that became law in October. It amends the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990, controlling the use and sale of such steroidlike substances as androstenedione. In 1998, Mark McGwire admitted to using androstenedione while breaking the single-season home run record long held by Roger Maris. 
 ''I don't think this issue is as important as Social Security or tax issues or the military,'' said Osborne, formerly the football coach at the University of Nebraska. ''But I think the president mentioning steroids in his State of the Union address was unprecedented, so our involvement is going to be unprecedented.''
 Osborne said he recently received a thank-you note from Selig, underscoring the relationship between baseball and the government. Major League Baseball leads every professional league when it comes to donations to candidates and political parties, and it outspent the next closest league in payments to lobbyists by about $3.5 million from 1997 through 2000.

Merely a Bluff?
 According to the Web site of the Center for Responsive Politics, Major League Baseball and its players union collectively spent $5,341,834 on lobbyists during those years. Those lobbyists have worked on influencing legislation relating to issues like antitrust matters, steroids, Internet gambling and tax-exempt financing of stadiums, according to lobbying disclosure forms.
 In that same time frame, the N.F.L. was the next biggest spender, paying $1,660,000 to lobbyists. The National Basketball Association paid $500,000.
 Through Nov. 22, a political action committee formed by the commissioner's office donated $368,850 to political candidates this year. Those receiving the most money were Republicans: Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky, a former major league pitcher; House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois; and Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which oversees antitrust legislation. 
 Selig has personally contributed $44,5000 to political campaigns since 1996, including $40,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. On the union side, Fehr has individually contributed $18,756 in that time, including $3,000 to McCain.
 Still, Sweeney is among those threatening to repeal baseball's antitrust exemption if the sport does not come through on a tougher drug program. Congress has dangled the antitrust exemption over baseball's head before, especially during work stoppages, but has always left it alone.
 ''That's sort of the nuclear warhead of it all,'' Sweeney said. ''We don't want to go to the absolute extreme, but we'll hang it out there.''
 Miller dismisses such contentions as ''the biggest bluffs I have ever seen.'' He said it would be unconstitutional to demand testing of only major league players and implausible to believe that Congress could impose penalties.
 ''It would be like having legislation just for African-Americans,'' Miller said.
 Union stalwarts would prefer to let the existing drug policy play out and evaluate it after the collective bargaining agreement expires in 2006, but they seem to be in the minority. Many of the most outspoken players, politicians and baseball executives are lobbying for change in the wake of a scandal that continues to unfold.
 Baseball has changed in the past 20 years, and so has its drug of choice, but the sport's ultimate test remains virtually the same.

HEADLINE: In Taiwan Ballot, Ties With Beijing Seem to Be a Winner

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing for this article.

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Dec. 11 

 BODY:
Supporters of closer relations with Beijing won a surprise victory in legislative elections here on Saturday, as voters appeared to reject President Chen Shui-bian's increasingly forceful calls in the past two weeks for greater Taiwanese independence from mainland China.
 The success of the Nationalist Party and its allies, the People First Party and the New Party, in preserving their slim majority in the legislature could reverse some of the rising hostility lately between Taiwan and the mainland. 
 The Nationalists and their allies have vowed to block President Chen's plans to write a new constitution for the island and take other actions that Beijing has labeled as provocative and possibly leading to war.
 ''It will be much more difficult for him'' to pursue his agenda, said Wu Chih-chung, a political expert at Dongwu University here. ''The tensions between Taiwan and China will be reduced.'' 
 In Beijing, there was no immediate comment from the Chinese government on the election. 
 Washington has been increasingly critical of President Chen's efforts to pursue more of the trappings of independence. But the success of the Nationalist Party's coalition could pose new headaches: unlike President Chen, the Nationalists have been very reluctant to approve the purchase of $18 billion in weapons that President Bush offered the island in 2001 to defend itself against the mainland.
 The Nationalists have questioned the size and cost of the purchase, and have suggested that not all the surveillance and antimissile systems may be needed if relations with the mainland can be improved.
 Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province ever since the Nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek fled to the island after losing China's civil war to the Communists in 1949.
 The loss by candidates of President Chen's Democratic Progressive Party is especially significant because it comes after nearly two decades of steadily rising support for pro-independence candidates.
 President Chen took personal responsibility for the defeat as his party's chairman. The party's secretary general and two deputy secretaries general submitted their resignations, to be considered at a meeting of the party leadership on Tuesday.
 ''The result did not meet our expectations, and we deeply regret this,'' President Chen said at a news conference Saturday night. 
 Nationalist supporters spent the evening waving flags and lighting celebratory firecrackers outside the party's headquarters. Lien Chan, the party chairman, said the outcome represented a vindication of the party's position on Beijing.
 ''We call on Chen Shui-bian to respect public opinion,'' he said, also warning that the vote would make it difficult to proceed with the purchase of American weapons, which he criticized as overpriced.
 Democratic Progressive officials said campaign decisions had hurt them. Chang Chun-hsing, the party's secretary general, said the party had nominated too many candidates in many multiseat districts, so the candidates took votes from each other. 
 Lee Ying-yuan, one of two deputy secretaries general, said party supporters in these districts had voted in such large numbers for their party's weaker candidates that the strong candidates got too few votes.
 The defeat ''is more technical than policy,'' Mr. Lee said in an interview. He added that although he expected President Chen to try to proceed with plans to rewrite the constitution in the next several years, the election results would make it harder for the president to carry out his agenda.
 Voters did seem leery of angering Beijing. ''We should focus more on the economy,'' said Kevin Chang, a 30-year-old bank worker, after he voted Saturday morning. 
 Trade with the mainland has propelled a vigorous economic recovery here this year, and business people broadly favor a more conciliatory Taiwanese stance.
 Since taking office in May 2000, President Chen has repeatedly antagonized Beijing by suggesting that two separate countries now exist and by holding a national referendum here on China's growing deployments of missiles aimed at the island. 
 But the Nationalist coalition's two-seat majority in the 225-member legislature has prevented President Chen and his governing Democratic Progressive Party from giving Taiwan the formal trappings of an independent state.
 For months, polls had suggested that the Democratic Progressives and their smaller and more radical ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, would claim a majority in the new legislature.
 But in the final weeks of the campaign, politics within the pro-independence bloc took an alarming turn for President Chen. Frustrated that he had not moved even faster toward independence after winning a second term last March, many hard-line advocates of independence began switching their support to the Taiwan Solidarity Union.
 President Chen's own senior adviser for international affairs, Lai Shin-yuan, resigned from his administration and ran successfully for the legislature on Saturday as a Taiwan Solidarity Union candidate.
 President Chen responded by moving away from the political center, even though polls have long shown that a substantial majority of voters are reluctant to jeopardize the status quo with the mainland. In the past week, President Chen and the Democratic Progressive Party called daily for dropping China from the names of state-owned enterprises and replacing it with Taiwan, and for using Taiwan in the name of the economic and cultural offices that it maintains in more than 70 countries that do not recognize it diplomatically, including the United States.
 President Chen stopped short of embracing the Taiwan Solidarity Union's position that the island should change its official name from Republic of China to Republic of Taiwan. But his new position nonetheless upset the State Department in Washington, which criticized him for endangering the status quo.
 Defying the criticism, President Chen urged voters on Friday to call their country ''Taiwan'' and to stand up to foreign pressure.
 President Chen's last-minute tilt was partly successful: while polls just a few days ago showed the Taiwan Solidarity Union expanding its delegation in the legislature to as many as 20, from 13 in the last election, the final vote on Saturday showed that the party wound up with only 12 seats.
 But the Democratic Progressive Party fared much worse than expected, picking up only 2 seats, to claim 89. The Nationalist Party gained 11 seats, for a total of 79, while the even more pro-Beijing People First Party lost 12 seats, retaining only 34, and the New Party kept its only seat. Independents maintained their 10 seats.

HEADLINE: The Anti-Anti-Americans

BYLINE: By Jonathan Tepperman

 BODY:
WITHIN months of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, the global surge of sympathy for the United States began to ebb. Before the invasion of Iraq, London's Sunday Times reported that equal numbers of Britons ranked Saddam Hussein and George W. Bush as the top threat to world peace. In France, a book claiming that Washington itself had sponsored the 9/11 attacks became a huge best seller, and in Germany a full 20 percent of the population endorsed this view. 
 Three years and two wars later, attitudes toward America have hardened still further. A worldwide poll taken last March found that the United States' favorability ratings have fallen to critical levels, dropping precipitously in most West European countries and to 5 percent in Jordan. Meanwhile, in October, a columnist in The Guardian mused on the coming presidential election, ''John Wilkes Booth, Lee Harvey Oswald, John Hinckley Jr. -- where are you now?''
 When a columnist for a leading newspaper of a leading American ally seems openly to call for the assassination of a sitting president (the day after the election, Britain's Daily Mirror ran the headline, ''How Can 59,054,087 People Be So Dumb?''), it's time to start worrying. 
 Of late, a whole shelf of books has been published attempting to explain why people hate America so much. These works fall roughly into two categories: left-wing attacks on the United States, and attacks from the right on those who attack it. Think of the first group as the anti-Americans, and the second as the anti-anti-Americans. Just about all these two factions can agree on is that anti-Americanism, in one form or another, is almost as old as the country itself -- and that it has recently grown a lot worse.
 Consider first the views of the antis. Americans -- as the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier recently suggested in his inventive but maddening movie ''Dogville'' -- are, by turns, materialistic, ignorant, rapacious and brutal. Arundhati Roy, the Indian author of one good novel and many peevish essays, complains in her strident broadside, ''An Ordinary Person's Guide to Empire,'' that the United States suffers from a ''self-destructive impulse toward supremacy, stranglehold, global hegemony'' and is led by a genocidal coward who manipulates a craven press to do his bidding. 
 In less hysterical terms, the Washington-based British scholar Anatol Lieven laments (in his well-written and well-researched ''America Right or Wrong: An Anatomy of American Nationalism'') that Americans are excessively religious and nationalistic; worse, they seem determined to inflict their Old Testament values on the rest of the world. It's the ''self-congratulatory guff'' of this civilizational mission (in the words of Will Hutton, another British writer and the author of the cranky ''Declaration of Interdependence: Why America Should Join the World'') that drives many of the anti-Americans around the bend; if only the United States would act more like other countries -- especially those in kinder, gentler, more cosmopolitan Europe, Hutton says -- much of the resentment would dissipate.
 There is something to such arguments, at least the more moderate ones. It's not hard to see why the puritanical moralism of the United States and its vigorous pursuit of self-interest rubs both secular Europeans and impoverished Muslims the wrong way.
 The problem with the anti-Americans' complaints, however, is that they are often undermined by bad faith. Some of the critics have never even bothered to visit the United States. And even those who have (like Hutton) or who live here (like Lieven) frequently sound as though they haven't and don't. When Hutton fulminates that national democracy in the United States has descended to the level of ''pre-Enlightenment Europe,'' it becomes hard to take the rest of his charges seriously. And Lieven undermines his otherwise lucid writing when he insists that there is little tolerance for dissent in American public discourse. Has he not seen ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' or visited a newsstand lately? The venom and inaccuracy of such charges suggest that the anti-Americans are motivated by something more basic than disagreements over policy or the personality of a particular president.
 Also disturbing is the way many of these writers emphasize America's relationship with Israel. There's nothing wrong with complaining about Washington's strategy in the Middle East; reasonable people can disagree. But one should be skeptical of a writer like Lieven who refers to the pro-Israel lobby as having an ''iron grip'' on Washington or who labels a contemporary pro-Israeli Lebanese-American writer an ''Arab Josephus'' -- a comparison (to Flavius Josephus, the Hellenized Jewish historian of the ancient world often known for his cowardice and treachery) that manages to combine several layers of racial condescension in two words. Such language is not new; anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism have run together at least since the 1930's, when French writers denounced the avaricious United States as ''Uncle Shylock.'' But the modern anti-Americans would serve themselves better by taking care to untangle the two.
 Enter the anti-antis, who seize on these faults to mount a spirited counteroffensive. Three new books lead the charge: ''Hating America,'' a richly detailed if pedestrian chronicle of anti-Americanism through the ages by Barry and Judith Colp Rubin (two conservative Middle East experts); ''Understanding Anti-Americanism: Its Origins and Impact at Home and Abroad,'' a collection of polemical essays examining the phenomenon around the world, edited and introduced by Paul Hollander (a professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Massachusetts and himself the author of a book entitled ''Anti-Americanism''); and, the most idiosyncratic of the three, the wildly discursive and undisciplined ''Anti-Americanism,'' by Jean-Francois Revel, a rare pro-American member of the French Establishment, who fills in the picture from Paris.
 The three books are united by rage at America's enemies -- with a venom that mirrors the anti-Americans' own. In none of them, however, has the excess of spleen produced clarity, fair-mindedness or nuance. 
 The anti-antis reject their opposites' claim that the problem with America is its behavior or its president. Instead, they argue, America-bashing derives from more fundamental sources: the resentment of once-great societies eclipsed by Yankee upstarts, and of those unable to participate in America's bounty. As Revel writes, much of European ''anti-Americanism stems fundamentally from our continent's loss during the 20th century of its 600-year leadership role''; Bernard Lewis, writing about the Arab world, has made virtually the same claim. In Revel's terms, ''the principal function of anti-Americanism has always been, and still is, to discredit liberalism by discrediting its supreme incarnation,'' an argument that echoes President Bush's line that ''so long as we hold dear to our freedoms, the enemy will hate us, because they hate freedom.'' Or as Hollander puts it, ''The deepest and broadest source of anti-Americanism . . . is the aversion to (or, at best, ambivalence about) modernity, which the United States most strikingly represents.'' Add to this a few other ingredients -- ''a romantic as well as Marxist anti-capitalism . . . the personal and cultural problems peculiar to intellectuals; the specter of standardization and homogenization associated with the spread of American mass culture'' -- and the picture starts to seem complete.
 Anti-Americanism, in this view, also proves useful for covering up one's own shortcomings. French intellectuals, Revel says, focus on despising America so they can ignore their own blunders and console themselves for their loss of linguistic, cultural and political influence. Similarly, as Salman Rushdie wrote in 2002, Arab leaders use the United States as ''a smoke screen for Muslim nations' many defects -- their corruption, their incompetence, their oppression of their own citizens, their economic, scientific and cultural stagnation.'' Bashing Washington, the Rubins argue, is a convenient way for despotic and incompetent regimes to distract their subjects from the real source of their problems: the regimes themselves.
 Several of these points, like many of those made by the anti-Americans, ring true. If hatred of the United States is rational, why has it persisted for so many years in the face of different kinds of American behavior? As Revel says, the hallmark of fanaticism is ''the way it seizes on a certain behavior of the hated object and sweepingly condemns it, only to condemn with equal fervor the opposite behavior shortly after -- or even simultaneously.'' And, indeed, at various times, the United States has been roundly attacked -- often by the same people, and in similar language -- for being both too engaged in the world and not engaged enough. Anti-American Islamists almost always ignore recent United States action on behalf of Muslims in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia and elsewhere.
 That said, it beggars belief to argue, as these writers do, that anti-Americanism stems solely from the neuroses of its proponents, that there's no link at all between America-bashing and George W. Bush. How else to explain the unparalleled current intensity? 
 Like the anti-Americans, moreover, the anti-antis make their own mistakes in describing American society. Revel is so adamant about rebutting every French criticism of the United States that he mischaracterizes the country as profoundly as do Lieven or Hutton. This forces him into some bizarre contortions. He claims, for example, that there was nothing even slightly fishy about the 2000 presidential election, and that it's just as easy to get guns in Europe as in America (ignoring the point that Europeans seem to use them less). The Rubins, similarly, manage to discuss anti-Americanism in Chile without an examination of Washington's support for the 1973 coup there, an egregious and telling omission. 
 Even more disturbing is what the anti-antis advise for United States policy. Roger Kimball (the managing editor of The New Criterion magazine and a contributor to Hollander's book) insists that since anti-Americanism has nothing to do with American behavior, there's no reason to change that behavior. On the contrary, Kimball says, we must stay the course, for ''the current orgy of anti-Americanism, fanned by the war with Iraq, will dissipate in proportion to the resoluteness demonstrated by the United States.'' Not only is this unlikely; a damn-the-torpedoes approach of this sort would also be disastrous after three years of blunders in Iraq and elsewhere.
 So, finally, which side is right? Do they hate us for what we do or for what we are? Or for what they are? Once one has sorted through the careless polemics in both camps, the unsatisfying answer seems to be that neither side is right (entirely) or that both are right (in part). Roy, Lieven and Hutton exaggerate the United States' flaws and underplay the way the country gets damned for whatever it does. Revel, the Rubins and Hollander & Company minimize the country's very real problems and misdeeds. 
 Meanwhile, the Nov. 2 elections haven't helped clarify matters. When voters endorsed Bush for a second term, the difference between anti-Bushism and anti-Americanism abroad became harder to distinguish. That's not to say, however, that a Kerry victory would have resolved this question either. There's little doubt that Kerry would have turned a more conciliatory (even French-speaking) face to the world. If, as many anti-Americans insist, they are really only Bush-haters, the change in style could have mollified them; and it certainly would have deprived them of some ammunition. But on substance -- the future of Iraq, the Kyoto Protocols, the International Criminal Court, etc. -- Kerry's foreign policy would probably not have been much different from Bush's. Given the pressures on America abroad and the demands of the public at home, especially since 9/11 and the Iraq war, a modern president (whether Republican or Democratic) would have little leeway in foreign affairs.
 What this suggests is that the distinction between what the United States does and what it is may actually be less clear -- and less helpful -- than many of the anti-Americans imply. There is no point in wishing, as Hutton does, that the United States would suddenly start acting in a more ''European'' fashion.
 Which leads to a gloomy conclusion. A more conciliatory American tone in the years ahead might quiet the country's critics somewhat. But nothing Washington could realistically do would be likely to change the minds of those determined, for their own reasons, to hate it. Anti-Americanism is something we're stuck with for at least as long as America remains pre-eminent. Perhaps the most Americans can hope for is that the animosity won't intensify any time soon. But if it doesn't, that's probably only because, as all these books agree, it couldn't get much worse.

HEADLINE: Social Security Reform, With One Big Catch

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
OF all the arguments being made to replace part of Social Security with private retirement accounts, few are more seductive and more misleading than the prospect of earning higher returns.
 Get ready to hear a lot about this next week, when President Bush is host for a two-day economic conference that is expected to focus sharply on Social Security.
 Under the current system, investment returns from Social Security are ''abysmal,'' Mr. Bush said in one recent speech, because the trust fund is allowed to hold only low-yielding Treasury bonds. 
 Letting working people invest some of their Social Security money in the stock market would allow them to earn higher returns, giving them more money at retirement than they would have if they let the government do everything for them, the logic goes.
 It sounds like a no-lose proposition. According to the Social Security Administration, Treasury bonds can be expected to yield a real annual rate of return of about 3 percent. Equities, by contrast, can be expected to earn 6.5 percent.
 That assumption is crucial to arguments that personal accounts can reduce Social Security's long-term shortfall -- which the government estimates to be at least $3.5 trillion. Most of the proposals to overhaul Social Security call for steep reductions in future benefits that would be offset by the higher returns people would presumably earn on their investments. 
 Stephen Goss, the Social Security Administration's chief actuary, has endorsed the assumption of higher returns. In evaluating the major proposals for putting some payroll taxes into personal investment accounts, Mr. Goss estimated that even people who hedged their risk by mixing stocks and bonds could expect an average return of 4.45 percent.
 But that logic is as flawed as a perpetual motion machine. If it were true, the government could erase Social Security's entire projected deficit by selling bonds at 3 percent and buying stocks that yield 7 percent.
 Why doesn't the government do just that? Because higher returns are inseparable from higher risk. No risk, no reward. And if the goal is to enhance security, if people are to have a solid reason to expect a particular level of wealth at retirement, the risks have to be relatively low.
 ''The entire argument is absurd,'' said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. ''These returns weren't free. You are getting these returns precisely because you are taking on risk.''
 To be sure, one of the biggest ways to reduce risk is to have a long time frame. People who invest at age 30 or even 50 have the time to ride out most of the ups and downs of the stock market.
 But there are no guarantees. According to Ibbotson Associates, which publishes data showing average returns over different periods, large-cap stocks actually suffered a loss of 1 percent, annualized, from early 1929 to the end of 1942.
 Granted, it is somewhat unfair to pick a time period that begins just before the great stock crash of 1929 and continues through the Depression. But many analysts contend that it is even more misleading to suggest that people should have complete confidence in their ability to earn above-average returns with no risk whatsoever.
 Surprisingly, the Social Security Administration actually goes further than that. In addition to relying on the premise that equities will yield higher returns than Treasury bonds, Mr. Goss of the Social Security Administration suggested that returns in the future might be even higher than those of the past.
 ''A consensus is forming among economists that equity pricing as indicated by price-earnings ratios may be somewhat higher in the long-term future than in the long-term past,'' wrote Mr. Goss. 
 ''This is consistent with broader access to equity markets and the belief that equities may be viewed as somewhat less 'risky' in the future than in the past,'' he added.
 If investment funds or stockbrokers made that kind of claim, they would probably be breaking the law.
 In an interview last week, Mr. Goss acknowledged that many experts believe investment returns should be adjusted for risk and that the common proxy for a risk-free return is the real yield earned on Treasury bonds. 
 The Social Security Administration's analyses do include lengthy disclaimers, noting that the projected returns are highly ''sensitive'' to what happens in the markets.
 But other government analysts take a much more conservative approach. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which is run by a former chief economist in President Bush's own Council of Economic Advisers, assumes that equities and bonds will earn no more than Treasury bonds.
 Strikingly, the White House's own Office of Management and Budget recently made the same assumption. The issue was not Social Security but rather the projected growth of assets in the railroad retirement trust. In evaluating the railroad retirement system, the White House budget office also assumed that investments would yield the same as Treasuries.
 BUT the more basic question is this: Should a rational person believe that Social Security's very real financial shortfall can be reduced just by shifting from bonds into stocks? 
 Those who imply that stocks can promise higher returns without higher risk are essentially arguing that Social Security can be fixed with a huge exchange of paper.
 If that is the government's strategy, people should by all means push for the right to shift all their payroll taxes to personal accounts and invest the money in gold.

HEADLINE: Gateway to Success

 BODY:
The ambition that propels immigrants into this country often finds itself hampered by formidable obstacles -- language, low pay, lack of education, limited opportunity and, not infrequently, local hostility. Immigrants being who they are, these hurdles are seldom insurmountable. Theirs is the energy of hope, and it's a powerful force. 
 Westchester Community College in Valhalla has begun a determined effort to tap that energy -- and to help pave the path to success for immigrants -- in a way that could set an example for the region. It has begun its largest-ever fund-raising effort to build the Gateway Center, a $35 million building that will consolidate the classes and services it offers to the foreign-born, who make up a large portion of its student body of 24,000. 
 The center will allow the school to expand its English as a Second Language program, which now serves 4,000 students. It will also offer job training, placement services and career guidance, and is envisioned as a social hub where the native-born and newcomers can meet, work together and learn from one another.
 It's a practical idea, and an inspiring one. The New York area, like much of the rest of the country, is absorbing a huge wave of immigrants. The process has not always gone smoothly, particularly -- and predictably -- in the mostly white suburbs. A case in point is Long Island, where immigrants confront increasing hostility. Long Island's immigrant ranks include a considerable cohort of middle- and upper-class professionals. Those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder are more visible: the day laborers in construction and the men who mow lawns and clip hedges, waiting for work on the Island's shady streets and in its convenience-store parking lots. Besides the vagaries of weather and unscrupulous bosses, they endure insults -- and occasional violence -- from other Long Islanders who have let their suspicion of outsiders sink into hatred.
 Some local political leaders have taken steps to defuse the tensions, like setting up hiring centers to get laborers off the streets. Others have ignored the problem, or stoked it by pandering to the xenophobia of anti-immigrant groups whose members compare Latino workers to terrorists and who would just as soon erase the Latinos' presence altogether. 
 The Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, caused an uproar with a plan to deputize some county police officers to enforce federal immigration laws. He has wisely retreated. But he needs to go much further to restore trust among his Latino constituents, and to reinforce the obvious truth that hard-working, community-building immigrants are a welcome presence in our region. 
 He can begin doing this by echoing the tone of pragmatism and tolerance -- and hope -- that is being shown by a community college in Westchester.

HEADLINE: The Week Ahead

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:

OF INTEREST -- Those of us with loans tied to the prime rate -- and the Week Ahead is not naming names here -- will watch closely from the sidelines when the Federal Reserve Board meets on Tuesday to consider short-term interest rates. With a withering dollar and a trade gap that threatens to become a chasm, the board will undoubtedly raise short-term rates a notch; long-term rates are expected to follow soon after. The Fed's rate-raising campaign began in June with a quarter-point boost, followed by quarter-point increases in August, September and November, with most banks now setting their prime rate at 5 percent, which could go higher this week.
 Consumers with a bit of debt have some substantial company: The world's biggest borrower, the United States, sold $260 billion in securities to foreign banks in the 12 months ending in September -- with much more to follow at higher rates.

JOCK SHOCK -- Tavis Smiley will give his last thoughts on Thursday, the final broadcast of his National Public Radio program. Mr. Smiley, the host of NPR's first predominantly African-American show, declined to renew his contract, in part, he said, because the network failed to meaningfully reach out to a minority audience. Mr. Smiley has been controversial from the first broadcast of his one-hour newsmagazine, in 2002, with some listeners suggesting that his choice of guests and rhetoric offended white listeners.
 In an interview two years ago, he said ''When Bob Edwards goes to work on any given day, he does not have staff meetings in which he tried to determine whether the program he's doing is 'too white.''' Then again, Mr. Edwards, the longtime host of ''Morning Edition,'' was pushed out earlier this year. 

CITY FOR SALE -- ''The Great Chicago Fire Sale,'' an eBay auction of civic assets, will conclude on Thursday, marking the first time a city has sold itself, or at least bits and pieces of its history, on the Web. With proceeds benefiting the city's cultural programs, the auction included an official 1997 resolution absolving Mrs. O'Leary's cow of having a hoof in the fire of 1871 and an original 1960's Playboy Bunny outfit, including that fetching tail.

BUT IS IT FRUGAL? -- Investors who took a pass on Google's initial public offering and have been kicking themselves ever since will have another chance on Thursday, when 25 million more shares will become eligible for public sale. Since its issue in August, Google stock price has more than doubled, closing at $171.65 on Friday, in part because only about 7 percent of the company's stock-- 19.6 million shares -- was available to trade. Much of that scarcity will soon disappear: In addition to this week's sale, another 25 million shares will become available in January, and in February, all restrictions on the remaining 177 million shares will be lifted.
 Is it still a buy? Search us.

HEADLINE: Sabermetrics for Football 

BYLINE: By PAUL CAMPOS AND JONATHAN CHAIT

 BODY:
Of all sports, football is the most strategic. Football coaches spend the late hours of the night poring over film, crouching over chalkboards and producing phone-book-size playbooks, all in the hope of gleaning some advantage. Occasionally one of them invents a system -- like Bill Walsh's West Coast Offense, or Buddy Ryan's 46 Defense -- that is so revolutionary it overwhelms all opponents, even those with superior talent. Baseball managers, on the other hand, go out for a beer after the game. Strategy in baseball, while fascinating to aficionados, affects the results only around the margins. Even brilliant managers can't win championships with average players.
 And yet, until very recently, it was baseball and not football that was reshaped by an intellectual revolution called sabermetrics. Created by the statistical guru Bill James, who now works for the Boston Red Sox, sabermetrics is a system for applying statistical analysis to decisions that were previously made according to basic intuitions -- intuitions that, as James and his disciples showed, were often horribly wrong. Now the sabermetric revolution may be gaining a toehold in football as well. And here too the center of the revolution can be found in Massachusetts, where Coach Bill Belichick has led the New England Patriots to victories in two of the last three Super Bowls. 
 Belichick is known for his unorthodox strategies: being more willing than most to not punt on fourth down; running the ball far more than average in certain crucial situations; and eschewing two-point-conversion attempts in situations when orthodox doctrine recommends them.
 Not coincidentally, experts in the world of football statistical analysis endorse all these strategies. For example, David Romer, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, published a working paper arguing that conventional football wisdom led to far too much punting. Romer analyzed thousands of plays and calculated the chance of scoring from any position on the field. Based on that, he gauged the relative worth of the field position gained by punting against the lost opportunity to score. Romer found that football coaches punt far more than they ought to -- perhaps acting out of fear of the worst outcome (going for it on fourth down and failing), rather than rationally balancing risk and reward.
 Romer's paper, ''It's Fourth Down and What Does the Bellman Equation Say? A Dynamic Programming Analysis of Football Strategy,'' is far from light reading, so it came as a shock to Romer when he learned that Belichick, who was an economics major at Wesleyan University, had read it.
 Yet this is not the only example of the Patriots' willingness to turn to the academic world for guidance. A few years ago, Ernie Adams, the Patriots' football research director, asked Harold Sackrowitz, a Rutgers statistician, to give his opinion regarding the team's two-point conversion strategies. Sackrowitz concluded that the strategy was less than optimal -- and the Patriots subsequently did not try any two-point conversions in the 2003-2004 season.
 Belichick also sticks to running the ball on third down in short-yardage situations, while other coaches pass reasonably often to try to surprise the defense. According to Aaron Schatz, founder of the sabermetrics-inspired Web site FootballOutsiders.com, Belichick's strategy, though predictable, is well warranted by a careful analysis of the risks and rewards involved in using it. 
 Following in James's footsteps, Schatz employs a metric known as defense-adjusted value over average, or DVOA. It takes into account that not all yards gained in football are created equal -- that, for example, gaining 5 yards on third down and 4 is more beneficial, on average, than gaining eight yards on third and 10.
 Just as it is in baseball sabermetrics, context is crucial to Schatz's analysis. Schatz rates every play a team runs by comparing it with the league average performance for plays in as close to that situation as possible. In Schatz's analysis, the relative success of a play is determined by, among other things, the down and distance, the current score, the field position and the opponent's strength. DVOA, in short, is an attempt to create a tool of analysis for football similar to such Jamesian baseball statistics as offensive winning percentage, runs created and OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging percentage).
 ''We're trying to see through the biases inherent in a game where the basic situation is constantly changing,'' Schatz told The Boston Globe. ''We're trying to create an intelligent community for discussing the N.F.L.'' In a sense, the community of those who believe that empiricism has a role to play crosses the boundaries of sport. As James says, the Red Sox front office ''has great admiration for both what the Patriots have done and how they've done it.'' PAUL CAMPOS AND JONATHAN CHAIT

HEADLINE: Self-Storage

BYLINE: By BRUCE GRIERSON

 BODY:
The modern urban traveler tends to move through the day at an allegro pace: he speeds around absorbing too much information to process and, come nightfall, crashes hard. At which point, all the day's complicated protocols are swamped by a simple biological imperative: tune out and recharge. There's no need to bring broadloom or satellite TV into the equation. This person is whipped; all he requires to fall asleep is a little slice of real estate where kids can't poke him and the rain won't short out his BlackBerry. 
 This year, the easyGroup -- a British chain specializing in discount air, sea and road travel -- announced that it will answer the call for no-frills body storage with easyHotel. Beginning next year, a night's accommodation in central London will cost as little as $10 a night. For that, you get a room that's 90 square feet -- or a shade larger than the average American prison cell.
 ''People are willing to trade off space for price,'' says James Rothnie, easyGroup's director of corporate affairs. The planned micro-suites resemble the Japanese ''capsule'' hotels that embrace businessmen like upholstered sarcophagi, but adapted for a different culture. ''We figured that a Westerner would want to at least stand up in their hotel room,'' Rothnie says. Everything does double duty: the headboard is the closet, the wall is the shelf, the bed is the chair. Conceived by a New York City architect, Joel Sanders -- who with this project has made a strong case for handling the first hotel in space -- prototype rooms are made of wipe-clean metal modules that link together.
 The need to crash during the day poses problems of its own, given vagrancy laws. But this, too, is now being addressed. For $13.45 plus tax for the first 20 minutes, Manhattanites can now rent a MetroNap ''pod'' on the 24th floor of the Empire State Building. You check in, drift off to the sound of ocean surf or rain, wake up to gentle lighting and a vibrating mattress pad, clean your face at the ''wake station'' and resume your routine. The company plans to expand into corporations, hospitals, highway rest stops and airports. (In fact, the second outlet is opening this month at the International Airport in Vancouver.) The aim here, finally, is a culture shift -- though not quite a downshift into gentler siestaville. ''We want to overcome the bias that people who nap are somehow lazy,'' says Christopher Lindholst, co-founder of MetroNaps. ''We believe there's a clear economic benefit to napping, to companies and to individuals -- it allows them to be more effective during the day.'' BRUCE GRIERSON

HEADLINE: Employable Liberal Arts Major, The

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO

 BODY:
Few questions make liberal arts majors wince more than the time-honored ''But what are you going to do with that?'' (As the accounting student said to the English major.) Now, with tuition costs rising as fast as parental anxiety levels, colleges have begun asking the same question -- and helping their students answer it through professional training programs that look ahead to the day after graduation. 
 This year, Colgate University and New York University began offering special career-oriented workshops to undergraduates. Colgate's ''Career Development in the New Economy'' program brings in alumni business executives to offer advice and engage in networking; students meet for up to two hours a week, for six to eight weeks during the semester. In its Gateway Program, Colgate will soon offer noncredit courses in fields like law, journalism and marketing and finance. ''The job market is getting competitive, and there are a lot of . . . industry-specific skills that young people need as the professions and the economy continue to diversify,'' said Adam Weinberg, the dean of the college at Colgate University. 
 At New York University, juniors and seniors with high grade-point averages can enroll in the Professional Edge program and take specialized vocational courses for academic credit in N.Y.U.'s School of Continuing and Professional Studies. An art history major could learn to appraise art, or a language student could learn to become a translator. Other colleges are on the same page. Columbia University allows undergraduates to take professional-school courses for credit, as does the University of Southern California.
 Colleges say they aren't abandoning the liberal arts education but rather bringing the ideal slightly more in line with the job-market reality. Colgate's program makes sure the professions don't ''seep in and otherwise corrupt the strong liberal arts curriculum,'' Weinberg explains. 
 Yet others aren't entirely convinced. ''To dilute the power of the liberal arts with premature professionalism will deprive our society of the thoughtful leadership it needs,'' Anthony Marx, the president of Amherst College, was quoted as saying in The Times earlier this year. If they have the luxury of time, he said, students should ''go deeper into the liberal arts, because that is the seed corn of an intellectual life and informed citizenship.'' After all, college is breathlessly short, and the American working life increasingly long. How many professionals think back fondly to those industry-specific lingo-training courses of their undergraduate days? RACHEL DONADIO

HEADLINE: Feral Cities

BYLINE: By KEN STIER

 BODY:
This year, the American military was forced to relearn painful lessons in urban warfare. Insurgents in Falluja and Najaf were able to neutralize much of America's technological superiority and inflict costly casualties. It remains to be seen whether the retaking of those Iraqi cities proves to be a Pyrrhic victory. 
 But renewed urban combat is hardly the only global urban crisis. In a World Policy Journal article published this spring, the national security experts Peter Liotta and James Miskel argued that the ''failed state,'' which received so much attention in the 1990's, is being supplemented by the emergence of failed cities, where civil order succumbs to powerful criminal gangs. From Brazil to South Africa, these gangs pose a variety of nontraditional security threats -- from unchecked black-marketeering and the smuggling of people, guns and drugs to public-health breakdowns and alliances with terrorists. 
 Richard Norton, a Naval War College scholar who has developed a taxonomy of what he calls feral cities, says that there are numerous places slipping toward Mogadishu, perhaps the only fully feral city nowadays. As public services disintegrate, residents are forced to hire private security or pay criminals for protection. The police in Brazil have fallen back on a containment policy against gangs ruling the favelas, while the rich try to stay above the fray, fueling the busiest civilian helicopter traffic in the world (there are 240 helipads in S-o Paulo; there are 10 in New York City). In Johannesburg, much of downtown, including the stock exchange, has been abandoned to squatters and drug gangs. In Mexico City, crime is soaring despite the presence of 91,000 policemen. Karachi, Pakistan, where 40 percent of the population lives in slums, plays host to gangland violence and to Al Qaeda cells.
 As cities around the world descend into disorder, the United States may have to step up training local militaries to undertake armed interventions. Writing in The Naval War College Review last fall, Norton warned that ''traditionally, problems of urban decay and associated issues, such as crime, have been seen as domestic issues best dealt with by internal security or police forces. That will no longer be an option.'' KEN STIER

HEADLINE: Income-Variability Anxiety 

BYLINE: By NOAM SCHEIBER

 BODY:
For decades, political scientists have believed that the economy is the key to a president's re-election chances: when the economy is buoyant, as it was in 1984 and 1996, the incumbent should cruise to victory. When the economy is dicey, as it was in 1980 and 1992, the advantage tilts toward the challenger. So it is no surprise that with every major economic indicator looking good this year, leading political-science models tended to show George W. Bush winning easily. 
 That obviously didn't happen. And the reason, according to a recent series of papers by Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist, is that while incomes have been rising, so has the degree to which those incomes fluctuate. The problem for an incumbent, Hacker argues, is that voters care a great deal about having a stable income, not just about having a large one.
 When Hacker began tinkering with ways to measure the instability of family income, what he found amazed him. Between the early 1970's and the early 90's, the index of income volatility he devised rose by a factor of 5 (though it fell somewhat toward the end of the 90's). Put differently, a family earning $50,000 a year in 1974 (in today's dollars) had a 2 in 3 chance of making anywhere between $38,000 and $62,000 in 1975. But by the early 90's, a family earning $50,000 would have a 2 in 3 chance of making between $30,000 and $70,000 the following year. The risk of a substantial drop-off in income was much greater. Moreover, the trend wasn't confined to less-well-educated workers. Workers with and without college training saw a similar rise in the volatility of their family incomes. 
 A conservative might argue that most people would gladly accept the risk of seeing their income fall in exchange for the possibility of a large increase. But the social scientific evidence suggests the opposite. Behavioral economists have identified a phenomenon known as ''loss aversion'' -- people's tendency to dislike losing things they already have much more intensely than they like gaining things of equal value. No wonder rising income volatility makes voters more and more anxious about their economic prospects. 
 ''The economy did much less for Bush than you'd have expected,'' Hacker says. ''I would posit one reason is that people feel less secure.'' NOAM SCHEIBER

HEADLINE: ''Acting White'' Myth, The

BYLINE: By PAUL TOUGH

 BODY:
When Bill Cosby spoke out publicly in May against dysfunction and irresponsibility in black families, he identified one pervasive symptom: ''boys attacking other boys because the boys are studying and they say, 'You're acting white.''' This idea isn't new; it was first proposed formally in the mid-80's by John Ogbu, a Nigerian professor of anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley, and it has since become almost a truism: when smart black kids try hard and do well, they are picked on by their less successful peers for ''acting white.''
 The only problem with this theory, according to a research paper released in October, is that for the most part, it isn't true. Karolyn Tyson, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and William Darity Jr., an economist at Duke and U.N.C., coordinated an 18-month ethnographic study at 11 schools in North Carolina. What they found was that black students basically have the same attitudes about achievement as their white counterparts do: they want to succeed, understand that doing well in school has important consequences in later life and feel better about themselves the better they do. 
 So where does the idea of the burden of ''acting white'' come from? One explanation the authors offer will make sense to anyone who has ever seen a John Hughes movie: there's an ''oppositional peer culture'' in every high school -- the stoners and the jocks making fun of the nerds and the student-government types. When white burnouts give wedgies to white A students, the authors argue, it is seen as inevitable, but when the same dynamic is observed among black students, it is pathologized as a racial neurosis.
 More insidiously, the authors say, the idea that failing black kids pull down successful black kids can be used as an excuse by administrators to conceal or justify discrimination in the public-education system. The one school where the researchers did find anxiety about ''acting white'' was the one in which black students were drastically underrepresented in the gifted-and-talented classes. And significantly, at this particular school, the notion of the burden of ''acting white'' was most pervasive not among the black students interviewed by the researchers, but among their teachers and administrators, who told researchers that blacks are ''averse to success'' and ''don't place a high value on education.''

HEADLINE: Well Howdy-Do, It's a Saab-aru

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
GREGOR MENDEL, the Augustinian monk known as the father of genetics, cross-bred peas in his monastery's garden so he could observe patterns in how features are inherited. General Motors seems bent on a similar course of research as it cross-breeds cars and trucks from its farflung operations and affiliates. 
 For old-timers with Saab, the Swedish automaker now under the G.M. umbrella, it must be startling to discover that their latest offspring seems so, ahem, Japanese. Who's the father? Well, that would be Subaru, the automotive operation of Fuji Heavy Industries, of which G.M. owns 21 percent. 
 Saab, a two-model car company for decades, desperately needs a larger footprint in today's ultracompetitive market. So G.M. looked across its global empire for an existing car that could be transformed into a Saab to compete in the premium-compact market. That booming segment includes the Acura RSX, Volvo S40 and Mercedes-Benz C230 (with the Audi A3, Mercedes B-Class and a smaller BMW yet to come).
 G.M.'s geneticists settled on the Subaru Impreza, an all-wheel-drive compact. Restyled and lightly revamped, it has been transformed into the 2005 Saab 9-2X and is being built alongside Subarus in Japan.
 The 9-2X brings some assets to product-hungry dealerships. It is the first Saab with all-wheel drive, and with a starting price of $23,685 it becomes the least expensive car in the showroom. Two versions are offered: the Linear, which is similar to the Impreza 2.5 RS and shares that car's 165-horsepower flat-4 engine, and the Aero, which is equivalent to the sportier, faster Impreza WRX, with a 227-horsepower turbocharged flat-4. Saab does not get a version of the hottest Impreza, the 300-horse WRX STi.
 While the 9-2X is heavily based on the Impreza wagon -- there is no Saab equivalent of the sedan -- it received a distinctive and attractive nose job. No Subaru sheet metal remains from the windshield forward, and the front end truly looks Saablike, despite a hood scoop that feeds air to the Aero's turbocharger.
 The cosmetic surgery fooled at least one onlooker. When I wheeled the 9-2X into a parking spot outside a baseball tournament in a small town north of Flint, Mich., the dad parked next to me took just one look before asking, ''That's a Saab, right?'' 
 His next question was one that Saab enthusiasts routinely ask: is the ignition switch between the seats in the usual Saab fashion? The answer is no, it's on the steering column. (Saab says moving the ignition would have taken too much time and money.)
 The Saab interior's character is only slightly more Scandinavian than the Subaru's. While Saab uses higher-grade materials, including plastics with a metallic finish, the cabins are not starkly different. 
 Saab has long been known as a innovator in safety features. But while all 9-2X's come with side air bags and antilock brakes, they don't offer side curtain bags, stability control or the ''active'' head restraints that help to prevent whiplash injuries in other Saabs. 
 Beneath its skin, the 9-2X has good bones and, at least in the Aero, a pounding heart. Car and Driver magazine ran the Aero from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in a very respectable 6.1 seconds. Still that is less brisk than the 5.4 seconds recorded for the lighter Subaru WRX.
 The Aero carries a fuel economy rating of 20 in town and 27 on the highway with a five-speed manual transmission, and 19/26 with a four-speed automatic. The Linear has a rating of 23/29 with the manual and 22/29 with the automatic.
 While the Subaru fundamentals are largely unchanged, Saab added sound-deadening material to quiet the cabin and tweaked the suspension with the goal of softening the ride.
 My test drives included treks to my son's out-of-town baseball games. Despite the suspension adjustments, the ride was quite similar to what I remember of the Subaru's. The Saab also retains the WRX's responsive handling; the car is delightful on winding country roads. 
 One marked difference between the Saab and Subaru, at least so far, lies in their popularity. While the WRX has sold very well, the 9-2X has had a slow start. Through November, just 1,350 of the Saabs had found owners since they went on sale in June. The company has lowered full-year sales projections to 5,000 from the original estimates of 7,000 to 8,000.
 While Saab attributes part of the sluggish start to the summer debut of an all-wheel-drive car with winter appeal, price may be a factor. The Linear starts at $23,685, including delivery -- more than $4,000 above the Subaru equivalent. At $27,645, the Aero seeks a premium of $2,675 over the WRX. There are few significant differences in features, though Saab includes two years of free maintenance and a 4-year, 50,000-mile limited warranty, a year longer than Subaru's.
 The 9-2X is by no means the only Saab that shares major parts with other cars. The midsize 9-3 is based on G.M.'s global Epsilon architecture, also used for the Chevrolet Malibu and Opel Vectra. Early next year, Saab will bring out the 9-7X, a sport utility based on the G.M. line of S.U.V.'s that includes the Chevrolet TrailBlazer. For 2006, Saab plans a seven-passenger car-based utility developed with Subaru. (The Subaru version, the B9X, will make its debut next month in Detroit. Saab says it will reveal its version, which may be named the 9-6, later in 2005.)
 Since the 9-2X was created from an Impreza that was already halfway through its life cycle, its future may be in peril when the Subaru is redesigned. Will the Saab's replacement be based on the next-generation Subaru or the next Opel Astra? In any case, the car will surely share components with some other car from G.M. or an affiliate. The days of purebred Saabs are over. 
 Company officials say all this parts sharing and crossbreeding is an economical and timely way to expand the product line. And they promise to inject more Saabness into future models. For those of us who are Saab fans, such a move can't happen too soon.

INSIDE TRACK: The face may be Swedish, but Japanese genes are dominant.

HEADLINE: Raising Anchor

BYLINE: By NINA ROBERTS

 BODY:
IF you happen to be on lower South Street just before midnight, you'll see the Fulton Fish Market being prepared for its midnight-to-8 a.m. ''day'' of buying and selling fish. Bleary-eyed men stumble around with their first coffee of the morning, 80-foot trucks unload, and mini-forklifts, called hi-los, beep by with boxes wrapped in tattered plastic. Yet sometimes it is so peaceful, you can hear lobsters clawing the inside of their plastic containers. 
 The open-air market, one of the city's iconic places, has been thriving on this spot since 1835. But early next year, after countless rumors of a move, it is finally relocating to a new $85 million, 450,000-square-foot facility in Hunts Point in the Bronx. The pending move has the market's 600 workers, many of them with decades of experience, overflowing with opinions, memories and stories.

Their Stories
 My grandfather came over in 1914 from Russia, Poland, somewhere in that area. He was in the retail fish business. He used to take the horse and wagon over the Brooklyn Bridge to buy fish. But there are a lot of imported fish here that my grandfather wouldn't even know what they are. Even fish my father wouldn't know. -- David Samuels, 53, owner, Blue Ribbon Fish Company. Years at the market: 35.
 I absolutely never thought I'd be in the fish business. Not in a million years. I thought I was going to be a disc jockey. I love music. And here I am. 
 I grew up down here, visiting my uncle in the summertime, working summers down here. I was just turned on by the whole idea. I had hair down to my back, I could wear ripped jeans, and no one ever told me what to do. -- John Flanigan, 36, co-owner and vice president, Emerald Seafood. Years at the market: 17.
 I've worked a little bit everywhere. I've taught, I worked for a roofing company, I worked for Stroock & Stroock & Lavan at 180 Maiden Lane, right over there. I did everything: deliver papers, make coffee, carry things for elderly attorneys, do the mail, stand in line at motor vehicles -- anything to get out of the office. Then they decided they were going to bring in outside people, and that was that. 
 On my first day here, I'm looking up there at the 40th floor, and I'm like, man, I've fallen a long way. But I like that I'm feeding people. When I worked for the law firm, I was working for a bunch who were basically working for rich people taking money from poor people.
 I had no training, no nothing. They were like, ''You just sign for the stuff and count it.'' And I was like, ''All right.'' The first couple are easy, ''Oh, yeah, two, three, five.'' And then all of a sudden, they give you, ''Oh, yeah, 575.'' Now, I can just eye it up. I just know how many are on a pallet, what to look for, what could be missing. But it's hard at first. -- Keith Nicolay, 47, receiver, Universal Fish. Years at the market: 5.

Good Memories
 I've been working in the market since 1976, when I was 23. Back then, it was great. It was the highlight of my life. It was old men with cigars, ripped-up pants, and smelling like an old fish. There were wooden boxes, not Styrofoam. Fish would be coming in off the trucks, and unloaded by hand. Everything was prehistoric, mysterious. 
 There was a bar across the street called Dirty Ernie's. Really horrible, dirty, but everybody would be in there every day, eating, because he was a great cook. There were old men in the bar eating breakfast and having shots of whiskey to keep warm. -- Ronnie Breyer, 50, dispatcher, Fulton Village. Years at the market: 28.
 Obviously, we love this place. You can talk with any man. It's in our heart, it's in our bones. Cobblestone streets, the smell, the air, the buildings, the two bridges. You look at the Brooklyn Bridge and the sunrise every morning, it's beautiful. You were a young man when you started, and there is your nostalgia, your life is here, your memories. -- Eddie Cruci, 41, senior salesman, M. Slavin & Sons. Years at the market: 23.

Good Riddance
 I know it doesn't seem like much when I say it, but it's 100 percent humidity with no breeze. My boss describes it, ''Standing here is like being in someone's mouth.'' 
 I'm wearing a hat because of the pigeons, not because I want to wear one.
 -- Dave Walthall, 42, journeyman, Universal Seafood. Years at the market: 16.

Why They Love Working With Fish
 It's amazing to see what the ocean produces. Sometimes you'll find a fish that is normally a Pacific fish, that will make it through the Gulf Stream, through the Panama Canal or all the way around South America, like an opah, to the East Coast, which is so bizarre. Sometimes a fisherman will catch a strange fish, send it to us and say, ''Please tell me what it is when you get it.'' 
 -- John Flanigan
 This is fun. It's like Wall Street, except with fish. What's beautiful about a fish being perishable is from a Monday to a Friday, the price of a certain species can fluctuate hundreds of percent. So when you buy it and when you sell it is very important. That's where the fun part is. -- Eddie Cruci
 They say there is a curse in the fish market; once you start, you can never leave. I tried a couple times, but you always find yourself coming back. I did a little bit of college, but I found that I liked doing this. 
 It's sort of like playing cards; always a gamble, always taking chances. This is the second-oldest profession after prostitution, the fish business. -- John Flanigan
 Every species has its own little nuance. There is so much mutation over time. It's Darwinian: how to be more hydrodynamic, or how to be a better predator, or be a better prey with camouflage, or fighting mechanisms. -- Eddie Cruci
 I've learned a lot. Before, I was just into crabs and shrimp. Now I'm into whiting, sushi. I've really developed a thing for squid, Alaskan crab legs. 
 I don't know how these guys out here fillet. They're cutting fish, if they slip, they cut off a finger, it's 10 degrees out, they're just cutting away, it gets pretty crazy. I guess that's the appeal of it. -- Keith Nicolay
 I'm very persnickety when it comes to fish. It's got to be white fillet. I'm not a fish person. I didn't grow up liking fish. I still don't like fish. I don't know how you can dig into a hearty piece of fish; it's a delicate thing. I like McDonald's and Chinese food. -- Eddie Cruci

The Smell
 I change my clothes before and after work. The only thing I'm wearing when I first came in, is my underwear, and I'll change again to go home. But my clothes, just from hanging upstairs, are still going to smell like fish. I spray some Febreze on them, I wash up with soap and water, put on a little cologne. But if you have anywhere important to go afterward, you've got to go home first. It's the smell of money, that's what I tell everybody. -- Dave Walthall
 I embrace the smell of fresh fish; it's almost a rush to me. When you open a good box of fish, you see it; it's jumping out of the box, and you get that fresh sea smell. As far as the pungency of the smell, when fish goes bad, you develop a tolerance for that. I remember when I first came down, it bothered me. Now, it is what it is. -- Eddie Cruci
 The smell? You get used to it. I just make sure I wash. I use lemon, I use bleach. But sometimes I think I go home so clean, then I'll have breakfast at a diner, and people will start to sniff and say, ''I smell fish.'' Like I always say, if we worked for a cesspool company, we'd smell like something else. -- Ronnie Breyer

Late-Night Visitors
 When graduation time comes, limos come down here, because the seniors like to go to the Seaport. They stick their heads out of the sunroof and flash us. In the summertime, sometimes drunk women will flash us, and they have 500 guys whistling at them. Once a guy was doing a porno shoot for a magazine, he brought a model and she had a blast. I guess once we move to the Bronx, that'll be over. -- Dave Walthall

Ethnicity
 The ownership hasn't changed much; it's Italian and Jewish. But the work force has changed; you have more Hispanic, African-American, Asian. There are no ethnic boundaries down here; money is the joining factor. Whoever has the money to pay for the fish, you're my buddy. -- Eddie Cruci

The Mob
 They made this place out to be like there were monsters in the closet. I understand the F.D.A. rules, but a lot of the other regulations -- background checks, watching everything you do and say, always having to say who you're working for, having to wear a badge. I've been down here 27 years, I didn't do anything wrong.
 We're not doing anything we didn't do 20 years ago. And if any people did, they're either in jail, they did their time, or they're dead. -- Ronnie Breyer

Family Matters
 It takes a very understanding wife to deal with a husband who comes home at 10, 11 a.m. The meat of everybody's day, when everybody is wide awake, you have to sleep. -- Eddie Cruci
 I see my wife and kids for two hours a day during the week. I have little kids, and you turn around and they're doing something new, and that's hard. My uncle told my wife when she married me: ''You're marrying a fish guy. It's not easy.'' She said, ''O.K., I love him, I'll marry him.'' -- John Flanigan

Why They're Bitter
 Nobody really wanted to move. Nobody said, ''Oh, we'd rather be inside.'' We don't care about working outside. 
 People come down here and say: ''I can't believe the fish market is moving. It's been here forever.'' The old-timers that used to work down here, they'd be turning in their graves. -- John Puleo, 43. Owner, South Street Seafood. Years in the market: 15.
 People have been selling fish on this location since the Indians. It goes totally against karma to move. I don't even know if I'll have a job up there. What I do might not even exist in the new setup. -- Keith Nicolay
 There is no big party, no nothing. The party will be between the guys that work down here, that's it. The city isn't going to say, ''Guys, let's throw you something before you get out of here, just to say goodbye.'' Nobody is doing that; nobody cares. It's like they're going to throw us wherever they're going to throw us, and say: ''You know what? If you go under, you go under. We don't care.'' A lot of the little guys are going to go under, and it's going to hurt. -- John Puleo
 What's going to be a drag is that I won't be able to come back here because it's going to be gone. It'll be like going back to a neighborhood you lived in, that used to be great old houses, and now it's all prefab. When I was a kid, I lived in a great place, and then all of a sudden they just came in and wiped out the woods, and built prefab apartments. Same with this. -- Keith Nicolay
 How they're allowing it, I don't know. When they wanted to toss the meat market out of the West Side, you know what happened? The people from landmarks came down and told the city, ''You can't do that.'' 
 This is way more historical than the meat market. The landmarks people should have come down here and said to the city: ''Listen, they can't move out of here. This is part of history; these guys stay.'' -- John Puleo

Why They're Relieved
 There is absolutely a magnificent view from Hunts Point. Oh, my God, you're looking at the river, and on the other side you see Queens, you see the planes taking off. It's gorgeous; the sun comes right up there. If you go down to the end of this dock here, there is a magnificent view of all the bridges, but I don't see it very often unless I take a tourist there. A view is great, but after 35 years, that's enough view. -- David Samuels
 Maybe 100 years ago this was a viable place for an open-air market, but 100 years later, we're getting squished. It's a nice venue for us up there: more space, more access for the vehicles, a controlled-temperature environment. 
 It's going to be great for the fish. It won't be too hot in the summer, or too cold in the winter. Hopefully that will stimulate business.
 Nostalgic-wise, you don't like it, because you're going up to a sterile environment and leaving Manhattan. But that has to take a back seat to the economy. Hopefully, like the movie ''Field of Dreams,'' if you build it, they will come. -- Eddie Cruci
 Am I going to have nostalgia leaving this old, depressing building? To move to an indoor, refrigerated facility? Oh, yes, absolutely. My arthritis will have nostalgia. -- David Samuels

Last Words
 I took an old sign home, I took an old scale, because everything is digital, I took some old-fashioned tags and put them all in the tiki bar I built in my backyard, next to the pool. I got the little South Street Seaport sign. I'm trying to find little things. 
 My brother worked here, but he's out on S.S.I. He got run over by a hi-lo. I'm against hi-los down here, all the new, modern things. We had hand trucks, and we lifted things. I understand everything had to get modernized, but the old way was the best way. 
 I just hope the new market works. If it doesn't, I don't know. I'll open up a bagel store or something. -- Ronnie Breyer

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Sovereignty

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CALDWELL

 BODY:
Americans claim they favor leaders who understand their wants, have a track record of creating jobs and can be ruthless when required. Sounds like Wal-Mart! Maybe that's why, last spring, the Arkansas-based retail behemoth asked the citizens of Inglewood, Calif., to hand it the reins of government. 
 When the Inglewood City Council rejected Wal-Mart's bid to open a 130,000-square-foot superstore, company executives did not sulk. They disparaged the council as the captive of outside special interests, particularly organized labor. And with the help of election professionals, they collected more than 10,000 signatures to sponsor a ballot referendum to reverse the decision. In the ensuing referendum campaign, the company spent more than $1 million to convey the idea that it would create hundreds of jobs and pump up the local tax base. Opponents emphasized what they saw as the company's legacy of blighted downtowns and falling wages. 
 Ultimately, though, voters were most upset by something else: Wal-Mart's initiative would have exempted the company from Inglewood's zoning, planning and environmental laws and established a provision whereby the deal could be altered only by a two-thirds vote of the public. By the time voters rejected the initiative at the ballot box in April, this strategy had acquired a name: Wal-Mart Sovereignty.
 There's nothing new about the urge to turn economic power into political power (and vice versa). Misgivings about it aren't new, either. But in times of economic transformation, when society renegotiates what is public and what is private, the questions that arise get really nettlesome. Should inmates pay their debt to society through the middleman of a for-profit prison company? Would you say no even if it meant more criminals on the street? Should sports moguls pocket fortunes from publicly financed stadiums? Would you say no even if it meant your city lost its baseball team?
 For a long time, Wal-Mart steered clear of such quarrels. It was out of sight, out of mind, building retail space mostly on the ahistorical, apolitical exurban frontier. But more and more, it is encroaching on communities that are more settled -- Inglewood is part of Los Angeles County -- more ideological or snobbier. The Inglewood referendum won't be the last time voters are invited to trade citizen rights for consumer rights -- and no one should make any glib assumptions about which of those rights Americans hold more dear.

HEADLINE: Africans Get a Cold Shoulder as Libya Turns to the West

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya, Dec. 11 

 BODY:
When Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi proposed a borderless United States of Africa several years ago, Kofi Bafoo in Ghana answered his call.
 Like hundreds of thousands of other young men living in the impoverished countries along the Sahara's southern fringe, Mr. Bafoo left for this oil-rich promised land with hopes of building a new life on the Mediterranean coast.
 It did not work out that way. Few of the estimated one million Africans who flooded into Libya found jobs in the country's feeble economy, so Mr. Bafoo and thousands of other young African men set their sights on European shores. Libya, it seems, was happy to let them go. 
 ''Until 2003, every day boats were leaving,'' Mr. Bafoo said, limping on a foot injured recently while running from the police. ''The government knew about it, but they didn't care.''
 The problem began a decade ago. Colonel Qaddafi, frustrated by his failures to build pan-Arab unity and the Arab world's lack of support for him in the face of United Nations sanctions imposed in 1992 to press Libya to deliver suspects in the bombing of a PanAm flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, turned his attention south. After African countries agreed to defy the sanctions by resuming flights to Libya in 1998, Colonel Qaddafi renamed the country's Voice of the Greater Arab Homeland radio station the Voice of Africa and began talking in earnest about his pan-African plans.
 But last year the sanctions were lifted, and Libyan leader has shifted his focus again, this time from Africa to new friends in the West who are eager to stop the African migration to Europe. The Libyan authorities have begun arresting and deporting those caught without a valid visa, even though visa requirements had been abolished earlier as part of Colonel Qaddafi's African outreach.
 ''For years, Libya said it could not play policeman for the West, but now, with the rapprochement, Libya has entered into a dialogue to deal with the situation,'' said Saleh Ibrahim, director of an academic institute close to the Libyan leader.
 Mr. Bafoo, 25, tried to emigrate last year but lost $1,000 to an unscrupulous intermediary who made off with the cash. Last January, he lost $1,200 when the Tunisian Navy intercepted his boat and sent him back to Libya.
 The Libyan police arrested him a few days ago and took his last $500. He hurt his foot when he escaped by scrambling over a cinder-block wall. 
 ''They discriminate by the color of your skin,'' complained Mr. Bafoo, his injured foot smeared with massage cream because he has no identity papers or money for a hospital.
 The boat people leaving from Libya are part of a broader wave of Europe-bound illegal immigrants from all along the North African coast, but nowhere has the passing been as easy or the traffic as heavy as it has been from here. 
 ''We have cooperation with Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, but there have been no formal relations with this country and that has created a gap,'' said a European diplomat in Tripoli who has been involved in talks on how best to stem the tide.
 Some of the Africans here say there was a rush of boats leaving Libya in recent months as people took their chances before the seas turned rough in November. More than 1,500 people landed on the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa in October.
 Libyan officials insist that their country has not abandoned Colonel Qaddafi's pan-African vision, but they say the problem has grown to a scale that cannot be ignored. Although Libya is now pushing Europe and the United States to increase investment in sub-Saharan Africa in the hope of keeping young men there, many of the Africans lured here by his past promises feel betrayed.
 ''Libya told all the Africans, 'Libya is Africa so you can come,' but many more people came than the country could handle,'' said Abbas Albal Kindam Yusef, a migrant from Sudan's troubled Darfur region. ''Now they want us to leave.''
 Drinking water from a communal tin cup in Tripoli's crumbling old city, another Sudanese migrant, Sadiq Ataia, said 700 of his countrymen had been caught in the previous three days. Like most of the Sudanese here, Mr. Sadiq is from Darfur and claims allegiance to an opposition group fighting the government in Khartoum. He and other Sudanese say Libya is deporting Darfurians to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, where they face an uncertain future.
 ''We're very afraid because we have no passport and no visa,'' Mr. Sadiq said. He said he had worked as an intermediary for smugglers, finding candidates for the dangerous Mediterranean crossing, but added that many smugglers had been arrested in the current crackdown and the rest were afraid to act. ''Now, it's impossible to leave,'' he said.
 Even if the men do make it onto a boat, few of the smugglers provide a crew and the migrants choose pilots and navigators from among themselves. Many drown or die of exposure, while others end up back where they began.
 Amin Boubaker said that two years ago, he spent $1,200 to get to Italy on a small Tunisian fishing boat with about 70 other people. They waited two days in the bush near Zuwarah for their boat to appear. When it did, they waded into the sea and clambered aboard in the darkness before dawn.
 To pilot the boat, the Africans chose the only one among them who knew how to drive a car. After four days, they spotted lights on the horizon and cheered with joy. But it was not Italy. Within hours, the 70 were picked up by a Tunisian naval patrol, which sank the boat and sent the men to prison. They were released two weeks later near the Libyan border and made their way back to Tripoli.
 ''When we left, I thought we would be in Sicily in four hours,'' Mr. Boubaker said sheepishly.
 Since then, the climate for Africans in Libya has rapidly deteriorated. Though the Africans provide cheap labor, ordinary Libyans never shared their leader's enthusiasm for their poor neighbors. In 2000, dozens of Africans were killed by mobs in western Libya. Although some Libyans were punished then, Africans say they have no protection from average Libyans or the police today. They say that Africans are regularly beaten and robbed.
 Libya's crude banking system lacks international links, so the Africans have no way to send their earnings home. Some men slice open the brims of their caps and hide cash inside or slip bank notes between the plastic covers of their passport holders and reseal them. ''If you fight back, they'll deport you right away,'' said a young Ghanian whose brother was deported two months ago. Libya is now offering free flights to repatriate Africans. But the waiting list for a seat is long and those who want to leave worry about being caught by the police. 
 The men say the overland trip home is dangerous, difficult and increasingly expensive, because the Libyan soldiers at checkpoints on the roads demand bribes. Crossing the desert itself is the most treacherous part. Trucks are discovered in the arid wilderness with a grisly cargo of people who died of thirst after their vehicle broke down or ran out of fuel when the driver lost his way.
 ''I'll take you to the border and you can see the bones of people in the desert, a skull here, a hand there, from people who lost their way,'' said a man eating from a communal bowl of stewed goat entrails in a building built for chickens that now houses hundreds of Sudanese instead. ''We have no way to go back.'' 
 But the draw of Europe remains strong. 
 ''I have many friends living in Italy now,'' said Muhammad Mutawakil, wearing a yellow baseball cap, ''and they are doing much better than we are here or than our families in Ghana.''

HEADLINE: The Hidden Price Tag For Health Care

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
ELIOT SPITZER? The Sarbanes-Oxley law? Never mind them. What should really be keeping executives awake at night is something that looks much more mundane: the upward trajectory of American health care spending.
 Mr. Spitzer, the New York attorney general (and candidate for governor), is the scourge of corporate corruption, and Sarbanes-Oxley is the tough new federal accounting measure. Why should medical costs make corporate America squirm more? Managed care, after all, has helped to hold down spending, and companies are passing along more costs to workers. Rising health care spending may be a problem, but not for investors and executives, right? 
 Wrong. A recent study found that the growth rate for health care spending, excluding Medicare, had stopped declining and appeared to be leveling off at 7.5 percent annually. Though that is smaller than the figure for some past years, it could cripple the economy soon enough, and my bet is that spending growth will resume its upward spiral before long --especially if the country finds a way to cover the 45 million Americans who now lack insurance. 
 The absence of more widespread alarm is a symptom of the cost-shifting and confusion that mask the seriousness of the disease. Health care is already consuming 15 percent of our national output, yet Americans are no healthier than people in comparable nations that spend much less. And nothing on the horizon suggests these costs will be constrained soon.
 Business should be worried because, no matter who writes the checks, we all pay the bill, and the miracle of compounding means that it will soon be staggering. Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton, has said that health care is expected to consume 28 percent of gross domestic product by 2030 -- and as much as 46 percent by mid-century.
 Some people have argued that advances in medical technology will eventually bail us out. Instead, those advances are likely to drive up costs by giving us more on which to spend, just as they have in the past. Other factors in this spending growth are the aging of the population, not to mention our national habit of overeating and underexercising. The impact will be amplified by the huge cost-shifting that characterizes our system. The cost of hospital care for the uninsured, for instance, is quietly built into hospital prices paid by the insured -- who in turn pass along part of their costs to Uncle Sam (through tax deductions). 
 New tax-sheltered health savings accounts, coupled with high-deductible insurance policies, are supposed to help by letting people set aside their own money for the first few thousand dollars of medical bills each year. But don't expect miracles from these new plans. People with chronic ailments probably won't choose them, resulting mainly in a tax giveaway to the healthy, affluent Americans who will. Besides, as Martin S. Gaynor, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, observes, relatively few Americans account for the bulk of all spending on health care. In one study, 10 percent of the people accounted for 69 percent of the cost. The implication is that helping most people to economize on routine medical expenses probably won't help much.
 The short-term impact of rising health care costs is cushioned by the tax breaks that come with medical coverage. Health insurance benefits are attractive to both employers and workers because they save both parties money, compared with an equivalent amount of regular wages. But by picking up part of the bill, the government is merely passing the buck to other taxpayers -- and masking the costs, while encouraging higher medical spending.
 Eliminating the tax deduction for traditional health coverage is the first step out of this morass. One advocate of such a move is Martin S. Feldstein, the Harvard economics professor and president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, who says it would increase federal income tax collections by $120 billion a year. In my view, businesses should stop providing health insurance altogether. It's a crazy, inefficient system that limits labor mobility and puts American firms at a big disadvantage. The $1,400 a car that General Motors spends on health care is one reason that Ontario, which has government health insurance, may soon surpass Michigan in automobile manufacturing.
 BEYOND that, it's time for business to mobilize its army of lobbyists for a national system of coverage that is comprehensive and competitive, and contains strong incentives not to spend. Like car insurance, it has to be mandatory -- for the healthy as well as the sick -- but left to individuals to buy. Through tax credits or other means, the government can provide it for those who can't afford it. We will also need a big national campaign to discourage unhealthy styles of living, which account for so much medical expenditure. And we will need coordinated deployment of information technology to find out what kinds of medical spending are worthwhile and what kinds aren't.
 Spending would probably still grow, but imagine if we could bring down the overall level to 12 percent of G.D.P. -- just halfway toward the roughly 9 percent that is the average in other advanced countries. If that happened tomorrow -- we're just imagining, remember -- we'd enjoy an annual windfall of more than $300 billion. I can't think of a better prescription for the economy.

HEADLINE: China's Splurge on Resources May Not Be a Sign of Strength

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
OVER the last year, the Chinese government and some of its largest companies have hopscotched the globe, from Australia to Angola and Canada to Sudan, writing huge checks. The idea is to secure supplies of oil and other raw materials with which to prime China's formidable industrial sector.
 Last month, as President Hu Jintao jetted around South America, Argentina won deals worth $20 billion, much of it in railways and energy exploration, and Brazil was not far behind, with China agreeing to build roads and pipelines to help get resources to market. 
 It is tempting to see this shopping spree as a sign of strength, or even proof of China's emergence, finally, as a true economic rival to the United States. 
 But many analysts look at China's global push for resources -- and especially the hefty prices it is paying -- as a sign of weakness and national insecurity. 
 The reason for Chinese anxiety, particularly in energy markets, is that big Western companies are already well established in the richest oil regions and can outdo China's producersfinancially. China also sees the American military presence in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan as part of a drive to control Central Asia's rich oil reserves. 
 ''China can be competitive in markets where they face the junior varsity, but not with the varsity,'' said Andrew Thompson, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in Washington. ''Paranoia is one way to describe their behavior. I would call it an acute awareness of their vulnerability. The new kids on the block who lack faith in the rule of law because they don't have it themselves, they don't see the international system as being in their favor, and engage in a constant quest for vertical integration in their business dealings, wanting to control every aspect of whatever it is they need. 
 ''The basic reality, though, is that they don't have the ability to compete internationally yet.'' 
 While a few nations where China is signing expensive oil deals are major producers -- like Iran, where Beijing committed $200 billion last month -- most are niche players. China is spending a reported $1 billion in an oil deal with Brazil that includes building a pipeline, an investment that some analysts say may cost three times the market value of the oil involved. 
 China has also invested heavily in Sudan to find, drill and ship an estimated 70,000 barrels of oil a day, a relatively small return. In Angola, China recently committed $2 billion to exploit an oil field with an estimated daily output of just 10,000 barrels. 
 If it turns out that China is paying too much for resources, the world economy could feel the effects. 
 In one closely scrutinized deal, China's state-owned Minmetals Corporation is bidding to purchase Noranda of Canada, the third-largest zinc producer and ninth-largest copper producer in the world, for a reported $5.5 billion. The deal is expected to include assumption of a substantial amount of debt not reflected in the cash price, and appears to be based on the assumption that commodity prices will stay high indefinitely, said Jason Kindopp, a China analyst at the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political-risk consulting firm. Mr. Kindopp said that China risked waking up one day to find itself holding vastly inflated contracts in a global recession in commodities, much the way Japan suffered major losses after having overpaid for international assets during its boom in the 1980's.
 The difference between Japan then and China now is that Japan's economy was far better prepared to withstand such shocks.
 ''Wanting to go out and buy equity in natural resources is not inherently wrongheaded, but you have to travel pretty far down the road, in terms of conspiratorial views of the world, in order to justify the way they are going about it,'' Mr. Kindopp said. ''China's economy is grossly imbalanced at this point, with an overwhelming dependence on investment versus consumption -- possibly the most imbalanced country in human history,'' he said, adding that ''China is paying peak prices for commodities today, and if their economy stumbles in any significant way, we are going to see really significant declines in the prices and some very serious pain as a result.''
 Other experts acknowledge a speculative bent in the way China is investing, but say the Chinese deem the prices justified by the sense of security they bring.
 ''Chinese companies are not as mature as Shell or BP, which can evaluate their risk better, but for now, their priority is to go out and find new supplies,'' said Han Wenke, vice director of the Energy Research Institute, a part of the Chinese government's State Development and Reform Committee. ''It is very difficult to say if these investments will pay off in the long term. But all of these companies -- state-owned companies -- have stockholders, and they will control that.''

HEADLINE: Misjudging Iran

BYLINE: By Ernest R. May

 BODY:

THE PERSIAN PUZZLE
The Conflict Between Iran
and America.
By Kenneth M. Pollack.
539 pp. Random House. $26.95.
 WHEN ''The Threatening Storm'' came out in 2002, it caused a sensation. The author, a Brookings Institution scholar who had been a Central Intelligence Agency analyst and the director of Persian Gulf affairs on President Bill Clinton's National Security Council staff, offered a measured and thoughtful argument paralleling that of hard-liners in the administration of President George W. Bush. The subtitle of the book was ''The Case for Invading Iraq.'' 
 ''The Persian Puzzle'' deals with the other big country in Kenneth Pollack's portfolio: Iran. To the question is it, too, a brief for pre-emptive war, the answer is a qualified ''no.'' Pollack (who, for the record, now says he made a mistake about Iraq, based on faulty intelligence) sees more cons than pros to a war with Iran -- too many Iranians, too many mountains, too many potential guerrillas and too many possibilities for trouble elsewhere. He finds more of a case for a pre-emptive strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, like Israel's 1981 bombing of the Iraqi nuclear facility at Osirak, but here too he sees more cons than pros. He recommends that the United States cope with the challenges posed by Iran by forming a tight combination with other nations and presenting Tehran with really big carrots and sticks, mostly economic.
 But ''The Persian Puzzle'' is most rewarding when it deals with the past, not the future. Many Americans were surprised to learn from the recent report of Charles Duelfer, the chief American weapons inspector in Iraq, that Saddam Hussein had pretended to have weapons of mass destruction because he was preoccupied with deterring Iran. Pollack reminds us again and again how often American assumptions about Iranian concerns were wrong. 
 The pivot of Pollack's narrative is the C.I.A.-sponsored 1953 coup that unseated the demagogic reformer Mohammed Mossadegh and entrenched young Mohammed Reza Shah. The coup created among Iranians a lasting belief that the United States not only wanted to but could control Iranian politics. Early on, Pollack quotes Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's 2000 St. Patrick's Day speech expressing regret at the ''setback for Iran's political development.'' He returns to it toward the end of the book, insisting that, however small the immediate result, confession of past errors is the starting point for avoiding future mistakes.
 The Americans who engineered the 1953 coup understood neither Mossadegh nor the shah. Mossadegh believed that the United States thought Iran vitally important and that he could win concessions from Washington by appearing willing to bargain with the Soviet Union -- making him look, to American eyes, like Moscow's cat's-paw. The shah saw himself as totally dependent on the United States yet so necessary to it that he could squeeze Washington like a protection racketeer -- and he did, most clearly in 1973, when he prodded OPEC into its most extravagant price gouging. (''The shah turned around and screwed us,'' Robert Hormats, then at the National Security Council, has been quoted as saying.) The shah's sense of dependency was most nakedly visible in his last days, when he considered trying bloody all-out suppression of the Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamist revolution but told the American ambassador that he could not take such action except on orders from Washington -- orders that President Jimmy Carter refused to give. Pollack is unsparing in his criticism of Carter administration policy making; hard-liners and soft-liners, he says, were both ''operating under completely false assumptions.''
 The litany of mutual misjudgments continues through chapters on Ayatollah Khomeini's rule, the hauling and tugging between theocrats and secular Westernizers that followed and the recent past, when, as Pollack sees it, the theocrats solidified control by following the Chinese model -- trading some social liberalization for surrender of all political power. Khomeini is said not only to have blessed taking the embassy hostages but to have held on to them with the specific aim of costing Carter votes in 1980 -+as a payback for 1953.
 The title of Chapter 7, ''At War With the World,'' captures the essential thread of the 1980's. Iran was at war with Iraq. At the same time it was building up Hezbollah and supervising plans for attacks like the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut. The internal struggles within the Reagan administration and the Iran-contra scandal may be highest on the register of American mistakes. The decision to put marines in Lebanon, Pollack writes, ''was a disaster for U.S. policy toward the region, and it was a disaster for U.S. policy toward Iran. It was a mistake to have intervened in Lebanon at all.'' Of Iran-contra he comments, ''Congress had denied the administration funding for the C.I.A. program to support the contras, but the N.S.C. and C.I.A. had found a way to tie one harebrained scheme to the other.''
 Not surprisingly, Pollack's view of the Clinton administration is more sympathetic. He gives Clinton's tough talking credit for Iran's pullback from anti-American terrorism after the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia. (Perhaps because of censors at the C.I.A. or N.S.C., he doesn't discuss the 9/11 commission's evidence that Iran facilitated the travel of the Saudis who were 9/11 muscle men.) Still, he concedes that the Clinton-era gestures came to naught. The hopes Pollack invests in his own recommendations seem to rest primarily on Tehran's pragmatic cooperation immediately after 9/11 and during the military campaign against the Taliban.
 For a background understanding of U.S.-Iranian relations, ''The Persian Puzzle'' is matchless. No one newly appointed to the second Bush administration will have time to read it, but every young person who wants to work in the national security apparatus should memorize it. Pollack says he started this book before an editor diverted him to writing a book on Iraq. That was a shame. If it had been the other way around, ''The Threatening Storm'' might have had a more cautionary thesis.

HEADLINE: Don't Revive the Death Penalty

BYLINE: By ANDREW CUOMO. 
Andrew Cuomo, who was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 1997 to 2001, ran for governor in 2002 .

 BODY:
CAPITAL punishment has been suspended in New York, following a state Court of Appeals ruling in June that the ''deadlock instructions'' in the death penalty law were unconstitutional.
 These instructions required a judge to tell the jury that if it failed to unanimously impose the death penalty, the defendant would be eligible for parole. The court reasoning that the fear of setting a criminal free might coerce a death penalty vote.
 Immediately after the court's decision, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, promised to cure the legal defect and quickly pass a new law. The governor put forward a bill in August. The Senate quickly followed suit. Fortunately, the Assembly leader, Sheldon Silver, announced that given the issue's profound importance, public hearings would be held. 
 The Democrats, who control the Assembly, should make it clear that they will not pass a new death penalty law. 
 This will take courage, but it is vital that they do so: We cannot rely much longer on a progressive Court of Appeals to intercede and prevent executions, as has happened since 1995, when the death penalty was reinstituted in New York. (Mr. Pataki had vowed to reinstate the death penalty in his campaign against my father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.) As judges appointed by Governor Cuomo retire over the next few years, Governor Pataki will install more conservative court members. 
 More important, there remains no evidence that the death penalty is a deterrent to crime and plenty of evidence that it is invoked arbitrarily -- and often mistakenly. Last year, 267 inmates nationwide had their death sentences overturned or removed, according to the Justice Department. This is the largest number in any year since 1976, when the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of state death penalty laws in a group of states. 
 Other developments since 1995 have also mirrored the growing doubts about capital punishment. 
 In 2000, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican who had supported the death penalty, imposed a moratorium on all executions in his state, citing instances in which death-row inmates were found to be innocent. And a recent report issued by the Justice Department shows death sentences nationally at a 30-year low. 
 At the same time, cases in which DNA evidence has established the innocence of people convicted of capital crimes -- along with concerns about racial bias in death-penalty sentencing -- have further undercut support for capital punishment around the country. According to a 2004 Gallup Poll, about half of all Americans say that convicted murderers should get the death penalty. But just under half instead support a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. 
 Public opinion has been shifting toward this second option, according to the Gallup organization. The poll also showed that 62 percent of Americans believe that capital punishment does not act as a deterrent, compared with 51 percent in 1991. 
 Nor does capital punishment make sense financially. Many studies show that it is more expensive for taxpayers to pursue executions than to sentence criminals to life without parole. Indeed, New York State has spent at least $160 million pursuing the death penalty since 1995. 
 Unfortunately, the prevailing thinking in Albany is that opposition to the death penalty is ''political suicide.'' I disagree. While the public overall still favors the death penalty, New Yorkers' opinions are shifting. 
 A poll conducted in 2003 by Quinnipiac University shows that a majority of New York Democrats oppose the death penalty and that a majority of all New Yorkers favor sentences of mandatory life without parole over execution. Such sentences did not exist when the death penalty law was passed in 1995. 
 Leadership can change public opinion, and this shifting point of view may become even more pronounced if the Assembly Democrats wage an intense debate on the issue, informing people of the facts -- and of the shortcomings of the bills awaiting action in the Legislature. While other states are instituting safeguards against police and prosecutorial misconduct and ensuring protection for mentally ill defendants in capital cases, for example, these issues are not addressed in the governor's or Senate's proposals. 
 For the public, the debate can begin as early as this week. The first of a series of public hearings on the death penalty is to be held in New York City on Wednesday. 
 The Court of Appeals ruling that suspended the state's death penalty has given New Yorkers a window of opportunity, a moment to enact a real reform. It should not be lost.

HEADLINE: Fertile Red States

BYLINE: By NOAM SCHEIBER

 BODY:
After this year's presidential election, pundits agreed that George W. Bush won by turning out conservative voters in greater numbers than Democrats turned out liberals. According to Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, that feat will only be easier for Republican candidates in the future. Instead of having to rely on the same conservative voters, Republicans may benefit from the fact that there simply will be more voters in conservative states. The reason, Longman argued in The Washington Post this summer, is that voters in red states are having children at much higher rates than their counterparts in blue states. 
 The numbers that Longman revealed were striking. In 2002, Utah, where Bush made his strongest showing this year, had the country's highest fertility rate (the number of births per thousand women of child-bearing age). By contrast, liberal Vermont had the lowest fertility rate that year. Furthermore, 15 out of the country's 17 most fertile states went for Bush in 2000. The Gore states today have an average replacement rate of 1.89 births per woman -- far below the rate of 2.1 necessary to prevent the population from shrinking. (The average rate of the Bush states is 2.06.) These trends are particularly meaningful when you consider that political convictions are often inherited. As Longman notes: ''It's a truism of social science that people wind up having the political and religious orientation of their parents.''
 You might object that state fertility rates are a crude unit of measurement, since states are not politically uniform and since people move in and out of them over time. But the evidence became even more compelling when Longman broke it down by demographic group. The fertility rate among Mexican-Americans, who tend to lean Democratic, is high but rapidly declining. Meanwhile, the Puerto Rican and African-American fertility rates are now only slightly higher than that of white America. But rural and religious white voters -- voters who went disproportionately for Bush -- seem to be reproducing at a rate far above the national average. 
 What accounts for the differences? Two factors, according to Longman. First, raising a middle-class child today is expensive. ''People don't have an economic reason to have kids,'' Longman says. ''They need another reason. God may provide that.'' Second, the cost of raising a child is much higher in urban areas than it is in rural areas. If Longman's math is right, then the slide from an evenly divided electorate in 2000 to a 51-48 split this year could be the beginning of a depressing trend for Democrats. NOAM SCHEIBER

HEADLINE: Micropolis, The 

BYLINE: By JON GERTNER

 BODY:
It's probably easiest to define a micropolis by what it isn't -- namely, a metropolis, which typically comprises a dense ''core'' city of more than 50,000 people surrounded by a large cluster of suburbs and exurbs. Since 1950, the United States Census Bureau has divided the country into broad swaths of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. According to the census, you were either in a metro area or you weren't. Any middle ground between big-city living and remote rural living went unrecognized. 
 That's no longer the case. This is the first full year the federal government has gathered data on 573 regions sprinkled around the country known as micropolitan areas: locales with a core city of fewer than 50,000 (as small as 10,000). In the South, that means Mount Airy, N.C., the model for Mayberry in ''The Andy Griffith Show''; in the Midwest, Ashtabula, Ohio; in the West, Heber, Utah; and in the East, Corning, N.Y. There's no typical micropolis -- Dodge City, Kan., and Bennington, Vt., present extreme variations within the category. Still, micro cities are generally more countrified than metro cities. Hub airports are usually very far away; so is good sushi. In addition, the suburbs of micropolitan cities often resemble the low-density exurbs at the fringe of many metro areas. Houses sit on large lots. Big-box retailers serve as commercial centers.
 The point of the micropolitan category is not so much to give government agencies extra data to crunch. It's to track the growth -- as well as the character -- of a type of influential urban area that already exists but is barely understood by demographers. In this regard, the census is far behind the business community, which has been tapping far-flung small-city America for at least two decades. Wal-Mart and Applebee's, in fact, have built vast empires from the legions who live there. So has the national Republican Party. Strictly speaking, the re-election of George W. Bush may have been less attributable to the so-called rural vote (which can still lie well outside micro or metro areas) than to the micropolitan vote. According to Robert Lang at Virginia Tech, in the newly defined micropolitan areas in the United States, Bush won 60.6 percent of the vote to Kerry's 39.2 percent. And in Ohio, 27 of the 29 micropolitan areas voted red -- a difference that by itself accounts for Bush's victory margin. JON GERTNER

HEADLINE: WORRIED ON WALL STREET

BYLINE: By C.J. Satterwhite

 BODY:
With the deficit growing, the trade gap widening and the dollar sliding, Wall Street leaders are lining up to offer economic advice to President Bush. Robert E. Rubin of Citigroup and Peter G. Peterson of the Blackstone Group weighed in last week. 
 At a forum at the ''21'' Club, Mr. Rubin, a former Treasury secretary, said that fixing the deficit would require ''revenue increases, improved savings, improved productivity, stronger growth abroad'' and ''perhaps a currency adjustment.''
 Mr. Peterson, a former commerce secretary, agreed. ''We're already borrowing $2.5 billion a day'' to keep the government going, he said, but younger workers still cannot count on Social Security and Medicare. ''The trust fund is an oxymoron,'' he said, referring to money set aside for the programs. ''It isn't funded and you shouldn't trust it.'' C.J. Satterwhite

HEADLINE: Democratic Providentialism 

BYLINE: By Michael Ignatieff. 
Michael Ignatieff is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author, most recently, of ''The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror.''

 BODY:
During this year's election campaign, President Bush liked to wind up his stump speech with a peroration about freedom -- and therefore democracy -- being not just America's gift to the world but God's gift to mankind. This line went down well, maybe because it carried the happy implication that when America and its soldiers promote democracy overseas, they are doing God's work, even in Iraq. 
 The name for this idea is democratic providentialism. It has become the organizing vision of an administration that took power in 2001 actively disdainful of highfalutin foreign-policy uplift. All that John Kerry and the Democrats could put up against it was prudent realism, and to the extent that the election was a referendum on vision, prudent realism lost hands down. The 2004 election closed out the final chapter in a fascinating realignment in American politics. Democrats, who once were heirs of big dreamers like Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, risk becoming the party of small dreams, while the Republicans, who under Nixon and Kissinger seemed determined to divest foreign policy of high moral purpose, have become the party that wants to change the world. 
 Of course, there is nothing necessarily good about dreaming big. Big dreams can be crazy. And dangerous. A lot of people -- including people of Christian faith -- found it alarming that a president could actually claim to know what God's plan might be, and scarier still that there were evangelical Christians divinely certain that George W. Bush was himself part of that plan. 
 But while you may not like the providential aspect of democratic providentialism, it remains true that the promotion of democracy by the United States has proved to be a dependably good idea. America may be more unpopular than ever before, but its hegemony really has coincided with a democratic revolution around the world. For the first time in history, a majority of the world's peoples live in democracies. In a dangerous time, this is about the best news around, since democracies, by and large, do not fight one another, and they do not break up into civil war. As a result -- and contrary to the general view that the world is getting more violent -- ethnic and civil strife have actually been declining since the early 1990's, according to a study of violent conflicts by Ted Robert Gurr at the University of Maryland. Democratic transitions can be violent -- when democracy came to Yugoslavia, majority rule at first led to ethnic cleansing and massacre -- but once democracies settle in, once they develop independent courts and real checks and balances, they can begin to advance majority interests without sacrificing minority rights. 
 Democracy has other advantages, some of them chronicled in a persuasive new book called ''The Democracy Advantage,'' by a trio of authors led by Morton Halperin, who had a hand in setting up the ''community of democracies'' during Madeleine Albright's time at the State Department. The real test of democracy is not how it does in countries that are already rich. The richest countries are all democracies, but they're the lucky ones that have cashed in the long-accumulating benefits of good geography, stable institutions and the profits of empire. The test is whether democracy works in poor countries without these advantages. Some analysts, like Fareed Zakaria, question whether you can stabilize democracy in countries where per capita income is below $6,000 a year. If you can't have democracy until development reaches this level, and if you need autocracy to get growth, then, according to some theorists, it might be smart for the U.S. to support growth-oriented autocracies like Vietnam or Singapore. 
 Halperin and his colleagues disagree with this ''development first, democracy later'' thesis. Democracy's advantage, they show, becomes apparent when you compare countries below $2,000 in per capita G.D.P. that have turned to democracy -- like the Baltic states, Mozambique, Senegal and the Dominican Republic -- with authoritarian states like Syria, Angola, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe. The poor democracies deliver more growth, lower infant mortality and higher life expectancy. And the recent sight of tens of thousands of people out in the freezing streets of Kiev, night after night, reminded jaded democrats everywhere that democracy is the one political system that says to every individual: you matter and your vote matters. So bad leaders can't treat democrats like fools and expect to get away with it. 
 While everyone likes the dignity conferred by democracies -- public-opinion surveys of Arab countries, for instance, indicate a clear preference for democracy -- not everyone believes they can deliver the goods. Disillusionment with democracy is growing in Latin America because the new democracies that replaced military rule in the 1990's failed to deliver promised growth. Some economists charge that democracies run up social spending to please voters, then get into trouble with deficits and can't sustain tough economic policies. Halperin and his co-authors argue that democracies tend not to run higher deficits, and while democracies sometimes lack discipline, they invariably avoid the worst errors -- like China's forced industrialization, which cost millions of lives in the 50's and 60's. 
 Despite the mistakes they have made, the Chinese pose a problem for the thesis that democracy works better than autocracy. Nasty, corrupt single-party rule in China has managed spectacular economic growth, with incomes growing nearly fivefold, from $186 to $944, between 1982 and 2002. Compare this with democratic India, which managed only to double its per capita income in the same period. China continues to attract an extraordinary share of investment going to developing countries. Its market is huge, its labor is cheap and the government keeps things stable. The question, however, is how long growth and autocracy can be combined. The Communist Party now represents no more than 5 percent of the population, its corruption angers millions of people and sooner or later both the winners and losers of the Chinese boom will demand a say in how they are governed. Democracy may take a while to arrive in China, but unless it does, it is not obvious how the party is going to manage China's growing tensions -- between city and country, classes, regions and sectors -- peacefully. In the recent Indian election, by comparison, the Hindu-dominated B.J.P. government kept claiming credit for the Bangalore-led software and call-center booms of the 1990's, but poor voters, who had not seen any trickledown, threw them out of office. If the incoming Congress Party government keeps its promises to these voters, democracy will show how it can balance growth with greater equity, a lesson China had better learn fast.
 Promoting democracy -- not just good governance -- is such a good idea that Halperin and his colleagues even suggest that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund abandon the technocratic pretense that they just dispense economic advice and start promoting democracy as a prerequisite for economic progress. The Bush administration's ''millennium challenge account'' does just that: it aims to distribute up to $5 billion of U.S. overseas assistance for the first time to those countries that ''govern justly'' and ''invest in their people.'' 
 For Americans, the problem is what to do when democracy and national interest conflict. Speaking to the National Endowment for Democracy last year, the president acknowledged that America won't have a viable political strategy against Islamic terrorism unless it stands up for democracy in the Islamic world. The problem is that if the U.S. does so, new regimes voted into power after elections in Egypt or Pakistan might be violently anti-American. ''One man, one vote, one time'' is another genuine concern: Islamists (or secular authoritarians) using electoral democracy to abolish democracy itself.
 So promoting democracy is risky, but propping up autocrats only delays the day of reckoning with popular anger. Throughout the cold war, the U.S. backed authoritarians like the shah in Iran, which put America on the wrong side of a genuinely popular uprising against tyranny, the Shia revolution of 1979. The United States has been paying the price in terrorism, nuclear proliferation and hostility ever since. 
 Trying to set elections aside when they go against your interests is another mistake, as France learned when it supported the Algerian military in canceling an election that would have brought Islamists to power in 1992. It's better to have the Islamists in office -- making mistakes, learning the disciplines of serving electorates -- than to back autocracies that fail their people. The ruling party in Turkey is Islamic, and democracy, plus the hope of joining Europe, has disciplined its radicalism. 
 The hardest lesson of all for a powerful democratic people to learn, however, is not whom to back but how to manage their own grandiose expectations. The United States can promote, encourage and sustain democracy, but it cannot impose it. In 2000, adroit American assistance to the Serbian opposition helped topple Slobodan Milosevic, but that is bound to remain an exception. The United States can help give people a chance at free elections, but it is the people themselves who must anchor free institutions in their own soil. Democratic providentialism feeds the illusion that America is the driver of world history. America has power and should use it, but history does not always serve American grand designs.
 The pessimists say democratic providentialism, having apparently squeaked by in Afghanistan, will meet its Waterloo in Iraq. Already, influential Sunni parties are calling for a postponement of the elections, lest widespread Sunni abstention and the difficulty of holding elections at all in Sunni areas combine to bring the Shia masses to overweening power. The insurgency is trying to strangle democracy at birth by killing any Iraqi who signs up to work for the Allawi government. If the insurgency succeeds, the cost of failure -- to ordinary Iraqis, let alone to the U.S. -- will be enormous. Unless Iraq gets semilegitimate institutions next year, and a constitution that allocates resources and powers to each of Iraq's constituent peoples, the U.S. invasion will have traded a dangerous dictatorship for a failed state and terrorist enclave. 
 Pessimists say the U.S. is imposing democracy at gunpoint in Iraq, but the evidence is that millions of Kurds and Shia, and some Sunnis as well, passionately want free elections in their country. There is no reason that American soldiers cannot help them ensure a relatively free electoral process just as they have helped out in Afghanistan. This moment, frightening and precarious as it is, is the last chance Iraqis have to exit from the black tunnel of Ba'athist rule and the chaos of incipient civil war.
 Giving them this chance requires the administration to live up to its rhetoric. The president's faith that God is on the side of freedom and democracy may be one reason that he has been so casual about detail and was so astoundingly assured in claiming ''mission accomplished'' in Iraq when the mission had barely begun. Another question mark over the administration's commitment to democracy abroad is its attitude toward democracy at home. Democracy is something more than red-state majority rule. The democratic faith also requires respect for the judiciary, deference to constitutional separation of powers, decent respect for the opinions of mankind, not to mention democratically ratified treaty law like the Geneva Conventions and, last but not least, the humility that goes with knowing that you serve the people, not a providential design that only you and other true believers can understand.

HEADLINE: Tax-Cut and Spend Conservatives

BYLINE: By Jonathan Chait

 BODY:
Two types of economic policies have come out of the Bush presidency. The first pleases conservatives and infuriates liberals (tax cuts, other tax cuts, some regulatory freezes and still more tax cuts). The second infuriates liberals and conservatives also (the farm bill, the Medicare bill, various tariffs). As for good-government centrists, it's hard to find a single one who's happy with the way things are going.
 A typical expression of conservative discontent is ROME WASN'T BURNT IN A DAY: The Real Deal on How Politicians, Bureaucrats, and Other Washington Barbarians Are Bankrupting America (HarperCollins, $24.95), an entertaining eruption by the former Republican representative and current MSNBC talking head Joe Scarborough. Scarborough is mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore. He's also extremely confused. He deplores the bloat of the federal budget under Bush, lingering in detail over the proliferation of pork-barrel spending -- he admits with honest shame -- in Republican Washington. 
 ''During Bill Clinton's two terms and a G.O.P. Congress,'' Scarborough concedes, ''federal spending grew at a rate of 3.4 percent, whereas government spending has grown at a dangerous 10.4 percent clip during George W. Bush's first term.'' He is honest enough to recognize the problem, but can't quite bring himself to the solution: since Republican-controlled government can't produce the spending cuts he wants, and he hates deficits, shouldn't he favor raising taxes?
 Peter G. Peterson, a successful investment banker and former secretary of commerce under Richard Nixon, understands the problem and the solution. In RUNNING ON EMPTY: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24), Peterson lays out, as he has in previous books like ''Gray Dawn,'' the bleak fiscal future that awaits us. A lifelong Republican, he casts himself in the role of nonpartisan straight talker by distributing blame equally. ''It's hard to say which party is being more irresponsible,'' he writes.
 Hard to say? A brief history lesson is in order. Peterson's rock-ribbed fiscal conservatism was once Republican orthodoxy. About 25 years ago, though, supply-siders began taking over, insisting in their zeal for tax cuts either that economic growth would wipe away deficits or, as Dick Cheney is reported to have said in a 2002 policy strategy meeting, ''Reagan proved deficits don't matter.'' Around the same time, Democrats began to embrace deficit reduction, enshrining it under Bill Clinton as the reigning fiscal dogma of the Democratic Party. To keep up his show of evenhandedness, Peterson must ignore inconvenient facts. For instance, Democrats (and sometimes a few Republican moderates) wanted this year to reinstate the pay-as-you-go rule, requiring new spending or tax cuts to be offset by spending cuts or tax increases. Bush and the Republican majority stymied them -- they'd rather not have to pay for new tax cuts. One of the reasons it's easy to get away with being irresponsible is that, no matter how irresponsible you are, the worst thing nonpartisan statesmen like Peterson will say is you're no worse than the other side.
 What about the so-called liberal media? Shouldn't the press uncover these fiscal shenanigans? ''Fat chance,'' Jack W. Germond says. In FAT MAN FED UP: How American Politics Went Bad (Random House, $24.95), Germond acknowledges that he, like most political reporters (he is a former political columnist for The Baltimore Sun), leans liberal in his personal views. You might think this would color coverage of economic policy, but few political reporters know or care about policy. Germond is open about this: ''It isn't easy for most of us to get emotionally caught up in an argument over the capital-gains tax rate or trade relations with Latin America.'' And he openly states the tacit assumption of most campaign reporters that personality matters far more than substance: ''In the end, it is far wiser to focus attention on the kind of people who are running rather than which one seems to have the best plan for providing drug coverage to old folks.'' That sounds a lot like George W. Bush's re-election strategy, doesn't it?

HEADLINE: Adolescent Angst: When the Karate Kid Fell for Jon Bon Jovi

BYLINE: By KEVIN CAHILLANE

 BODY:
BON JOVI had me from hello or, to be precise, from the first shrieking synthesizer riff of ''Runaway,'' the band's ode to jailbait that became a sweaty hit in 1984. That was also the year my address changed and my voice broke. While ''Runaway'' was pop cocaine, there was little reason to believe that 20 years later the boys from the Garden State 'burbs would stand atop a mountain of 100 million albums sold -- especially given that their limp second single, ''She Don't Know Me,'' made fans of no one, particularly English teachers. 
 Even so, the two songs set the template for the Bon Jovi catalog -- aspartame-infused ballads that alternated with preening rock bombast. Both styles carried hooks that snagged you by the ears like a schoolmarm and relentlessly hung on for weeks. Critics dismissed the band as a guilty pleasure at best, but Bon Jovi's music soothed my alienated adolescent soul. 
 So why resurrect that dear-departed teenager now? Well, the release last month of a five-disc Bon Jovi retrospective, ''100 Million Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong'' (Island), sent me careering down the dim-lit halls of nostalgia. 
 I was 14 in 1984 when Bon Jovi dented pop-culture consciousness. That was also the year my parents ruined my life. I was savoring halcyon, hayseed days in rural Washingtonville, N.Y., when they decided that the economic prosperity of the family trumped my burgeoning romance with the eighth grade field hockey team. So we moved south of the border to New Jersey, to Mountain Lakes, where I was forced to try to assimilate into the mysterious suburbs. I was like the Karate Kid minus the beautiful blonde girlfriend, sage mentor and, well, the karate. While not exactly the stuff of James Dean-like mythology, my outsider status made me low-hanging fruit for the safe, cinematic teenage rebellion that Bon Jovi was selling and the entire world bought in 1986 with the release of the album ''Slippery When Wet.'' 
 ''Slippery'' shot directly to the heart of the youth market with a healthy dose of histrionic love songs for a generation that would eventually move on to Kurt Cobain, Nirvana and unintelligible love songs. While contemporaries like Depeche Mode built detached compositions about anything but love, Bon Jovi played their forlorn hearts out. From the goofy anthem ''You Give Love a Bad Name'' to the gritty romanticism of ''Livin' on a Prayer,'' Bon Jovi sang of painfully ordinary lives redeemed by the fits, starts and occasional epiphanies of love and it's hideous stepsister, love in vain. 
 Even Jon Bon Jovi's liner notes in the boxed set read like a love letter with key words like ''thank you'' written in caps they way a lovesick schoolgirl might. 
 Yet, the band's approach worked. One of the most defiant lyrical meditations on devotion I've ever heard is from ''Born to Be My Baby'' off the ''New Jersey'' album:
 Light a candle, blow the world away
 Table for two on a TV tray
 It ain't fancy, baby that's O.K.
 Our time, our way
 Now, you may prefer your rock music without the cheese, but to an 18-year old schoolboy burdened by virginity and crippling SAT scores, it sounded like the future.
 Jon Bon Jovi's music stopped speaking to me sometime in the 90's. Truth be told, though, maybe we just grew apart. Like the girls used to say: ''It's not you. It's me.'' I eventually gave up on the desperate throes of youthful passion and graduated to different, if not altogether more satisfying, music. Bon Jovi was the soundtrack of high school, Chunky chicken soup for the sophomore soul. It spoke to the rock stars we had planned to become rather than the accountants or programmers or baristas we became. 
 Not that I don't still rock all night. It just so happens that there's a baby on my lap.
 Somewhere along the way, too, I got the impression that guys who listened to Bon Jovi best left that fact buried in the closet, next to those dog-eared copies of Playboy. But let's face it. I'm not cool. I drive a minivan. Even the title of the boxed set, ''100 Million Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong,'' seems designed to ease any lingering guilt over my callow cultural transgressions. It states in large type: ''You, sir, are not alone in your pedestrian tastes.'' 
 Yet, Bon Jovi needs no apologist. The numbers speak for themselves, though 100 million albums sold doesn't quite equal 100 million fans. After all, I bought two myself. While math teachers and skeptics may cringe, Bon Jovi does not appear ready to say goodbye any year soon. 
 Which is just as well, because I'm not quite ready to lose the old mullet yet.

HEADLINE: Strategic Extremism

BYLINE: By PAUL TOUGH

 BODY:
It may be hard to believe these days, but in fact, Americans are pretty moderate people, politically. Even on deeply emotional issues like abortion, public opinion tends to coalesce around a mushy compromise position somewhere close to the middle of the road. So why do party platforms and campaign rhetoric tend toward extreme positions? 
 According to a paper in the October issue of the Harvard Institute of Economic Research, there may be a calculated reason behind the nation's current political divide. The lead author, Edward L. Glaeser, a Harvard economist, argues that the parties are employing a tactic that he calls strategic extremism. When the political landscape is balanced in a very particular way, he writes -- the way it is right now -- ''extreme political platforms that deviate sharply from the median voter's preferences can be vote-maximizing.'' 
 There are two main conditions that have to be met before strategic extremism can work. The first is the presence of a lot of voters with relatively extreme positions who don't vote regularly. This was the idea behind Karl Rove's ''base'' strategy this year: target the four million evangelicals who didn't vote in 2000, as well as other reluctant voters with similar positions. If you fire them up enough, you can afford to lose a few voters in the middle.
 The second condition is what Glaeser calls informational asymmetry. Strategic extremism works only if you are able to target your extreme messages solely at your own base. The polarization of the media has made this easier -- an interview on Fox News will reach more right-leaning voters; an interview on Air America will reach more left-leaning voters. Direct mail (the field in which Karl Rove got his start in politics) is probably the most effective narrow-casting strategy of all. 
 But at the same time, there are other emerging technologies that make this approach risky. Blogs, ''oppo'' researchers and even the mainstream media can reveal a candidate's red-meat rhetoric to the other side, thus firing up his opponent's base. It is anyone's guess, Glaeser says, which set of tools will be more effective in the future. ''Everything depends upon whether changes in technology increase the ability to target faster than they increase the ability to reveal,'' Glaeser says. ''It's direct mailing versus Drudge, and reducing extremism depends on the Drudges expanding faster than the direct mailers.'' 
 Despite the president's campaign rhetoric, Glaeser doesn't expect him to expend much political capital in his second term on the cultural and religious issues that his base cares about. ''This has to do with energizing the base and getting elected,'' Glaeser says. ''I'll be very surprised if this is where he chooses to put his energy.'' PAUL TOUGH

HEADLINE: An Era More Forgettable Than Collectible

BYLINE: By PAUL DUCHENE

 BODY:
YEARS from now, archeologists digging through the garages of societies long gone may be baffled by a lack automotive artifacts from a period of the late 20th century. Little of the evidence that would tell the story of what Americans drove from the mid-1970's through the 1980's awaits their excavations. 
 Whether this is a result of so few desirable cars having been offered in the United States at that time, or a legacy of Generation X drivers who may not care enough about cars to collect and preserve them, is open to debate. Other factors, including antipollution laws and oil shortages, are certainly part of the picture. 
 Signs of this ''lost generation'' phenomenon can be seen at collector events and custom car meets. Enthusiasts from Generation X -- the nearly 50 million Americans born from the mid-1960's to the late 70's -- are conspicuously absent, and the cars of their formative years as young drivers, about 1975-90, are very few. Instead, the parking lots are filled with V-8-powered street rods owned by gray-haired boomers, or the low-slung Japanese compacts from the '90s and later, customized by the Generation Y ''Fast and Furious'' crowd with superchargers, 1,000-watt stereos and 20-inch wheels wearing tires like strips of spandex. The two groups have little in common.
 Dan Cyr, a producer of big hot rod and custom car shows from Portland, Ore., can see merit on both sides of the argument.
 ''Chrysler was still recovering and trying to make it with K-cars and Ford had a Mustang shaped like a box with bumpers,'' Mr. Cyr, 62, said. ''The car manufacturers were too strapped with worries about 5 m.p.h. bumpers and the fuel economy to do anything creative.''
 Mr. Cyr, an enthusiast since he first bought a 1940 Ford coupe for $125 in 1956, has four sons. The older two followed in his tire tracks, but the younger ones, now 34 and 38, grew up playing soccer and video games.
 ''They have no motor oil in their veins,'' he said. ''One drove an old Toyota pickup and the other a Honda.'' 
 Brian Moody, road test editor for Edmunds.com, the online auto shopping Web site, recalls how disappointing it was to grow up in the 1970's.
 ''It seemed like all the cars were being built for my Dad,'' he said. ''There was nothing I thought was cool.''
 There are generational differences at work, too. Ann Fishman, an analyst who has tracked such issues for the United States Census Bureau and now for her own company, Generational Targeted Marketing, said that Generation X was the first generation reared in homes where divorce was commonplace, and that made them self-reliant and practical, the savviest consumers yet.
 ''They didn't have much money and they learned to appreciate quality and value; they're like living versions of Consumer Reports,'' Ms. Fishman said. ''Boomers thrive on spin, Gen Xers want substance.''
 Wolfgang Gotschke is the design manager for Ford's Special Vehicle Team, or SVT, responsible or Ford's F-150 Lightning pickup and other projects. He recalls starting in the business in 1979. 
 ''It was a dreadful time for our profession,'' he said. ''The new cars were terribly uninspiring, like the Ford Fairmont.''
 Mr. Gotschke added: ''If you grew up in that time you did not get into cars, you got into music, break-dancing, skateboards, BMX bikes. Clothes became more important than cars.''
 He and his friends bought big 60's cars and he recalls cruising in a giant Chevy convertible. ''The interest in old cars was a clear indication there was nothing new desirable enough to spend money on,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Cheers, and Concern, for New Climate Pact

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER and ANDREW C. REVKIN; Larry Rohter reported from Buenos Aires for this article, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York.

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
With the United States keeping to the sidelines, delegates from more than 190 countries have gathered here both to celebrate the enactment of the Kyoto Protocol, the first treaty requiring cuts in greenhouse gases linked to global warming, and to look beyond 2012, when its terms expire.
 Many delegates and experts concede that the pact, negotiated in 1997, is deeply flawed and that years of delays in finishing its rulebook mean that many adherents may have trouble meeting their targets for emissions cuts. 
 Its impact will also be limited because it exempts developing countries, including fast-industrializing giants like China and India, from emissions restrictions, and lacks the support of the United States, the world's dominant source of the heat-trapping gases.
 Nonetheless, delegates and United Nations officials say the treaty, which has been ratified by 130 countries and international blocs, and takes effect on Feb. 16, is an important step. It is the first time industrialized countries have agreed to mandatory constraints on carbon dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas and an unavoidable byproduct of burning the fossil fuels powering modern economies. 
 The treaty commits the three dozen industrialized countries taking part to cut combined emissions of the gases by 2012 to at least 5 percent below levels measured in 1990. 
 It also establishes for the first time an international trading system allowing countries to earn credits toward their treaty targets by investing in emissions cleanups outside their borders. 
 For example, European investors agreed last month to buy credits from a project that will produce electricity at a Brazilian dump by burning 31,000 tons of methane a year emanating from rotting trash. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas. 
 The meeting, which opened last Monday with informal discussions and culminates on Thursday and Friday with rounds of public debate among senior government officials, is equal parts international negotiations, trade fair, lobbying session and pulpit. 
 While global warming has long been portrayed mainly as an environmental problem, here it is also cast as an economic and even human rights issue.
 More than 6,000 attendees are milling in convention halls that resemble a kind of greenhouse bazaar, where businesses are trumpeting the merits of everything from windmills to nuclear power, which do not add to the atmosphere's greenhouse-gas burden. In a host of presentations, environmental and human rights groups have been showing how the accumulating gases stand to imperil some of the world's poorest countries and native cultures. More broadly, the conference reflects a world that remains deeply divided over what to do about the buildup of greenhouse gases that climate experts say has caused most of a 50-year warming trend.
 Experts now largely agree that if oil and coal burning continue to increase at current rates, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will more than double in this century from pre-industrial levels, causing warming that could disrupt climate patterns and raise sea levels. 
 World leaders also agree that actions must be taken to avoid harmful human influence on the climate. Where agreement quickly dissolves is over how to accomplish that. 
 Many experts say the Kyoto pact will end up being just one facet of a decades-long shift toward limiting greenhouse gases, carried out in different ways in different places. 
 There are essentially three camps in the climate debate reflected in discussions here: those welcoming the Kyoto pact; those opposed to an internationally set cap on emissions; and the world's poorest countries and native cultures, which fear they will be the first to bear the consequences of climate shifts they did little to bring about. 
 Europe and Japan, where energy taxes and conservation have long been the norm, have been the biggest supporters of the pact. Experts in international relations say it has also helped to cement the European Union, which has already created its own internal ''cap and trade'' system for carbon dioxide and the other gases as a result of the treaty. 
 Russia waffled for years, but ratified the Kyoto treaty last month, in part to help forge economic ties with Western Europe and because it could gain billions of dollars in foreign investment and income under the treaty's trading mechanisms.
 The treaty is also a focus for American companies with international operations or markets. Although the United States government has rejected the Kyoto pact, businesses must pay attention. 
 ''Almost 40 percent of our production and 50 percent of our sales are outside the United States, and we're going to be under the European Union caps and trading and allocation system,'' said Mack McFarland, a DuPont company representative at the conference. 
 The United States and large developing countries, for different reasons, reject mandatory emissions restrictions and are unlikely to shift anytime soon, many experts and negotiators say. 
 China and India insist that wealthy countries, which generated most of the existing pollution, must take the initiative. 
 President Bush has focused on a long-term effort to find new ways to produce energy without harmful emissions.
 Many of the world's poorest countries have come to demand aid and action in light of scientific projections that conclude they will be the first to bear the brunt of climate shifts. 
 ''It all underscores the necessity of all the communities of the world to work together to solve the world's worst problems,'' said Enele S. Sopoaga, the ambassador to the United Nations from Tuvalu, a Pacific nation where the highest point is 15 feet above the waves. 
 Because of its rejection of the protocol, the United States government has emerged as the favorite whipping boy of many participants in the conference. 
 On the official level, however, other governments appear eager to find a way to re-engage the United States. The European Union has suggested a two-track approach to addressing what to do after 2012, using as frameworks both the Kyoto Protocol and the original convention to which the United States was a signatory.
 That approach is intended ''to assure that all parties participate in the discussions'' about the future, said Yvo de Boer, a Dutch official who is the head of the European Union delegation. ''By having the broad discussion, we are offering them an opportunity to participate and we would be very keen to see them do that.''

HEADLINE: Deportation Case Riles Colorado Town

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: RIDGWAY, Colo., Dec. 8 

 BODY:
The Sargsyan family came from Armenia in the 1990's already primed with many of the attributes that small-town rural America respects. They worked hard, paid their bills on time, learned English rapidly, excelled in school and were good-looking as well, people here say. 
 In this mostly white ranching and retirement town of about 700 people near the Telluride ski resort, the Sargsyans also brought a tincture of foreign exoticism that many residents found bracing. 
 ''These are the kind of people you want as immigrants, the kind that made this country great,'' said Dr. Richard Engdahl, pastor of the United Church of the San Juans, which meets in the local community center. 
 But what happened next says as much about the town as it does about the family. After the Sargsyans were threatened with deportation earlier this year -- they had entered the country on student visas and gotten jobs instead, the government said -- a kind of collective howl went up here over what was perceived as a terrible injustice.
 The anger filtered through the tiny Ridgway School, where Hayk Sargsyan (pronounced sarg-SEE-yan) is a senior in the 17-member class of 2005. And it erupted from Dr. Engdahl's church, where Hayk's sister, Meri, is a pianist. 
 The Sargsyans were in trouble -- Hayk, Meri and two other family members were placed in detention in early November -- and many people said that was all they needed to know. Dr. Engdahl offered at least half a dozen sermons on the subject.
 Heidi Comstock, an assistant office manager at a medical clinic up the road from Ridgway's one traffic light, said, ''This was an opportunity to make a difference at a time when there's a feeling of helplessness on a lot of other levels about the world.'' 
 A fund-raiser with Armenian food and a silent auction raised $15,000 for legal bills. Students began a letter-writing campaign to anyone who might be able to help, from the county commission to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Immigration and Customs Enforcement bureau. 
 A seven-hour bus trip was organized to visit the four family members who were being held at the immigration detention center near Denver, and about a third of the town's 150 middle and high school students went. The student body president, Rachel Overton, 17, said the experience taught her how to properly organize a protest rally.
 [On Thursday, the family members in detention were released; they are still awaiting the outcome of their case. A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said officials had decided that the Sargsyans presented neither a risk of flight nor a threat to national security. On Saturday, the town held a welcome-home reception at a park.]
 But the effort to save one family has also exposed the town, people here say, to some thorny questions and consequences. The family patriarch, Ruben Sargsyan, 62, who had been a scientist in Armenia working on optics for the Soviet space program, lost his job frying doughnuts on the night shift at a local bakery after the furor erupted, residents say.
 And the uncertainty about the family's permanent status has led some people to say they fear a loss of innocence as a small town accustomed to participatory democracy bumps up against a vast and faceless bureaucracy. If a local official in Ridgway makes a boneheaded decision, a resident can step up and say so the next time they bump into each other at the True Grit Cafe, which is the closest thing to a town nerve center. The Department of Homeland Security, with its tens of thousands of employees of somber mandate to protect the nation, does not lend itself to hands-on folksiness.
 ''People here still have this faith and belief that if we write the right letter and reach the right politician, we can make a difference,'' said Susan Lacy, the secondary school principal at Ridgway School. ''I worry about the students becoming cynical too soon,'' she added.
 Students like Rachel Plavidal, a 17-year-old classmate of Hayk, say the government is simply wrong in prosecuting the Sargsyans.
 ''It's definitely giving me a negative impression of the government, that they could do this,'' she said. ''It just seems like the laws are being compromised.''
 Other people say the effort illuminates how little attention is paid to other immigrants in the community, especially those from Mexico. And most people admit that the support probably would not be so universal if the family were Muslim. The Sargsyans are loved, many people say, because they fit in so well, and they fit in because they personified the shared values and ideals of the town.
 ''These people stood up and took part in this community, and let's face it, they have more in common, culturally, with this community than a lot of the Hispanics,'' said Rodney Fitzhugh, a lawyer who practices in Ridgway and nearby Montrose and who represented a member of the Sargsyan family, Nvart Idinyan, 30, in a divorce case a few years ago. 
 Mr. Fitzhugh said that he supported the campaign for the family, but that he also hoped it made people think about immigrants not as well loved as the Sargsyans.
 ''I champion it in part because it might shed light on these other cases,'' he said.
 The Ouray County sheriff, Dominic Mattivi Jr., said he thought the Sargsyan case revealed the uneven enforcement of immigration law by the government in small communities like Ridgway, where Hispanic immigrants have become economic mainstays, especially in the construction and tourism industries. 
 ''Unless a Mexican commits a felony, they don't want to hear about it,'' Sheriff Mattivi said of the immigration service.
 And the rules are tough to enforce, he said, given the proximity and porousness of the United States' border with Mexico. One Mexican resident who was recently convicted on a drug charge was deported, Sheriff Mattivi said, but was back in town and at work just two weeks later. 
 The family's visa troubles began after Ms. Idinyan's divorce, when her ex-husband turned in the family to the authorities. Family members say the ex-husband, a United States citizen who has since left the country, was also the person who arranged the family's immigration, defrauding them in the process. He took money from the Sargsyans and other Armenians, they say, for arranging student visas that he falsely promised did not require enrollment in school. 
 The family's lawyer, Jeff Joseph, has filed an application under a visa program for victims of immigrant trafficking. Mr. Joseph said the two boys, Hayk and Gevorg, who is a sophomore in chemical engineering at the University of Colorado in Boulder, were legally adopted before their 16th birthdays by Ms. Idinyan's new husband, Max Noland, who is a United States citizen, and that they should be protected from deportation by that shield as well.
 A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Carl Rusnok, said he could not comment on the outlook for the family's case. He said he thought the matter would be concluded within the next few months.
 Dr. Engdahl at the Church of the San Juans said the Sargsyan case was bigger than one town or one family because of the questions it raised about how security fears after Sept. 11 were changing the nation.
 ''The country once welcomed people like them, but if we're not that country any more, because we're so concerned about being violated, what does that do to the United States?'' he said. ''That's the question we should be asking.''

HEADLINE: Sales Are Soaring And Hollywood Is Split Over Dividing Profits

BYLINE: By ROSS JOHNSON

 BODY:
When things look darkest in Hollywood, there is always a cavalry over the next hill.
 In a town whose economy runs on the slimmest of margins, the latest savior is the DVD, which has filled the coffers of the studios, driven up the stars' salaries and altered the economics of making movies and television.
 Now the question is whether there is enough money in the DVD windfall for everybody.
 Dividing revenue from DVD's is the contentious issue in negotiations between Hollywood producers, represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, and the combined bargaining teams of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Radio and Television Artists. The two sides began meeting in Los Angeles last Monday to fashion a new three-year film and television contract. 
 The dispute has already led to infighting over Robert Pisano, the chief negotiator and national executive director of the Screen Actors Guild, who also sits on the board and is also a shareholder of the online DVD rental company Netflix. More important, the dispute has raised the possibility of an actors' strike. Most people within the industry believe that another prolonged strike by the actors (the last was in 2000) would be a crippling economic blow for the entire entertainment industry.
 ''No one doubts that the actors have the power to shut down the town,'' said John Ptak, an agent at the Creative Artists Agency, which represents the actors Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks. ''The question is -- and it's the one only the actors can answer -- if it's worth it to them over DVD's.''
 DVD's are just the latest example of a technology that, like the videocassette recorder in the 1970's, Hollywood studios greeted with skepticism -- if not outright hostility -- only to see the breakthrough add to their bottom lines. 
 In 1996, the year before the home DVD player was introduced, consumers spent $6 billion buying VHS tapes, and $9.2 billion renting them, with the studios taking in 75 percent of sales and 20 percent of rentals. In 2004, according to Adams Media Research, consumers will spend $24.5 billion buying and renting DVD's and VHS tapes. Almost $15 billion of that will be in DVD sales, and nearly 80 percent of that will go to the studios through their home entertainment divisions. 
 The explosion in DVD sales has changed the calculus of the Hollywood hit. Last year, ''Finding Nemo'' sold $339.7 million in tickets when it was released to the nation's movie theaters. It went on to capture a greater amount -- $431 million -- in home video (including DVD) retail sales and rentals. 
 Despite the inflow of cash, the studios have refused to change a home video residual formula for the creative talent guilds that puts only fractions of pennies of each DVD sale into the hands of most actors, writers and directors. 
 ''Sixty percent of studio films never, ever, recoup their cost,'' said a Warner Bros. executive who refused to be identified and who has participated in several recent labor negotiations on the side of the producers' alliance. ''We need the huge profits of some of the money makers to cover the losers.'' 
 The producers successfully held the line on DVD profits in recent negotiations with directors and writers, but negotiators for the 120,000 members of SAG and the 20,000 members of Aftra have signaled their willingness to fight harder for their piece of the pie. 
 At issue in the negotiations is a 23-year-old formula that was designed when some major studios were not even in the home video distribution business. The formula held 80 percent of home video wholesale revenues for the distributor. (In the case of the major studios, their home video distribution arms are kept on a separate balance sheet.) Writers, directors and actors then receive a small portion -- 1.8 to 5.4 percent -- of the remaining 20 percent. 
 To understand just how the formula works in the age of DVD sales, however, look at Dave Chappelle, star of ''Chappelle's Show'' on Comedy Central. Mr. Chappelle's show is wildly popular on cable -- a limited audience compared to network television -- with around three million viewers.
 Last February, Paramount Home Entertainment, part of the Viacom conglomerate that owns Comedy Central, bundled Mr. Chapelle's first 12 episodes into a DVD boxed set. It shipped just 35,000 sets to the nation's video retailers.
 ''Paramount just dumped the DVD out there,'' said an executive who helped broker the initial employment deal between Mr. Chappelle and Comedy Central and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
 To the amazement of studio executives, sales of the boxed set, which included many of the words that were bleeped when the shows were broadcast, had reached 2.2 million units by the end of November, and had returned close to $37 million in wholesale revenues to corporate parent Viacom.
 Mr. Chappelle's reward was a renegotiated deal with Comedy Central that will also earn him several dollars for each future boxed set of DVD's sold, paying him a total of around $25 million a year. 
 The reward for the rank-and-file actors who performed on ''Chappelle's Show''? They will divide 12 cents for every DVD sold, the figure determined by the residual agreement. 
 One studio executive, who asked not to be identified, admitted that the current home residual formula is ''arcane,'' but said that the studios are willing to fight for it. ''As long as actors don't want to share in the downside risk, we're not going to mortgage our future,'' the executive said. 
 As in almost any labor negotiation, the actors and their employers are facing more than just financial issues. Chief negotiators for the actors, Mr. Pisano from SAG and Aftra's executive director, Greg Heffinger, were not available for comment. J. Nicholas Counter, president and chief negotiator for the producers' alliance, also was not available for comment.
 Seth Oster, the spokesman for SAG and Aftra in the negotiations, said that while the DVD issue is at the forefront of many actors' feelings about a possible future strike, actors' negotiators ''are also trying to get important gains in health contributions by the producers, and we want more protection for background actors and stunt players.''
 Activist members of SAG have pressured Mr. Pisano to ignore pattern bargaining and use his experience at Netflix to get the actors a better DVD residual deal in contract talks. 
 In June, the board of directors of the union's Hollywood branch cited the Netflix issue when attempting to remove Mr. Pisano from contract negotiations. In July, two SAG members filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court arguing that Mr. Pisano's involvement with Netflix conflicted with his position as a chief negotiator for the actors. Mr. Pisano, who revealed his Netflix association to SAG leaders before he was hired, has denied any such conflict.
 Meanwhile, for the lucky few who have benefited the most from the DVD explosion -- the stars whose deals give them a percentage of all revenue -- life goes on without a lot of worries about a collective-bargaining agreement on DVD residuals. 
 ''It's not really something that some of our clients have to worry about,'' said Mr. Ptak of the Creative Artists Agency. 
 Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, the co-creators of ''Seinfeld,'' split 25 percent of the adjusted gross revenues of the television show, a percentage that will eventually earn them about $250 million each, according to the executive familiar with their deal. 
 Last year, Mr. David and Mr. Seinfeld approached the rest of the ''Seinfeld'' cast and asked them to participate in the taping of interviews and commentary for a DVD boxed set of the almost 200 episodes of the show. 
 The cast members, including Jason Alexander, Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Michael Richards, then did some collective bargaining of their own. Noting that they had made much less from the show than its creators, the three actors refused to record anything for the DVD versions until each was paid advances against royalties for future sales. 
 ''Seinfeld'' Seasons 1 through 3 were just released in DVD boxed sets. Each set is expected to easily surpass the current sales record holder in for DVD boxed sets of TV series, which is HBO's ''Band of Brothers,'' whose retail sales have been $44 million to date. 
 While rank-and-file actors nervously await the outcome of the current contract talks, publicizing DVD's has just become part of the job description for big stars in Hollywood.
 ''For actors or directors who get a piece of the gross of all revenues, they're happy to show up at a party for a DVD launch or record some supplementals for the DVD version of their movies,'' Mr. Ptak said. ''Some will ask for expenses, maybe 10 or 15 thousand dollars, but how much can you charge for coming to a party?''

HEADLINE: M.I.T. Technology Review Adopts More Serious Tone

BYLINE: By VICTORIA SHANNON

 BODY:
Technology Review at M.I.T., like many similar magazines, was born during a technology boom. In The Review's case, that boom took place in the late 1800's, which may help explain why it has outlived so many of its recent imitators, like Red Herring and The Industry Standard.
 Now Technology Review, which was introduced in 1899 with such titillating headlines as ''The Function of the Laboratory'' and ''Applied Science and the University,'' is getting a makeover with help from a refugee of the latest tech bubble. Jason Pontin, the former editor of Red Herring before that magazine's collapse in 2002, has remade The Review for more sober times. 
 ''We want to levelly and intelligently analyze today's and tomorrow's technology,'' Mr. Pontin said. ''The magazine didn't have the elegant seriousness we intend.''
 Technology Review is also expanding in size -- from 10 to 12 issues a year and from 56 to 72 pages a month -- and in scope; new features will include reviews and synopses of scientific articles and innovations. The first redesigned issue is on newsstands this week with a fresh look from the company of Roger Black, the well-known graphic designer. 
 The ostensible goal of a redesign is to attract more readers and advertisers, each of which, in this case, provide about half of the magazine's revenue. But editorially as well as commercially, this is a more subdued version than the last one in 1998, which injected a cheerleading breathlessness into its coverage that left some academics cold.
 Mr. Pontin said the new image tries to project more seriousness. ''We will never be gee-whiz,'' he said.
 The Review's makeover comes at a time when other magazines are gingerly stepping back into the technology arena. A new Red Herring magazine returned to newsstands this fall, and the publishers of The Daily Deal, a newspaper for investment advisers, are preparing a monthly called Tech Confidential.
 Although Technology Review was among the few titles that survived the dot-com blowout -- the original Red Herring and The Industry Standard did not -- it has yet to make an annual profit. The publication is still subsidized by M.I.T. for an undisclosed sum, and about 95,000 of its 315,000 readers get the magazine, which sells for $5 an issue, for free through the institute's alumni association, which buys it in bulk as its official newsletter.
 ''We're working as hard as we can to get to break even,'' said R. Bruce Journey, the chief executive of Technology Review Inc., the nonprofit company owned by M.I.T. that publishes the magazine. Licensed versions are now being published in China, Russia, Poland, South Africa, Germany and several other countries.
 Mr. Journey earns a high salary. He did not dispute a report in the Boston Globe last month that put it at $317,000 in 2002. ''It hasn't changed in three years,'' he said last week. 
 Like Scientific American and Popular Science, Technology Review is trying to take advantage of a new interest in the discovery of technology, some media experts believe. 
 ''We believe it's a very strong sector,'' said Eric McClure, media director of DCA Advertising in New York. ''We look at the readers of a Technology Review or a Scientific American as intelligent, well-educated, generally influential people.''
 Mr. Pontin is trying to give the magazine's accent on the business of technology innovation more impact by recruiting writers from The Economist and The New Yorker with generous payments of up to $5 a word for articles on topics ranging from ''The Future of Books'' to ''What We Can Learn From Robots.''
 Still, Technology Review is not the intellectual publication of the pretechnology boom times.
 ''It's far more enthusiastic about what technology can do for us,'' said Kevin Finneran, editor in chief of Issues in Science and Technology magazine, published by the University of Texas and the National Academies. ''The earlier Technology Review was more likely to look at the social and political dimensions of science and technology.'' Mr. Pontin promises a grounded approach this time. ''We want to be skeptical,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bright Spots From Those Dull Years

BYLINE: By PAUL DUCHENE

 BODY:
HAVING trouble recalling those really desirable and affordable collectible cars of the mid-70's through the 80's? 
 Though the selection may be sparse, there are a few nuggets from those otherwise bleak times. Here are some that are worthy of consideration as collectibles.

1974 MGB/GT: The coupe version of the classic British roadster offered improved weather protection. Best of all are the V-8-powered models, though only about 2,500 were made, and none were certified for sale in the United States. Typical prices for cars in excellent condition: $6,000-$8,000.

1985-86 DODGE SHELBY OMNI GLH: With tuning by Carroll Shelby, creator of the Cobra, the turbocharged 4-cylinder of Dodge's economy sedan put out 146 horsepower and 0-60 times of 7.5 seconds. (GLH stood for ''Goes Like Hell.'') It's safe to assume that most have been used hard; survivors are rare. $2,500-$5,000.

1984-86 FORD MUSTANG SVO: Aside from the hood scoop and the dull gray color this could be mistaken for any plain-Jane Mustang of the 80's. It handles well and has a high-strung turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. But the car required fastidious maintenance. $6,000-$9,000.

1982-83 AUDI COUPE: Several levels of the two-door Audis were available, ranging from front-drive 100-horsepower models to turbocharged versions with the Quattro all-wheel-drive system, a car with many rally wins to its credit. Insist on complete maintenance records and be ready to pay extra. $3,000-$9,500.

1976 CADILLAC ELDORADO CONVERTIBLE: The front-drive Eldorado was (enormously) restyled in 1971 and stayed largely unchanged through '77. The '76 model was promoted as the ''last convertible,'' which means that many were bought as investments and were rarely driven. $12,000-$22,000.

1987 BUICK REGAL GRAND NATIONAL: Named for the Nascar series in which these brawny coupes ran, the squared-off Buicks used a turbocharged version of the company's 3.8-liter V-6. The best of the breed were the limited-production GNX models, pumped up to 275 horsepower -- but the tweaks doubled the price to $29,290. Most people cannot tell the GNX from the cheaper Grand National. $14,000-$43,000.

1979 CHRYSLER 300: This gussied-up Chrysler Cordoba is probably the only one of the series that will ever be worth collecting. Most have been cosseted -- probably because they cost $1,500 extra when new. Figure on $5,000 to $8,000 -- and don't break its special grille.

1981-86 JAGUAR XJ6 SERIES III: The last update of the original 1969 design added some rear headroom to the classic British wood-and-leather interior. It handles beautifully, but the usual caveats about its unreliable Lucas electrical system apply. $3,500-$8,000.

1981-83 DeLOREAN: Owners who doggedly held on are getting their money back 20 years later. The DeLorean has a stainless-steel shell and gullwing doors, but also an anemic 2.8-liter V-6. Still, John Z. DeLorean's spectacular fall from grace means everybody recognizes the car. DeLorean built 8,583 cars in its three-year run. Some owners painted over the stainless body, which can look as dull as a dirty kitchen sink. $17,000-$26,000. PAUL DUCHENE

HEADLINE: Taiwan Watches Its Economy Slip to China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
When the Lenovo Group Ltd. of China agreed last week to buy I.B.M.'s personal computer division in exchange for cash and a large block of Lenovo stock, it was an even greater shock for people in Taiwan than those in the United States.
 Taiwan prides itself on being the ''silicon island'' of East Asia; after all, the place has nurtured some of the world's largest manufacturers of computer chips, laptop computers and notebook computers. But businesses in Taiwan have been slow to establish brands known to retail customers. And now, with I.B.M.'s powerful PC brand slipping into the mainland's hands, those companies may soon find it even harder to trump their mainland counterparts and move beyond their role as low-cost producers. 
 ''You look at China, how fast it's moving, it's incredible,'' said Frank Huang, chairman of the Powerchip Semiconductor Corporation, Taiwan's third-largest computer chip maker. ''Nobody knows if it will work for Lenovo, but at least they have the guts to try.''
 A big advantage that Lenovo and other Chinese companies have over companies in Taiwan these days is that many corporations and investors want their stock: China has become one of the hottest investment plays in the world, despite the poor performance in recent years of Chinese stock markets and poor corporate governance at many Chinese companies, as shown most recently by the loss of $550 million in derivatives transactions by the China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Corporation. 
 But voters in Taiwan may have raised the appeal of their island as a place to do business. In legislative elections on Saturday, they unexpectedly preserved the thin majority of lawmakers opposed to repeated moves by President Chen Shui-bian to increase Taiwan's political independence from mainland China -- steps that Beijing has labeled as provocative and has said could possibly lead to war.
 The most ardently pro-Beijing and anti-Beijing political parties fared worst of all, as voters tended to support more moderate candidates and parties on both sides of the independence issue -- those who had taken more pragmatic positions in favor of preserving the status quo with Beijing, and in some cases had taken an interest in the economy instead of concentrating solely on ideological differences.
 Voters ''are in favor of a conciliatory, stabilizing approach by both sides so that both sides can create a better, more competitive economy for Taiwan,'' said Andrew Yang, the secretary general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a nonprofit research group here. ''That truly will encourage more investment.''
 Over the years, as many politicians here focused on the emergence of an identity for Taiwan distinct from that of China, the economy became ever more closely intertwined with that of the mainland.
 After decades of relying mainly on the American market to lift its 23 million people out of poverty, Taiwan now finds itself exporting twice as much to China as to the United States. Foreign direct investment in Taiwan has dropped by more than half in the last five years; the figure is now less than a fifteenth of the tidal wave of money pouring into new factories, office buildings, shopping malls and other projects in China. Overseas money managers do invest substantial sums in Taiwan's stock market, however, partly to match its weighting in global stock market averages.
 Close to a million people from Taiwan have moved to the mainland, most of them highly skilled managers and workers from ages 30 to 50 , in a brain drain so great that both multinational companies and those based in Taiwan struggle to find qualified employees here.
 ''We now are faced with a shortage of skilled labor -- in the past, we were known for an endless supply of skilled labor,'' said Hu Sheng-cheng, the chairman of Taiwan's powerful Council for Economic Planning and Development.
 Economic dependence on the mainland may someday limit Taiwan's political options, but it has also produced considerable gains lately. Powered by exports, Taiwan's economy has been growing briskly for more than two years, interrupted only by a short, sharp drop in the spring of last year because of an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Unemployment has fallen steadily for the last two years, to 4.3 percent in October.
 To keep that expansion going, business leaders here say they will need better trade and transportation links with the mainland. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party says that it can negotiate direct flights and direct cargo shipments.
 Yet while candidates for the legislature have been mostly silent on economic issues, senior policy makers in the administration of President Chen have been quietly removing some trade barriers. They have been doing this partly to comply with Taiwan's admission to the World Trade Organization three years ago and partly to attract foreign investors who want to maintain business networks spanning all of Asia.
 Taiwan passed a new and more stringent copyright law this summer, delighting foreign recording and publishing companies, and it is close to adopting a law protecting pharmaceutical trade secrets -- legislation sought by Merck and other pharmaceutical companies. Taiwan's police have been cracking down on counterfeits; they have helped Gillette, for example, control an inflow of counterfeit Duracell batteries from the mainland.
 While computer and semiconductor companies have moved many manufacturing operations to the mainland and have set up substantial research labs there, cutting-edge research still tends to be done here and in the United States, said Betty Lin, the Taiwan research manager for IDC, a big information technology consulting company.
 Domestic companies, multinationals and the rest of the business community here have been united in demanding closer business links to China and an end to lingering protectionism toward many goods from the mainland. Working through the American Chamber of Commerce here, General Motors has been lobbying for an end to Taiwan's restrictions on imported Chinese auto parts, and Mars has sought to bring in mainland chocolate.
 Taiwan currently has import limits on mainland goods in 15 percent of the categories of industrial goods and 35 percent of the food and agricultural categories. But it is reviewing these restrictions and gradually removing some of them, said Huang Chih-peng, Taiwan's director general of foreign trade.
 As factories have moved to the mainland and been replaced by hospitals, banks, insurers and other service industries, income inequality has risen in what had been one of Asia's most egalitarian societies after the land reform that followed World War II. The ratio of average incomes in the top 20 percent of the income distribution to the bottom 20 percent has climbed to 6.07 to 1 this year, after hovering at 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 for many years. 
 Retirees and people with limited skills in an increasingly high-technology economy have been hurt the most, despite the recent economic gains. ''In the past five years,'' said Wu Chong-shia, a 74-year-old retired engineer, ''Taiwan's economy has been going downhill.''

HEADLINE: China Relents, And Promises Textile Tariffs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Monday, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
The Commerce Ministry in China announced Sunday night that it would impose tariffs on some textile exports, a step that could avert a trade war with the United States and the European Union over a new influx of low-cost Chinese garments that had appeared likely to flood Western markets starting Jan. 1.
 The ministry's Web site, where the announcement was posted, did not specify the level of these export taxes or what textiles would be taxed. If the tariffs are not high enough to limit the competitiveness of Chinese exports, then the Bush administration could still proceed with recent threats to impose new limits on shipments by China.
 The Chinese decision nonetheless represents the first sign of compromise on the contentious issue by China, and appears to represent a victory for the Bush administration. The administration has been under strong pressure from apparel manufacturers and their workers in Southern states, who had warned of large-scale layoffs if nothing was done. 
 A complex system of quotas has limited international trade in textiles and apparel for decades but will expire on Jan. 1 under an agreement worked out in 1993 as part of the creation then of the World Trade Organization. Chinese manufacturers have been expanding their factories in preparation to increase exports once the quotas are lifted.
 The Commerce Ministry said in its statement that the goal of the tariffs would be to encourage Chinese producers to manufacture higher-end textiles and apparel instead of selling a full range. A minimum tax will be set for each garment regardless of what each garment costs. If the tax is $1 a shirt, for example, it might discourage the production of T-shirts in China, for which the wholesale price is much less than $1 a shirt, but not silk blouses with much higher price tags. 
 ''This is part of a string of measures China will take to ensure a smooth transition for textile integration following the end of the quota system,'' Chong Quan, a ministry spokesman, told the official New China News Agency. 
 A Commerce Ministry aide declined to elaborate.
 The Chinese decision to impose export tariffs under Western pressure will mean that American and European shoppers are less likely to see lower price tags on an influx of everything from underwear to Chinese-made Armani ties. But for seamstresses in North Carolina and in dozens of developing countries that compete with China, the decision announced Sunday could mean a reprieve from fiercer competition and possible unemployment.
 China is not the first country to impose voluntary restrictions on its exports in the face of threatened retaliation by the United States. Japan imposed quotas on its exports of cars to the United States through the 1980's to allay worries from Detroit that it would take over much of the American automobile market.
 Detroit repeatedly complained that the Japanese had set their quotas too high. It is similarly possible that the Chinese export taxes will not be set high enough to satisfy American textile and apparel producers or the Bush administration.
 The Commerce Ministry said only that the tariff rate would be set ''by considering the conditions of textile manufacturers.'' There was no immediate reaction on Sunday from Washington to the Chinese decision.
 Carl B. Weinberg, the chief economist of High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y., said tariffs would probably not leave Chinese manufacturers selling any less than they do now but could prevent them from reaping gains next year. ''However, it is a setback to the W.T.O. objective of reducing constraints on world trade,'' he said.
 Before China was allowed to join the W.T.O. in 2001, Clinton administration officials insisted on a special provision of the so-called Chinese accession agreement that would allow the United States to impose new limits on Chinese textile and clothing imports from 2005 through 2008. The provision allows the United States to impose limits if Chinese exports disrupt American garment markets or even threaten to do so.
 The Bush administration has already ordered new limits on Chinese shipments of four categories of clothing, and has threatened limits on a wide range of additional categories. European officials had also signaled their strong opposition to a new influx of inexpensive Chinese textiles.
 W.T.O. rules now prohibit the kind of semi-voluntary export quotas that Japan imposed on its car shipments in the 1980's. But Jim Leonard, the United States deputy assistant secretary of commerce for textiles and apparel, said at a recent news conference in Hong Kong that the United States would welcome any Chinese effort to make the end of global textile and apparel quotas a more harmonious process.
 He said then that Chinese officials had refused to discuss export limits. 
 Willie Fung, the chairman of Hong Kong-based Top Form, the world's largest maker of brassieres, with operations in China, Thailand and the Philippines, said in a recent interview that Beijing had been nervous about facing lawsuits alleging the export of garments below cost, a practice known as dumping.
 As a result, Beijing has been trying to discourage companies from quickly moving factories that make T-shirts, socks and other inexpensive garments to China from other developing countries while encouraging production of more specialized clothing, for which antidumping lawsuits would be harder to prove.
 The Bush administration signaled again over the weekend its intention to limit Chinese shipments if China did not do so, by announcing that shipments this month in excess of quotas for 2004 would not be allowed into the United States in January, and would only be allowed to trickle in thereafter. 
 Japanese automakers responded to export quotas by making Lexuses and Acuras instead of compact cars, increasing the threat to Detroit. As Chinese garment factories produce costlier goods, they may pose a new challenge to American companies.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Opposition to Social Security privatization is based on arithmetic, not ideology. David Brooks asserts that private accounts, ''based on conservative historical averages,'' will get an average return of about 4.6 percent. The problem is that the future is projected to be different from the past. 
 The economy is projected to grow more slowly, primarily because of slow growth in the labor force. Slower economic growth translates into slower growth in profits and stock prices. 
 Using standard assumptions about the mix between stocks and bonds, private accounts should get a return of less than 3.5 percent, after deducting administrative costs. This is only slightly better than the 3 percent return on the government bonds, meaning that privatization only adds risk.

To the Editor:
 My work as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Brookings Institution, the Council of Economic Advisers and the Bureau of Economic Analysis has left me with a good pension, Social Security and an annuity. 
 I do not believe that I would have had the discipline or financial savvy needed to build a comfortable retirement by investing in the market -- and I had the advantages of a strong middle-class background and a good education.
 It is not a patronizing attitude that leads many liberals to doubt that the more poorly paid and poorly educated workers would not be well served by having to manage a portion of their Social Security. 
 It is an understanding of the realities of the economic situation of these workers, and an understanding that someone holding down a low-paying job (or two) and scrambling to make ends meet is just not in a position to do a reasonable job of managing those funds.

HEADLINE: A Hostile Land Foils the Quest for bin Laden

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN and DAVID ROHDE; James Risen reported from Washington for this article, and David Rohde from Peshawar, Pakistan. Mohammed Khan contributed reporting from Peshawar.

 BODY:
Hunting for Osama bin Laden, the C.I.A. established a series of small, covert bases in the rugged mountain frontier of northwest Pakistan in late 2003. Mr. bin Laden, the terrorist leader, was being sheltered there by local tribesmen and foreign militants, the agency had concluded, and controlled a group of handpicked operatives dedicated to attacking the United States.
 But since the bases opened, the C.I.A. officers stationed there have been strictly supervised by Pakistani officials, who have limited their ability to operate and have escorted them wherever they travel in the Pakistani border region. As a result, it has been virtually impossible for the Americans to gather intelligence effectively, say several officials familiar with the operation who would only speak anonymously. 
 More than three years after the Sept. 11 attacks on the Pentagon and New York transformed Osama bin Laden into the most wanted man in the world, the search for him remains stalled, frustrated by the remote topography of his likely Pakistani sanctuary, stymied by a Qaeda network that remains well financed and disciplined, sidetracked by the distractions of the Iraq war, and, perhaps most significantly, limited by deep suspicion of the United States among Pakistanis. 
 Prodded by the United States, Pakistan began an offensive along its northwest border this spring to flush out forces of Al Qaeda that had escaped from Afghanistan and to help find Mr. bin Laden. But after suffering heavy casualties and causing civilian deaths that stirred opposition, the Pakistani Army declared victory two weeks ago and announced that Mr. Bin Laden was not in Pakistan. Many American intelligence officials are confident that he is, however -- and that he is as dangerous as ever. 
 The war in Afghanistan inflicted severe damage on Al Qaeda, forcing it to adapt to survive, intelligence specialists agree. Today, they say it functions largely as a loose network of local franchises linked by a militant Islamist ideology. But Mr. bin Laden remains much more than just an iconic figurehead of Islamic militancy, most American intelligence officials now say. From a presumed hiding place on the Pakistani side of the Afghan-Pakistan border, he controls an elite terrorist cell devoted to attacking in the United States, the officials say they suspect. They contend that he personally oversees the group of Qaeda operatives, which he hopes to use for another ''spectacular'' event, like the Sept. 11 hijacking plot. 
 American counterterrorism analysts say this special Qaeda unit is probably dispersed, though they do not know where. This ''external planning group'' can communicate with regional affiliates around the world to work with them when needed, one senior intelligence official said. ''There is a strong desire by bin Laden to attack the continental United States, and he wants to use the external planning node to do it,'' the official said. 
 But the United States has failed to penetrate the group and has no idea when or where it will try to strike, the officials acknowledged. Intelligence officials would not provide any details of how they reached their conclusions about Mr. bin Laden's current role, which have not previously been reported.

Protective Network
 Many analysts are convinced that he is being protected by a well-financed network of Pakistani tribesmen and foreign militants who operate in the impoverished border region, and that they have helped him communicate with major figures in his network. ''Bin Laden is getting his logistical support from the tribes,'' said one intelligence official. ''He still has operational communications with the outside.'' 
 The place suspected of being Mr. bin Laden's hide-out, in the shadow of the Hindu Kush mountain range, is in one of the most isolated and backward corners of the world. Pakistan's frontier is a barren terrain of mountains and mud. The fiercely independent ethnic Pashtun who inhabit the region are farmers and smugglers, most of them poor and illiterate. Local mullahs preach a radical Islamic ideology that portrays the United States as bent on enslaving Muslims and destroying their culture. 
 Sympathetic to the Taliban, many of whom attended madrasas, or religious schools, in the region, militant young tribesmen perceive American soldiers as dangerous aggressors who have occupied Afghanistan and Iraq and they view Mr. bin Laden as an avenging hero. Pakistan prohibits Western reporters from entering the area without a military escort. 
 The seven semiautonomous tribal areas in the region have been a virtual no man's land for American forces since the Sept. 11 attacks, making them a natural haven for Qaeda figures who fled Afghanistan after the battle of Tora Bora in 2001.
 Pakistan does not permit American military and intelligence forces in Afghanistan to cross the border to go after militants. This prohibition on cross-border ''hot pursuit'' makes it relatively easy for Taliban and Qaeda fighters to initiate attacks on American bases in Afghanistan, and then quickly escape to the safety of Pakistan. American soldiers have complained about being fired on from inside Pakistan by foreign militants while Pakistani border guards sat and watched.

Has Hot Pursuit Cooled?
 As a result of the restrictions, American military and intelligence personnel in Afghanistan are no longer really hunting for Mr. bin Laden, an intelligence official said. They are trying to provide stability for Afghanistan's new government while battling a local Taliban insurgency and a scattering of Qaeda fighters. On Saturday, the United States military began an offensive in Afghanistan to pursue those militants.
 While the United States conducts some air operations over Pakistan, they are tightly controlled. Unmanned Predator drones are authorized to fly over Pakistani airspace, but only with approval from the Pakistani military chain of command, frequently leading to costly delays, C.I.A. officials say.
 Electronic surveillance of the border region by the National Security Agency has proved frustrating as well, American intelligence officials say. Mr. bin Laden is believed to avoid using any electronic devices that could be monitored, and probably communicates only through trusted couriers, American intelligence officials say. Without cellphone towers along the frontier, satellite phones and push-to-talk radios are widely used often by drug smugglers, making it difficult to zero in on Qaeda operatives using the same kind of equipment. 
 Hoping to collect more intelligence, the C.I.A. opened secret bases with small numbers of operatives in Pakistan in late 2003, but it has been unable to use them for aggressive counterterrorism operations, intelligence officials say. The operatives, many of whom are C.I.A. paramilitary officers, depended on Pakistani Army commanders, whose views on cooperation with the C.I.A. vary widely, American officials say.
 ''There are real limits on our movement'' inside Pakistan, said one American official, and it has deeply frustrated intelligence officers. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to discuss any aspect of the clandestine bases. 
 Pakistani officials said that the Americans were instantly identifiable and unlikely to succeed working alone. They say the Americans are escorted to prevent them from being kidnapped or killed, or their presence exposed, which would be damaging to the Pakistani government. 
 The decision to allow the bases is one of President Pervez Musharraf's most significant steps to help the United States, intelligence officials say. He is trying to balance his alliance with the United States with his need to avoid setting off a broader insurgency in the border region, where the central government is resented for its long neglect. Government officials said that some militants from other parts of Pakistan have gone to the tribal areas to join the fight.

Reluctant Allies
 Though the Americans had pressed the Pakistanis to search for Qaeda forces since late 2001, the military campaign was begun only after two assassination attempts against General Musharraf in December 2003 were traced back to the tribal areas. Before that, Pakistani officials had stated that there were no foreign militants in the region. 
 The army eventually deployed 25,000 troops in South Waziristan, one of the tribal areas, and found several terrorist training camps. In October, Pakistani commanders said they had killed 246 militants and captured 579. The raids and sweeps had a heavy cost. About 200 Pakistani soldiers were killed, and tribal members said hundreds of civilians had died. 
 On Sept. 9, for example, an air raid near the village of Dela in South Waziristan killed as many as 80 civilians. Young men from the Mehsud tribe, many of whose members died in the incident, began flocking to the militants. ''That was a turning point,'' said Rahimullan Yusufzai, a Pakistani journalist. ''Their friends, their relatives and people they knew were killed.''
 No precise numbers exist, but Pakistani officials estimated that 500 to 1,000 of the tribesmen were fighting beside 150 to 300 foreign militants, most of them Uzbeks. Pakistani analysts say the area's tribal structure is fraying. Drawn by the wealth, sense of belonging and promise of paradise that the militants offer, unemployed young tribesmen are openly defying edicts from tribal leaders and taking up arms, Mr. Yusufzai said. ''These young men refuse to listen to their elders, to their families,'' he added.
 Local residents have said that they were caught between the army and the militants. Nisar Wazir, 56, a teacher in Wana, a town in South Waziristan, said in a telephone interview that the American and Pakistan governments had neglected the tribal areas after supporting militants there in the 1980's anti-Soviet jihad. Asked if Mr. bin Laden was hiding in the tribal areas, Mr. Wazir responded angrily. ''America brought Osama bin Laden to this region,'' he said. ''They know his whereabouts better than me.''
 Despite the Pakistani government's efforts to win over residents by building schools, wells and roads there, cooperating with Pakistani and American investigators continues to be considered ''napak kam,'' or dirty work, among many tribesmen, Pakistani officials say. 
 Aside from tribal members, the militants may be getting help from some officers in Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, the country's powerful intelligence agency. The agency was the hidden power behind the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan and was close to Al Qaeda. Pakistani civilian security and police officials complained in the past that intelligence agency personnel have sometimes interfered with their efforts to arrest Qaeda members. 
 Pakistani officials warn that suspicion of the United States prevents a significant American presence. Since the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, many Pakistanis fear that the United States will bomb Iran to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons, and that Pakistan will be next. 
 One Pakistani security official said opposition to American forces in the country would be widespread. ''The day the American troops cross into Pakistan territory, that will be the day when the Pakistani government will be hard put to stop the people who say, 'Why don't you reverse your position on helping America?''' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''They already say, 'You have done too much to help America.''' 
 Some American intelligence officials say that the war in Iraq provided a powerful new recruiting tool for Al Qaeda. The conflict has diverted resources -- C.I.A. paramilitary personnel and pilotless Predator surveillance aircraft -- from Afghanistan to Iraq in 2002, several current and former intelligence and administration officials said. They contend the war in Iraq weakened the focus of the United States, giving Al Qaeda time to regroup. Pakistan has been a sanctuary for some Qaeda figures since soon after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan. When the Taliban government fell in the winter of 2001, some Qaeda leaders went west to Iran, but a large group of Qaeda members, including many of Mr. bin Laden's lieutenants, went south to Pakistan, intelligence officials say. 
 By spring 2002, South Waziristan had become ''the hub of Al Qaeda operations in the whole world,'' one senior Pakistani official said. Local religious leaders offered the militants houses, while poor tribesmen collected handsome rents on their homes. 
 They soon established a highly effective security system. A network of tribesmen augmented by radios and satellite phones acted as lookouts and notified them whenever more than one vehicle left a new Pakistani army base in Wana. ''They could get warnings,'' said a senior Pakistani official. 
 The foreign militants are flush with cash, use a highly sophisticated code when communicating, travel in small groups at night, are disciplined and have access to laptop computers, Pakistani military officials say. The network has even sent e-mail messages, letters and DVD's to Pakistani soldiers fighting in the tribal areas urging them not to kill their fellow Muslims on behalf of America, according to Western diplomats.

A Pre-Election Warning
 The C.I.A. has intermittently received information about Mr. bin Laden's movements along the Pakistani frontier, but it has always come too late to act against him, officials said. ''There is no credible information that he has ever left the border region'' since Tora Bora, one American analyst said. 
 Many American analysts have concluded that Ayman al-Zawahiri, the Egyptian who is Mr. bin Laden's chief deputy, is also along Pakistan's border -- in the tribal lands or an adjacent region -- but is no longer with Mr. bin Laden. American officials contend that the two men separated for security reasons, but remain in close communication. That may explain why over the last year or more they have each issued audio and videotapes broadcast over Arab television, but have not been seen or heard together.
 Days before the American presidential election this fall, Mr. bin Laden released a videotape warning the United States to change course to prevent future attacks. In contrast to his haggard appearance in his videotaped message televised in September 2003, Mr. bin Laden appeared vigorous. C.I.A. officials say they are not certain of the state of his health, but have long been dismissive of reports that he suffered from kidney disease or some other serious ailment. 
 Despite the shortcomings of the Pakistani border campaign, the Bush administration contends that General Musharraf has taken great personal and political risks to side with the United States against Al Qaeda, and is unwilling to push him too hard or too publicly. Out of deference to President Musharraf, the official United States position on Mr. bin Laden's whereabouts is that he is on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, a description that avoids pointing fingers at Islamabad. 
 American counterterrorism officials cite the vital role Pakistani security services have played in catching Qaeda operatives, including several important figures, in Pakistan cities. In urban areas, security officials can argue that they are doing police work, and can arrest Qaeda operatives one by one without much political unrest. ''The key high value targets that have been picked up in Pakistan have been picked up in the cities,'' one American intelligence official said. ''We haven't gotten any out of the border.'' A benefit of the recent campaign is that it has forced foreign Islamic fighters from lowlands of South Waziristan into mountains and forests, other tribal areas or Pakistani cities, American and Pakistani intelligence officials say. ''It caused movement, and hopefully that will expose them and we can target them,'' an American said.

A 'Success' Meets Skepticism
 At the end of November, the Pakistani government called the South Waziristan operation a success, saying that Mr. bin Laden was not there. Meeting with President Bush in Washington recently, General Musharraf declared that Pakistani forces had ''broken the back'' of the Qaeda network in his country and destroyed its training bases.
 Many American intelligence officials have been skeptical of the effort, though, noting that the Pakistanis often alerted tribal leaders to raids beforehand and mostly only snared foot soldiers. To rout Al Qaeda and find Mr. bin Laden is going to require a much more sustained campaign by the United States and Pakistan, intelligence officials from those countries say. The United States is spending $4.5 million to help build roads, wells and schools in the tribal areas, an amount dwarfed by the $18 billion the United States is spending on the reconstruction of Iraq. Pakistani officials and others say economic development, locally elected government and full integration of the tribal areas into Pakistan are the only way to eradicate militancy from the isolated area.
 ''To really neutralize and eliminate them, it will have to be a lot more effort,'' said Talat Masood, an Islamabad political analyst and former general. ''They are still a very potent force.''

HEADLINE: Karzai Plans To Destroy Poppy Fields In 2 Years

BYLINE: By NAT IVES

 BODY:
Hamid Karzai, who was sworn in Tuesday as Afghanistan's first popularly elected president, said yesterday that he planned to destroy the country's flourishing poppy fields.
 Afghanistan has become the source for 87 percent of the world's opium, according to a report last month from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
 ''We are as a nation embarrassed about it,'' Mr. Karzai said on the CNN television program ''Late Edition.'' 
 ''It hurts our economy, it destroys our government, it brings us a bad name,'' Mr. Karzai said, adding that his government would eradicate poppy fields over the next two years while helping farmers begin to grow substitute crops.
 Mr. Karzai's comments come in the wake of news reports about an American military review of Afghanistan that says poppy cultivation and opium production will increase there and expand the influence of drug magnates at all levels of the government.
 The assessment, by Lt. Gen. David W. Barno, the top American commander in Afghanistan, was presented last week to Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld during their visit to Afghanistan.
 The review says that by strengthening their ties to drug traffickers, Taliban fighters and other militants will be able to use intimidation and play on ethnic and tribal allegiances to try to undermine the government.
 Mr. Karzai's comments yesterday underscored the antidrug statements he made last week. In his inauguration speech on Tuesday, he said, ''The relationship between terrorism and narcotics, and the continued threat of extremism in the region and the world at large, are a source of continued concern.''
 Two days later, at the opening of a two-day narcotics conference in Kabul, Mr. Karzai called on his countrymen to declare a holy war against the fast-growing opium trade.
 In the interview yesterday, Mr. Karzai also faced questions about his earlier assurances that Osama bin Laden would be caught.
 ''For a man like him who is on the run, who is hiding, I would repeat my words that no fugitive can hide forever,'' he said.
 Asked whether Afghanistan or its allies were any closer to capturing Mr. bin Laden than they were six months ago, Mr. Karzai said, ''In terms of getting him physically, let's count on our luck and good pursuit.''
 With violence continuing in Iraq as preparations are being made for elections, Mr. Karzai said Iraqis had opportunities similar to those recently seized by the people of Afghanistan, where 70 percent of voters turned out to cast ballots on Oct. 9.
 ''I hope the Iraqi people would also recognize this opportunity,'' Mr. Karzai said. ''They must go to the polls, elect their people to Parliament, have a government of their own and have peace.''
 But an open letter on Dec. 3 to Mr. Karzai from Human Rights Watch, a group based in New York, contended that much work remained in Afghanistan to ensure reliable security and human rights. The letter said American forces were holding Afghans incommunicado, for example, and that Afghanistan was responsible for any abuses committed on its soil.
 When asked about the letter, Mr. Karzai said, ''Without the presence of American troops in Afghanistan, Afghanistan would not be what it is today.''
 ''This did not come to us or to America or to the rest of the world without a price,'' he added. ''Along the way, mistakes were made.''

HEADLINE: Alert the Pastry Chefs: 6,500 Guests Are Coming

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
There are the ghosts of the campaign just past at the White House this Christmas as President Bush offers spiked eggnog and baby lamb chops to stunned guests like Bryan Johnson of Chesapeake, Ohio. Mr. Johnson, a public affairs officer for an independent living center, was invited to his first-ever White House reception after appearing with the president at a Bush campaign set piece, a ''conversation on job training'' at a community college in West Virginia last spring.
 ''It came as a real shock,'' Mr. Johnson said in a telephone interview last week, recounting the call from the White House inviting him to a Christmas party on Dec. 2. Once there, he said, ''I saw a lot of people I recognized but weren't quite sure who they were,'' although he said he ''positively identified'' the ''American Idol'' star Kimberly Locke. 
 Did the president remember him as he passed through the receiving line? ''There was a glimmer of recognition,'' Mr. Johnson cheerfully reported.
 The White House at Christmas is always a little like Grand Central Terminal. This year at 15 holiday receptions from Dec. 2 through Dec. 21, Mr. Bush and the first lady will shake hands and pose for pictures with 6,500 guests. Since each reception lasts at least two hours, that amounts to some 30 presidential hours in a receiving line.
 What's new this year is that so many people from the campaign are passing by Mr. Bush like a diorama of the last 12 months. For the humming White House political machine, the holiday parties are an efficient way of spreading thanks. For Mr. Bush, it is the campaign that never ends.
 ''Who has the capacity to do that after a full day, taking those endless pictures with all those strangers who come in?'' said Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis, an Orthodox scholar, sometimes called ''the Jewish Billy Graham'' or ''the Jewish Tammy Faye Bakker,'' who was a guest at the White House Hanukkah party last week. 
 The rebbetzin, who goes by the Yiddish title traditionally given to the wives of rabbis, got her holiday thanks from the White House (as well as a meeting with prominent rabbis and the president in the Roosevelt Room) because she delivered the closing benediction at the Republican National Convention.
 Of course, not all 1.4 million Bush campaign volunteers would fit in the White House this season. For them, there were Christmas cards -- many, many Christmas cards. The Bushes broke another personal record this year by sending out two million cards, continuing a trend of Christmas card inflation. (The first couple sent out 1.3 million cards in 2003, 1 million in 2002 and 875,000 in 2001. In contrast, the Clintons sent out 400,000 Christmas cards in their last year in the White House.)
 ''If you came in and helped out at a county office as a volunteer, you got a card,'' said Gordon Johndroe, Laura Bush's press secretary. The cards, which this year feature an oil painting of the White House Red Room by Cindi Holt, a Texas artist, are paid for by the Republican National Committee. So far, the committee said, the postage alone has come to $600,000.
 As might be expected, the White House holiday parties are not intimate affairs. The biggest event, the Congressional ball, which the White House counts as separate from the 15 holiday receptions, had 800 people. The party for the news media next week is expected to have two shifts of 600 guests each.
 There are also parties for the Secret Service, the cabinet departments, the Christmas volunteers, the Christmas decorators and the White House residence staff of butlers and maids.
 The nightly stampede consumes much of the same menu from an enormous candlelit table in the State Dining Room year after year. Mr. Johndroe reported that by the end of this season the White House expected to go through 15,000 lamb chops, 21,000 pounds of shrimp, 500 pieces of beef tenderloin and 200 fruit cakes. At the Hanukkah party, there were also traditional latkes, or potato pancakes, and a kosher buffet. 
 ''It's a very nice, important gesture to the Jewish community, and it elevates Hanukkah almost to the level of a national holiday,'' said Daniel Ayalon, Israel's ambassador to the United States and a guest at the party. ''The fact that Hanukkah is being celebrated at the White House, the highest office of the land, makes Israelis feel good.''
 (Last month at the White House, Mr. Bush also celebrated his fourth annual iftar dinner, an occasion to break the daily fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.)
 As for Mr. Johnson of Chesapeake, Ohio, his invitation to the White House Christmas party produced the kind of results that would bring holiday cheer into the cup of Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser.
 Mr. Johnson, 28, described himself as an ''independent at heart'' who had never registered to vote before this year.
 So is he a Republican?
 ''I am now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Foxes in Iran's Henhouse

BYLINE: By Vali Nasr and Ali Gheissari. 
Vali Nasr is a professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. Ali Gheissari is a professor of history at the University of San Diego.

 BODY:
AS the Bush administration looks at its options in dealing with Iran's nuclear threat, it should consider some little-noticed but significant recent changes in that country's leadership. The assumption in Washington has long been that Iran is ruled totally by a clerical clique headed by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Behind the facade of theocracy, however, the balance of power between religious elite and the military in the Islamic Republic has been changing. 
 The clerical regime's version of a praetorian guard, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has been growing in prominence in recent years, and may be poised to gain control of main levers of power. This has broad implications for Iranian politics, and for the future of American policy on Iran. 
 The Revolutionary Guards were formed in May 1979 by young rebels loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini; their job was to combat the well-organized leftist militias that had challenged clerical control of the revolution. The guards evolved into a full-fledged military force during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's, and were involved in many of the key campaigns. They also played a direct role in the organization and training of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Badr Brigade in Iraq. 
 While the guards had a lower profile in the 1990's, the victory of the reformist Mohammad Khatami in the presidential election of 1997 led the conservative clerical leadership to give them new support. In exchange for the guards cracking down on advocates of reform, the government gave them generous financing for troop training and new heavy-weapons systems -- including giving them oversight of missile and nuclear research programs -- as well as increases in salaries and benefits. The guard corps expanded its intelligence service, paramilitary ranks and even its air and naval capacity. It now has close to 150,000 soldiers, making up about a third of the nation's military. 
 Today the guards are commanded by a group of ideological conservatives, notably Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, who has even criticized the government for its willingness to negotiate with Europe over the country's nuclear activities. These commanders share strong personal bonds forged in the Iran-Iraq war, during which many were involved in ferocious campaigns that involved chemical attacks. They hold common views on Iran's regional dominant role, the nature of the country's external threats, and protecting the values of the revolution. 
 Since 1997 the guards' leadership has become much more prominent in foreign policy, strategic decision-making and even economic policy. Its commanders more or less control the state police as well as national radio and television; a former senior officer was recently named the country's vice president; they dominate the Ministries of Defense and Intelligence; and they are responsible for the personal security of the clerical leadership. Former members make up more than a third of the conservative Parliament that was elected earlier this year. 
 In addition, through its arrangements of contracts for public and private companies, the Revolutionary Guards have expanded their reach into the economy. More important, they have established a monopoly over the black market trade in embargoed goods -- consumer electronics, Western clothing, construction materials -- bringing in perhaps billions of dollars a year. The revenue has not only allowed the corps to exercise considerable domestic power through patronage, but has also removed budgetary constraints and government control over its spending on weapons and aid to foreign terrorist groups. 
 The full power of Revolutionary Guards was on display last year at the official opening of the Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran. After the ceremonies led by President Khatami, Revolutionary Guard forces stormed the airport and shut it down. While the reason for the show of force was a desire to get the contract for the management of the airport, more than anything it clearly established the extent of the group's power in Iran.
 Now, guard commanders are showing readiness to assume large civilian roles, somewhat as Pakistani generals did before taking power from the country's civilian leaders in the 1990's: promising order, stability and prosperity. Some senior commanders are now sporting stylishly trimmed beards, flaunt newly acquired graduate degrees, and prefer to be called ''doctor'' rather than ''general.'' At least one, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, is being mentioned as a contender for next May's presidential election.
 Most important for America, the guards hold the key to nuclear dispute. They control both the Shahab missile program and vital parts of the nuclear technology effort. The guard corps' current commanders were greatly affected by Iraq's use of chemical weapons in the 1980's and Scud missile attacks against Iranian civilians. This experience drives their insistence that Iran needs a deterrent that will prevent any future attack on its soil. The greater presence of American troops in the Persian Gulf area only intensifies their concerns. 
 Yet the guard leaders oppose strengthening Iran's regular military forces. This is for two reasons: they know that their conventional forces would never be strong enough to combat a determined America, and they fear that a strengthened regular army might challenge the corps' current status and drive for power. Thus they see nuclear weapons as the sole means of ensuring their survival and projecting their power in the region. 
 What does all this mean for Washington? First, if America is going to change Iran's nuclear goals, it must influence decision making not only among the clerical leaders but also in Revolutionary Guards. This is why simply using a big stick -- possible economics sanctions and military threats -- won't work; that approach would only lead the guards to dig in their heels, and would strengthen their political position by allowing them to play to nationalist sentiments. 
 The situation calls for a more nuanced policy, one that will complement the fitful negotiations on nuclear policy led by our European allies. The objective should be first to slow down Revolutionary Guards' monopolization of power and, second, to strain their alliance with the religious leadership. A key will be gaining more international support for democracy in Iran, strengthening reformist forces and nongovernmental groups that continue to resist authoritarianism and can drive a wedge between the guards and the mullahs.
 On the other hand, we must get the European countries with extensive commercial ties with Iran to use sticks as well as carrots. They must put pressure on the Revolutionary Guards' considerable business interests in a way that will enlarge fissures between the guards, the clerical elite and the various social groups that are tied to them through patronage.
 Iran may be America's most intractable problem of the post-cold-war era. But in foreign policy it is always easier to deal with a divided opponent than a united one. America and the West must not only recognize the growing political divisions in Iran, but also exploit them.

HEADLINE: Icahn Accuses A Hedge Fund Of Stock Manipulation

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Carl C. Icahn has chosen his latest target. But this time, he is not content to go after just a single company but has his eye on the secretive practices of the hedge fund industry. 
 Late Friday, Mr. Icahn, an investor with the style of an activist, filed a wide-ranging $1 billion lawsuit against the Perry Corporation, a large hedge fund, accusing it and other firms of engaging in an effort to manipulate the shares and outcome in several takeover battles, including the sharply contested fight for the acquisition of Compaq Computer by Hewlett-Packard in late 2001 and early 2002. 
 Mr. Icahn, one of the best known of the 1980's corporate raiders, contends that Perry, an $8 billion hedge fund based in Manhattan, has used a variety of complex techniques to effectively buy the votes of companies pursuing acquisitions without actually holding an economic interest in the shares. Perry did this, according to the suit, to influence the results of shareholder votes and profit from its investment in the companies being acquired. 
 Mr. Icahn is being represented by David Boies, who was chief lawyer in the efforts by the Justice Department in President Bill Clinton's administration to break up Microsoft. 
 The suit could shine a bright light on the hedge fund industry, which has long gone unregulated but in recent years has come under scrutiny by lawmakers calling for greater oversight. The suit is intriguing in part because Mr. Icahn is himself in the midst of starting his own hedge fund.
 According to the suit: ''The conspiracy and conduct complained of in this complaint are classic examples of the kinds of manipulative arrangements that arbitrageurs and hedge funds are increasingly employing, outside of the public's awareness and without effective regulation or oversight, to generate profits at the expense of ordinary shareholders.''
 Questions about Perry and the practice that Mr. Icahn accuses it of using were raised by investors and corporate governance specialists two weeks ago when the company, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, appeared to acknowledge that it used the technique in at least one recent takeover battle.
 That involved the proposed acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals, a producer of generic drugs, by a larger rival, Mylan Laboratories. Perry disclosed that it owned seven million shares of King. It hopes to profit from the spread between the price Mylan offered for each King share -- $16.49 -- and King's actual share price, which at the end of trading on Friday was $12.85. If the deal is completed, Perry stands to make more than $28 million, based on figures in the filing.
 Richard C. Perry, the company's president and owner, could not be reached over the weekend for comment.
 In a statement, Mylan, which is also named in the suit along with its chief executive, Robert J. Coury, said it ''is yet another increasingly desperate and feeble attempt by Icahn to intimidate Mylan and its shareholders. We believe the claims against Mylan and Mr. Coury are entirely without merit, and that Icahn's accusations are completely baseless. Mylan's board and its fiduciaries will not allow Icahn to interfere with continuing to take actions in the best interests of Mylan's shareholders.''
 Perry's filing about its investment in Mylan said it had entered into several hedging transactions with Bear Stearns and Goldman, Sachs to borrow shares, but did not spell out the exact hedging technique.
 Alan C. Greenberg, chairman of the executive committee of the Bear Stearns Companies, acknowledged that the firm had sold shares of Mylan short on behalf of Perry, but said that it had not participated in a swap or other derivative type of transaction.
 A spokesman for Goldman, Sachs declined to comment.
 In bringing the lawsuit, Mr. Icahn has some economic interests of his own. He owns about 10 percent of Mylan and is trying to block the transaction with King, arguing that the deal would hurt Mylan in the long term. As part of his effort to derail the deal, he has proposed to buy Mylan, though his overtures have so far been rejected. He has also set up his own short position in King, betting that the proposed deal between it and Mylan will collapse or be revamped on less favorable terms to King. 
 ''The Hewlett-Packard deal enabled such arbitrageurs to profit from positions in Compaq stock,'' the suit said, ''but caused large losses to unsuspecting Hewlett-Packard shareholders.''
 It is hard to judge how strong Mr. Icahn's suit is, legal experts said, because he has entered novel territory. But there has been a long debate about whether shareholder voting rights must be tied to shareholder ownership.

HEADLINE: G.M. and Daimler to Work Jointly on Hybrid Engine

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
The prospects for hybrid electric vehicles were bolstered Monday when General Motors and DaimlerChrysler, two automakers long skeptical about hybrids, said they would develop them by working together. 
 The two companies have already been separately developing hybrids and said they had been in discussions since last year. They agreed to jointly develop a compact hybrid system that saves gas on both the highway and in the city, where today's hybrids are more efficient. It will also be designed for full-size trucks and for use with diesel and gasoline engines. 
 The companies said their first vehicles would not be on the road until 2007. 
 Eric Ridenhour, executive vice president of product development at Daimler's Chrysler division, likened current hybrid technology to videocassettes. ''We like to think of this as the DVD or streaming video, the whole next way of doing it.''
 Tom Stephens, a G.M. group vice president, said the new system would ''achieve at least a 25 percent improvement'' in overall fuel economy in large trucks, without compromising how much they could tow. 
 Competitors, however, were skeptical about the value of the advances. 
 ''The Escape hybrid today gets a 50 percent combined fuel economy improvement and 80 percent in city driving,'' said Jon Harmon, a spokesman for Ford Motor, which introduced a hybrid version of its Escape sport utility vehicle this year. ''So I'm not sure what the leapfrog is in a 25 percent improvement.''
 G.M. makes a hybrid system for city buses, and both G.M. and Daimler are selling a small number of pickup trucks that use a mild form of hybrid technology to improve fuel economy 10 percent or more.
 Hybrids made by Honda, Toyota and Ford offer fuel savings of 40 percent or more -- and potentially much more, depending on how and where the vehicles are driven. 
 G.M. has said that by 2007 it will offer a more ambitious hybrid system in its Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon sport utility vehicles. On Monday, it said those two vehicles would be the first to use the co-developed system.
 Daimler's Chrysler division said it would follow G.M. in late 2007 or early 2008 with a hybrid version of its Dodge Durango S.U.V. Daimler's Mercedes division will also use the new system in a luxury car. 
 Neither company would say how many they would make. 
 Hybrid vehicles save gas by supplementing the internal combustion engine with an electric motor. In the Toyota Prius hybrid, for instance, an electric motor takes over for the gas engine at slow speeds and stops; the system preserves energy usually lost in braking. Toyota and Honda began selling the first hybrid cars in the late 1990's in Japan. Ford has been the most enthusiastic American manufacturer of hybrids. 
 Daimler and other German automakers favor advanced diesel engines, which are popular in Europe. G.M. is pushing hard to develop the most futuristic new engine technology, the hydrogen fuel cell. Both companies have expressed doubts that hybrids could be profitable. 
 In an interview last year, Wolfgang Bernhard, who was then Chrysler's chief operating officer but has since taken a top job at Volkswagen, said, ''Everybody is jumping on the hybrid bandwagon and saying this is the most important thing and without it, the world's going to end. It reminds me of the hype we had around e-business in the early 90's.''
 On Monday, the companies did not exactly embrace the technology, but they said hybrids would be one of several fuel-saving options they would develop.
 ''They are not a silver bullet,'' said Mr. Stephens of G.M. But with some analysts projecting that hybrids could account for as much as 15 percent of the American vehicle market by the end of the next decade, he said the partnership ''will prepare us to satisfy customers and the market.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 22, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Dec. 14 about plans by General Motors and DaimlerChrysler to collaborate on hybrid electric vehicles misspelled the surname of the executive vice president for product development at Chrysler, who commented on the development. He is Eric Ridenour, not Ridenhour.

HEADLINE: Competition Means Learning to Offer More Than Just Low Wages

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DHAKA, Bangladesh 

 BODY:
Not long ago, garment makers in the world's poorest countries were in utter dismay, fearing that the long-planned abolition of global trade quotas for textiles and apparel next month would wipe out their factories and send millions of jobs to more competitive operations in China. The International Monetary Fund warned that a quarter of Bangladesh's exports and 2.3 million jobs here could evaporate next year, shaking the entire economy.
 So why, then, is Abu Taher tripling his work force, adding five floors to his cotton trousers factory here? And why is Annisul Huq, just down the road, hiring 2,000 more workers and building two new factories -- adding to the eight he already has -- to churn out more shirts and sweaters for Calvin Klein, Van Heusen and others? 
 It turns out that the outlook for the textile and apparel makers here and elsewhere is not as bleak as many experts had thought, at least for the bigger, more up-to-date factories in developing countries, especially those like Bangladesh and Pakistan with large, low-wage work forces. ''Retailers are asking for better factories, more volume,'' said Mr. Huq, who got a master's degree in economics and did a stint in television before he started his apparel-making business. ''I do not foresee immediately an earthquake in 2005.'' 
 [In an additional nod to countries like Bangladesh, China said on Sunday that it would tax clothing exports to stem excessive growth next year. And if that is not sufficient, the Bush administration is prepared to further limit Chinese imports.]
 Still, the end to decades of textile and clothing quotas on Jan. 1 is beginning to spin the economics of the developing world around and around. The expiration of the quotas is intended to allow for free-flowing trade in garment making. It used to be that by guaranteeing a certain level of clothing production from just about every poor country in the world, quotas became a classic engine for nations with cheap labor and low skills to connect effectively with the global economy. 
 But now, without quotas to ensure access, quality and modernity will count as much as, if not more than, low wages. Poor countries will have to compete on the scale and skill of their factories and on the efficiency of their roads, ports and electrical grids. Most of the cost of clothing lies not in the labor but in the logistics of moving it to stores for sale, so low manufacturing wages by themselves are not enough. 
 Of the typical $48 to $54 for delivering a dozen long-sleeve men's shirts to Bangladesh's main port, for example, most goes for the fabric, often imported from China. Just $5 goes to the foreman, technicians and assembly workers, who earn as little as 70 cents a day.
 Yet, the savings on labor costs here and in some other developing countries are enough to keep retailers from switching suppliers for now, especially as the Bush administration has re-imposed quotas on several categories of Chinese exports and is poised to do so on more.
 ''Our policy is to take a conservative position; we will continue to source from where we have been sourcing,'' said Andrew Tsuei, Wal-Mart's vice president for global purchasing, in an interview before the Chinese announcement. ''Bangladesh is very competitive because the labor cost in Bangladesh is only half of what China is, and maybe less than that.''
 But in the longer run, the survival of the garment industry in Bangladesh and other developing countries depends upon how well governments respond to the demands of the global market. That will be affected, in part, by how much they invest in roads, ports and electricity grids; in the past, such infrastructure has been starved of investment here and elsewhere. 
 Small factories and their workers are the most vulnerable. Less than two miles away from Mr. Huq's main factory, Shirin Akhter sat recently on a low wooden sleeping platform in her dirt-floored shack in one of this city's worst slums.
 She lost her $15-a-month, full-time job in a pants factory a year ago and has been unable to find similar work. She now juggles two jobs as a housemaid while her husband searches for temporary work at construction sites.
 ''I can barely live here, sometimes I cannot eat regularly,'' she said, cradling her 2-year-old son, Rifat.
 The garment industry has drawn literally millions of women out of villages into large cities in poor countries around the world. For deeply traditional countries like Bangladesh, where girls who leave their villages are seldom welcomed back, the globalization of trade in apparel and textiles has helped transform a way of life unchanged for generations.
 ''It is a silent revolution that has taken place in our country,'' said Morshed Khan, the foreign minister of Bangladesh, one of the few democracies in the Muslim world. ''For the first time in a Muslim country, hundreds of thousands of women in their late teens and early 20's are wearing cosmetics, carrying handbags and walking to work every day. 
 ''There is no way in Bangladesh'' he added, ''that this government or any other government can send them back to the kitchen.''
 Just a few months ago, it seemed unlikely that Bangladesh could avoid that fate. But now the future seems a little brighter.
 Here in Dhaka, Mr. Huq became a clothing magnate in much the same way Bangladesh became an international power in the garment industry: largely by luck.
 The son of a senior civil servant, he earned a master's degree in economics, only to find himself jobless for two years. It was the late 1970's, and the country was struggling to recover from a devastating war of independence from Pakistan and the subsequent nationalization of many industries across Bangladesh.
 ''I was an unemployed man,'' he said, ''and there are millions of unemployed men in this country.''
 Mr. Huq became the host of a variety show, and literally stumbled into some luck when he opened a door too quickly and hit a stranger who turned out to be Noorul Quader. Mr. Quader was a civil servant who had just negotiated agreements that allowed desperately poor Bangladesh to start exporting garments without facing any serious quotas.
 Mr. Quader had started a garment manufacturing business himself, and Mr. Huq went to work for him for $200 a month. A year later, Mr. Huq left and started his own business with two friends and $1,700 that he borrowed from his father. As Bangladesh's garment exports grew from $32 million to $5.9 billion in the last two decades, his business grew too.
 He now lives in a three-story, impeccably decorated post-modern mansion and is chauffeured through Bangladesh's polluted, congested streets in a black BMW X5 sport utility vehicle. 
 Mr. Huq's spacious, well-ventilated and well-lit factories are designed to appeal to multinationals concerned about protecting their image from criticisms that they are exploiting workers in poor countries. The factories are fully booked with orders from brands like Calvin Klein and Van Heusen through next August, so he is building two more.
 Yet Mr. Huq still worries. His workers earn $15 to $85 a month, sometimes more, based on output. That gives him an advantage over Chinese factories paying their workers $50 a month and up that also cover housing and food costs. But balancing the lower wages here are formidable disadvantages.
 One problem lies in the hartals, national strikes called by political factions at short notice that can shut down almost all activity for one to three days. There have been 20 hartals in the last year, and even that is an improvement from recent years.
 The biggest problem for Mr. Huq and other clothing makers here is Bangladesh's state-owned port in Chittagong. Studies have ranked it last or close to last in the world in turnaround time for big container ships. The ships must anchor in deep water offshore and then be unloaded and loaded by ancient, state-owned feeder vessels with shallow drafts. 
 Yet Mr. Huq's large factories have overcome these obstacles, sometimes even operating on Friday, the Islamic holy day, to meet deadlines.
 ''There are some concerns which need to be cured -- you cannot change a bureaucracy overnight,'' Mr. Huq said. ''We work overnight, we work Fridays, we work holidays, we ship the goods.''
 But if Bangladesh does not move quickly to raise the country's competitiveness, it will soon wind up with more unemployed workers living hand-to-mouth in slums like Banshtola. 
 Ms. Akhter moved here from her village four years ago, finding work as a ''helper'' in a small factory making short pants for men and boys. She used to clip stray threads after a more skilled worker sewed the pants.
 But she lost the job a year ago when her employer ran low on orders. She has been unable to find new work, while her husband has cast about, unsuccessfully, for construction work. They rely on occasional profits from selling vegetables.
 Banshtola is filled with tiny shacks, with corrugated steel roofs and walls that are simple bamboo mats, often riddled with holes. The shacks rent for $6.75 a month. There is no running water, and the toilet is a hole in the ground at the end of one of the dirt alleys, which turn to mud during the rainy season.
 Workers are often plagued by disease and malnutrition. And in the last two years, mosquitoes have brought an epidemic of dengue fever, which is sometimes fatal. 
 Ms. Akhter is resigned to her difficulties. But she looks on with a touch of jealousy at the new class of money-earners, women like Muhamad Zulekha, 27, a sweater factory worker whose nimble fingers allow her to earn $85 a month. She says that her husband now listens to her more because she can work outside the home and earn real money. 
 Until the infrastructure improves dramatically, the burden still falls on cheap workers like Ms. Zulekha -- and even Ms. Akhter when she was working, to give an edge to Bangladesh's factories, particularly if the country wants to keep a toehold as the quota system disappears. 
 Indeed, big international buyers and manufacturers have proved leery of relying too heavily on a single country like China, seeing greater security in diversity. Top Form, a Hong Kong company that is the world's largest bra manufacturer, has decided to make no change to its long-standing policy of keeping 55 percent of its production in China and 45 percent in Thailand and the Philippines.
 ''Unless we see a more strengthened trade relationship between China and the United States,'' Willie Fung, the chairman of Top Form, said, ''we would not want to put all our eggs in one basket.''
 Fearful governments in other developing countries are showing rare bursts of energy, addressing long-festering problems in the hope of saving their clothing makers. Bangladesh plans to train 40,000 garment workers next year to improve their skills in conjunction with BRAC, a local nonprofit group formerly known as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, and is eliminating taxes on electricity and other utilities used by garment factories.
 But smaller or less populous developing countries like Brunei and Mongolia, and small factories practically everywhere, may still face serious losses. Executives at Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, say that they are likely to cut purchases from Fiji, Brunei, Turkmenistan and Macedonia, but plan to keep buying from the rest, and will actually increase their purchases next year from Bangladesh, their biggest single supplier of clothing, exceeding even China.
 Bangladesh and other very poor countries have been lobbying Washington to grant them duty-free access to the American market. The $1.7 billion a year in apparel exports from Bangladesh to the United States currently face an average levy of 16 percent, or nearly $300 million a year, a burden that dwarfs the less than $70 million a year that the United States gives Bangladesh in foreign aid.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about efforts by textile and apparel factories in Bangladesh to stay competitive as global trade quotas come to an end referred incompletely to working hours at plants operated by Annisul Huq. Mr. Huq said that while factories operated overnight or on weekends after production delays due to national strikes, natural disasters or port problems, the practice was not routine. He said workers also received compensatory time.

HEADLINE: The Crux: To Worry Or Not To Worry?

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
Almost every Michael Crichton novel has embedded in its clockwork plot machinery a microchip of alarm, intended to start readers fretting about something they hadn't sufficiently worried about before. In his first book, ''The Andromeda Strain,'' Mr. Crichton introduced us to space-borne plagues. In ''Jurassic Park'' and its sequel, ''The Lost World,'' we found out what could happen if genetic engineering ran amok. ''Airframe,'' it seems safe to say, did not swell the ranks of frequent fliers, and ''Timeline'' ought to have made any sensible person think twice about stepping into a quantum teleportation machine. 
 ''Rising Sun'' raised the specter of a Japanese takeover of the American economy. ''Disclosure'' revised that scenario somewhat to suggest that an even bigger problem might be rapacious female executives. And ''Prey,'' Mr. Crichton's last book, refined that message still further to suggest that an overly ambitious mother who worked outside the home might find herself caught up in nanotechnology research and unwittingly turning the world into goo.
 In an interview last week, Mr. Crichton suggested that we have become a nation of worrywarts. ''There are many groups in contemporary society who find it in their interest to promote fears,'' he said. ''A free society, a free press, has a lot of good features, but giving you an accurate view of the world is not one.'' 
 Mr. Crichton himself, of course, is not without blame for this state of affairs. His scary techno-thrillers typically spend lengthy sojourns on the loftiest slopes of the best-seller lists and bounce up there again, in paperback, when they're made into movies
 Mr. Crichton's newest novel, which came out last week, has the classically Crichtonian title ''State of Fear,'' and it's about a subject so menacing that it's surprising he hadn't got to it long before now. This time he has taken on global warming, which provides the book with some cliffhanging action sequences including an ice slide, tidal waves, a flash flood and some SUV-melting lightning strikes -- except they're all engineered, it turns out, by a new kind of fear monger. The villains here are the sinister agents of an environmental group called NERF, reverse eco-terrorists, bent on making us think that the earth is in much worse shape than it actually is. In a review of the book yesterday in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani called the plot ''ludicrous'' and said the characters ''practically come with Post-it notes on their foreheads indicating whether they are good guys or bad guys.''
 Plot aside, the not-so-hidden message of ''State of Fear,'' spelled out in copious footnotes, a lengthy afterword, an appendix and a 20-page bibliography, is an oddly reassuring one for a Crichton book, even if many scientists would disagree with it: there is no such thing as global warming, or not that anyone can prove or predict, and when it comes to climatic change, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and the compromised and politicized experts who are in the business of purveying it.
 For good measure the book also includes a number of mini-lectures challenging some of the green movement's most cherished beliefs and arguing, for example, that DDT is safe enough to eat, that the giant sequoias are practically junk trees and that the methane emitted by termites is potentially a greater hazard than the atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide.
 ''For most of my life I have felt burdened by highly publicized fears that decades later did not turn out to be true,'' Mr. Crichton wrote in a recent article for Parade magazine, and the new novel appears in some ways to be a heave of exorcism. Throughout the novel and in the afterword, he takes the opportunity to disparage a number of other widely held fears. Fossil fuel shortage? Not to worry, we'll come up with something. Population explosion? Nope, birthrates are coming down. Cancer from power lines? Please, you've got to be kidding.
 Mr. Crichton, who was in New York last week to promote his new book, could easily be mistaken for one of his own creations. He is himself an example of superior bioengineering: extremely tall (6 feet 7 inches), almost unnaturally youthful looking (62, but you'd never know it), and opinionated about all manner of scientific subjects. (He is also a medical doctor, a successful film director and the creator of a long-running television series.) He speaks slowly, without much inflection, in perfectly outlined paragraphs that frequently begin with a topic sentence and include subsections and analogies.
 Sitting in his hotel room, he had at hand a stack of photocopied graphs and articles, but he seldom needed to refer to them as he patiently explained what he thinks is wrong with the theory of global warming: temperatures have not increased at anything like the rate that was originally predicted, and temperature data are not especially reliable to begin with; back in the 70's we were worried about global cooling. He was particularly dismissive of the various computer models for climate change, saying, ''You have to remember, I come from an experience where you can use a computer to make a photo-realistic dinosaur, and I know that isn't real.'' 
 He began idly looking at temperature records about three years ago, he explained, and even after he became convinced that climate changes were impossible to predict and the threat of global warming much less than environmentalists were claiming, he resisted writing about it. ''I didn't want the hassle,'' he said, adding that at first he didn't see a way to turn his findings into a novel. ''My message is there isn't a problem,'' he said. ''That's not a very good message -- it's not a smash-bang one.''
 Eventually Mr. Crichton shamed himself into starting ''State of Fear'' -- he ''felt like a coward,'' he admitted -- and his most important breakthrough came when he hit upon the notion of inverting everything and turning the ostensible good guys into bad ones. 
 The book's action sequences, he said, were modeled on the old Saturday-morning movie serials, though he added that ''no one in the contemporary world knows what a Saturday-morning serial is.'' 
 And, indeed, for readers who may not remember how often cannibals figured in Saturday-morning cliffhangers, ''State of Fear'' includes a doozy of a scene in which the heroes are captured and tied to posts by some man-eating Solomon Islanders led by a menacing chief called Sambuca, as in the liqueur. (''Don't ask why this name,'' another character says. ''Him crazy man.'')
 ''This book has been the most wrenching experience for me personally -- in terms of what changes it has brought about in my view of the world,'' Mr. Crichton said. He explained that two years ago some armed robbers entered his house in California and held him and his daughter at gunpoint. ''That changed me,'' he said. It taught him ''that there really are events that are going to take place about which you can do nothing -- things that really do happen.''
 ''But I think it heightened my attunement,'' he continued. ''I mean, if that was a real fear -- then what about all the other fears that maybe weren't so real?''
 Mr. Crichton also said that in his opinion the message of ''State of Fear'' is cautionary. ''What you're reading may not be right,'' he explained. ''Take it easy, just be careful. Could be overstated, could be not entirely accurate.''

HEADLINE: Retail Sales For November Top Forecasts

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
The economy showed signs of strength with the release of stronger-than-expected retail sales data on Monday that helped solidify views that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again this week.
 The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.1 percent in November, in contrast to a Wall Street forecast for a 0.1 percent decline. In addition, retail sales for October were revised to a 0.8 percent increase, compared with the 0.2 percent gain that was initially reported. 
 Stripping out autos, retail sales were up 0.5 percent. Forecasts were for a 0.3 percent advance, after an upwardly revised 1.1 percent increase in October. On a 12-month basis, retail sales excluding autos have grown 8.6 percent.
 Motor vehicles and parts sales shrank 1.3 percent, but this performance had been expected after industry reports of a weak month amid signs that consumers were holding back in the hope of better bargains in December.
 Business inventories, released later by the Commerce Department, reinforced the impression of consumer spending gathering momentum in the fourth quarter. Retail inventory advanced less than expected in October as sales grew.
 Economists scrutinize retail sales as a dominant component in consumer spending, which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output. The numbers support other signs of a moderate expansion as oil prices eased from a peak above $55 a barrel in October.
 ''Excluding autos, it was up five-tenths of a percent, and that was also better than expectations. It's a pleasant sign of better-than-expected strength in a period when energy prices were quite high,'' said Patrick Fearon, an economist at A.G. Edwards & Sons.
 A later Commerce Department release showed that business inventories grew 0.2 percent in October, less than expected, as retailers depleted stocks at a rapid pace while their sales grew.
 Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.6 percent rise in inventories compared with September, when the government initially reported a 0.1 percent increase, which was later revised to show no change.
 Economists see rising inventories either as a sign of confidence in future demand or as a result of an unexpected decline in sales. Analysts look at the inventories-to-sales ratio to determine how to interpret the data.

HEADLINE: Necessity as the Mother of Tenure?

BYLINE: By Erich E. Kunhardt. 
Erich E. Kunhardt is a professor of physics and dean of the School of Science and Arts at Stevens Institute of Technology.

DATELINE: Hoboken, N.J. 

 BODY:
AS we fret over the nation's fitful economic growth and the growing number of jobs moving overseas, few are discussing a matter that may be a better indicator of our future in the global marketplace: the declining number and quality of patents awarded to Americans.
 Patents, along with available investment capital, are an excellent measure of the potential for job creation. America's competitive advantage in the global economy has long rested on our ability to generate intellectual property -- patents and other expressions of creativity -- and to leverage it by creating companies or increasing market share. The virtual demise of Bell Laboratories, the longtime icon of American inventiveness, and the fact that nothing has emerged to take its place should be seen with alarm. The United States' share of its own industrial patents has fallen steadily over the decades and now stands at 52 percent. 
 As corporations have cut back on research, the government has increasingly encouraged universities to take a larger role in maintaining American economic competitiveness -- as, for example, in the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which encouraged universities to commercialize inventions created with federal financing. However, ''academic entrepreneurship'' -- the patenting and licensing by universities and their faculty -- has not become part of the academic mainstream, and is generally viewed within the Ivory Tower as conflicting with the mission of the university. That mission is now often captured by the phrase: ''to teach, and to research.'' I think a third element should be added: ''to invent.'' There are two compelling reasons for broadening the academic mission. First, the university shapes the thinking and outlook of our future workers, and also offers one of the most stable environments for bright Americans to work on new things and sustain our creative leadership. Second, putting an emphasis on invention would enrich the academic community by adding a new dimension of creative expression. Independent of whether inventing can be taught or not, affirming the creative process as a long-term value in the university will serve to stimulate faculty and students alike. 
 The idea of changing the mission of the university in such a substantial way should not be alarming; a similar shift occurred once before, in the late 1800's, when research was made a priority. A few visionaries then saw that research could be of great benefit to industrial expansion as well as enriching academic life. In fact, the new push for research helped transform what had become a stale academic community. 
 Johns Hopkins University, which opened in 1876, was the first to require its faculty to conduct research. That model proved so successful that research -- be it empirical exploration in the sciences or writing books in the liberal arts -- is now a pillar of the tenure process nearly everywhere.
 So how can we make the process of invention an equally vital aspect of higher education? One possible approach would be to emulate Johns Hopkins, creating new institutions or remaking existing universities with a focus on invention. The results -- a creative effervescence of the community and concomitant attractiveness to students, faculty and society -- will speak for themselves. 
 The other approach will require a joint effort among faculties and administrations at our major universities. A professor's success at invention must be recognized in his pay and promotion. Unfortunately, for some time now universities have placed more value on patents that bring in revenue than those that might show more originality. Thus inventing is viewed mainly as technology transfer, not as something with academic value of its own. It is no surprise, then, that few faculty members get involved in inventing, and students are not challenged to attempt it. And any arguments that inventing should be nurtured for its potential contribution to American economic development are quickly dismissed. 
 The quickest way to change this mind-set will be to get administrations and faculties to accept successful inventing as a step toward tenure. After all, in a few decades research went from being a foreign concept in academia to being the most important factor in tenure decisions. However, unlike research, there is no established peer-review process for evaluating inventions, no way to evaluate the academic significance of a new idea beyond its potential economic value. 
 That must change, and the academic community, perhaps with a push from the professional societies and the financial support from the government, should take the lead in clarifying the principles for doing so. Not only could it have profound benefits for the intellectual vigor of the university, it would also help America keep its place in the global economic order.

HEADLINE: Jury Says Scott Peterson Deserves to Die for Murder

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY; Carolyn Marshall contributed reporting from Redwood City for this article.

DATELINE: REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Dec. 13 

 BODY:
After three days of deliberations and nearly two years of a nationwide obsession with the story of a young fertilizer salesman and his pretty and pregnant wife, the jury in the double-murder trial of Scott Peterson determined on Monday that he should be put to death.
 Judge Alfred A. Delucchi, who under California law will formally sentence Mr. Peterson, 32, for killing his wife, Laci, 27, and the fetus, said he would take up the matter at a hearing on Feb. 25.
 At the same hearing, the judge will consider motions from Mr. Peterson's lawyers for a new trial and to reduce the penalty to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The judge is required by law to consider the lesser sentence, but his praise for the jury on Monday made that seem unlikely. 
 ''This is the way you saw it, and this is the way it is,'' Judge Delucchi said, his voice cracking with emotion as he addressed the six men and six women of the jury. He added, ''I just can't believe how well you have performed.''
 After the jurors were dismissed, a spokesman for Laci Peterson's family said Mr. Peterson ''got what he deserved.''
 ''What a nightmare,'' said the spokesman, Ron Grantski, who is commonly described as Laci Peterson's stepfather. ''It hasn't changed. It's still a nightmare. It should never have happened.''
 On Friday, only six jurors said they favored a death sentence, the jury foreman said at a news conference afterward. But after a weekend with the jurors sequestered in a hotel, the decision fell into place on Monday morning, when the foreman requested several pieces of evidence, including autopsy photographs of Laci Peterson and her fetus. Her body was found in San Francisco Bay without limbs or a head, and the fetus -- which washed ashore separately -- was described by prosecutors as appearing like ''trash.''
 ''It was very important for me to see that, to be sure of my decision,'' the foreman, Steve Cardosi, a fireman and paramedic, said of the photographs. ''We all passed them around and we looked at them.''
 Mr. Peterson, who wept on several occasions during the eight-day penalty phase of his trial, reacted stoically to the reading of the verdict. His parents, Lee and Jackie Peterson, and his half-sister, Janey Peterson, all looked ashen. Seated directly behind Mr. Peterson, they listened in silence and showed no emotion beyond the worry that has burdened them throughout the trial.
 Across the courtroom, Laci Peterson's mother, Sharon Rocha, and her companion, Mr. Grantski, as well as Laci Peterson's brother, Brent Rocha, and half-sister, Amy Rocha, were equally subdued, remaining quietly in their seats well after the jury had been dismissed.
 Moments before the jury entered the courtroom, Mr. Peterson's lead lawyer, Mark Geragos, crouched in the aisle and spoke in a hushed voice with the Peterson family, his expression somber. Later, speaking briefly outside the courtroom on the Petersons' behalf, Mr. Geragos said the family was disappointed and would appeal, which is automatic in death-sentence cases in California.
 ''I hope you can understand that it's a very difficult time, and that's all I've got to say,'' Mr. Geragos said.
 With the jury's decision, Mr. Peterson is set to join California's death row at San Quentin, the largest in the country, where 641 inmates await execution. Until he is formally sentenced, he will remain in Redwood City at the Maguire Correctional Facility, where he has lived alone in a cell in 3B West, a special unit for prisoners in protective custody. As has been the case since his arrival at the jail in January, he will be allowed one-hour visits twice a week.
 The penalty verdict brings closer to an end, at least until the appeals are heard, one of the most talked-about criminal cases in recent American history. The trial managed to sustain intense media interest, particularly on cable television talk shows, even though cameras were not allowed in the courtroom and testimony in the guilt and penalty phases, often dry and tedious, extended over a six-month period.
 That Mr. Geragos, a Los Angeles lawyer known for his celebrity clients and media savvy, joined the spectacle on Mr. Peterson's behalf made the case especially irresistible for television's armchair legal analysts. Before taking on Mr. Peterson as a client, Mr. Geragos had described the circumstantial evidence against him as ''damning'' during a television appearance. 
 More than 850 people were issued media credentials for the trial, and on Monday the regular throng of journalists was joined by dozens of television ''bookers,'' who sought to schedule television appearances by jurors, family members and other key players. Because of the many onlookers from the public outside the courtroom, some television personalities were accompanied on Monday by bodyguards.
 Judge Delucchi, with a record of death-penalty trials, is retired but took over the case when it was moved from Modesto, Calif., a farming town where the Petersons lived, to this San Francisco suburb about 70 miles away. 
 Mr. Peterson's lawyers had argued that it was impossible for him to receive a fair trial in Modesto, where public opinion turned against him almost from the day his wife was reported missing on Dec. 24, 2002. The hostility worsened when he acknowledged an extramarital affair with Amber Frey, a massage therapist from Fresno, that had begun in the weeks leading up to Laci Peterson's disappearance.
 Ms. Frey cooperated with the authorities once she learned Mr. Peterson was married and his wife had disappeared, providing some of the most compelling testimony against Mr. Peterson during the trial. 
 Last Thursday, in urging the jurors to deliver a death sentence, prosecutors replayed some of the taped telephone conversations between Ms. Frey and Mr. Peterson, in which Mr. Peterson could be heard romancing -- and lying to -- Ms. Frey while hundreds of volunteers in Modesto searched for his wife. 
 Three jurors who spoke with journalists after the proceedings on Monday said Ms. Frey had helped them make up their minds. One, Greg Beratlis, described her testimony as ''a big piece of the puzzle.''
 ''There are a lot of victims in this,'' Mr. Beratlis said. ''A lot of people were deceived. And that includes his family.'' 
 After Mr. Peterson was convicted on Nov. 12 of first-degree murder in the death of his wife and second-degree murder in the death of the fetus -- and big crowds celebrated the verdicts outside the courthouse here -- his lawyers insisted that a fair hearing in the penalty phase was not possible in Redwood City. 
 They were unsuccessful, however, in legal efforts, including a petition to the California Supreme Court, to move the penalty phase to Los Angeles, where they believed it would be easier to find jurors who had not been influenced by the media coverage. 
 Mr. Beratlis and the other jurors said they resented the suggestion that they had reached their verdicts because of public pressure. 
 ''I am going to be O.K. with it,'' said one juror, Richelle Nice, an unemployed mother of four. ''It is a difficult decision, but I know I made the right decision.''

HEADLINE: When a Utility Saves Money, Who Benefits?

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

DATELINE: SALEM, Ore., Dec. 13 

 BODY:
Customers of investor-owned electric utilities must cover all the expenses of these legal monopolies in the rates they pay. But what happens when a utility owner reduces costs, say by merging the accounting operations of two utilities or by reducing corporate income taxes? Do the savings benefit customers or the owners? 
 The Texas Pacific Group, the $13 billion investment fund that is trying to buy Oregon's largest electric utility, said on Monday at a regulatory hearing that if the savings resulted from combining functions like accounting, the money must be returned to customers. But it said that if the savings were in taxes, the utility's owners are entitled to the money. 
 The distinction, which some saw as contradictory, came during closing arguments before the Oregon Public Utility Commission on whether Texas Pacific will be allowed to buy Portland General Electric from the Enron Corporation for $2.3 billion. 
 The case has significance beyond Oregon because it has prompted corporations and landlords to begin asking if they are being overcharged for electricity, a discussion that may spread to other cities as companies seek ways to lower costs.
 When the sale or merger of a utility is proposed, big customers typically seek concessions, like rate reductions. But in this case, nearly all the economic powers in Portland are asking that the deal be rejected, even if that means that the city of Portland could wind up owning the utility. 
 Leading industrial, commercial and real estate interests in the city argued at the hearing that Texas Pacific would be an absentee owner that would charge too much and make too much profit, and that it would not have an interest in making long-term investments to ensure reliable electricity. 
 Texas Pacific specializes in buying troubled companies like Continental Airlines, J. Crew and Burger King that have tax losses. By buying a profitable company, and indeed one in which the taxes are included in the company's revenue stream, Texas Pacific can offset those losses and keep some share of the tax money.
 Portland G.E. collects $1.2 billion a year from its customers, of which $92 million is used to cover federal and state income taxes. Since 1997, when Enron bought the utility, none of that money has made its way to government treasuries. Retaining the taxes roughly doubles the profit an owner can earn from Portland G.E.
 The industrial and commercial customers pay 40 percent of those taxes, or about $36 million a year. Intel, the area's largest employer, pays almost $4 million a year in taxes that are reflected in its Portland G.E. bill.
 The Supreme Courts of Pennsylvania and Indiana have found it improper to include in electric rates ''fictitious expenses,'' like taxes that owners retain, saying this was simply disguised extra profit. 
 The idea that accounting department savings, but not tax savings, must benefit customers emerged after Commissioner John Savage asked what should happen if two utility companies merged, saving money by eliminating one accounting department.
 Thad Miller, a lawyer for the subsidiary Texas Pacific created to own Portland General Electric, said that it would be ''fundamentally unfair for customers to incur those expenses, which were embedded in rates.''
 Any savings from such consolidation, Mr. Miller said, must be returned to customers.
 When another commissioner, Ray Baum, asked about tax savings, Mr. Miller took a different approach, saying the commission should not be ''cherry-picking'' the tax issue.
 Mr. Miller said that utility companies across the country had for decades collected taxes that their corporate parents may not have had to turn over to governments.
 Lisa Rachner, another lawyer for the Texas Pacific subsidiary, said that in the current case, or any future case involving rate increases, the commission could not require that taxes not paid to governments be returned to customers. She said the commission could only examine the tax issue in a special proceeding covering all investor-owned utilities in the state.

HEADLINE: Immigrant Workers And Bernard Kerik

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Bernard B. Kerik's withdrawal as the nominee to run the Department of Homeland Security (''Kerik Withdraws as Bush's Nominee for Security Post,'' front page, Dec. 11) highlights an increasingly inarguable truth: even wealthy and powerful Americans rely on undocumented immigrant workers. Why? Because they do the work we need at the lowest price. 
 The American people need to match their insatiable desire for cheap labor with legal protections for these important economic participants. We need to stop whining about immigrants taking jobs away from Americans and realize that Americans will not do this work for the wages that Americans are willing to pay. Until then, we can expect to see more of these unfortunate embarrassments.

HEADLINE: How Do You Drive Out a Union? South Carolina Factory Provides a Textbook Case

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: SUMTER, S.C. 

 BODY:
Tom Brown, the leader of an anti-union campaign at the EnerSys battery factory here, made some surprising admissions in recent testimony about how his campaign had been run and financed.
 Mr. Brown, a longtime maintenance man, acknowledged that a mysterious consultant known as Mr. X had advised him on how to oust the union and had helped him write fliers that called the union's leaders names like ''trailer trash,'' ''Uncle Tom'' and ''dog woman.'' Not only that, Mr. Brown testified that envelopes filled with cash had often been sent to his home. He said he had no idea who had sent them. ''I don't look a gift horse in the mouth,'' he said.
 Across the South companies have long used bare-knuckled tactics to fight unions. But now a surprisingly detailed roadmap to such tactics has emerged from an unusual court battle between EnerSys and its law firm over whose wrongdoing -- the company's or its lawyers' -- led to a $7.75 million settlement that EnerSys entered into after federal officials accused it of 120 labor law violations in its seven-year effort to eliminate the union. 
 The company has accused the firm, Jackson Lewis, of malpractice and of advising it to engage in illegal behavior. The law firm says that EnerSys ignored its sound advice and that the company is trying to avoid paying its legal bill. 
 The wrangling has cast a spotlight on how the company fired and harassed the union's top officials and aided Mr. Brown, the anti-union leader, although federal law prohibits companies from financing or otherwise assisting efforts to get rid of a union.
 The litigation also highlights a little known but thriving business in which law firms and consultants work with corporations to beat back unionization efforts. Jackson Lewis, a national law firm based in New York, describes itself as ''committed to the practice of preventive labor relations.''
 ''Union membership is declining because employers will stop at nothing to prevent employees from having a union,'' said David Bonior, the former Michigan Congressman who is now president of American Rights at Work, an advocacy group fighting violations of workers' rights. ''Unfortunately, 75 percent of employers use union-busting consultants to fight unionization drives.''
 Labor experts call the EnerSys case unusual, with federal labor officials accusing the company of firing the top seven union leaders, spying on workers, refusing to bargain and ultimately closing the 500-worker plant to retaliate against the union. Its $7.75 million settlement is evidence of how far the company strayed from the law. But labor experts also say the case opens a window onto some common tactics. 
 ''Jackson Lewis is a key player in the union avoidance industry,'' said Fred Feinstein, former general counsel at the National Labor Relations Board. ''This kind of aggressive anti-union campaign is not unusual.''
 Jackson Lewis says it did nothing wrong.
 ''Jackson Lewis zealously represents its clients,'' Kevin A. Hall, a lawyer representing the firm, said. ''In doing so, the firm always honors the letter and the spirit of the law. Jackson Lewis was neither involved in the initial campaign by the union to organize the employees nor involved in any effort to assist the employees to oust the union.'' EnerSys refused to comment.
 This tale began a decade ago when the International Union of Electrical Workers began rounding up support at the factory, which produced giant batteries to power forklifts and provide backup power to cellphone towers. 
 The union petitioned for a unionization election when many workers voiced dismay about meager pensions, bullying supervisors, production speedups and safety problems, especially with the high temperatures and lead used in production.
 The company, then called Yuasa, hired Jackson Lewis to help mount a last-minute anti-union campaign. The company required employees to listen to speakers saying the union did not want to help workers, but only wanted their dues money. Management posted pictures of tombstones and skulls and crossbones in the cafeteria to warn employees that unionized factories often closed. 
 But on Feb. 23, 1995, the workers voted 191 to 185 to unionize. Management was livid.
 ''They said that if the union came in the company was doomed,'' Paulette Jackson, a union steward and quality control worker, said. ''They fought tooth and nail. They didn't want a union in the South. Period.''
 The company fired Ms. Jackson, accusing her of failing to detect some faulty batteries, but her supervisor later told the National Labor Relations Board that the charges were trumped up.
 The company's tactics led to many tangles with the labor board, which ultimately filed a sweeping complaint against EnerSys, accusing it of 120 violations of federal law, among them wrongly firing Ms. Jackson and other union leaders, assisting the anti-union campaign, improperly withdrawing union recognition and moving production to nonunion plants as retaliation. 
 As a result of all the litigation -- including the battle between the company and its lawyers -- detail after detail of what had happened emerged. In a deposition, Darryl Davids, the factory's director of human resources, testified that John Craig, the company's president, had once said: ''We need to do whatever we've got to do to get rid of this union, regardless of what it may cost us.''
 After the unionization vote, management refused to negotiate a contract, challenging the union's victory. After a two-year legal battle, a federal appeals court ruled that the union's victory was valid and ordered the company to bargain. During those two years, the company refused to grant raises.
 Once negotiations began, the company said it faced such hard times, even though the economy was booming, that it would lay off workers unless the union accepted a 10 percent pay cut. Management indicated that a new ''gainsharing'' plan would offset those cuts by providing bonuses for increased productivity.
 Pressured by union leaders from Washington, union officials and workers in Sumter reluctantly approved management's proposals, they say.
 But then the company stunned the workers, cutting most salaries by 16 percent, not 10 percent. Workers complained that the gainsharing bonuses were minuscule, even though productivity had increased.
 ''They gave us a bum deal on that gainsharing,'' said David Bunker, a machine operator whose pay fell to $11.07 an hour from $13.26. ''The union was trusting the company to do what is right. That didn't work.''
 The union protested the tiny bonuses, and the dispute went before an arbitrator. After two more years came a final ruling that EnerSys had improperly manipulated the system to give paltry bonuses. 
 The arbitration's star witness was a former human resources director, Choice Phillips. Mr. Phillips said the factory's budget had provided no money for bonuses, indicating that management had never intended to offset the pay cuts. 
 Mr. Phillips also testified that the plant manager, Doyle Thresher, used to leave cash on a table in his office for Mr. Brown, to help finance the anti-union campaign. The plant manager, Mr. Phillips testified, said the cash was ''trash'' that Mr. Brown was to pick up.
 EnerSys said in legal hearings that Mr. Phillips had been fired for sexual harassment, an allegation he denies. The company won a defamation suit against him, but in November, a federal judge vacated that judgment, concluding that EnerSys had lied when it denied that it had helped the anti-union campaign. Mr. Phillips said he had been dismissed for refusing to participate in the company's illegal conduct.
 ''They did everything they could to make the union look bad,'' Larry Brown, a union vice president, said. 
 Many workers became angry with the union over the pay cuts, especially because they received no raises from 1995 to 2001.
 The anger fueled the effort to oust the union. Tom Brown organized anti-union meetings, sent mailings to the plant's 500 workers and asked them to sign cards saying they wanted the union out. 
 Mr. Brown testified that Mr. X, the company consultant, had given him advice. EnerSys officials later admitted that they had paid the consultant $39,000 to help guide the anti-union campaign. Mr. Brown also acknowledged that company officials had given him stamps for anti-union mailings.
 The company also went after union officials directly. In June 2001, EnerSys fired Vincent Gailliard, the union's president, during an arbitration hearing over the bonuses, accusing him of lying. EnerSys announced that same day that it was withdrawing recognition from the union, asserting that a majority of workers had signed cards saying they no longer wanted a union.
 ''They figured if they got rid of the leaders, the rest of us would buckle under,'' Cathy Moody, another fired union official, said.
 The labor board accused EnerSys of fabricating its allegations against Mr. Gailliard, asserting that it fired him to cripple the union and cow workers.
 Facing a downturn in orders, EnerSys began several rounds of layoffs in 2001, often giving no advance notice to the union. On Sept. 10, 2001, EnerSys announced it was closing the factory, again giving no notice. 
 Federal law generally requires that factories give unions notice before large-scale layoffs and plant closings.
 Union officials said EnerSys's tactics were an egregious version of what many corporations do. According to N.L.R.B. statistics, companies illegally retaliate against 20,000 workers a year for supporting a union. And according to a study by Kate Bronfenbrenner of Cornell University, half the companies that face unionization campaigns threaten to close their plants and one fourth fire at least one union supporter to derail the campaigns. 
 Faced with the sweeping complaint by the N.L.R.B., EnerSys agreed to pay $7.75 million to settle the board's charges and the union's lawsuits over the failure to pay bonuses or give notice of the layoffs. 
 After the settlement, EnerSys sued Jackson Lewis, accusing it of malpractice, including misleading federal investigators, giving illegal assistance to Mr. Brown and engineering ''a relentless and unlawful campaign to oust the union.''
 ''The company gave carte blanche to the law firm -- the law firm was pretty much running the plant,'' Mr. Gailliard said. ''It came back and slapped them in the face, and now they want someone to blame.''
 EnerSys said that Jackson Lewis had engaged in malpractice by recommending that the company withdraw union recognition when the firm must have known about the illegal anti-union aid. Federal law bars the withdrawal of union recognition when companies have financed a decertification effort. EnerSys also accused Jackson Lewis of wrongly advising it not to give the union notice of the layoffs and plant closing.
 Jackson Lewis has mounted a vigorous defense. It has accused EnerSys of obstructing justice and paying ''hush money'' to Mr. Brown by placing him in a job with a company that services the shuttered battery factory and by paying his salary there. EnerSys insists that the arrangement was not intended to buy silence.
 Jackson Lewis says it consistently gave sound advice. 
 Mr. Hall, the lawyer representing the firm, said, ''Sometimes when clients ignore their attorneys' advice and end up with disappointing results, especially where legal fees are still outstanding, they deny responsibility for their own conduct and sue their lawyers for malpractice, hoping that the case will settle with a forgiveness of the legal fees.'' Jackson Lewis says EnerSys owes it more than $270,000.
 Frank Macerato, general counsel for EnerSys, which is based in Reading, Pa., declined comment, saying the company would not discuss matters in litigation.
 Today the factory lies quiet, and many workers remain unemployed. Jackie Clemmons, one of the earliest union supporters, said the firings, the lack of raises and the plant closing had all sent a powerful message.
 ''After all this, I don't think you could pay the people here to join a union, to mess with a union,'' Mr. Clemmons said. ''And I don't believe the union would want to deal with us anymore down here.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rally as Reports of Mergers Raise Expectations

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks rallied yesterday after the software maker PeopleSoft accepted Oracle's $10.3 billion sweetened buyout offer and other big deals fueled expectations for more takeovers. 
 Ending a long battle, Oracle increased its offer for PeopleSoft to $26.50 a share from an earlier offer of $24. Shares of Oracle rose $1.35, or 10 percent, to $14.63, while PeopleSoft jumped $2.47, or 10.3 percent, to $26.42 on Nasdaq.
 News of the deal helped drive the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to close at its highest level since August 2001, while the Dow Jones industrial average logged its highest close since March. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average added 95.10 points, or 0.90 percent, to close at 10,638.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.68 points, or 0.90 percent, to 1,198.68. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 20.43 points, or 1 percent, to 2,148.50. 
 Other deals in focus included Honeywell International's agreement to buy Novar of Britain for $1.5 billion and reports that Sprint and Nextel Communications are continuing their talks. 
 ''It's not merger mania yet, but we've got Oracle and PeopleSoft, Sprint and Nextel, and we've got Honeywell buying Novar,'' John Forelli, portfolio manager with Independence Investments, said. 
 ''There's been speculation that 2005 is going to be a big M. and A. year as companies try to grow and margins get depressed. Today reminds people that corporate America has plenty of money and they are willing to spend it.'' 
 Trading was moderate, with 1.4 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, equaling the 1.4 billion daily average for last year. 
 Investors also pushed stocks higher on data from the Commerce Department showing retail sales increased by 0.1 percent in November. Economists looked for a 0.1 percent decline. 
 After a tepid start to the critical holiday shopping season, investors welcomed the small increase in November retail sales and were thankful the figures did not register a slide as expected, traders said. 
 Honeywell's $1.5 billion offer for Novar is aimed at bolstering its security business and lifting 2005 earnings toward consensus forecasts. Shares of Honeywell gained $1.14, or 3 percent, to $36.45. 
 Investors are waiting on the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision today, when it is widely expected to lift its overnight lending rate a quarter-point, to 2.25 percent. Comments on the health of the economy from the Fed's policy panel will also be scrutinized by Wall Street. 
 Shares of Sprint climbed 1.2 percent, to $24.44. Sources close to the situation say Sprint is near a deal to buy Nextel. 
 Electronic Arts, THQ and Take-Two Interactive Software jumped after J.P. Morgan raised its rating on the companies, all video game publishers, to overweight from neutral. 
 Electronic Arts was up 6.2 percent, to $57.57, Take-Two rose 5 percent, to $35.42, and THQ climbed 3.3 percent, to $23.48 on Nasdaq. 
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 1/32, to a price of 100 26/32. The note's yield remained at 4.15 percent.
 The 30-year Treasury bond gained 7/32, to a price of 108 14/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.8 percent from 4.82 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: Mayor Vows to Keep Crime Low

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Crystallizing his message for his re-election campaign, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that crime has fallen nearly 5 percent this year in New York, and wrapped the announcement in a rosy assessment of life in the city under his tutelage. 
 ''I think it's fair to say our city is on a roll,'' Mr. Bloomberg said during a news conference in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. ''Our quality of life is strong, our schools are improving and our economy is growing again. Jobs are being created in all five boroughs and unemployment is the lowest it's been in three years.'' 
 And setting a new bar for his performance on the law enforcement front, Mr. Bloomberg also declared, ''As long as I am mayor we will keep crime coming down in this city.'' Crime has fallen sharply over the last decade and New York outpaces the rest of the nation. 
 According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York's crime rate remains 25th out of the 25 major cities around the country, and out of 217 cities with populations greater than 100,000, New York City was ranked 203rd, between Alexandria, Va., and Ann Arbor, Mich.
 The mayor, whose statistics came from the Police Department and are as of last week, attributed much of the drop in crime to Operation Impact, a program that puts more officers in neighborhoods where crime patterns persist. This year, the initiative has resulted in more than 11,000 arrests, Mr. Bloomberg said. Further, the city is on course to have fewer than 600 homicides by year's end for the third year in a row; in the Bronx, homicides are down 34.5 percent over the last three years.
 During his lengthy remarks yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg also alluded to the 18.5 percent property tax increase he ordered in 2002. The mayor is not fond of talking about the increase. But yesterday he used it to defend his record on maintaining city services. ''I did something unpopular,'' he said, ''I asked the City Council to pass a tax increase.'' But he did so, he said, ''not worrying about politics.'' The mayor was concerned enough about politics, however, to refund most of the increase this year, a move likely central to his re-election bid as well.

HEADLINE: A Record Short in Washington, Long in Utah

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
In choosing Michael O. Leavitt to be secretary of health and human services, President Bush is nominating a former governor of Utah who generally pursued an ambitious approach to expanding health care coverage in his state, favoring aggressive, even untested solutions if they held the promise of greater efficiency and access to benefits.
 ''He's not an odd pick at all,'' said Scott Williams, executive director of Utah's Department of Health, acknowledging the surprised reaction of many in Washington that Mr. Bush would turn to an apparent environmental specialist to preside over a vast array of health programs in the federal department with the largest budget, more than $543 billion for fiscal year that ended in September.
 Mr. Leavitt, who is 53, was Utah governor for 11 years before he resigned last year to become administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, which was ''totally and completely surprised'' on Monday, when Mr. Leavitt announced his resignation, one of his aides said. 
 But if anything, Mr. Leavitt as governor probably had a stronger impact on health-related issues than environmental ones, working closely with Washington to give states more flexibility in managing federal health care programs. 
 In 1994, the Utah Legislature passed his health care initiative that led to an increase of 400,000 people with health insurance in the next 10 years. In 1995-96, Mr. Leavitt was one of six governors who led efforts to reform welfare and Medicaid.
 In 1997, he fought to make the new federal Children's Health Insurance Program a separate entity, rather than an expansion of Medicaid, to protect it from economic downturns that would reduce benefits. In 2002, state officials said, Utah became the first state to win a federal waiver allowing it to cut some Medicaid benefits to provide coverage for a larger number of low-income residents.
 Critics asserted that Mr. Leavitt's flexibility undermined the guaranteed benefits that many of Utah's poor and elderly residents relied upon.
 ''A lot of Mike's background was working with federal agencies that were not doing enough to reach across barriers,'' said Jim Geringer, a former Republican governor of Wyoming who worked closely with Mr. Leavitt on a variety of issues.
 Mr. Leavitt's pragmatism was a major reason Mr. Bush tapped him to lead the E.P.A. He replaced another former Republican governor, Christie Whitman, of New Jersey, who resigned after it became apparent that her moderate approach to policy did not always sit well with the White House.
 With a reputation for inviting all sides to the table, Mr. Leavitt plunged into a thicket of clean air and clean water issues with confidence that his common-sense approach would prevail. On some issues it did. He completed new standards for diesel emissions and brought together dozens of federal, state and local leaders to develop a plan to clean up the Great Lakes.
 But some of the major contentious issues facing the agency eluded resolution, including new rules that would reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury.
 Over the weekend, the White House made it clear that its environmental priority for the second term would be antipollution legislation called Clear Skies that had languished in committee, rather than a regulatory measure known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule, which Mr. Leavitt had promised to finish by the end of the year. The deadline was pushed back to March.
 Environmental groups oppose both efforts as too accommodating to the utilities they would govern. But that did not make them necessary gleeful that Mr. Leavitt was leaving. His inclusive approach to problem-solving, if not the environmental preferences of the White House, had at least made him an honest broker in the eyes of some leading environmental groups. 
 Phil Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, said Mr. Leavitt's exit made him nervous because the next E.P.A. administrator might be ''a hard right'' leader.
 Agency officials said several people had emerged as candidates, including Jim L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality; Gov. Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho, who was on the short list when Mr. Leavitt was named, and three senior E.P.A. officials: Steve Johnson, Thomas V. Skinner and Jeffrey R. Holmstead. 
 ''Obviously, we had policy differences with him,'' Mr. Clapp said of Mr. Leavitt. ''But we had begun a good dialogue. Conversations had started. He had made a serious effort to reach out to us. Who replaces him is a great concern to the environmental community.''

HEADLINE: NASA Leader Cites Finances And Submits His Resignation

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
Sean O'Keefe resigned as NASA administrator on Monday, saying he is leaving the position he has held for three years to pursue better economic opportunity for his family.
 Mr. O'Keefe's pending departure as head of the space agency had been widely discussed over the weekend when it was disclosed that he was in line to become chancellor of the main campus of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. 
 Mr. O'Keefe, 48, is scheduled to be at the university on Wednesday and Thursday for meetings and tours before its board of supervisors votes on a new chancellor, a spokesman for the university said. 
 President Bush received and accepted the resignation, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Robert Jacobs, said. 
 In his resignation letter, Mr. O'Keefe said he would stay in his position until a successor had been selected and confirmed, but he indicated he would like to leave by February.
 ''Administrator O'Keefe has previously indicated to us that he is planning on leaving,'' a spokesman for the White House, Scott McClellan, said at a briefing. ''The president believes he has done a great job over at NASA.''
 In his handwritten five-page letter, Mr. O'Keefe said that the first of his three children would begin college next fall and that ''I owe them the same opportunity my parents provided for me to pursue higher education without the crushing burden of debt thereafter.''
 ''This was the most difficult decision I've ever made, but it's one I felt was best for my family and our future,'' said Mr. O'Keefe in a separate statement.
 The administrator's position pays $158,000 a year. The chancellor of L.S.U. earns more than $500,000.
 Mr. O'Keefe was sworn in as the 10th administrator of the agency on Dec. 21, 2001, after Mr. Bush's nomination and Senate confirmation. 
 A management and accounting expert, he was sent to rein in cost overruns on the International Space Station and other projects.
 A year after changes began, NASA faced one of its biggest challenges when the shuttle Columbia disintegrated returning from a mission, killing its seven-member crew. 
 The accident, partly attributed to management problems at NASA, led to significant safety and operational changes, spearheaded by Mr. O'Keefe.
 ''I was sorry to hear of Sean O'Keefe's decision to step down, as he has been an effective and forward-looking leader for NASA over the past three years,'' Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House Science Committee, said in a statement. ''Sean leaves NASA in far better shape than he found it.'' 
 While praising Mr. O'Keefe, Representative Bart Gordon of Tennessee, ranking Democrat on the committee, said the next administrator faced problems like returning the shuttle fleet to flight and reconciling constrained budgets with Mr. Bush's goals of expanding human exploration of the Moon and Mars.
 Officials at NASA said the White House had appointed a group to look at possible successors.
 A list under discussion, experts on space policy said, includes Lt. Gen. Ronald T. Kadish, who retired from the Air Force and who until September directed the Missile Defense Agency; former Representative Robert Walker of Pennsylvania, a former House Science Committee chairman and a member of the president's Moon-Mars exploration commission; and former astronauts.

HEADLINE: Most G.O.P. Plans to Remake Social Security Involve Deep Cuts to Tomorrow's Retirees

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
As President Bush gears up for a major public push to overhaul Social Security, he has focused almost all his rhetorical energy on the need to let people divert some of their taxes to private retirement accounts.
 But nearly every leading Republican proposal on Capitol Hill acknowledges that private accounts by themselves do little to solve the system's projected shortfall of at least $3.5 trillion. Instead, those proposals rely on deep cuts in benefits to future retirees.
 That uncomfortable political truth was driven home on Monday by the head of the investigative arm of Congress.
 ''The creation of private accounts for Social Security will not deal with the solvency and sustainability of the Social Security fund,'' that official, David M. Walker, comptroller general of the Government Accountability Office, said in a speech on Monday. 
 Or, as Thomas Saving, a Republican-appointed trustee to the Social Security trust fund put it last week: ''Fundamentally, if you don't reduce the benefits, you don't reduce the debt.''
 Some of the Republican proposals would raise the age when people can start to receive benefits. Others would reduce payments to beneficiaries to account for longer life expectancies. Still others would reduce payments to married couples and scale back the annual increases that are made to keep pace with inflation.
 But the biggest single idea is included in the plan the White House most often points to, abandoning the practice of setting benefits as a share of people's pre-retirement earnings.
 Analysts affiliated with both political parties say that that one change could save more than $10 trillion over the next 75 years, more than enough to wipe out Social Security's projected shortfall. People retiring today or even in the next 10 years would feel almost no impact.
 But in decades to come, analysts say, many people would see sharper drops in their incomes when they retired. And because benefits would not keep up with wages, many retirees could feel steadily poorer compared with neighbors who still work.
 Mr. Bush, who is likely to step up his call for private accounts when he acts as host of a two-day conference on the economy this week, has steadfastly avoided any reference to cutting future benefits. Instead, he has repeated a two-part message, that Social Security faces a financial crisis, and that people should be allowed to put some of their payroll taxes into private accounts and earn higher returns by investing in stocks.
 ''This is more than a problem to be solved,'' Mr. Bush declared during the election campaign. ''It's an opportunity to help millions of our fellow citizens find the security and independence of ownership.'' 
 To drive that point home this week, White House officials scheduled a single mother from Iowa, Sandy Jaques, to speak on the advantages that private accounts could offer to divorced spouses and widows.
 But White House officials have begun to acknowledge what many conservatives take as a given; that is, with or without personal accounts, future Social Security benefits must be scaled back.
 ''Sacrifice is built into the system already,'' Joshua B. Bolten director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a meeting with reporters last week. ''The one thing I can say for sure is that if left unattended, the system will be unable to make good on its promises.''
 Those comments echo a recent warning by N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, that there ''is no free lunch'' and that the benefits promised today are ''unfeasible'' for the future.
 Because Mr. Bush has yet to spell out any details of how he would overhaul the system, his stated principles sound like a free lunch: benefits for people at or near retirement should not go down; taxes should not go up; people who do not want private accounts should be able to keep drawing benefits. 
 The leading Republican proposals, at first glance, sound even better. Benefits could actually be higher than before for low-income people, widows and divorced spouses. On top of all that, Social Security's looming shortfalls, estimated variously from $3.5 trillion to $10.4 trillion, would be wiped out. 
 But most of the Republican proposals would also reduce the role of Social Security as a source of guaranteed retirement income, slowly but surely.
 The simplest cut is the one developed by Mr. Bush's advisory commission on Social Security in 2001. That proposal, which White House officials often cite as a model for how the system could be changed, would change the way future benefits are calculated.
 Instead of setting benefits as a share of a person's pre-retirement wages -- about 42 percent, for a middle-income worker today -- the government would link future benefits to inflation.
 Because wages generally rise faster than inflation, analysts say the savings could total more than $10 trillion and would wipe out the entire projected deficit for Social Security in one easy move.
 ''If you just switched from wage-indexing to price-indexing, you would save so much money over that period you would actually wipe out the entire imbalance,'' said Kent Smetters, an associate professor at the Wharton School of Business who worked on entitlement issues in the Bush Treasury Department. 
 But many analysts contend that the change could also leave future workers with a huge drop in income as soon as they retire and would erode a basic premise of the current old-age system. 
 Under today's law, a middle-income worker who retires in 2065 would be entitled to an annual Social Security benefit of $26,400, or about 40 percent of the worker's wages.
 Under the proposed change, that same worker's benefit in 2065 would decrease by 40 percent to $14,600, about 22 percent of the wages. That prospect troubles many experts, including some conservatives. 
 ''What people are forgetting is why the system is there in the first place,'' said John Goodman, director of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research group that strongly supports private accounts. ''The reason is that people don't want to reach retirement age and have their standard of living cut in half. If you use price-indexing, you won't be keeping up with your neighbors.''
 Critics of the administration contend that Mr. Bush is using the tangible allure of personal accounts to mask a profound reduction in the government's main safety net for the elderly.
 ''They are using smoke and mirrors in the sense that they are cutting taxes in the here and now and making cuts way off in the future,'' said Laurence J. Kotlikoff, a professor of economics at Boston University who has written extensively on the long-term financial problems of Social Security and Medicare. ''What I see them doing is very gradually wiping out the old system, and putting something very minor in its place.''
 Democratic lawmakers say the problems in Social Security can be fixed with modest changes that would be phased in slowly. Lifting the ceiling on payroll taxes, which are capped when a person earns more than $87,900, would fill much of the gap. Pushing back the normal retirement age, which is already set to shift from 65 to 67, would reduce the deficit even more. 
 ''If the president pulled all sides into a room and put everything on the table, we could solve this problem very quickly,'' said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California. 
 Mr. Bush's own advisory commission in 2001 made it clear that personal accounts would make little dent in the underlying shortfall.
 If the government kept Social Security benefits as they are now, and let people set up private accounts as well, the government would still face a shortfall of more than $4 trillion over the next 75 years.
 Some Republicans suggest that a free lunch may indeed be possible. Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator John E. Sununu of New Hampshire have proposed a bill they say would eliminate the projected shortfall without reducing future benefits or imposing new taxes.
 In contrast to most other proposals, which would not allow people to divert more than about $1,000 in taxes a year to personal accounts, Mr. Sununu and Mr. Ryan would let people divert almost all their Social Security taxes to private accounts.
 ''What we learned was that with these large accounts you produce such large surpluses that you don't need to cut back on benefits,'' Mr. Ryan said. 
 But many analysts are skeptical. The key to the plan is a premise that total government spending on all programs would grow by 3.6 percent a year for the next eight years.
 That would be extremely difficult. More than two-thirds of the federal budget is locked up in mandatory entitlement programs, mainly Social Security and Medicare. Any cuts there would violate Mr. Bush's pledge to protect people who are at or near retirement. 
 An additional 20 percent of the budget goes to domestic security and the military, which have ballooned under Mr. Bush, and with no end in sight to the war in Iraq, are expected to keep climbing.
 ''The plan is really based on the assumption that budget restraint will fill the hole in Social Security, and that is a doubtful assumption,'' said Peter R. Orzsag, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was a Clinton administration official. 
 Given the difficulties, some Republicans say they have to consider tax increases. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a longtime champion of private savings accounts, recently broke with the Bush administration and proposed raising the ceiling on payroll taxes for high-income workers.
 ''The bottom line is that there should be no Band-Aid solutions, no more kick-the-can-down the road,'' Mr. Graham said. ''If anybody else can come up with a better way to achieve solvency, I am all for it.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses for New Director Of the U.N.'s Atomic Agency

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said Monday that it would continue to press for Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei to be replaced next year as head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, but European diplomats and some administration officials said they could not rule out his staying on if no suitable alternative emerges.
 Officials at the White House and the State Department repeated in nearly identical language on Monday that the administration adhered to the so-called Geneva rule, named after a group of 14 wealthy countries that subsidize the United Nations, that leaders of international organizations should serve only two terms and then retire.
 Dr. ElBaradei, an Egyptian lawyer who has tangled with the administration on Iraq and drawn criticism from conservatives for his failure to declare that Iran has a nuclear weapons program, began running the I.A.E.A., the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, in 1997. His second four-year term ends next fall, and he has said he would like a third term. 
 ''Our view has always been, two terms is enough,'' said Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, adding that no decision had been made on who might replace Dr. ElBaradei. ''With regard to any specific agency, we'll have to see who the candidates are. We'll make our decisions at that time.''
 The administration's comments were prompted by a report in The Washington Post on Sunday that secret negotiations conducted by Dr. ElBaradei with Iran had been intercepted by American intelligence services, but that they did not reveal anything incriminating to strengthen the hand of conservatives in the administration seeking his ouster. 
 Bush administration officials said they could not confirm that his conversations had been monitored, but several said they would not be surprised if that were the case. In August, Lt. Gen. Mike Hayden, head of the National Security Agency, testified before Congress that electronic surveillance was often carried out to give ''tactical support to State Department negotiators.''
 Despite the American position that Dr. ElBaradei should not have another term, European and other diplomats said he had proved effective in recent negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. He repeatedly criticized the Tehran government for failing to disclose all its nuclear-related activities. He has also declared that Iran still needed to dispel doubts about its programs.
 Last month, Iran acceded to a request by Britain, France and Germany to suspend a major part of its nuclear program in return for discussions on possible future economic incentives. Talks with those countries are to resume this week.
 Bush administration hard-liners, led by John R. Bolton, under secretary of state for arms control and international security, have criticized Dr. ElBaradei's performance publicly and privately, particularly because of his refusal before the Iraq war to endorse the administration's view that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons program.
 Since the war and the failure to find evidence of such a program, Dr. ElBaradei has said many times that he has been vindicated by the facts, a statement that, while difficult to deny, rankled many throughout the administration.
 But others in the administration say Dr. ElBaradei, as a Muslim with a reputation for impartiality, has served American interests well on Iran and might well be the best person to help negotiate a resolution of the dispute over Tehran's nuclear program.
 ''There are a lot of views in this administration, but frankly we could do a lot worse,'' said an American official, explaining that resentment of the Bush administration might well cause the nations that support the international agency to rally around someone even more skeptical of American claims.
 A European diplomat said that Dr. ElBaradei, who has called for a negotiated settlement to the Iran impasse, had played a constructive role and that the Geneva rule was ''more of a habit than a rule.'' In addition, both France and Germany, for example, have not endorsed the American call for him to be replaced, officials from those countries said.
 Another Western diplomat involved in discussions at the United Nations said any overt attempt by the United States to push Dr. ElBaradei out would backfire among countries resentful of the war in Iraq and other American actions. 
 ''It's always dangerous for the United States to openly push for someone to get out of a job like this one, unless you're 100 percent sure you've lined up someone who is better,'' the diplomat said. 
 According to the rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency, two-thirds of the agency's members must ratify the selection of a new director. The schedule calls for a decision to be made by next summer.
 A senior administration official said it was not impossible that Dr. ElBaradei would end up with a new term. ''I don't think we've boxed ourselves in,'' the official said. ''We're waiting to see who emerges between now and the time we have to decide.''
 Another senior administration official said the sparring over Dr. ElBaradei was a sideshow, because the real problem in confronting Iran is the lack of support for such an approach by Europeans, Arab nations, Russia and China. Without their support for a tough approach, the administration's demands for an end to Iran's program cannot succeed, he said.

HEADLINE: Eskimos Seek to Recast Global Warming as a Rights Issue

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN; Larry Rohter contributed reporting from Buenos Aires for this article.

 BODY:
The Eskimos, or Inuit, about 155,000 seal-hunting peoples scattered around the Arctic, plan to seek a ruling from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that the United States, by contributing substantially to global warming, is threatening their existence. 
 The Inuit plan is part of a broader shift in the debate over human-caused climate change evident among participants in the 10th round of international talks taking place in Buenos Aires aimed at averting dangerous human interference with the climate system. 
 Inuit leaders said they planned to announce the effort at the climate meeting today.
 Representatives of poor countries and communities -- from the Arctic fringes to the atolls of the tropics to the flanks of the Himalayas -- say they are imperiled by rising temperatures and seas through no fault of their own. They are casting the issue as no longer simply an environmental problem but as an assault on their basic human rights. 
 The commission, an investigative arm of the Organization of American States, has no enforcement powers. But a declaration that the United States has violated the Inuit's rights could create the foundation for an eventual lawsuit, either against the United States in an international court or against American companies in federal court, said a number of legal experts, including some aligned with industry. 
 Such a petition could have decent prospects now that industrial countries, including the United States, have concluded in recent reports and studies that warming linked to heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe emissions is contributing to big environmental changes in the Arctic, a number of experts said.
 Last month, an assessment of Arctic climate change by 300 scientists for the eight countries with Arctic territory, including the United States, concluded that ''human influences'' are now the dominant factor.
 Inuit representatives attending the conference said in telephone interviews that after studying the matter for several years with the help of environmental lawyers they would this spring begin the lengthy process of filing a petition by collecting videotaped statements from elders and hunters about the effects they were experiencing from the shrinking northern icescape. 
 The lawyers, at EarthJustice, a nonprofit San Francisco law firm, and the Center for International Environmental Law, in Washington, said the Inter-American Commission, which has a record of treating environmental degradation as a human rights matter, provides the best chance of success. The Inuit have standing in the Organization of American States through Canada.
 Sheila Watt-Cloutier, the elected chairwoman of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, the quasi-governmental group recognized by the United Nations as representing the Inuit, said the biggest fear was not that warming would kill individuals but that it would be the final blow to a sturdy but suffering culture. 
 ''We've had to struggle as a people to keep afloat, to keep our indigenous wisdom and traditions,'' she said. ''We're an adaptable people, but adaptability has its limits.
 ''Something is bound to give, and it's starting to give in the Arctic, and we're giving that early warning signal to the rest of the world.''
 If the Inuit effort succeeds, it could lead to an eventual stream of litigation, somewhat akin to lawsuits against tobacco companies, legal experts said. 
 The two-week convention, which ends Friday, is the latest session on two climate treaties: the 1992 framework convention on climate change and the Kyoto Protocol, an addendum that takes effect in February and for the first time requires most industrialized countries to curb such emissions. 
 The United States has signed both pacts and is bound by the 1992 treaty, which requires no emissions cuts. But the Bush administration opposes the mandatory Kyoto treaty, saying it could harm the economy and unfairly excuses big developing countries from obligations.
 That situation makes the United States particularly vulnerable to such suits, environmental lawyers said. 
 By embracing the first treaty and signing the second, it has acknowledged that climate change is a problem to be avoided; but by subsequently rejecting the Kyoto pact, the lawyers said, it has not shown a commitment to stemming its emissions, which constitute a fourth of the global total. 
 The American delegation at the Buenos Aires conference declined to comment on Tuesday on the petition or the arguments behind it. ''Until the Inuit have presented a complaint, we are not responding to that issue,'' a State Department official said. ''When they do, we will look at what they have to say, consider it and then respond.''
 Christopher C. Horner, a lawyer for the Cooler Heads Coalition, an industry-financed group opposed to cutting the emissions, said the chances of success of such lawsuits had risen lately. 
 From his standpoint, he said, ''The planets are aligned very poorly.''
 Delegates who flew to the conference from the Arctic's far-flung communities, where retreating sea ice imperils traditional seal hunts, said they planned to meet in Buenos Aires with representatives from small-island nations that could eventually be swamped by rising seas, swelled by meltwater from shrinking glaciers and Arctic ice sheets.
 Enele S. Sopoaga, the ambassador to the United Nations from Tuvalu, a 15-foot-high nation of wave-pounded atolls halfway between Australia and Hawaii, said he still saw legal efforts as a last resort. 
 Tuvalu had threatened to sue the United States two years ago in the International Court of Justice, but held off for a variety of reasons.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Rises

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Production at factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3 percent in November, the Federal Reserve said yesterday. 
 The increase in industrial production came after a gain of 0.6 percent in October that was smaller than previously reported.
 Economists had expected the industrial production index to rise 0.2 percent in November.
 Production was up 4.2 percent from a year earlier, and the share of industrial capacity put to use rose to 77.6 percent last month, the highest since May 2001, when it was 77.5 percent. 
 Work at factories, which accounts for almost 90 percent of the index, rose 0.3 percent in November after it increased 0.5 percent the month before, the Fed said in its report.

HEADLINE: Fed Panel Lifts Rates and Says More Increases Are Probable 

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Tuesday for the fifth time this year and suggested that more rate increases are in order in the months ahead.
 As expected, the central bank raised the federal funds rate on overnight loans by a quarter point, to 2.25 percent, and reiterated its intention to raise borrowing costs at a ''pace that is likely to be measured.''
 The decision was a milestone of sorts, pushing the overnight lending rates in the United States above those in Europe for the first time since March 2001.
 It also came just hours after the news that America's trade deficit shot up 9 percent in October to a monthly record of $55.5 billion, adding to anxieties among investors about the possibility of a sharp plunge in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. 
 By repeating its previous statements almost word for word, the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee offered no hint of changing its pace of raising interest rates from their lows last June.
 ''The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative,'' a reference to an easy money policy, the central bank said. 
 Similarly, the bank maintained its assessment of inflation and economic growth, again declaring that the ''upside and downside risks'' on both fronts were still ''roughly equal.'' 
 The statement was in line with what analysts had expected, but it led investors to jettison any lingering suspicions that the Fed may pause in its rate increases at the next policy meeting, on Feb. 1 and 2.
 Based on the prices of fed funds futures contracts, traders raised the probability of a rate increase in February to 100 percent from about 80 percent.
 Until about a month ago, some analysts were predicting that the Federal Reserve would take a break in December from its policy of raising the cost of money to a more ''neutral'' and less inflationary level.
 In recent weeks, some analysts began to speculate that the Fed might speed up its rate increases because of increased worry about inflation. 
 But the Fed defied both camps of speculators. The message on Tuesday was straightforward: expect more of the same until further notice.
 The Federal Reserve still has a long way to go before interest rates are back up to a neutral level, one that neither provokes inflation nor slows economic activity. 
 Even after the latest rate increase, the ''real'' fed funds rate is about zero after adjusting for inflation.
 That is well below any definition of normal or neutral. Historically, the federal funds rate has been about two or three percentage points above the inflation rate. 
 When asked what a neutral interest rate might be, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told a Congressional committee in July that people would recognize it when they had one.
 Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, predicted that the federal funds rate would rise to about 4 percent by early 2006. 
 ''Four percent is kind of like home base for neutral,'' Mr. Hoffman said, ''but it may not reach that level next year.''
 But Mr. Greenspan could be forced to move faster. The biggest uncertainties now are the future of oil prices, which have eased since shooting to $55 a barrel this fall, and the declining value of the dollar in response to the United States' soaring trade and financial deficits.
 The dollar declined sharply against the euro and other major currencies after President Bush's re-election last month. Most analysts say the dollar needs to fall further, which would make American exports less expensive and make foreign imports more expensive.
 But a steep plunge in the dollar could force Mr. Greenspan's hand for two reasons. The first is that a steep drop would increase inflation, because imported goods would become more expensive and American companies would have less competitive pressure to keep prices low.
 The second reason is that foreign investors could start demanding higher interest rates on Treasury bonds and other securities to offset the potential of a plunge in the value of American assets.
 Thus far, that has not happened. Even though the United States' current account deficit has ballooned this year to a record of about $620 billion, long-term interest rates are lower today than when the Fed began raising short-term rates on June 30.
 Another determinant of Fed policy will be the trends in the growth of productivity and wages. Unit labor costs have been climbing this year, as companies have added more workers, and they could increase further if wages start to climb more rapidly. 
 In a paper published this week by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a team of economists that included Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University predicted that productivity would continue to climb at a relatively strong pace of 2.6 percent a year. 
 But if productivity slips, inflationary pressures will pick up and the Fed will be under additional pressure to raise rates.

HEADLINE: Math and Science Tests Find 4th and 8th Graders in U.S. Still Lag Many Peers

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
Eighth-grade students in the United States scored better in both mathematics and science last year than in 1999, but still lagged their peers in a number of other industrial countries, according to a survey of student performance released yesterday. 
 Fourth graders, who also ranked behind their peers in other developed countries, showed a modest decline in science and no gain in math compared with 1995, the last time they were surveyed. 
 Secretary of Education Rod Paige, who called the tests a good indicator of school performance, said the eighth-grade results demonstrated ''that a greater emphasis on higher standards in the classroom leads to improved performance and a smaller achievement gap.''
 But he added, ''The results also show that we have further to go, particularly in earlier grades.'' 
 The survey, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, or Timss, found that Singapore students topped the math and science scoring in both the fourth and eighth grades last year.
 Of the 45 countries ranked in the eighth-grade survey, the United States was 15th in math and 9th in science; among 25 countries in the fourth-grade rankings, it was 12th in math and 6th in science.
 American students fared better in the new survey than in another international education report, released last week by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In that survey, the Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, American 15-year-olds fell below the international average in mathematics literacy and problem-solving. That study included only industrialized countries; the study released yesterday included developing nations, too.
 Patrick Gonzales, a research analyst at the National Center for Education Statistics, an Education Department agency, said that the tests that were the basis of the new study were aimed at measuring classroom learning, and that they showed some American students learning more math and science. 
 ''But PISA said our students are not doing as well as our international peers in applying that knowledge, which is the logical next step,'' he said. 
 The Timss report was released by the International Study Center at Boston College, and an analysis of the American performance by the National Center for Education Statistics. Mr. Gonzales said the study included performance by about 9,000 American eighth graders in 230 schools and 10,000 fourth graders in 250 schools. The schools were chosen in a way that provided a representative sample. 
 Cathy Seeley, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, said that the improvement in eighth-grade math scores showed that ''we are indeed making progress,'' but that there was still a huge discrepancy in the allocation of resources within the country and a ''tremendous achievement gap'' among different groups of students. 
 The National Center for Education Statistics said black fourth graders showed a 15-point gain on the math test from 1995 to 2003, while white students' scores climbed only one point and scores for Hispanic students fell one point. But while the gap narrowed a bit, the average score for black students (472) remained sharply below those of white students (542) and Hispanic students (492). Possible test scores ranged from 0 to 1,000. 
 The center also said scores varied significantly by income. Fourth-grade pupils in schools where at least three-quarters were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches had an average math score of 471, compared with 567 among pupils in schools where no more than 10 percent were eligible for subsidized lunches.
 Some analysts were also struck by the extent of the disparity between the American scores and those of higher-scoring performers like Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan.
 ''The United States has moved up a little, but there is still a huge gap between what our students can do and what students do in the high-performing Asian countries,'' said Ina V.S. Mullis, co-director of the Boston College center.
 ''Singapore has 44 percent of their students at the advanced level,'' Dr. Mullis said, ''while the United States has 7 percent.''
 Monty Neill, executive director of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, which is a frequent critic of standardized tests, dismissed what he called a deluge of confusing and often contradictory test data from an ''alphabet soup of exams.'' He said that ''a more rational response would be to rethink the nation's overreliance on standardized exams.'' 
 ''If scores remain stagnant after a decade of test-based 'reform,''' he said, ''why should anyone expect that an even more intense focus on these narrow tools would lead to real educational improvement?''
 But at the Education Department, Mr. Gonzales said a critical question was how some countries had made such sizable gains while American scores lost ground or remained virtually flat. In fourth-grade science, for example, the United States fell a statistically insignificant 6 points from 1995 to 2003, while Singapore climbed 42 points.
 ''Everyone is trying to move forward,'' he said. ''But that raises a question no one has an answer for: Why is it that some countries have made much greater gains than others?''

HEADLINE: U.N. Criticizes Iraq Occupation Oil Sales

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
An audit board set up by the Security Council to monitor oil sales in Iraq reported Tuesday that during the 15 months that the United States-led occupation authority ran the country there was widespread mismanagement, including financial irregularities, a failure to curb smuggling and overdependence on no-bid contracts.
 The watchdog panel, the International Advisory and Monitoring Board of the Development Fund for Iraq, cited three main concerns over oil sales under the Coalition Provisional Authority: the absence of metering to keep track of how much oil was being pumped from Iraqi fields, noncompetitive bidding procedures for many contracts, and barter transactions with countries in the immediate region. The problem with the metering continues. 
 Among the noncompetitive, or sole-source, contracts paid for with Iraqi oil money, the only ones specifically identified were those awarded to a subsidiary of the Halliburton Company, the Houston-based military and oil services conglomerate, which Dick Cheney headed before becoming vice president. The company's operations in Iraq, involving contracts worth more than $10 billion through its subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root, have been dogged by charges of preferential treatment, overbilling, cost overruns and waste. 
 Headed by the American diplomat L. Paul Bremer III, the provisional authority was the administrator of Iraq from the invasion in March 2003 until its dissolution as the occupation authority on June 28, 2004, with the formal return of sovereignty to Iraq.
 The watchdog panel was created by the Security Council in October 2003 and includes officials from the United Nations, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It was intended as an independent oversight body for the Iraqi Development Fund, the body authorized by the Security Council to receive Iraqi oil revenues, assets of the previous government that had been frozen abroad and remaining monies from the oil-for-food program. That program is under a separate series of investigations by the United Nations and five Congressional committees trying to uncover the corrupt practices and officials that resulted in billions of dollars being diverted to Saddam Hussein.
 Before relinquishing authority to the current Iraqi interim government, the occupation authority spent $20 billion from the development fund, $11.1 billion of which was estimated to have come from oil sales. The board said the Defense Department had failed to produce requested documents on time, delaying its audits of the sole-source contracts.
 It finally received documents, censored ''to safeguard proprietary information of the concerned parties,'' for five orders totaling $812 million, which it said highlighted many shortcomings, among them inadequate technical evaluations and overstated costs.
 In an indication of its continuing questions about the sole-source work by Halliburton and others, the board said it had reached agreement with Washington this month to let the federal government conduct a special audit of the contracts, to be completed in early 2005.
 The auditors said an unknown quantity of petroleum and petroleum products was smuggled out of Iraq, particularly in the chaotic aftermath of the invasion, when authorized processes of marketing, sales and cash collection were easily bypassed.
 The audit reported that the absence of proper metering had prevented auditors from making full and reliable judgments about the amount of sales. Necessary work on the metering system, although promised and budgeted, has not yet occurred, the board said, because of continuing security and technical problems. The board said getting a system in place was vital to protecting Iraq's oil, which is the country's principal source of income.
 The bartering in the region involved trading residual fuel and crude oil for electricity and other products, ''making it difficult to determine whether fair value has been received for Iraq's oil revenues,'' the report said.
 The board said the outside auditor it hired, KPMG, an international accounting cooperative based in Switzerland, encountered problems gaining access to needed records at a number of Iraqi ministries.

HEADLINE: An Effort at a Union Comes Up a Loser at the Track

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF

DATELINE: ARCADIA, Calif., Dec. 13 

 BODY:
In the rough-and-tumble world of horse racing, Diego Sotelo is known as a brawler. He is a bantam of a man with a dark complexion and white teeth and a jaw permanently cocked prizefighter-style. He abstains from alcohol, appreciates women from the neck down and despises the horses he rides for a living as much as the rich men who own them.
 For all his acumen with the fist and the whip, however, Mr. Sotelo, 40, picked a fight with the owners and trainers and lost. Now he is out of a job as an exercise rider and banned from the Santa Anita stables, which were home to the famed Seabiscuit.
 Known as the Fox, Mr. Sotelo assumed the role of labor agitator in an industry historically unwelcoming to unions. At Santa Anita Park, about 15 miles east of Los Angeles, he threatened a strike by the stable hands -- the grooms, hot walkers and exercise riders, known as backstretch workers and hired by the trainers -- just before the racing season resumes the morning after Christmas. 
 Backstretch workers in California have lived in such squalor that the state, embarrassed by newspaper reports, passed a battery of laws three years ago guaranteeing minimum pay and living standards in an industry to which they did not apply.
 Mr. Sotelo says little has changed.
 ''When you get to this country, you are happy and it takes a couple of years to realize you're working for peanuts,'' said Mr. Sotelo, who began his career at age 10 on the Mexican quarter-mile tracks. ''You risk your life, get broken down and then get thrown away like a used diaper.''
 He and a coterie of riders complain that they have not received a raise in 15 years and are paid $10 for galloping a horse through its morning workout, an exceedingly dangerous occupation. When Santa Anita opened in 1934 in the depths of the Great Depression, apprentice jockeys earned 50 cents for galloping each horse. Adjusted for inflation, that is about $7 today.
 ''That means we got four stinking pennies a year,'' said Mr. Sotelo, a renowned exercise rider who was working about eight horses a day at his peak.
 Mr. Sotelo attempted to organize backstretch employees, in accordance with the new laws, and it seemed a likely proposition, according to those who attended the meetings. But when it came time for a vote last month, security guards broke up the meeting after trainers complained to track officials.
 Cowed, most riders went back to work; a few were fired, a few others got the $15 a horse they had been asking for. Mr. Sotelo, the leader, was banned from the track. He has not mounted a horse since early November and vows never to get back on one, as a matter of honor, until someone pays him $15.
 ''The others are cowards,'' he said recently over a cup of coffee. ''You try to show them something, how to improve themselves. But you cannot change a mouse into a lion.''
 In the stables where the horses are kept, there is a village sometimes called Tortilla Flats. Perhaps 1,000 people live and work there, not only riders but also grooms who feed and clean and rub liniment into the beasts and walkers who cool them after they run. They usually receive no more than minimum wage, work seven days a week, get no overtime and are kept off the books, industry insiders and labor officials say. Most are immigrants who do not complain, for fear of being blackballed or threatened with deportation.
 They live in drafty 12-foot-square rooms attached to the barns, with no running water, a light bulb, a socket and a concrete floor. The communal bathrooms are without shower curtains, infected with flies and strewn with soiled toilet paper.
 The roads are dirt. The characters are hard-bitten men, infirm from alcohol, and tough-looking women who speak little.
 Historically, the backstretch workers in California were exempted from state labor laws until the California Legislature enacted the new regulations three years ago. Those regulations gave backstretch employees the right to unionize, outlined minimum housing standards and required trainers to keep accurate payroll records of their employees.
 The California Horse Racing Board was charged with oversight, but the board is composed of prominent thoroughbred owners, including its chairman, John Harris, a cattle rancher and horse breeder.
 State labor officials say the laws are not enforced. ''They're cheating,'' Dean Fryer, a spokesman for the California Department of Industrial Relations, the state labor department, said of the trainers. None of the state's seven thoroughbred tracks and nine racing fairs have been inspected in more than two years, he said, because when inspectors arrive, they are given the stall.
 ''Every time we've arrived, the staff at the track announces we're there and the stables empty out,'' Mr. Fryer said. ''At this point, it's a waste of resources to go to a place where there are no employees to talk to, and employers who say they have no employees. We're trying to work with the racing board to change that, but it's a slow process.''
 Officials of the racing board say that while they do everything they can to help labor investigators get access to workers and smooth the process for employees who choose to unionize, labor officials must enforce labor laws. ''We try to make sure they've got everything they need,'' said Mike Marten, a spokesman for the board. ''Ultimately, we have no authority in labor matters.''
 Last year, $4.3 billion was wagered on California racing, with 20 percent of that going to track operators, horsemen and the state. When the labor laws for backstretch employees went into effect, the state also made it legal to accept wagering on horse races over the Internet and by telephone. Last year, those additional forms of revenue came to $313 million. Still, the riders and grooms as a rule saw no raise.
 Trainers, who are paid by the horse owners, say their margin is as thin as dental floss.
 ''The economics of racing in California just don't work,'' said Ed Halpern, executive director of the California Thoroughbred Trainers, citing rising prices and competition from Indian casinos. ''It's not great for anybody. Not for the trainers, the grooms, the hot walkers or exercise riders. We can't pay riders an extra five dollars per horse. Most of them realized that, went back to work and forgot about a strike.''
 Mr. Halpern also pointed out that backstretch workers at Santa Anita get free medical and dental care from an on-site health clinic, as well as a small pension and free housing in the stables, which were recently renovated.
 Most people in Tortilla Flats do not complain about conditions. ''It's a lot better than where most of us came from,'' said Adolfo, a groom. ''Not too many jobs give you a free place to live. This place is almost a palace when you look at it that way.''
 Mr. Sotelo understands the attitude. Like Adolfo, he came from a poor corner of southern Mexico, where he learned the rough art of the equestrian. In the Mexican quarter-tracks, in lieu of saddles, jockeys have their legs strapped to a horse with a belt and disputes are settled with fists and razor blades.
 When he came to the United States in 1986, Mr. Sotelo waxed supermarket floors before finding his way to Santa Anita. He lived in Tortilla Flats until a jealous husband with a loaded gun invited him to leave. The Fox accepted the invitation.
 He has worked 18 years balancing on stirrups three-quarters of an inch thick, on thousand-pound animals running 40 miles an hour, covering 28 feet per stride. He has fallen too many times to count, suffered broken bones, been kicked, smothered and knocked unconscious. 
 ''A person does not grow old in this business,'' said a fellow rider, Mike Bull, 41. ''You can't make a living. But you do it because you love the life.''
 And even the Fox is drawn like a fly to a snout, sitting in the grandstand in the early morning darkness, drinking weak coffee, watching the riders go through their paces, his pride thicker than blood.

HEADLINE: Major Markets Move Higher Despite Some Bad News

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks moved higher yesterday as the Federal Reserve announced a widely expected move to increase interest rates and investors welcomed the prospect of a merger in the software industry.
 Using language nearly identical to the statement it issued on Nov. 10, the Fed's Open Market Committee raised the nation's benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, to 2.25 percent. Stocks moved solidly into positive territory on the news, as buyers who had stuck to the sidelines ahead of the announcement returned to the market. 
 Wall Street had been disappointed earlier in the day by the latest reading on the nation's trade deficit, which surged to a record $55.5 billion in October. Continued demand for Chinese imports and the high cost of oil contributed to the growing deficit, which was much larger than the $52.4 billion Wall Street had expected. But while the numbers looked bad from a monetary perspective, they showed continued consumer spending, which some took as a bullish sign.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 38.13 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,676.45. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 4.70 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,203.38, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 11.34 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,159.84.
 Adding to the market's upbeat mood, oil prices appeared to be holding steady in the $41 range. Light crude for January delivery settled up 81 cents, or 2 percent, at $41.82 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, nearly $14 cheaper than the record settlement price of $55.17 set in October.
 Buoying technology stocks was a report that Symantec was in talks to acquire Veritas Software for $14 billion. A deal could be announced later this week. Symantec tumbled $5.41, or 16 percent, to $27.45; Veritas surged $2.19, or 8.7 percent, to $27.38.
 Verizon Communications shed 24 cents, to $41.04, on reports that the company's wireless arm would offer $36 billion for Nextel Communications, topping Sprint's $35 billion offer. Nextel was unchanged at $29.99, while Sprint climbed 66 cents, to $25.10.
 American Express gained 91 cents, to $55.95, after landing a major credit card distribution pact with Citigroup, part of the company's effort to market its cards jointly with a variety of financial institutions. Citigroup was up 10 cents, at $46.87.
 Merck added 57 cents, to $29.62, after filing a statement with regulators that outlined plans to cut an additional 700 jobs before the end of the year, adding to the 4,400 job cuts already planned.
 General Electric declined 10 cents, to $37.38, after reiterating its expectations for double-digit earnings growth in both the current quarter and the 2005 fiscal year, in line with Wall Street expectations.
 The home accessories retailer Pier 1 Imports soared $1.24, or 6.9 percent, to $19.10, after reporting it had earned 22 cents a share in the latest quarter, matching Wall Street expectations. The company's outlook for future profits was also in line with analysts' estimates.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note rose 7/32, to a price of 1011/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.12 percent from 4.15 percent on Monday.
 Following are results of the auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Statement on Rate Increase

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter point:
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 2.25 percent.
 The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the earlier rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.
 The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.
 In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, to 3.25 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.
 In addition, the committee unanimously decided to expedite the release of its minutes. Beginning with this meeting, the minutes of regularly scheduled meetings will be released three weeks after the date of the policy decision. The first set of expedited minutes will be released at 2 p.m. E.S.T. on Jan. 4, 2005.

HEADLINE: October Trade Gap a Record, Up 9% in Month

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
The trade deficit hit another record high in October, with imports outpacing exports by $55.46 billion.
 The 9 percent increase from September was higher than expected, and economists immediately blamed the twin pressures of rising imports and high oil prices.
 Even the weakening dollar failed to stop the widening trade gap. Economists had hoped that a falling dollar would strengthen exports and at least stabilize the trade deficit. 
 The Bush administration said on Tuesday that oil prices were a big factor in the poor numbers as well as stagnant foreign demand for American exports.
 As proof of the impact of high oil prices, the United States set a record $7.2 billion trade deficit with the countries of OPEC in October.
 Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said the American economy was ''growing faster than most around the world, and that can increase the trade deficit.''
 The administration has said that the best way to handle the trade deficits is to encourage other countries to open their markets further. At the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Chile last month, Mr. Bush reaffirmed that his government ''is dedicated to dealing with our deficits, both short term and long term.''
 The roots of the trade deficit are in the current global imbalance. American consumers are buying exports from Europe and Asia, feeding those economies, while European and Asian banks are underwriting American debt.
 The 9 percent increase from the $50.9 billion trade deficit in September led economists to question how long the United States can sustain such results and attract foreign investors to underwrite it. The annual current account deficit, which represents the difference between foreign trade and investment in the United States and American trade and investment abroad, is a record annual rate of $665 billion, or 5.7 percent of gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2004.
 Economists and trade experts say that the United States deserves a share of the blame, too.
 ''In large part, today's U.S. trade deficits are made in Washington,'' Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a research report. ''Lacking in private saving, outsize U.S. budget deficits are leading to ever-widening current account and trade deficits.''
 Higher oil prices were behind half of the $4.6 billion increase in this month's trade deficit. 
 Ashraf Laidi, the chief currency analyst at the M.G. Financial Group in New York, said that ''soaring oil imports reared their ugly head, affirming our long-established view that the trade deficit cannot be stabilized by a falling dollar alone, especially when rising oil prices are exacerbating imports.''
 Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., wrote in a report on Tuesday that even with a drop in oil prices ''the deficit will remain large indefinitely.''
 The rest of the increase was a result of a sharp jump in imported goods other than oil.
 Despite an increase in bilateral trade agreements, the United States has failed to increase its exports at anywhere near the increase in its imports. The trade deficit will continue to climb if the trend continues and imports continue to outstrip exports.
 The nation is running a trade deficit with its major trading partners, including Canada, China, the European Union and Japan.
 Once again, the deficit with China -- at $16.8 billion in October -- set a record. Some trade experts predict that the ballooning deficit could lead to more demands for ways to limit Chinese exports or to a re-examination of the trade relationship.
 Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee, said that the administration was partly to blame for the imbalance with China since it has failed to enforce the terms of China's admission to the World Trade Organization three years ago.
 ''The U.S. trade deficit with China is on pace to exceed an astounding record of $160 billion this year, almost double the level from just three years ago,'' Mr. Levin said.
 Some trade experts question whether new trade agreements are the solution to the growing deficit. Greg Elias, a trade lawyer and former senior Congressional aide, said that the trade deficits were a result of trade agreements that are really investment agreements.
 ''Our trade agreements are about investing in foreign countries and sending back the products unimpeded to the United States,'' Mr. Elias said.

HEADLINE: Water Contract Renewals Stir Debate Between Environmentalists and Farmers in California

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
The time has come for thousands of farmers in California to renew their water contracts with the federally run Central Valley Project, the country's largest irrigation system and for many years a major source of friction between the state's powerful agricultural and environmental interests.
 The farms served by the Central Valley Project cover nearly 4,700 square miles and get about 20 percent of California's water supply. That has made the new contracts, some for 25 years and some for 40 years with options to renew, the center of a debate over how much water in the state should be dedicated to growing crops and at what price.
 When construction of the Central Water Project began in 1937, the idea was to protect the state's farmland from water shortages and floods and provide cheap water for family farmers. But as the state has grown in population, there has been a growing push by cities and environmentalists to break the farmers' grip on the water, or at least make them pay more for it. 
 A report to be released on Wednesday by the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that has tracked federal subsidies in agriculture, estimates that the subsidies in the Central Valley Project are worth up to $416 million a year at market rates for replacing the water. The calculation, based on data collected by the group over 16 months, shows that the median subsidy for a Central Valley farmer in 2002 was $7,076 a year and for the largest 10 percent of the farms, the average subsidy was worth up to $349,000 a year. 
 Five years ago, the United States Bureau of Reclamation, which runs the Central Valley Project, began negotiations on 223 water-supply contracts with individual farmers and big irrigation districts, serving farmers from Redding to Bakersfield. Those negotiations are expected to be wrapped up early next year, and many critics of the bureau, including the Environmental Working Group, are not happy that they will apparently continue supplies of federally subsidized water for farms.
 ''Reforms to make details of water subsidies public, limit the amount and value of water subsidies to large farms and encourage conservation by pricing water at rates closer to market value are needed to end the disaster for taxpayers and the environment wrought by the Central Valley Project,'' the Environmental Working Group report states.
 Many farmers reject that analysis, including the president of Woolf Enterprises, a family-owned farming business based in Huron, near Fresno, which was identified by the group as the recipient of $4.2 million in subsidies. Woolf Enterprises grows almonds, cotton, tomatoes and other crops on about 20,000 acres in the area served by Central Valley Project. 
 The president, Stuart Woolf, said the land was a collection of farms owned by members of his family, each 960 acres, the maximum allowed under federal rules. Mr. Woolf said the family business had survived by adding more acreage and by introducing savings through economies of scale -- including large savings on its water use.
 Though he had not seen the Environmental Working Group's full calculations, he scoffed at the suggestion that his farm had received such a huge benefit, saying, ''The numbers just don't add up.''
 ''They would indicate the purpose of the Central Valley Project is to have small family farms,'' Mr. Woolf said. ''I would contend the small family farm won't be able to survive in today's ag environment. A small family farm can't make the investments that are needed.''
 Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who has long been at odds with the state's agricultural interests over water, has accused the Bureau of Reclamation of ''rushing to put these contracts in place'' at a time when the reliability of the state's water supplies is in question. Mr. Miller said the contracts would amount to a huge windfall for some farmers, who under a law he helped write in the early 1990's would be entitled to sell the water to urban water districts at marked-up prices.
 ''What these guys are doing is freezing in time the massive subsidies that go to the largest and wealthiest farmers in the state, and who are then going to sell it back to the taxpayers,'' he said in a phone interview from Washington. ''It is a great gig if you can get it.''
 Officials with the Department of Interior, which oversees the reclamation bureau, defend the new contracts as keeping with the bureau's mission since 1902 of encouraging agricultural development in the West. Though the costs of water supplies will remain below market value, the new rates will be high enough, the officials say, to recover the costs of building the Central Valley Project by 2030. Diversions for environmental purposes will continue.
 ''This is a big and important effort by the bureau to have contracts in place and ensure orderly operations for the project,'' said Jason Peltier, a deputy assistant secretary for water and science. As for the bureau's critics, Mr. Peltier said, ''I suppose we will have to agree to disagree.''

HEADLINE: No Bang for Our Cheap Buck

 BODY:
The Bush administration's de facto weak-dollar policy -- its preferred ''cure'' for the American trade deficit -- is not working. Yesterday's trade deficit report shows that imports outpaced exports by a record $55.5 billion in October. The huge imbalance was worse than the gloomiest expectations. 
 So far, the administration has been hoping that the weaker dollar will raise the price of imports, leading American consumers to buy less from abroad, and will at the same time make our exports cheaper so foreigners will buy more American goods. That's supposed to shrink the trade deficit and, with it, America's need to attract nearly $2 billion each day from abroad to balance its books. 
 But the dollar has been declining since February 2002 -- it's down by 55 percent against the euro and 22 percent against the yen -- and the trade deficit has stubbornly refused to shrink along with it. The falling dollar has done nothing to diminish America's appetite for foreign goods -- such imports continue to rise at a faster rate than exports. According to yesterday's report, imports were some 50 percent greater than exports in October. Much of October's import growth was caused by high oil prices, which have since subsided. But that's no reason to shrug off the disturbing evidence of the weak dollar's failure to fix the trade gap. The United States is now on track for a trade deficit of more than $60 billion next June. 
 As the American economy heads for higher global imbalances, the need to borrow from abroad grows. And the more we borrow, the weaker the dollar becomes. That's because the markets that set the value of freely traded currencies, like the dollar and the euro, punish indebted nations by pushing down their currencies. The United States, by any measure -- trade, the federal budget, personal consumption -- is by far the world's biggest debtor. The need to borrow in the face of an already weak dollar portends higher prices and higher interest rates.
 How high and how fast? Who knows? But one thing is sure: that American tourists need to pay $5 for a demitasse in Paris will be the least of our worries if mortgage rates spike, the stock market falls, and businesses curb their already modest hiring. 
 A cheaper dollar would not be as threatening if it was part of a comprehensive strategy to close the trade deficit. For instance, the United States must demonstrate to our trading partners and the currency markets that it intends to reduce the federal budget deficit -- thereby lessening its need to borrow from abroad and reducing downward pressure on the dollar. Unless and until it does so, the United States will lack the credibility and the authority to press for changes that need to occur in other countries to balance out global trade. There are alternatives to a single-minded pursuit of a weak dollar fix. What is lacking is the leadership to pursue them.

HEADLINE: Loans to Soldiers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Seeking Quick Loans, Soldiers Race Into High-Interest Traps'' (front page, Dec. 7):
 One wonders what moral values are behind the Bush administration's treatment of the young men and women fighting the president's war. 
 Our soldiers have to fight without body and vehicle armor. Now we learn that payday loan companies are preying on young military families with impunity here at home. 
 That payday lenders are allowed to charge triple-digit interest rates to struggling young military families is a measure of this administration's contempt for anyone beneath the top 1 percent tax bracket. 
 You report that some interest rates are as high as 650 percent when annualized. Street fighting in Baghdad is stressful enough without having to worry about your home being foreclosed back home. 
 Allowing these practices to propagate unregulated may have something to do with certain corporate values, which this administration demonstrably knows something about. 
 Allowing and enabling these practices has nothing to do with moral values.

HEADLINE: Developers Will Put Reader's Digest Campus to New Use

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
Summit Development and Greenfield Partners, two development companies in South Norwalk, Conn., that reached an agreement late in November to acquire the Reader's Digest headquarters in Westchester County, N.Y., will face two challenging tasks when they take title late this month. 
 The first, and most immediate, will be to sign up tenants for 450,000 square feet of vacant office space -- no longer being used by the Reader's Digest Association, the publication's parent and a global publisher and direct marketer of magazines, books, music and videos.
 The company has downsized in recent years and now has only 800 employees in Westchester, compared with 1,800 a decade ago. To fill the space, the new owners will try to tap into the real estate market for corporate tenants seeking a self-contained suburban campus with 24-hour security, said Felix T. Charney, managing director of Summit Development. 
 The second major task for the developers will be to shepherd a proposal for senior housing through the local approval process. The property, 114 acres in total, is zoned for corporate use, and approvals may be needed before it is used otherwise. This is the partners' first joint venture in Westchester, but they have others in Connecticut, including a $60 million urban renewal project in South Norwalk. 
 The Reader's Digest Association agreed last month to sell the land and buildings for $49 million due on closing and a further $10 million in two years. The company signed a 20-year lease for 250,000 square feet in its main headquarters building. The agreement is renewable.
 Had it not been able to negotiate the lease, a spokesman, William Adler, said, Reader's Digest may have left Westchester altogether. The digest's founders, DeWitt and Lila Wallace, moved its operations in 1939 to Chappaqua, a hamlet within the Town of New Castle, although the company has long used nearby Pleasantville as its mailing address. 
 The team of Summit Development and Greenfield Partners was one of many bidders on the property, said Mitchell Consker, executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services company that handled the sale. ''It was a hotly contested property with a huge array of potential suitors,'' he said, adding that the field had been narrowed to 30 interested parties, and then to 4, from 400.
 Cushman & Wakefield will market the available office space -- in blocks of 20,000 square feet or larger -- to financial institutions and other corporations seeking geographical diversification. 
 ''For security and other reasons, these will be companies that don't want all of their operations in one place,'' Mr. Consker said. The new owners of the Reader's Digest campus will be in competition for tenants with Robert P. Weisz, a developer who is converting the interior of the 523,000-square-foot former Altria headquarters in Rye to upscale offices. 
 Mr. Charney would not disclose details about the number or price of senior housing units planned or how much of the site might be used for housing. He said housing for older adults was deemed more acceptable than single-family homes for a suburban community that wanted to ''retain its population and tax base without straining the schools.'' Most of the land is now rolling hills, with some woods.
 He also noted that the real estate market for people over 55 or 60 is strong in Westchester. In White Plains, for example, the Noyak Equity Group, a partnership based in Manhattan, acquired the defunct St. Agnes Hospital yesterday in an auction for $21.4 million and said it would develop some form of senior housing on the 23-acre property.
 While the Summit-Greenfield partnership looks for corporate tenants and zoning approval, Reader's Digest will spend about a year consolidating its workers in the area it is leasing, Mr. Adler, the spokesman, said.
 The employees will all be in the campus's original building, with its rotunda styled after those in Williamsburg, Va. Some of them have been working in wings that were added onto the original building over the years. 
 The remaining pieces in the extensive art collection of Reader's Digest -- some Monets and Renoirs were sold in recent years -- will continue to hang in the space the magazine occupies.
 In addition to the original building, it will be able to use a 400-seat auditorium on the campus and will have exclusive use of a 19th-century four-bedroom guest house furnished with antiques.
 The Wallaces first published Reader's Digest in 1922 from their Greenwich Village apartment, and it remained privately held until 1990, when the Reader's Digest Association went public. The company, whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has been unprofitable in recent quarters.
 In its latest quarter, ended Sept. 30, it reported a loss of $13 million, much wider than the $5 million loss in the quarter a year earlier. For the fiscal year ended June 30, the company lost $13.1 million on revenue of $2.47 billion.
 Thomas O. Ryder, the Reader's Digest Association chairman and chief executive, said that after consulting with real estate advisers, ''we came to the conclusion that the best outcome would be to sell the property and convert the asset to cash.'' Because Reader's Digest will no longer have to pay cleaning, heating and other upkeep costs for the campus, it expects to save $10 million a year.
 Elsewhere in the United States, the company employs 2,000 people, and it has 2,000 others overseas.

HEADLINE: G.E. Expects Profit Rise of Up to 17% Next Year

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The General Electric Company said yesterday that it expected profit to rise as much as 17 percent next year as its revamped portfolio of faster-growing businesses drives sales. 
 Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, said in a presentation to investors in New York that the company expected double-digit growth in 10 of its 11 main business units next year. ''We really think we have today a stronger and faster-growing G.E.,'' he said. 
 For Mr. Immelt, who took over G.E. from John F. Welch Jr. in 2001 only to see earnings growth erode as the economy plunged into recession, the projections follow a three-year turnaround effort during which he placed his stamp on the company. 
 Over the last few years, G.E. has expanded its presence in developing countries like China while spending more than $65 billion to make major acquisitions in areas like consumer finance, entertainment, security, health care and water treatment. At the same time it has shed slower-growing businesses and underperforming units, like insurance. 
 ''This is the beginning of a very great story for Jeffrey,'' said Richard D. Steinberg, the president of Steinberg Global Asset Management in Boca Raton, Fla., which owns about $7 million in G.E. stock. ''He walked into the biggest shoes that could exist and had to put his imprint on it.'' 
 Mr. Immelt said that increased operating cash flow totaling more than $63 billion over the next three years would allow the company to invest in its businesses and make acquisitions while returning ''significant value'' to shareholders.
 Last week, G.E. raised its quarterly dividend 10 percent and said it would repurchase $15 billion of common stock in the next three years. Its shares fell 10 cents, to $37.38, yesterday.
 Mr. Immelt said G.E. would take the disciplined approach it had used to increase profits and apply it to achieve sales growth of 8 percent each year. ''I start with a much better portfolio than Jack had or that the company had in decades,'' he said. ''I have a great or better set of businesses from which we can grow organically.''

HEADLINE: War Figures Honored With Medal of Freedom

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
President Bush on Tuesday bestowed the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, on three of the central architects and executors of the war in Iraq, one of the president's strongest efforts yet at putting a formal stamp of success on a war whose outcome is still a question.
 The recipients were Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the overall commander of the invasion of Iraq; L. Paul Bremer III, the chief civilian administrator of the American occupation of the country; and George J. Tenet, the longtime director of central intelligence who built the case for going to war.
 ''Today this honor goes to three men who have played pivotal roles in great events,'' Mr. Bush said, surrounded by members of his administration in a ceremony in the East Room of the White House, ''and whose efforts have made our country more secure and advanced the cause of human liberty.'' 
 It was a remarkable moment in a city still gripped by uncertainty about whether Iraq will become the democracy Mr. Bush speaks of almost weekly or descend further into chaos and American casualties. Mr. Bush has never looked back, at least publicly, saying in an interview last summer that his only ''miscalculation'' about the rise of the insurgency grew from the ''catastrophic success'' of the military invasion.
 In his public remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Bush carefully sidestepped the questions and second-guessing that have followed his Iraq policy and discussed in his own Situation Room over the past two years. Each of the medal recipients made crucial decisions in events that were driven by murky intelligence, a sharp internal debate over how large a force was needed to fight the war and the unanticipated rise of an insurgency that war planners had expected would be wiped out long ago.
 ''I don't think history will be as kind to these gentlemen as the president was today,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and a former officer in the Army's 82nd Airborne Division. Mr. Bush, he said, is ''still trying to put a good face on serious mistakes. This is the continuing motif: Everything is working, and we should reward ourselves for that.''
 Mr. Bush would hardly be the first president to use the medal to reward the architects of military action -- both when events have gone badly and when they have gone well. In the last 24 hours of his presidency in January 1969, Lyndon Johnson gave out 20 medals, including to McGeorge Bundy and Walt W. Rostow. History is still revisiting decisions they made in Vietnam.
 At the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, a clear success -- though it left Saddam Hussein in power -- Mr. Bush's father gave medals to his entire war council: Gen. Colin L. Powell, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, and the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. Mr. Bush was more restrained on Tuesday, leaving Mr. Powell (who received a second medal of freedom a few years after his first), Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, and the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, off the list.
 Mr. Bush's press secretary, Scott McClellan, deflected questions about how Mr. Bush arrived at his choices, saying, ''I would let his remarks speak for themselves.'' 
 Mr. Tenet's assessments of Iraq's unconventional weapons, and the huge gaps that became evident in America's intelligence system, became the focus of investigations into how Mr. Bush and his administration built a case for war. Mr. Bush made no mention of that or of the shake-up at the C.I.A. after Mr. Tenet's departure, but he praised him as ''one of the first to recognize and address the growing threat to America from radical terrorist networks.''
 Mr. Bremer's efforts to rebuild Iraq began with great promise, and he was compared to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who ran the occupation of Japan two generations ago. But in Mr. Bremer's case, the security situation declined precipitously in the second half of his tenure -- a result, Mr. Bremer said recently in remarks that he did not intend to become public, of the Pentagon's failure to provide enough troops to secure the nation.
 Inside the White House, there is still significant debate about Mr. Bremer's judgments, including his decisions to disband the defeated Iraqi army and to pursue an aggressive policy of ''de-Baathification,'' the broad exclusion of former Baath Party members from the newly reconstituted interim government. Those moves are widely regarded as fundamental mistakes that departed from the White House's occupation plan and alienated hundreds of thousands of armed and unemployed troops, some of whom joined the insurgency. 
 On Tuesday though, Mr. Bush reached back to Mr. Bremer's ''life of service'' as a diplomat and his early expertise in counterterrorism. ''For 14 months,'' Mr. Bush said of Iraq, ''Jerry Bremer worked day and night, in difficult, dangerous conditions, to stabilize the country, to help its people rebuild, and to establish a political process that would lead to justice and liberty.''
 Mr. Bush reserved some of his warmest praise for General Franks, a native of Midland, Tex., who argued behind the scenes with his boss, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, that the invasion of Iraq would require more troops. That is now the accepted wisdom, including in the Pentagon, though General Franks has often been criticized for failing to plan for the occupation as well as he planned for the invasion.
 Mr. Bush praised General Franks for the swift toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and said that in Iraq ''a force half the size of the force that won the gulf war defeated Saddam Hussein's regime and reached Baghdad in less than a month -- the fastest, longest armored advance in the history of American warfare.''
 But he could not resist a jab at a fellow Texan; Mr. Franks went to high school in Midland with Laura Bush. The president repeated a story that General Franks tells about himself, concerning a high school reunion the general attended in Midland, where Mr. Bush was also raised.
 ''Tommy's old principal told the general, 'You weren't the brightest bulb in the socket,''' the president said. The general, Mr. Bush said, replied, ''Ain't this a great country?''

HEADLINE: Little Outcry As M.T.A. Prepares To Raise Fares

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and ANDY NEWMAN; Johanna Jainchill contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The last two times the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted to raise fares, in 1995 and 2003, it faced denunciations from angry commuters and lawsuits from riders' groups.
 But as the board prepares to vote tomorrow on another increase in fares for subways, buses and commuter railroads, it faces only scattered resistance and subdued emotions. The fare increases are widely expected to pass.
 ''Most people feel the same way I do -- that there's nothing to be done,'' said Edwin Evans, 34, a video store worker who lives in Harlem. ''No one is talking about it, but it's affecting us all.'' 
 There are several possible explanations for the muted reaction. On the subways and local buses, the proposed increase applies only to unlimited-ride MetroCards, making its effect harder for riders to measure than last year's increase, which raised the base fare to $2 from $1.50.
 There is still some fatigue among riders' advocates from the fare struggle last year. And with the authority facing a well-publicized multibillion-dollar deficit, few people seem to think there is an alternative.
 The increases, to be phased in beginning in January, are projected to raise $234 million next year. Under the proposal, the price of a 7-day MetroCard would rise to $24 from $21, and that of a 30-day card to $76 from $70. Fares on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad would rise about 5 percent and express bus fares would go to $5 from $4. Most bridge and tunnel tolls would increase by 25 or 50 cents.
 The loudest critics of the increase have been elected officials. These include Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is running for re-election next year and whose four appointees to the board voted against the fare increase at yesterday's meeting of the transit committee of the authority. 
 The mayor's appointees have only those four of the 14 votes on the board, and riders' advocates have complained that the mayor in particular has not taken more action than he has to prevent the increase. 
 Neysa C. Pranger, an organizer for the Straphangers Campaign, a rider organization that opposes the fare increase but favors restoration of state and city transit subsidies to previous levels, called the nay votes ''an empty political gesture if it's not backed up with a real conversation with the governor with real ideas and real plans.''
 Mr. Bloomberg has conceded that he has yet to even speak to Gov. George E. Pataki, the elected official with the most power over the authority, about the proposed increase. Nor has Mr. Bloomberg offered to restore any of the hundreds of millions in city subsidies to the authority that were withdrawn under the Dinkins and Giuliani administrations.
 Yesterday a protest outside the governor's Midtown office drew support from several mayoral hopefuls including Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, and Councilman Charles Barron of Brooklyn.
 ''We aren't paying a higher fare. I don't care what the M.T.A. does,'' Mr. Barron shouted over a chorus of approving honks from bus drivers heading up Third Avenue just behind him. ''A fare hike is a tax on the poor, and we are not accepting it.''
 The protest drew about 125 people, most of them from the coalition of rider advocates and union workers who are trying to stop the increase. Mr. Pataki had no official reaction to the protest, but he said earlier yesterday that while he opposed fare increases, he was not going to tell his appointees to vote against them.
 The coalition has distributed more than 60,000 leaflets asking riders to call Mr. Pataki's office and has collected 1,500 signatures on an online petition.
 But even the most fervent opponents of the fare raise concede that it is all but certain. ''We don't have any illusions that we'll meet with success,'' said Paul Steely White, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an group representing riders, bicyclists and pedestrians that is part of the coalition.
 One observer of transit politics, Robert E. Paaswell, said many people were ''just sort of worn out'' from the last fare fight.
 ''They've come to expect that not only the M.T.A., but government in general, is just not going to respond to civic needs,'' said Professor Paaswell, a civil engineer who directs the Urban Transportation Research Center at City College of New York.
 More than a dozen riders interviewed this week were either only vaguely aware of the imminent fare increase or resigned to it.
 Steve Joblin, 53, a construction worker who takes the Long Island Rail Road daily from his home in New Hyde Park, said his neighbors and co-workers viewed the board's decision as a certainty. ''It's not a topic of conversation anymore,'' he said. ''We just assume they are going to do it.'' 
 Raising the price of unlimited-use fare cards, which are used by only about half of subway and bus riders, makes the economic effects on city residents harder to discern, said Steven M. Polan, who was the transportation authority's general counsel from 1984 until 1990, when the MetroCard was being planned. 
 ''Part of the conscious strategy of that whole program -- as a collateral benefit, not the primary benefit -- was to get the focus away from the price of a single ride,'' Mr. Polan said.

HEADLINE: For Sprint and Nextel, a Battle With Titans

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
When Sprint and Nextel Communications formally announce their merger -- which could come as early as today -- they will have completed the easy part.
 The harder part, industry executives and analysts say, will be competing against their much larger rivals, Cingular Wireless and Verizon Wireless, both of which are owned by regional Bell telephone companies that have more money and more services to sell to consumers who like one-stop shopping. 
 Sprint and Nextel would make a formidable No.3 player in the wireless market. Together, they will have 39 million subscribers, just 7 million fewer than the market leader, Cingular. Nextel's popularity with small businesses complements Sprint's power in the consumer market. And the new company -- which will probably be led by Gary D. Forsee, Sprint's chief executive -- will have some of the most loyal subscribers in the industry. 
 Yet the economics of selling wireless phone service dictate that Sprint and Nextel merge to survive. By combining forces, they can make better use of their networks and spectrum licenses to offer better service to more subscribers. They can also gain more leverage over handset manufacturers, advertisers and other vendors.
 Even so, Sprint and Nextel will be hard pressed to match the firepower of the Bells and their wireless carriers. 
 The telecommunications industry is increasingly being defined by bundles of services -- fixed phone lines, high-speed data connections, wireless services and video products. Customers who buy more than one service from a company not only spend more, but they also are less likely to switch to a competing company.
 Cingular, which is owned by SBC Communications and BellSouth, and Verizon Wireless, which is owned by Verizon Communications and Vodafone, have been selling cellular service to customers who also buy local and long-distance phone service and broadband connections.
 The Bells are also marketing satellite television services and they have started to build out their fiber-optic networks to deliver video programming to millions of homes. And they have the advantage of being able to broadcast their marketing message directly to a combined 135 million fixed-line phone customers.
 ''The future of the telecom really belongs to the Bells,'' said Robert V. Green, an investment strategist at Briefing.com, an independent financial analysis firm in Boston. ''You'll see a one-source assault: wireless, wireline and data. Everything they've been doing over the last few years has been to provide one big bundle.''
 In contrast, Nextel has no traditional fixed-line business and Sprint has only 7.7 million local phone customers, just 5 percent of the market. The combined Sprint-Nextel is also expected to sell Sprint's local lines after the merger, which would actually reduce the range of products the new company could offer.
 Sprint and Nextel will also be hard pressed to match the financial resources of the Bells. The credit ratings for the three Bells are all rated A or higher by Standard & Poor's, though the ratings of all three also have a negative outlook. Sprint is rated BBB- and Nextel's credit has a BB rating.
 Though S.&P. has a positive view of Sprint and Nextel, the companies' lower credit ratings mean they must pay more to issue and refinance their debt. This will not hamper a deal between Sprint and Nextel, which mostly involves exchanging stock. But it could limit Sprint's ability to acquire another wireless carrier later on.
 The higher credit ratings are ''not a complete advantage for the Bells, but they mean Sprint has less financial flexibility to merge with others in the future,'' said Dave Novosel, a credit analyst at Gimme Credit. At the same time, ''Verizon Wireless and Cingular have all sorts of other opportunities for buying other companies.''
 To match the Bells and their arsenal of products, Sprint and Nextel could join hands with cable providers, some of whom are reportedly talking about how to add wireless products to their own product lineup. Sprint, in fact, already has contracts to connect Internet-based phone calls for some cable companies.
 ''A deal between Sprint and Nextel could certainly make an wireless alliance more attractive to the cable companies, who are still looking to fill in the pieces missing from their own bundles,'' said Todd Rosenbluth, a telecommunications analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 But such partnerships may not happen immediately, because the cable industry is still trying to figure out how to strike a deal, industry analysts say, and because it will take Sprint and Nextel many months, if not years, to integrate their networks.
 Sprint and Nextel, meanwhile, will have to play catch-up in two crucial areas: high-speed data services and international roaming. 
 Sprint has only recently announced plans to build a high-speed network that will let consumers send and receive e-mail messages and other data services with their handsets. Verizon Wireless, by contrast, has offered that service for a year. Cingular also offers a data service, though it is more limited than the Verizon Wireless service. Without such a service, Sprint and Nextel risk losing high-paying business customers. 
 The same business customers are also big users of international phone plans. Cingular, which uses the same network technology as many wireless carriers in Europe and Asia, has several popular international phone plans. Sprint and Nextel use less common technology to run their networks, which makes it more cumbersome for their subscribers to use their phones overseas.
 ''International roaming is a big hole for Sprint,'' said Lisa Pierce, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ''It's not a big group who use the service, but they are premium customers.''

HEADLINE: A Mayor Who Has Learned How to Kiss a Baby

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
As congregants at Memorial Baptist Church in Harlem listened, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg trotted out the latest in his collection of tough one-liners. ''If you want to go ahead and act stupid, that's all right for you,'' he said, referring to unruly students, ''but you don't have a right to take away somebody else's education.'' He was rewarded with a chorus of amen from the pews.
 The moment, however modest, underscored the thousand miles of studied locution and political savvy that Mr. Bloomberg has accrued since a trip to Memorial Baptist in 2001, the first time in his life he had entered a black church. During that visit, worshipers looked on indifferently as Mr. Bloomberg, then a first-time mayoral candidate, made some vague remarks in flat tones about the similarities between blacks and Jews. 
 As he embarks on his second mayoral campaign, Michael Bloomberg is both remarkably the same and altogether different from the candidate of 2001, when he played the role of the unlikely billionaire awkwardly lurching through his first political race. 
 He still speaks in a less-than-lilting Boston accent, but keeps his remarks far more concise and guarded. It is safe to assume he will not make the kind of stumbles that marred his 2001 campaign, like Mr. Bloomberg's announcement in front of a Republican colleague, Gov. George E. Pataki, that he was a liberal.
 Once oblivious to agency acronyms and the number of workers on a sanitation truck, Mr. Bloomberg can now talk authoritatively and at length about budget modifications, the pleasures of artificial turf in public parks and recycling trivia. He is still manically social, but his famous dinner parties now include community leaders from Queens as well as movie stars, and he often takes old friends to haunts in places like the Pelham Parkway section of the Bronx rather than the Upper East Side. He has memorized the pet peeves of neighborhoods throughout the city (Not enough parking! Too many pornography shops!) and their best restaurants.
 He is still no political chameleon. Mr. Bloomberg will not bob his head to gospel music, and he lectures 11th graders on the fine points of education finance in the same manner he addresses business leaders. But Mr. Bloomberg can now kiss babies and flick a thumbs up without explicit instructions from his press secretary.
 Still, his insistence on remaining a far less public and excitable mayor than his predecessors has clearly left many New Yorkers ambivalent. His approval rating remains below 50 percent, in spite of an improving economy and his administration's aggressive agenda of taking on issues like failing third graders and barroom smokers, and enjoying successes on fronts like reducing crime and establishing the 311 system to put people in touch with city agencies. 
 Although New Yorkers' confidence in the city has swelled since 2001, Mr. Bloomberg has remained unable to shake his image as an out-of-touch billionaire largely ignorant of the daily struggles of average citizens. His relationship with labor unions is perhaps the worst of any mayor in two decades, and he has found himself in a potentially damaging fight over his plans to use public money to finance a stadium for the Jets on the far West Side of Manhattan. 
 Mr. Bloomberg sold himself as a businessman mayor, but he has yet to tame New York's constant budget woes with steely private-sector eyes. He averted a fiscal crisis in large part through raising property taxes 18.5 percent instead of reducing city services. Though he later refunded most of the residential part of the increase, the move cost him and the city's budget remains structurally out of balance, with huge new gaps looming for years to come.
 But his greatest challenge, say both supporters and adversaries, is almost intangible: convincing voters that a mayor who lacks the charisma of an Edward I. Koch or a Rudolph W. Giuliani nevertheless has the passion to continue running the most complex city in the nation. And the image of a remote Mr. Bloomberg -- fair or not -- is one that Democrats, smarting under 11 years of Republican rule in City Hall, are longing to exploit.
 ''I think there is a perception among elites in New York that Mike Bloomberg has done a good job as mayor,'' said Howard Wolfson, a Democratic consultant who will probably represent one of Mr. Bloomberg's challengers. But he added: ''That is not an opinion shared by a majority of New Yorkers. The majority of New Yorkers think he is out of touch and does not share their priorities. If I were an incumbent behind by five points at the beginning of an election cycle, I would be worried.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides are confident that he will win a second term. But they all concede that the battle will probably be bruising. ''You can't take anything for granted,'' said William T. Cunningham, Mr. Bloomberg's communications director, who ran his last campaign.

A Growing Understanding
 The political evolution of Mr. Bloomberg has played out for all to see. The man who once dismissed Queens as little more than a haven for aircraft now visits the Lemon Ice King of Corona, and has attended 49 civic association meetings, from Cambria Heights to Washington Heights to the far reaches of Staten Island. His parade attendance at this point rivals that of Senator Charles E. Schumer. 
 More than a dozen of the mayor's subordinates echoed the refrain: that far from being an out-of-touch billionaire, Mr. Bloomberg has truly come to understand the ways that government touches people's lives. 
 ''He is much more knowledgeable on issues facing specific neighborhoods because he's been there countless times and spent the last three years listening,'' said Patricia E. Harris, a deputy mayor and one of Mr. Bloomberg's closest advisers.
 While the mayor was once fond of shutting out all but his inner circle from planning major policy initiatives, he has since tried harder to build coalitions and curry favor: on Wednesday, he attended a menorah-lighting ceremony at a small restaurant favored by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, an important voice on the proposed Jets stadium deal.
 ''He has become a far, far better politician,'' said Mark Green, whom Mr. Bloomberg narrowly defeated in 2001. While noting that he will support any breathing Democrat over Mr. Bloomberg next year, Mr. Green nevertheless conceded, ''He has been a far better mayor than I thought.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides say that his grasp of public policy has blossomed. Four aides independently cited his attempt to solve the costly problem of dealing with New York's' garbage as an important example.
 In the first year as mayor, Mr. Bloomberg pushed his sanitation commissioner to consider costly engineering solutions to the city's trash problem. At one point, the administration even pondered sending garbage to the Caribbean. 
 A task force was assigned to tackle the issue, and Mr. Bloomberg, in typical form, checked in every so often and left several aides with the impression that he was gaining a marginal understanding of the problem. But then it suddenly dawned on them that he had mastered the incredibly dense and complex issue.
 ''It was amazing how much he had thought through and understood,'' said Peter J. Madonia, the mayor's chief of staff, who oversaw the task force. ''This is a guy who probably never noticed how many people worked on a sanitation truck, much less what happened to the garbage inside of it. In the end he got where we pick up garbage, where it goes, how much it costs to move it. And garbage is just one thing he does as mayor.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides also point to the mayor's evolving beliefs about overdevelopment, an issue that vexes many neighborhoods. Three aides said that when he was running for mayor, Mr. Bloomberg, a pro-development businessman, was perplexed that any neighborhood would want less housing and business development. 
 So Mr. Bloomberg took a tour with residents and local leaders in Staten Island one day, spending the whole morning viewing lots stuffed with multiple-family homes where one house once stood, and cookie-cutter architecture that critics said was ruining the character of many neighborhoods. From that tour, a new zoning policy was born. 
 Among policy issues, Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly asked voters to judge him on education, and his performance in that area, three years after he took over the public schools, is among the hardest of his accomplishments to measure.
 Randi Weingarten, the head of the teachers' union and a constant critic of the mayor, sees the system as more broken and flawed than ever, with top-down management demoralizing teachers and classrooms in disarray. The inability of the city and the union to agree on a contract fans the flames.
 ''I feel profoundly disappointed,'' said Ms. Weingarten, who initially supported mayoral control of the schools, ''because he is a smart guy and he would have gotten so much more out of the work force if he treated us with a real respect and as peers.''

Out-of-Sight Generosity
 In contrast, Mr. Bloomberg was greeted warmly on a recent visit to a failing high school in the South Bronx that the Department of Education had turned around. ''He not only said education is his priority, he delivers,'' said Virginia Gonzales, a board member of South Bronx Churches, which is involved in neighborhood education issues. 
 Asked if she would consider supporting Mr. Bloomberg over Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president who is believed to have the best shot in a Democratic mayoral primary, Ms. Gonzales said, ''I don't vote because they are Latinos, I vote for people who care to make a difference.'' 
 Kevin Sheekey, a longtime aide who will run Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, and other people close to the mayor are expected to heavily court the black vote around the city, and some aides say they think he can pick up some Hispanic support, too, which is counter to conventional wisdom.
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides are unnerved by the constant refrain that he is ''out of touch,'' and that his wealth alienates him from the rest of the city. People closest to him acknowledge that he fails to emote warmth -- he tends to give quick pats on the back, not hugs. But they insist that that is how Mr. Bloomberg came into the world, and that that has little to do with his money, even if his money has made it harder for him to relate to the financial struggles of his constituents. Aides and friends describe a man who has maintained the middle-class sensibilities he picked up during his upbringing as the son of a bookkeeper in Bedford, Mass. Mr. Bloomberg, who is now worth at least $4 billion, still eats saltines with cream cheese and will not let his police detail hold the elevator door.
 Still, many of Mr. Bloomberg's most generous acts, which would humanize him to outsiders, happen out of public view. He sends friends of friends to famous doctors he knows, calls his commissioners numerous times when they have family problems, and recently had an emotional phone call with the widow of the city firefighter who had died in Iraq. The mayor, who in his first year in office was criticized for not being sensitive enough to the families of Sept. 11 victims, instructed the police to put her in touch with him at any hour when she called a 24-hour number.
 Charlotte Bloomberg, the mayor's 95-year-old mother, who lives in the house he grew up in, said her son was not one to promote his own good deeds. ''The best things he does are the things that nobody knows about,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''The things that don't get into the papers are much more important than anything.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's association with wealthy and famous friends continues, but some of the circumstance of the friendships have changed. Many now find themselves sitting next to city commissioners and community leaders at his dinner parties. Beverly Sills said he no longer had time to go to the opera with her. 
 E. John Rosenwald Jr., the vice chairman of Bear, Stearns & Company and one of Mr. Bloomberg's closest friends, said quiet dinners with his wife, Pat, and Mr. Bloomberg and his companion, Diana Taylor, now take place in the Bronx and in Astoria, Queens.
 ''We find a place through various sources in very, very unfancy, no-jackets-no-ties kind of places,'' Mr. Rosenwald said.
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides are hoping that the coming race will be decided by his record managing the city, not by his personality. If that is the case, political experts say, he could be well positioned.
 ''As an incumbent, he now has a record and a basis for attack,'' said Steven Cohen, a professor of public administration at Columbia. ''Presiding over the most diverse city in the world is something he has grown with, and I think serving in the public sector has allowed him to see the nuances. When you apply his accomplishments to the kind of money he is going to spend, I think he will be a very formidable candidate.''

HEADLINE: Decentralization Foe Now Assails Mayor's Rule

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
Perhaps no one knows the tumult and turmoil of the New York City school system better than the author and historian Diane Ravitch, whose books include ''The Great School Wars: New York City, 1805-1973.'' 
 Having long decried the failures of the city's decentralized school system, Dr. Ravitch, a research professor at New York University and visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, enthusiastically supported Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's campaign to gain control of the schools in 2002. 
 But nearly three years later, Dr. Ravitch has become a fierce critic of Mr. Bloomberg's education policies and seems intent on undercutting the image he has tried to build as the ''education mayor.'' She says that his handling of the schools has been awful and has called for ''midcourse corrections.'' 
 ''I like the mayor,'' she said in an interview. ''But I think he's got very serious problems about what he's doing in education. His stewardship of the schools suggests this turn of mayoral control doesn't work.''
 Since Dr. Ravitch championed mayoral control and worked for a Republican White House, few educators expected her to become so critical of the mayor, a Republican, and on so many fronts. At a recent meeting of the principals' union, she attacked him for everything from his choice of curriculum to his new administrative structure. 
 City education officials reject her criticism, but they do not take her lightly. Last week, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein used part of a breakfast speech at N.Y.U., Dr. Ravitch's home turf, to offer a point-by-point rebuttal of remarks she had made at a similar event there last month.
 Dr. Ravitch, an assistant secretary of education under President George H.W. Bush, first questioned the mayor's education agenda after he chose a citywide reading program in February 2003 that she and other experts said did not use scientifically proven methods to help the lowest-performing students. Now, she says the reading program tops a long list of problems. 
 Under Mr. Bloomberg's heavy hand, she says, public discourse and community input have been stifled and veteran teachers and principals are micromanaged and are retiring in droves. She also says that the mayor's new administrative structure of 10 regions, instead of 32 districts, has not reduced bureaucracy and that too many people running the system have no background in education. Dr. Ravitch attacks a new training academy for principals, calling it too expensive and too focused on recruiting outsiders rather than growing leaders from within. 
 She has also complained that the Education Department has not encouraged independent research to determine whether its plans are working. ''Every new program is declared a success on the day it is inaugurated,'' she said. 
 In recent weeks, Dr. Ravitch's criticism has grown sharper, including an analysis of last year's scores on the statewide fourth- and eighth-grade English tests that she says shows that the first full year of the mayor's literacy program resulted in sharp declines in some of the city's neediest districts.
 By this analysis, which she made the focus of an op-ed article in The Daily News last month, the number of fourth graders meeting standards on the state reading test in District 5 in Harlem dropped to 31.2 percent from 41 percent. 
 ''The mayor and the chancellor ought to pay attention to what the scores are telling them,'' she said this month at the annual conference of the principals' union, where she gave the keynote address. ''There is a problem with the reading program.'' 
 Mr. Klein said that her analysis of last year's test scores was ''flat wrong.'' 
 In his talk at N.Y.U., he pointed to broader results, including citywide exams in grades 3, 5, 6 and 7, that showed rising scores. ''People can put up selective data,'' he said. 
 Mayor Bloomberg's office referred questions about Dr. Ravitch to Chancellor Klein's office. The chancellor's press secretary, Jerry Russo, said that Dr. Ravitch ''has lost any sense of objectivity when it comes to school reform in New York City.''
 He added: ''Under mayoral control, we now have clear leadership and clear accountability. Why would she want to go back to the dysfunction, lack of accountability and politics of paralysis that deprived our children of a quality education for generations?'' 
 Others say Dr. Ravitch, 66, has a grudge against the Bloomberg administration because some of her close friends were pushed out of jobs in the shake-up of the bureaucracy; still others say she is driven by conservative ideology. 
 ''Diane Ravitch is an ideologue,'' said Arthur Levine, the president of Teachers College at Columbia University, where Dr. Ravitch was part of the faculty for nearly 20 years but which is now also home to the architects of the city's literacy program. 
 But he acknowledged that unlike union leaders and some politicians, she was not an easy critic to dismiss. ''Her credentials make her more thoughtful than many other conservatives,'' Mr. Levine said. Among some educators, she is regarded more as an oracle than a commentator. At the principals' union conference, she was treated like a celebrity, signing copies of her latest book, ''The Language Police.'' 
 ''When Diane Ravitch speaks, educators listen because she is known to be a bright, impartial observer of truth,'' said Mae Fong, who retired last year as principal of Middle School 67 in Queens. ''I could listen to her for hours because of the knowledge and perspective she brings.'' 
 Carol Gresser, the former president of the Board of Education, said: ''You know why I love her? She tells it exactly the way she sees it. People may not agree with what she says, but when she talks, people listen.'' 
 But Dr. Ravitch said that getting people to listen is difficult these days. ''People inside and outside the schools are afraid to raise issues or problems for fear of offending the mayor,'' she said in her talk at N.Y.U. last month. 
 At the same event, Dr. Ravitch, who is a registered independent, said she planned to vote for Mr. Bloomberg next year because of his record on crime and the economy. But more recently she has said she does not know how she will vote.
 Dr. Ravitch said the bottom line was that the State Legislature had given the mayor too much control. And when the school governance law expires in 2009, she does not expect it to be renewed. ''I am in a position to say the law should change,'' she said. ''It's a one-man show.''

HEADLINE: Body of Kidnapped Turkish Worker Is Found on an Afghan Hilltop

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
A Turkish construction engineer has been kidnapped and killed by suspected Islamic militants opposed to the international reconstruction effort in Afghanistan, government officials said Wednesday.
 The engineer, Muhammad Ayub, was working on a road project financed by the United States Agency for International Development and managed by an American construction company, the Louis Berger Group. 
 He was abducted Tuesday from his car, along with a driver and a translator as they were traveling from Jalalabad to Kunar Province in eastern Afghanistan. His body was found Wednesday on a hilltop, said Lutfullah Mashal, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. 
 ''We think they were militants,'' he said. ''Bandits would have taken him but not killed him like that.'' He called the perpetrators ''terrorists,'' and ''enemies of peace and prosperity for the Afghan people.'' 
 The driver and the translator were released Tuesday around midnight.
 President Hamid Karzai, who celebrated his inauguration to a new five-year term last week, condemned the attack. ''I am angered that the enemies of Afghanistan have killed a brother and fellow Muslim in pursuit of their goal of disrupting reconstruction in Afghanistan,'' he said in a statement released by his office. 
 Some 40 aid workers, election workers and contractors have died this year in violence that officials say has mostly been directed at unarmed foreign and Afghan staff engaged in reconstruction work. By deterring such efforts, the militants hope to undermine popular support for the American-backed government.
 The United States Embassy here in the capital released a statement saying the country would not be stopped from building roads in Kunar or any other province. 
 ''This cowardly attack will not deter United States resolve to help Afghanistan stand on its own feet,'' the statement said. ''Those who committed this crime are desperate elements that have no future in Afghanistan.''

HEADLINE: Workers Demand Union at Wal-Mart Supplier in China

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SHENZHEN, China, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
The scene on the street did not look like much, just the comings and goings of small groups of women from their factory dormitory, with a few lingering here and there in knots to discuss their situation.
 Since Friday, though, work has stopped inside the Uniden factory's walls here, where 12,000 workers, mostly young women from China's poor interior provinces, make wireless phones, which the Japanese manufacturer supplies in large number to the giant American retailer Wal-Mart.
 China's laws tightly proscribe public demonstrations, so the women found another way to vent their anger over their wages, and what they said were many other abusive work conditions. They met secretly to draw up a list of demands, and then walked off the job. 
 Wal-Mart has been much in the news recently in China, with the government insisting that the retailer do what it refuses to do in the United States: allow all its workers to join unions. 
 But what the scene at the Uniden plant here in Shenzhen, the very heartland of China's export-led resurgence, reveals is a situation much more typical in this country's booming new economy, where the government has been reluctant to enforce laws that would oblige foreign companies to allow unions, for fear of losing overseas investment. 
 The hordes of young women employed here say they are required to work 11-hour days, including three hours of mandatory overtime, to earn a basic monthly salary of 484 yuan, or about $58. 
 The women say they must spend nearly half their wage on the drab company dormitories where, as migrants, they must live. They laughed ruefully when asked if they were able to save any money, or send money back to their families. 
 ''No, I haven't been able to save any money,'' said Liu Shuangyan, outside the factory gates. ''You have to eat. You buy a few clothes, and then there's nothing left.''
 ''If you get sick,'' added Ms. Liu, a native of Hunan Province, ''they won't give you leave unless it is very serious.'' 
 A friend and fellow worker from Hunan, Wang Lifang, then spoke up to say, ''They have a small clinic, but you have to pay, and the medicines they give you are much more expensive than outside.''
 Other young women said that many minors were employed in the plant, and that most of the employees had been forced to pay 200 yuan under the table as a job-finder's fee in order to be hired.
 Some women said they had little idea what a union was, but yearned for some kind of representation that could serve as their advocate. Others said with certainty that no union existed, and ascribed their plight in large part to this fact. 
 ''If there were a union, things would be fairer for us,'' said one 32-year-old woman from Henan Province. ''Right now, one person says one thing, another complains about another, and the boss doesn't listen to anything.''
 Workers said the strike began when a senior Japanese manager was overheard saying to a Chinese supervisor that the employees would be foolish to accept the terms of a new contract being offered them. Others said it was caused by abusive dismissals of workers with seniority to make way for cheaper, more pliable replacements.
 Japanese officials at the company, reached by telephone, refused to comment, passing the phone to a Chinese manager. The manager, who declined to identify himself, said, ''A group of workers' contracts have reached termination, and the company, in conformance with labor laws, did not offer them a new contract.''
 Believing the questions were coming from a caller in New York, the Chinese manager said the strike had ended, early in the afternoon, and the situation had returned to normal.
 ''If you could get into a spaceship right now and come over, you'd see for yourself,'' he said, laughing.
 Meanwhile, plainclothes security agents milled outside of the plant. As soon as a foreigner began taking photographs of the continuing work stoppage, they called the police.
 Analysts of China's labor scene say strikes like this are becoming far more common as younger migrant workers exposed to the wealth of China's relatively rich eastern cities grow increasingly angry over what many see as their exploitation. Although few are unionized, communication and coordination among them is growing, often through the sending of coded messages to each other by cellphone.
 ''The migrant workers have learned to protest with their feet, they are more capable of negotiating, and they can choose not to work,'' said Liu Kaiming, who studies conditions of migrant workers in Guangdong Province. ''That has especially been true recently, with a lot of the migrant workers who were born in the 1980's entering the workforce. They've had a better education, they're young and emotional, and they've been emboldened by media reports about their conditions to demand their rights.''
 All the women interviewed seemed determined to press their demands, the most important of which, they said, were shorter work hours and enforcement of minimum-wage laws. 
 Asked if they were afraid of losing their jobs, they scoffed at the idea, saying workers were in short supply in Shenzhen's vast manufacturing zone.
 ''If we were men, there would have been a strike a long time ago,'' one woman said. ''Women are easier to bully, but we have hearts of steel.''

HEADLINE: Nudging America Awake as a United Europe Takes the Stage

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN. 
Roger Cohen writes the Globalist column in The International Herald Tribune

 BODY:

'The United States of Europe'
''The New Superpower and the End of American Supremacy''
By T.R. Reid.
305 pages. Penguin Press. $25.95
 Sometimes major events take place quietly, their import obscured by the hubbub of more arresting happenings. Only with time is the shift perceptible; it becomes clear that the world has changed not because another terrorist has struck but because a nameless bureaucrat has accomplished a thankless task. Such is the case, it seems, with the emergence of what T.R. Reid somewhat provocatively calls ''the United States of Europe.''
 Mr. Reid, a correspondent for The Washington Post, is by no means the first to use that term. In 1946, Winston Churchill urged Europeans to ''build a kind of United States of Europe'' to transform the Continent from ''a breeding ground for pestilence and hate.'' Since then, through successive treaties and much haggling, Europe has inched toward the ''ever closer union'' prescribed by the founding fathers of integration. Mr. Reid's thesis is that the United States of Europe is no longer an objective; it is a reality.
 This is a bold view. Mr. Reid's book, ''The United States of Europe: The New Superpower and the End of American Supremacy,'' sometimes stretches to make the argument that the 25-nation European Union has marched into a central place on the world stage while America slept. The chronic failings of the union are glossed over. High unemployment, slow growth, often acute internal divisions (as over the war in Iraq) and the lack of the sort of military power needed to make diplomatic initiatives persuasive are issues on which Mr. Reid chooses not to dwell.
 Rather, his focus is on Europe's achievements and the ways in which the union has emerged as a counterweight to an American power that is overwhelming in military terms, but less persuasive in others. This approach is timely. For behind all the trans-Atlantic ugliness over Iraq lurk divisions that will no doubt prove enduring.
 A united Europe has emerged as the embodiment of an approach to world affairs that stands in contrast to that of the United States. It is one based on pooled sovereignty, the primacy of international institutions and law, the exaltation of peace, an inviolable secularism, a shared currency (the euro), and a value system equating the death penalty with barbarism and free health care with civilization.
 ''Europe,'' Mr. Reid writes, ''is at a point in its history where making aggressive war is considered passe, an outdated relic along the lines of burning at the stake or a medieval joust.''
 That is an overstatement; European troops are deployed, and dying, in Afghanistan. But in this fluid book, written with verve, marked by the cool distillation of complex issues, Mr. Reid's central point is a critical one: the European Union, 15 years after the end of the cold war, has achieved a heft insufficiently acknowledged on this side of the Atlantic. This unity was inspired by America's federal model and achieved under the protection of American troops, but is now often characterized by opposition to America.
 Soon, under its draft constitution, the European Union will have what amount to a president and a foreign minister. Mr. Reid argues that these leaders will head a ''borderless federal union that is not exactly a single country, but is much more than just another international organization or trading bloc,'' one ''determined to challenge American claims to global supremacy.''
 In fact, several members of the European Union, especially new ones like Poland, remain attached to a strong American presence in Europe, because they see it as the ultimate guarantor of their security. Views of the United States vary: British Atlanticism and French anti-Americanism coexist, with Germany hovering between them.
 But it is indisputable that the ideal of European unity has assumed a kind of global resonance -- one that inspires democratic reformers in Ukraine today -- and done so in contradistinction to American power. The importance of Mr. Reid's book lies in its evocative framing of this shift.
 His approach is journalistic, using portraits of European entrepreneurs and his family's personal experience during their years in London to compile a picture of a fast-changing continent. The vignettes are framed with enough history to give them context but not so much as to weigh down a book of polemical energy.
 Among the best chapters is that devoted to the travails of General Electric's former chief executive, John F. Welch Jr., whose plans in 2000 for a merger with Honeywell ran afoul of the European Union's Directorate-General for Competition. What's that? It is, as Mr. Welch discovers to his discomfort, where European antitrust law is enforced. Forget national governments; they have no more say in such matters. ''We have to do business with Europe, so we have no choice but to respect their law,'' Mr. Welch says when his merger is squelched. ''That really is just the way the world works now.''
 In his chapter on the European social model, Mr. Reid explores one aspect of the ''basic differences of worldview on the opposite sides of the Atlantic.'' He compares the Continent's safety net to ''falling into a large, soft bed with a down comforter.'' There is, of course, a price for all the benefits: a lack of initiative. But Mr. Reid feels this can be overstated; look at how Nokia grabbed a bigger market share than Motorola or how Airbus took on Boeing. And his experience of Britain's National Health Service leads him to a stark view: ''As an American, I would rather see my country move in the European direction on health care than vice versa.''
 It is hard, given spiraling American health costs, to argue with that conclusion. Mr. Reid's portrait of the euro's rise and America's vulnerability to its deficits is equally persuasive. But his general bullishness on European industry seems overblown, and the book suffers from a few odd slips, among them a reference to Zoran Djindjic as ''prime minister of Serbia'' that fails to note that he was assassinated in 2003. The book's notes -- seven entries -- leave much to be desired. 
 But these are quibbles. Mr. Reid has performed a valuable service. The tendency in the United States is still to laugh at European Union rules governing ''the maximum permitted curvature of cucumbers,'' or invoke Henry Kissinger's line about Europe's missing phone number. These are tired habits.
 It is now more important to ask how the United States should respond to the growing ''soft power'' and independence of the European Union. In recent years, under the Bush administration, the tendency has been to ignore it or try to divide it. Mr. Reid proposes another approach: ''The United States of America has to show respect for the United States of Europe.''

HEADLINE: Melting Icy Egypt-Israel Relations Through a Trade Pact

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Mona el-Naggar contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
When Egypt, Israel and the United States signed a trade agreement this week, it represented the most tangible step in a monthlong thaw in chilly relations between the Egyptians and Israelis.
 The agreement, signed Tuesday, allows for the duty-free import of certain Egyptian goods by American buyers as long as the items contain some Israeli input. But the agreement also was part of a broader reconciliation from the Egyptians, driven by four important factors. 
 First, the death of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat in November prompted both Egypt and Israel to re-examine how attempts to reach a peace agreement might be revived. 
 Second, Egypt is newly convinced that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is serious about withdrawing from the Gaza Strip starting as early as March. Although senior Egyptian officials harbor some doubts as to how far Israel will eventually go in terms of a similar exit from the West Bank, they are determined to try to use Gaza as a springboard to larger issues. 
 The third factor is the re-election of President Bush. Arab leaders hold that American presidents in their second terms care more about the judgment of history than the judgment of the Jewish lobby, and hence are more willing to press Israel. 
 Finally, there is some thought here that the United States will not be too harsh on Cairo for the glacial pace of its political reform if they see Egypt being nice to Israel, especially since Washington itself has begun stressing economic opportunity as the route to more open political systems. 
 During the various meetings marking the signing of the trade agreement, one official after another commented on the shift in atmosphere between Egypt and Israel. When asked what had changed, Maged Abdel Fattah, the presidential spokesman and United Nations ambassador-designate, pointed to Mr. Arafat's death as a catalyst. 
 ''That created some momentum of optimism on the Israeli side, which was followed by another momentum of optimism from the Palestinian side,'' Mr. Abdel Fattah said. 
 The Egyptians have taken a number of steps to maintain the momentum and to ensure a central role for themselves. 
 They have stressed their willingness to train Palestinian security officers and to serve in an advisory capacity once the Israelis pull out of Gaza. They have sought to wrangle the often bickering Palestinian factions into a unified front for talks. The Israelis in turn have indicated that they will consult with the Palestinians about the withdrawal, something they gave no sign of doing with Mr. Arafat. 
 President Hosni Mubarak made some of his most positive comments ever about Mr. Sharon's government, suggesting to the Palestinians that the Israeli leader was their best chance for peace and that missing the opportunity would be a mistake. He made the remarks after his chief of intelligence, Omar Suleiman, and his foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, returned from Israel with assurances Egypt had hoped for: that the Israeli troops would not impede the election on Jan. 9 to pick Mr. Arafat's successor. 
 In another upbeat move early in December, Azam Azam, an Arab Israeli businessman convicted of spying for Israel, was released after serving 8 years of a 15-year sentence, and six Egyptian students captured by Israel were also sent home.
 The changed atmosphere remains tenuous, naturally, subject to potential eruptions of violence in the Arab-Israeli dispute. Given the continuing bloodshed, for example, Egypt has not returned its ambassador to Israel. ''It is natural that we would have an ambassador to Israel, but this is related to achieving progress in the peace process,'' Mr. Abdel Fattah said Tuesday. 
 The mere fact that Egypt and Israel, with American backing, were finally able to hammer out a trade agreement that had first been broached in 1996 is telling. Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, who signed for the United States, issued a statement calling it ''the most important economic agreement between Egypt and Israel in two decades.''
 Rashid Mohamed Rashid, the Egyptian foreign trade and industry minister, and Ehud Olmert, his Israeli counterpart, pointed out that the agreement was not merely about economics. 
 ''It goes far beyond the economics and the business and the trade between the two countries,'' Mr. Olmert said. ''This is another statement of two major forces in the Middle East: that they are looking forward toward greater cooperation.''
 The agreement stipulates that all Egyptian goods produced initially within seven specific ''qualified industrial zones'' will be exempt from American import tariffs as long as they contain at least 11.7 percent Israeli content. Given that much of the trade is expected to be in clothing, this would mean that the buttons or zippers or patterns would come from Israel, for example, while the actual manufacturing would depend on inexpensive Egyptian laborers. 
 The textile industry in Egypt employs a million people and accounts for more than one quarter of all industrial production, according to official figures. The United States takes half of Egypt's textile exports, or $470 million in 2003, which Mr. Rashid predicts could triple under the agreement. Jordan, the first to establish such zones, is expected to export $900 million to the United States this year, according to the American Embassy in Amman, up from virtually nothing five years ago. 
 Still, the pact was a tough public sell in Egypt, where bitterness and anger against the United States and Israel run deep. The professional unions in particular oppose any normalization with Israel, despite a 25-year-old peace treaty. Critics fret the agreement will not produce the anticipated job bonanza and will give Israel undue influence over some Egyptian exports. 
 A demonstration outside the Journalists Union drew fewer than 50 protesters, but their sentiments echoed the popular mood. 
 ''It is not possible that we should reward Israel for its crimes by making an agreement,'' said Muhammad Waked, who identified himself as a member of an antiglobalization group in Egypt, adding that the only people who would benefit in Egypt were rich factory owners. 
 The prevailing sentiment was that the agreement was yet another attempt by the United States to make Israel more palatable to the Arab world. Economic issues here often come secondary to the emotional desire to see some sort of overall settlement that will return occupied lands, particularly the holy mosque in Jerusalem, and find some solution for millions of Palestinian refugees stuck for generations in camps. 
 ''I think the United States often reverts to very complicated methods to avoid facing the essential problems,'' said Hassan Nafaa, a political science professor at Cairo University. 
 To overcome the opposition, Mr. Rashid underscored the idea that the agreement would bring economic benefits, including increasing exports to the United States and desperately needed job growth. Indeed, factory workers outside the designated zones demonstrated to be included out of fear their jobs were in jeopardy. 
 The expiration of a longstanding international quota system for textiles on Jan. 1 is likely to set off worldwide price competition for clothes, so getting Egyptian exports into the huge American market duty-free will protect jobs here, Mr. Rashid noted.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 27, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article on Dec. 16 about a thaw in relations between Egypt and Israel referred imprecisely to the numbers of Palestinian refugees living in refugee camps. Currently almost 4.2 million Palestinian refugees are officially registered, of whom 1.3 million live in camps, according to United Nations figures. The number of officially registered refugees passed one million in 1957; the camp population passed one million in 1995. Thus the number of Palestinian refugees who have lived in camps for generations is not in the millions. (Official refugee numbers do not reflect Palestinians who fled the West Bank during the 1967 war or their descendants, now believed to exceed 800,000; they are officially considered displaced persons.) The error was reported to The Times on Dec. 16; this correction was delayed for checking with several refugee organizations.

HEADLINE: Hollywood, the Global Village: Festivals Feed a Love of Movies

BYLINE: By CHARLES LYONS

DATELINE: ROCHESTER 

 BODY:
Ella Waldek, 74, and Ida Mae Martinez, 73, don't look much like movie stars. But as they answered questions and kibitzed for an audience at the historic Little Theater at the High Falls Film Festival here, it was clear that they were born to entertain.
 Ms. Waldek and Ms. Martinez are two real-life heroines of ''Lipstick and Dynamite the First Ladies of Wrestling,'' a crowd-pleaser directed by Ruth Leitman about the brash and lovable pioneers of women's wrestling in the 1940's and 50's. It may not be the perfect movie to blast onto 7,000 screens in multiplexes across the country, but it certainly clicked with the festival audience last month. 
 In the last 10 years, film festivals have spread across the country. According to the Web site filmfestivals.com, there are roughly 2,500 worldwide. Withoutabox, a Los Angeles-based company that helps filmmakers apply to film festivals, estimates that there are 950 festivals in the United States alone, with 300 more in Canada; in North America, there are 100 Jewish film festivals, 30 gay and lesbian film festivals, and 279 festivals that either focus on animation or have animation categories. 
 In many instances, regional film festivals emerge when local chambers of commerce finance them to promote economic development through cultural tourism. But some festival directors say their events are part of larger efforts to reclaim a film culture overrun by multiplexes and studio blockbusters. They say starting a film festival is a rebellious act and a sign of the growing democratization of film. 
 ''The more you build the center, the more the fringe aspects reach out to the outside,'' said Geoff Gilmore, director of the Sundance Film Festival. ''Today it's not so esoteric for people to talk about directors like Walter Salles, who would have been considered obscure 10 years ago.''
 In a business saturated with independent films that are costly to market, festivals are an invaluable way for a distributor to generate word of mouth and local press for a movie. For fledgling filmmakers, they are occasions to travel, schmooze and maybe meet someone who can advance their careers.
 ''Super Size Me,'' Morgan Spurlock's critique of the fast-food industry, was shown at more than 20 film festivals, including the West Virginia International Film Festival in Charleston and the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival in Durham, N.C. The film was distributed by two independent companies, Samuel Goldwyn Films and Roadside Attractions; it has taken in more than $11.5 million since its release in May. 
 Eamonn Bowles, the president of Magnolia Pictures, an independent distributor, said regional film festivals become alternative forms of distribution for some films that will never find distribution. The outlets in the commercial marketplace just cannot keep up with production, Mr. Bowles said. 
 Ira Deutchman, a film professor at Columbia University and president of Emerging Pictures, is exploring digital distribution for independent films. But until a new system catches on, film festivals will remain a means of distribution, allowing audiences at events as varied as Zoinks Film Festival in Boston and the International Wildlife Film Festival in Missoula, Mont., to see a vast range of films. 
 The four-year-old High Falls Film Festival drew inspiration from local history. George Eastman invented Kodak motion picture film in Rochester; his legacy endures through the George Eastman House, one of the world's most important film archives. Rochester is also the city where Susan B. Anthony, the women's suffrage leader, spent most of her politically active years. 
 The backdrop proved perfect for a festival whose focus is women's contributions to cinema. This year's honorees included the director Mira Nair, the actresses Joan Allen and Sally Kellerman, and the pioneer publicist Lois Smith, all of whom were on hand for the festival's closing-night gala. 
 ''Our goal is to become the East Coast center for women filmmakers,'' said Catherine Wyler, the festival's artistic director, a daughter of the three-time Academy Award-winning director William Wyler. 
 Some festivals have less lofty goals, including the Tunkhannock Film Festival in the tiny Pennsylvania township of Tunkhannock, where the dilapidated 1936 Dietrich Theater was renovated in 1998.
 ''We can't believe we're doing this,'' said Hildy Morgan, a founder of the festival. ''We are all in our 50's and 60's; we are retired from something else. And now we are in the movie business. We hire a lot of people in a town where a lot of people are out of work.'' 
 Now in its third season, the Tunkhannock Film Festival is gaining popularity in nearby towns, Ms. Morgan said. ''It opens up dialogue between people,'' she said. ''The films we show are uplifting and educational. People have strong feelings about the movies they see at our festival, one way or another.'' 
 Other festivals have other cultural agendas. The first annual San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival, held from Nov. 11 to 13, was intended to encourage the production of films that inspire the highest ideals, support the clearest and noblest biblical values and do so with a commitment to holiness, according to a mission statement provided by the festival's founders and main sponsor, Vision Forum Ministries, based in San Antonio. 
 With so many festivals, it is not surprising that their directors say they must compete with other festivals for the best independent films. A filmmaker who spoke on condition of anonymity said some festival directors even agree to pay distributors a percentage of box office grosses to obtain the films they want. 
 Despite success stories, Jeff Lipsky, the co-founder of October Films, said festivals masked a 52-week-a-year problem. According to Exhibitor Relations Inc., a box office tracking company in Los Angeles, roughly 405 films will be released in the United States by the end of the year. Of those, about 120 come from major studios and the remaining 285 from independent distributors. The 40 top-grossing films will represent an estimated 90 percent of the year's total box office receipts. That leaves hundreds of films vying for the rest. 
 And finding a distributor, even at a major festival like Sundance, remains difficult. Of the 5,874 submissions to this year's Sundance, the festival screened just 255 films, including shorts. According to Sundance, roughly 30 features were picked up for distribution. It's too early to say how many of those will prove profitable, but if past years are any indication, the number will be fewer than a dozen. 
 Recent history shows that most independent films do not survive a Darwinian cultural landscape in which theater owners at local art houses replace small films that aren't performing well in their opening week with other small films that might. A gem like ''Lipstick and Dynamite,'' which Koch Lorber Films plans to distribute next year, may not have the chance to build word of mouth. But for the roughly 200 people in Rochester who saw a quirky film about female wrestlers, the experience was probably unlike going to the multiplex. For that they can thank one of the hundreds of film festivals that delight in finding bold, eccentric and vital new voices.

HEADLINE: Holding Up Arab Reform

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 

 BODY:
For years now it's been clear that the Middle East peace process has left the realm of diplomacy and started to become an industry, with its own G.N.P. of conferences and seminars. But there is a new industry rapidly overtaking it in the Middle East, and that is the ''reform industry.'' Every month there seems to be a new conference on reform in the Arab world. Indeed, I have been attending one here in Dubai, an amazing city-state on the Persian Gulf that is becoming the Singapore of the Arab East.
 What the reform process and the peace process have in common is that neither advances when we Americans tell the parties in English that they have to change. Progress happens only when the people here tell themselves in Arabic that they must change. So I took heart from the blunt manner in which Dubai's crown prince, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, opened his conference by saying, in a speech broadcast by Arab satellite TV, ''I say to my fellow Arabs [in power]: If you do not change, you will be changed.'' 
 I didn't hear talk like that five years ago. Nor did I hear an Egyptian friend remarking to me that she had absolutely no problem with Hosni Mubarak's son, Gamal, one day succeeding his father. Gamal is a good man. She just had one condition, that Gamal Mubarak succeed his father the same way George W. Bush succeeded his father: in a free election.
 Meanwhile, last Sunday, about 1,000 Egyptians gathered in downtown Cairo, many wearing over their mouths yellow stickers with the Arabic word for ''enough'' written on them, to protest plans by President Mubarak to run for a fifth term.
 Yes, there is definitely something stirring out here, but it has miles to go before meaningful changes occur. It is something America should be quietly encouraging, so it is inexplicable to me that the Bush administration is holding up publication of the next U.N. Arab Human Development Report. Let me fill you in:
 In 2002, the U.N. Development Program sponsored a group of courageous Arab economists, social scientists and other scholars to do four reports on human development in the Arab world. The first one, in 2002, caused a real stir in this region -- showing, among other things, that the Arabs were falling so far behind that Spain's G.D.P. was greater than that of the entire Arab League combined. 
 That first report, published in Arabic and English, was downloaded off the Internet one million times. It was a truly incisive diagnosis of the deficits of freedom, education and women's empowerment retarding the Arab world.
 In 2003, the same group produced a second Arab Human Development Report, about the Arab knowledge deficit -- even tackling the supersensitive issue of how Islam and its current spiritual leaders may be holding back modern education. This was stuff no U.S. diplomat could ever raise, but the Arab authors of these reports could and did.
 So I eagerly awaited the third Arab Human Development Report, due in October. It was going to be pure TNT, because it was going to tackle the issue of governance and misgovernance in the Arab world, and the legal, institutional and religious impediments to political reform. These are the guts of the issue out here. I waited. And I waited. But nothing.
 Then I started to hear disturbing things -- that the Bush team saw a draft of the Arab governance report and objected to the prologue, because it was brutally critical of the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the Israeli occupation. This prologue constitutes some 10 percent of the report. While heartfelt, it's there to give political cover to the Arab authors for their clear-eyed critique of Arab governance, which is the other 90 percent of the report. 
 But the Bush team is apparently insisting that language critical of America and Israel be changed -- as if language 10 times worse can't be heard on Arab satellite TV every day. And until it's changed, the Bush folks are apparently ready to see the report delayed or killed altogether. And they have an ally. The government of Egypt, which is criticized in the report, also doesn't want it out -- along with some other Arab regimes.
 So there you have it: a group of serious Arab intellectuals -- who are neither sellouts nor bomb throwers -- has produced a powerful analysis, in Arabic, of the lagging state of governance in the Arab world. It is just the sort of independent report that could fuel the emerging debate on Arab reform. But Bush officials, along with Arab autocrats, are holding it up until it is modified to their liking -- even if that means it won't appear at all. 
 It makes you weep.

HEADLINE: Government Eases Rules on Writers in Sanctioned Nations

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
The Treasury Department, under fire for regulations that restricted the publication of works from countries under American economic sanctions, issued broad new rules yesterday that will allow United States publishers to work with authors from those countries as long as they are not government representatives.
 The new rules follow the filing of lawsuits recently against the department by publishers and an Iranian winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. The suits argued that the Treasury regulations violated the First Amendment and overstepped the laws intended to restrict economic trade with countries under sanctions.
 The countries affected by the regulations currently include Cuba, Iran and Sudan. 
 Stuart Levey, under secretary for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the Treasury Department, said in a statement that the old regulations were ''interpreted by some as discouraging the publication of dissident speech from within these oppressive regimes.''
 ''That is the opposite of what we want,'' Mr. Levey said. ''This new policy will ensure those dissident voices and others will be heard without undermining our sanctions policy.''
 Under the new rules, which are effective immediately, the range of permitted activities include ''all transactions necessary and ordinarily incident to the publishing and marketing of manuscripts, books, journals and newspapers'' in paper or electronic format, including the commissioning of new works, advance payments, augmenting of already published work with photographs or artwork, editing and publicity.
 The rules prohibit publishers from working with government representatives from countries under sanctions, although publishers can work with academic and research institutions and their employees in those countries.
 But some activities remain restricted, including the development, production and marketing of software, general marketing activities unrelated to a written publication and the operation of a publishing house or sales outlet in the designated countries.
 Lawyers representing the individuals and organizations that sued the Treasury Department said they were pleased with the new rules.
 ''This looks very good for the publishing industry,'' said Edward J. Davis, a lawyer who in September filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of the Association of American University Presses, the professional and scholarly division of the Association of American Publishers, the PEN American Center and Arcade Publishing Inc. 
 ''I think it's going to give a good deal of comfort to everyone involved with the publication of books, journals, newspapers and online material,'' Mr. Davis said.
 Philip A. Lacovara, who filed suit on behalf of Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human rights advocate and recipient of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize, and the Strothman Agency, a literary agency that sought to commission her memoir, said the new rules ''seem to unblock the kind of publication we had sought the right to pursue.''
 But both he and Mr. Davis said it was unclear as yet whether all of the concerns in their lawsuits had been fully addressed and that it was too early to say whether the lawsuits would be withdrawn. 
 Mr. Davis noted that the regulations allow publishing activities do so by granting a ''general license'' for them. The publishing companies contend in their lawsuits that the First Amendment and recent laws make publishing exempt from regulation, thereby requiring no license.
 Molly Millerwise, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, said the new regulations were not issued in response to the lawsuits. Rather, she said, the new rules are ''more of a clarification'' that the department had been considering ''since we were first asked how the regulations apply to publishing activities.''
 In late 2003 and early this year, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control issued several advisory letters saying that publishers could face legal consequences for almost any editing of manuscripts from the affected countries. Essentially, only camera-ready copies of publications could be published in the United States.
 But in April, the Treasury Department revised its ruling, saying that normal style and copy editing procedures were allowed, as was peer review of articles for scholarly publications.

HEADLINE: Other Paths to Riches in Las Vegas

BYLINE: By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
Las Vegas is not only a hotbed of gambling. Largely because of low taxes and a rapidly growing population, it is also ground zero for American entrepreneurship.
 Consider Mary Basta. For 20 years, Ms. Basta ran her specialty pastry business, the Chocolate Swan, next to a beauty salon in Elm Grove, Wis., earning a modest income. Then, about a year ago, Ms. Basta and her husband, Robert, moved the business to Las Vegas, operating two shops out of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.
 Since the move, she says, business has increased tenfold, and Ms. Basta's company has celebrities like Celine Dion clamoring for her gourmet treats, like Grand Marnier mousse and homemade caramel corn. To accommodate the growing demand for her products, Ms. Basta has had to hire a small army of workers, and plans to open several kiosks throughout the resort. 
 ''It's been a whirlwind year,'' Ms. Basta said. ''I've gone from a mom-and-pop shop to the big time.''
 Ms. Basta and her husband decided to relocate their business to Las Vegas after a friend shared some of her company's homemade chocolates, which have a European flair, with Mandalay Bay's top executives. They persuaded her to set up shop in the resort's upscale retail center, Mandalay Place. ''They told me that my products would fly off the shelves, and they were right,'' Ms. Basta said.
 What sold Ms. Basta on the idea of moving her business, she said, was that tourism in Las Vegas was booming. Indeed, the city maintains an average year-round occupancy rate of close to 90 percent in its hotels, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Tourism Authority, and convention business is growing rapidly. In the fourth quarter, for example, Las Vegas was scheduled to play host to 17 trade shows, bringing in about 387,000 visitors, up nearly 11 percent from the period last year. 
 But the city's healthy tourism industry is only one factor that is making Las Vegas the top city in the country for small- business growth. According to a new report by Sales Genie, a business and consumer marketing database operated by infoUSA that includes information from about 14 million businesses, Las Vegas had 46,170 small businesses in 1998; that number hit 73,163 in 2003, a 58.5 percent increase, the biggest increase of any metropolitan area in the country.
 At the same time, the number of small businesses in the country's top metropolitan statistical areas ranked by Sales Genie grew an average of only 18.6 percent. (The number of small businesses in New York City grew by only 12.3 percent in the period. In Buffalo, the growth rate was 0.5 percent.) 
 A pro-business environment is driving some of that growth, said Hugh Anderson, 2005 chairman of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce, and a vice president for the local branch of Merrill Lynch. Nevada has no state personal or corporate income tax, Mr. Anderson said, and energy, transportation, telecommunications and real estate costs are relatively low compared with other Western states. 
 As for labor costs, they are fairly low. For example, according to Chamber of Commerce reports, annual labor costs per employee (not counting wages) are about $4,416 in Las Vegas, compared with $5,238 in San Francisco, and $5,007 in nearby Reno. 
 Industries are increasingly attracted to Las Vegas, particularly software and biotechnology companies. A survey of 30 metropolitan areas by the Boyd Company, a New Jersey consulting firm, gives a clue why: it ranked Las Vegas as the eighth least-expensive city for a technical company with 125 workers or fewer.
 The Small Business Association Office of Advocacy in Nevada says than more than 95 percent of the state's businesses have 500 or fewer employees. As more new residents flock to the city, the number of entrepreneurs opening small retail outlets, dry cleaners and personal-services companies has skyrocketed, said Donna Hopkins, public information officer for the Nevada district office of the United States Small Business Administration. The city is gaining about 6,000 residents a month, Ms. Hopkins said, and many of them are Californians who have sold their homes in that boom market. ''These people have money to spend,'' she said. 
 In the last year alone, Ms. Hopkins said, five pet-grooming and kennel services have opened in the city, and hundreds of entrepreneurs have begun businesses out of their homes, from cleaning to personal-shopping services.
 Recently, Ms. Hopkins said, the chamber put on a workshop on starting a business that was conducted entirely in Spanish, and more than 50 women attended. Most were looking to start day-care centers out of their homes, she said.
 The population growth is what motivated Tim Atkinson to relocate to Henderson, just outside Las Vegas, from Boise, Idaho. Mr. Henderson worked as an electronics salesman in Boise, and asked for a transfer within his company to Las Vegas.
 Eager to cash in on the city's growth, he hired a business broker and last month purchased a franchise of Money Mailer, a direct-mail service. Mr. Atkinson works out of his home and said he could ''barely handle'' the number of leads he is getting. ''In the five ZIP codes in which I operate, about 300 businesses launched just this month,'' he said. 
 Most of these businesses have just a few employees, so Mr. Atkinson often finds himself making house calls to solicit customers. Last week, he said, he visited a man making custom cabinetry out of his home. He has also called on landscapers and those who operate real estate operations from home.
 ''When you drive down the street in a residential area here, you'd never realize how many businesses you were passing,'' Mr. Atkinson said.
 Susie Bramhall, president of Crayon Communications, which publishes a local magazine for entertainers and party-planning enthusiasts, said one reason her business had taken off was because it focused on the city's residents, rather than tourists. Ms. Bramhall moved to Las Vegas from Omaha about three years ago.
 ''Because the city is still relatively new, there are pockets of opportunity here that you can't find in more established areas,'' she said. Since its first year in publication, Ms. Bramhall said, her magazine has doubled its advertising pages. Many of the advertisers are new businesses themselves, she added.
 While many entrepreneurs cite economic reasons for hatching their businesses in Las Vegas, others cite benefits that are more intangible, like the warm climate and the affability of the city's residents. Jacob Hand moved to Las Vegas in September from Athens, Ohio, for family reasons. But after he saw how friendly other small-business owners were in the area, he said, he decided to start a company, In Hand Technologies, that provides software services to small companies. He had owned a similar company in Ohio.
 ''Because everybody's new here, they're a lot more receptive to being called upon,'' he said. ''They don't have a lot of established relationships yet with suppliers, so they're very friendly. Some can use my services and some can't, but I'm never turned away.''
 The situation is much different from what Mr. Hand said he experienced in Ohio. ''It was very hard to get new business there,'' he said. ''Everybody demanded to see your credentials, and frankly, many were just downright rude.''

HEADLINE: Easing the burden on thePension Benefit GuarantyCorporation will do the samefor taxpayers.

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
LAST week, I.B.M. announced that it was closing its traditional defined-benefit pension plan to new employees and instead would offer new workers a 401(k) plan.
 This is just the most recent of many such announcements by major companies. In the mid-1980's, 40 percent of workers were covered by defined-benefit plans. But those plans have become less popular in recent years, and now only 20 percent of workers are covered by such plans. 
 As the name implies, a defined-benefit plan bases its pension payment on a formula involving years of service, final salary and other considerations. The employer effectively promises workers that it will pay them some predetermined amount when they retire. 
 But pension plans and companies sometimes become insolvent. Who back ups these promises? The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was set up by the federal government 30 years ago to provide insurance for traditional pension plans. If an employer cannot pay the promised benefits, the pension agency steps in to cover the difference. In exchange for this insurance, the companies that offer traditional pension plans have to pay a fee to the agency.
 Zvi Bodie, a professor of economics and finance at Boston University, discusses some of the problems the agency faces in an article entitled ''Straight Talk about Government Pension Insurance,'' which will appear in the next issue of The Milken Institute Review.
 The agency's biggest problem is that it faces significant potential liabilities. In 2000, it showed a net balance of assets over liabilities of $10 billion. By 2004, its financial position had deteriorated to a $23.5 billion deficit. If we add in other companies covered by the agency that face significant bankruptcy risk, the deficit could reach $96 billion.
 The problem, according to Mr. Bodie, is a mismatch between the assets and liabilities of the pension plans that the agency guarantees. In a defined-benefit plan, companies promise to pay a fixed amount of money to workers when they retire. A company could be sure of having enough money available by investing in secure assets like high-grade corporate bonds.
 But bonds pay relatively low rates of interest, meaning that companies would have to set aside a substantial amount of money to meet their pension obligations. They find it much more attractive to invest in assets like stocks that have a higher expected rate of return. But high expected returns go hand-in-hand with high risk, increasing the chance of a shortfall.
 In 2003, General Motors' net pension expense was $2.6 billion. Their financial statements assumed a 9 percent rate of return on investments, which were primarily in stocks and other risky assets. If these funds were invested in bonds yielding about 6.75 percent, G.M. would have had to put away $4.2 billion that year, making its pension plan much more expensive.
 So what is wrong with assuming a 9 percent rate of return? That is a reasonable figure for the average return on the stock market -- but it is only an average. Given the historical fluctuations in the stock market, there is a reasonable chance that a stock market investment may not actually pay off enough to cover the liabilities.
 That is where the pension guaranty agency comes in. Even if the stock market drops, the workers' pensions will be covered. This means that G.M. has every incentive to invest in stocks rather than bonds: it is heads they win, tails the pension agency loses.
 As Mr. Bodie explains, there is a fundamental fallacy in pension accounting, which assumes that the ups and downs of the stock market will cancel out over time. This is not necessarily true.
 Consider a 40-year-old worker who hopes to receive a lump-sum payment of $1,000 when she retires in 20 years. If the interest rate on 20-year bonds is 5 percent, then the company will have to set aside about $377 now, which is the present value of the $1,000 obligation at a 5 percent interest rate.
 But instead of those dull bonds, the company could invest the $377 in a stock market index fund, which yields about 10 percent a year on average. After 20 years, the odds are that the company will have more than enough money to pay the $1,000, leaving itself a tidy profit, or so it seems.
 The trouble with this logic is that even though the market will probably do better than bonds on average, there is still a significant risk of a shortfall, even in the long run.
 To see this, consider how much the company would have to pay now to guarantee that it could cover its $1,000 obligation. The company would need to buy some sort of portfolio insurance that would pay off if the stock market investment fell below $1,000.
 To provide such insurance, the company could buy a put option, a contract that gives it the right, but not the obligation, to sell the pension stock portfolio for $1,000 in 20 years. If the value of the stock portfolio ends up above that amount, there is no problem. If it falls below $1,000, the pension plan would exercise the option to make good on its promise.
 How much would such an option cost today? Using standard techniques for option valuation, the price is about $125. Thus, the total cost to guarantee the $1,000 future payment turns out to be $377 plus $125, or $502. 
 So it is not so inexpensive to invest the pension in stocks after all. Either the employee runs some risk of not being paid the entire amount, or someone -- the company or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation -- has to provide the put option.
 The problem is that the pension agency has a difficult time charging the actuarially fair price for the insurance it offers. Companies that are close to bankruptcy cannot pay, and healthy companies find it more attractive to opt out of the program entirely and offer 401(k) plans instead.
 So the financial position of the pension agency continues to deteriorate. Sooner or later, Congress will probably have to step in to fix it. The sooner it can put the program on a sound financial footing, the less it will cost the taxpayers in the long run.

HEADLINE: State's Transit Network Deteriorating, Panel Says

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Michael Cooper contributed reporting from Albany for this article.

 BODY:
On the eve of a vote by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to raise fares for the second time in less than two years, a state panel warned yesterday that New York State's transportation infrastructure had begun to deteriorate and would need billions of dollars in public investment in the next five years.
 In a report titled ''Transportation -- Trouble Ahead,'' the panel warned that New York would lose jobs and see its economy falter if it did not put ''substantial, sustainable and predictable funding'' into its highways, bridges, rail network, ports, airports and mass-transit systems, of which New York City's is by far the largest.
 The report and its timing could be important matters for Gov. George E. Pataki, who holds the most sway over the authority and has been criticized for not offering new funds to close the substantial deficit in its proposed capital budget. Under Mr. Pataki and his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, the state cut subsidies for the authority's construction programs. 
 Mr. Pataki's transportation commissioner, Joseph H. Boardman, named the 12 members of the New York State Advisory Panel on Transportation Policy for 2025 in June. Over three months, they held nine public hearings throughout the state. 
 While their report avoided direct criticism of the governor, it pointedly cited the vision of two of his predecessors: DeWitt Clinton, who championed the construction of the Erie Canal in the 1820's, and Thomas E. Dewey, who supported the creation of the New York State Thruway in the 1950's. 
 ''It is essential that the state take bold and decisive action to ensure that the infrastructure of the Empire State does not slip back to the deplorable conditions of the 1980's,'' the panel wrote. 
 In interviews, panel members said they were struck by the severity of unmet needs for improvements in highways, roads and rail and bus systems. ''We tried to avoid placing blame, but clearly the Legislature and the governor are part and parcel of the problem,'' said one member, James J. McGowan, president of AAA New York State, a federation of seven automobile clubs. ''If adequate appropriations had been made, the problem that the report addresses wouldn't even exist, in both rail and road infrastructure.'' 
 Another member, Dennis J. Fitzgerald, said the report was a call to action. ''Virtually all of the panel members felt very strongly that this was not the time to produce a lukewarm report and that we should be ringing an alarm bell, basically,'' said Mr. Fitzgerald, a former executive director of the transit agency in Albany. 
 ''I don't think there's any blame to be placed right now, but if nothing is done, there will be plenty of blame to go around.''
 The Legislature and Mr. Pataki ''certainly haven't shown the kind of leadership that is demanded,'' said a third panel member, James T.B. Tripp, a lawyer for Environmental Defense, an advocacy group. He added that advocates had not articulated the need for new funds for transportation projects as clearly as they should have.
 At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Pataki was noncommittal. He said he would examine not only the authority's proposed operating budget but also its plans for construction. He added: ''We're also going to be looking at proposals from our Department of Transportation, from our other transportation entities, as to how we can do that. We will just have to look to see what we have the capacity to do, and what we're able to commit to.''
 In a statement, Mr. Boardman noted that a federal transportation bill that provided much of the state's highway spending was more than a year overdue. ''The state's dedicated transportation fund needs replenishment now,'' he said, adding that new funds would not be easy to obtain. ''Crafting new transportation investment programs under these conditions presents an enormous challenge to the state's decision makers.'' 
 Mark Hansen, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said the Senate ''recognizes that maintaining and upgrading our transportation infrastructure is critically important,'' but noted that voters rejected a $3.8 billion transportation bond issue in 2000. A spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said his staff had not seen the report but would review it. 
 The report described the growing stress on the state's transportation systems. Free-trade agreements and the growth of same-day delivery services have prompted an explosion in truck traffic. Subway ridership in New York City has steadily increased since 1992 -- spurred by the reconstruction or replacement of the system's cars, tracks and stations -- and the system has become overburdened. 
 Both the size and frequency of pavement cracks on state roads are increasing, according to the report. It cited a study last year by the American Society of Civil Engineers, which found that 37 percent of the state's bridges were deficient or obsolete and that New York drivers spent $2.3 billion a year on extra vehicle repairs and operating expenses due to unsound roads.
 Meanwhile, spending on debt service to pay off bonds for past capital projects has soared, curtailing the amount of money available for current upkeep and new expansion projects. 
 The panel found that the state's transportation system was fragmented, comprising 12 public authorities, Mr. Boardman's department, local highway departments, four major private railroads and 32 short-line railroads, among other entities.
 ''No one is truly in charge of the system as a whole,'' the report stated.
 Among other recommendations, the report called for improving downstate freight-rail service east of the Hudson River and increasing highway tolls to manage congestion and generate revenue. The full report can be found online at www.utrc2.org.

HEADLINE: Opportunity in Armenia

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Young Armenians, a Promised Land Without Promise'' (Yerevan Journal, Dec. 9) leaves the impression that young professionals in Armenia are getting ready to pack up and jump ship because of a sinking economy and a lack of opportunities.
 In fact, after significant economic liberalization, Armenia's gross domestic product grew by 13 percent in 2002 and 15 percent last year. Armenia has one of the most vibrant and fastest growing economies among the states of the former Soviet Union.
 Armenia has the only fully accredited American university in the former Soviet Union -- the American University of Armenia, which has the academic backing of the University of California system; the most sophisticated high-tech base in the region; and for good or ill, the highest growth in commercial and residential real estate.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Staten Island: Railroad Construction Begins

BYLINE: By Sewell Chan (NYT); Compiled by Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
Construction has begun on a $72 million project to reactivate the Staten Island Railroad, the city's Economic Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced yesterday. 
The eight-mile railroad, acquired by the city in 1994, will provide rail-freight access to the New York Container Terminal at Howland Hook, a waste transfer center at Fresh Kills, and other industrial sites on the west shore of the island. The terminal, reopened in 1996, is Staten Island's largest employer. Officials said the project would create 780 construction jobs and 330 permanent jobs, reduce truck traffic by 100,000 trips a year, and add $93 million in economic activity. Sewell Chan (NYT)

HEADLINE: FANNIE MAE TOLD TO REVISE PROFIT

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered Fannie Mae, the nation's largest buyer of mortgages, to restate its earnings over the last four years after concluding that it had violated accounting rules on its treatment of derivatives and loans.
 The agency's findings, announced Wednesday evening by Donald T. Nicolaisen, its chief accountant, is a huge setback for the company and its chairman and chief executive, Franklin D. Raines.
 Fannie said last month that if it was found to be in violation of the rules, it might have to report after-tax losses on its derivatives transactions of as much as $9 billion.
 Fannie Mae was created to promote home ownership. It does so by buying mortgages from banks that issue them, allowing those banks to make further mortgages and keeping interest rates low. Fannie Mae, now privately owned, has become a giant, with about $1 trillion in assets. 
 Chuck Greener, the company's top spokesman, said the decision ''will have a negative impact on our minimum capital position'' but declined to quantify it. In September, Fannie agreed to increase its capital reserve to $9.4 billion. 
 ''We are committed to taking the steps necessary to comply with our minimum capital requirement,'' Mr. Greener said, adding that the company would also abide by the decision of the chief accountant. Analysts have said that Fannie Mae could shore up its capital by selling some of its mortgage portfolio or by a securities offering.
 Mr. Nicolaisen said that the S.E.C. investigation of Fannie Mae was continuing. The Justice Department is also looking at the company's accounting.
 For Mr. Raines and his top advisers, however, Wednesday's announcement could be ominous news. Both Mr. Raines and Armando Falcon Jr., the director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which has been aggressively looking at Fannie Mae, received details about the findings in a briefing at the commission late Wednesday.
 Throughout the crisis at the company, Mr. Raines, a former budget director in the Clinton administration, has continued to enjoy the strong support of the company's board. The board retained its own lawyers, who also had not found any wrongdoing by Mr. Raines or the senior management at the company.
 But the board's confidence in Mr. Raines may now begin to erode with the findings of the commission, and particularly if it faces a significant restatement of earnings. Representative Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican who heads the House Financial Services Committee, said on Wednesday that he would hold hearings on Fannie Mae after Congress returns next month. 
 At an Oct. 6 hearing, Mr. Raines appeared confident that the company would be vindicated by the S.E.C. and that it had been the victim of overzealous regulators at Mr. Falcon's agency, known as Ofheo.
 That agency had concluded in a report a few weeks earlier that Fannie Mae deliberately violated accounting rules and engaged in ''cookie jar'' accounting, dipping into reserves or postponing the recognition of expenses. The company did this, Ofheo contended, to smooth out quarterly earnings, meet financial projections and in 1998, at least, earn larger bonuses for its top executives.
 But Mr. Raines repeatedly assured skeptical lawmakers at the hearing that Fannie Mae had complied with the accounting rules and that it would be exonerated.
 ''I want to make one thing very clear,'' Mr. Raines told the lawmakers, departing from his prepared text. If proved wrong, he said, ''our board and our shareholders will hold me accountable; I will hold myself accountable.''
 Mr. Nicolaisen's statement did not address many allegations raised by Ofheo, like irregular accounting or manipulation of expenses and earnings to earn larger management bonuses. But he concluded that Fannie Mae had violated two accounting rules: one on accounting for the costs of prepayment of loans and another on the accounting treatment of derivatives that the company has used to reduce risks to its portfolio from changes in interest rates.
 At the heart of the dispute between Fannie Mae and its regulators is a complex accounting rule, known as SFAS 133. That rule requires companies to account for derivative securities at market value but allows them to keep those changes from affecting earnings if the derivatives are used to hedge specified exposures.
 The report by Ofheo concluded that Fannie Mae rode roughshod over the rules, certifying that some hedges were ''perfect hedges'' when they were not, and in other cases treated as hedges investments that did not qualify for the treatment. In some cases, Fannie Mae's documentation of hedges was not adequate, and in other cases the documents were created retroactively, the report said.
 The statement by the chief accountant at the S.E.C. did not go into the same detail as the report by the housing regulator. But the statement appeared to support its conclusions when it noted that ''among other things, Fannie Mae's methodology of assessing, measuring and documenting hedge ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported.''
 In response to the findings of Ofheo, the company's board decided in September to increase its capital and change the way it accounts for deferring some expenses and hedging transactions, beginning in 2005. 
 Fannie Mae shares closed up 30 cents, at $70.69.

HEADLINE: To Try to Stop Sale, Yukos Files Chapter 11 in U.S.

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
The Russian oil giant Yukos sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States on Wednesday, requesting an emergency court hearing in Texas to stop the Russian government's auction of the company's largest production unit.
 Yukos filed a petition for reorganization in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Houston, where the company's chief financial officer, Bruce K. Misamore, has a residence, and where the oil company says it has assets. A judge there scheduled a hearing for Thursday morning. 
 Yukos wants the American court to stop the auction of its prize asset, Yuganskneftegas, set for Sunday in Moscow. Yuganskneftegas pumps about a million barrels a day, or 60 percent of the company's oil. 
 The unit is being sold to help cover more than $27 billion in tax claims the Russian government has lodged against Yukos over the last year -- part of a broader campaign against the company and its founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. 
 ''The steps we took today were done as a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders, employees and customers,'' Steven M. Theede, the chief executive of Yukos, said in a statement Wednesday. ''The actions by the Russian authorities appear to be expropriation 21st-century style.'' The company noted that the tax claims exceed the company's revenues for the three years in question. 
 The auction Sunday would cap a yearlong government confrontation with Yukos, which started with the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky in October 2003. Since the dispute began the company has lost $38 billion off its peak market capitalization, leaving it at about $2 billion today. 
 If the Houston judge decides that the court has jurisdiction and rules that a bankruptcy injunction known as an ''automatic stay'' applies against Yukos's creditors, bankruptcy experts said the next question would be the reach of that stay, and whether it prevents foreign creditors from seizing Yukos assets in Russia. 
 ''It's a novel and difficult question that courts have struggled with, as bankruptcy has become more international in flavor,'' said Michael L. Luskin, a bankruptcy expert and partner with Luskin, Stern & Eisler in New York. 
 Yukos has long argued that the case against it is highly politicized, and that no court in Russia would grant it bankruptcy protection from what it says is the Kremlin's campaign to unravel the company.
 In its Houston petition, Yukos argued that the court must also stop banks and international financial institutions with operations in the United States from financing the bid of Gazprom to buy assets of Yukos. 
 Yukos named as defendants the Russian Federation, the three known bidders in the Dec. 19 auction, as well as banks reportedly financing the bid by Gazprom, the widely expected winner. Among the banks named are ABN Amro, BNP Paribas, Calyon, Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. 
 Yukos's petition follows months of warnings that it was insolvent and close to bankrupt. But few here who have been following the battle between Yukos and the state believe that a court decision in the United States will stop Sunday's auction. 
 ''It would be like a Moscow court putting an injunction on the sale of Enron assets,'' said Ron Smith, an analyst at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. ''There's really going to be no effect'' from a court in the United States, he added. 
 More important, Mr. Smith said, a bankruptcy filing would help Yukos stave off its own creditors, particularly banks like Societe Generale, which lent Yukos and Group Menatep, Mr. Khodorkovsky's investment company, about $2.6 billion.
 A State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said in a statement, ''Yukos's management has the right to pursue any legal remedies it determines are in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.'' 
 ''We've expressed our concerns about the Yukos case and about its implications for the Russian economy and for Russia's reputation as a place to do business. And we've made that clear in public and in private with the Russian government, as well.'' 
 One Yukos executive, who insisted on anonymity, said the petition's motive was to embarrass the Kremlin, which is seeking to cobble together an energy giant combining some Yukos oil assets with those of Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly. 
 ''Those who take Yukos assets without permission may have to worry, because those assets could be contested in the U.S.,'' the executive said. ''It gives leverage in other jurisdictions, and makes it possible to go after bank accounts or physical assets of Gazprom,'' or banks financing its expected purchase of Yuganskneftegas. 
 Group Menatep may be setting the stage for a protracted legal battle against Gazprom after the auction. ''Menatep has a war chest to do that,'' the Yukos executive added. 
 Separately, three independent directors at Yukos -- Jacques Kosciusko-Morizet, a former vice president at Credit Lyonnais; Raj Gupta, former vice president for strategic planning at Phillips Petroleum; and Sarah Carey, a lawyer at Squire, Sanders & Dempsey in Washington -- resigned from the company's board on Wednesday.
 ''Over the past few months it has become clear that independent directors can't play the role they are supposed to play, which is engage in strategic planning for the company,'' Ms. Carey said in an interview from her Washington office. ''Basically the government is doing that. It's an illusion to pretend there is any ability to control the fate of the company.''

HEADLINE: Earnings at Wall Street Firms Help Keep a Rally Going

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose for a third day as results from Lehman Brothers bolstered optimism that profits at Wall Street brokerage firms would top estimates.
 ''Corporate earnings are right where companies wanted them, or higher,'' said Bob Basel, managing director of equity trading at Citigroup in New York. ''It's a very good sign for the economy. The market is generally in a rally mode.'' 
 Benchmark indexes climbed even as oil prices had their biggest increase in six months. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at its highest level since Aug. 3, 2001, rising 2.34 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,205.72.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,691.45, a level not seen since February. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.71 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,162.55, its highest close since June 2001.
 Lehman, the first Wall Street firm to release results, rose $2.25 to $87.90. Its fourth-quarter profit increased to $1.96 a share, lifted by trading revenue and fees from offering mergers and underwriting advice. Lehman, the nation's No.5 securities firm, was expected to earn $1.69 a share, according to the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial. Earnings in 2005 may be higher than this year, the company said.
 Morgan Stanley, which is scheduled to announce earnings on Tuesday, rose 82 cents to $55.53 a share. Bear Stearns added 41 cents to $106.20; the firm also reports Tuesday. Goldman Sachs, the world's third-biggest securities firm, will report today. Its shares dropped 63 cents to $109.25.
 Crude oil surged more than $2 a barrel after the government reported a decline in inventories of heating oil as below-normal temperatures increased demand. Oil for delivery in January climbed 2.3 percent, to $44.19 in New York.
 ''If energy prices continue to move higher, they can curtail this rally a little bit,'' said Thomas Garcia, head of trading at Thornburg Investment Management, in Santa Fe, N.M. ''The more people spend on gas, the less they have to spend on Christmas gifts and other things.''
 Energy-related shares gained as oil prices surged and Prudential Equity Group raised its ratings for Sunoco and Marathon Oil to overweight from neutral.
 Shares of Sunoco, the biggest oil refiner in the Northeast, climbed $3.64 to $84.39. Marathon advanced 53 cents to $37.55 a share.
 Sprint lost $1.08 to $24.02 a share after agreeing to buy Nextel Communications for about $35 billion, bolstering its No.3 position in the mobile telephone industry. Shares of Sprint had climbed 12 percent in the previous four trading days as investors anticipated the merger. Nextel slipped $1.29 to $28.70.
 Shares of Guidant and Veritas Software advanced amid speculation that the companies may be acquired. Guidant, the maker of devices to treat heart and circulatory ailments, gained $1.05 to $72.05. Johnson & Johnson is negotiating to pay $75 for each share of Guidant, people familiar with the talks said. Shares of Johnson & Johnson slipped 53 cents to $60.90.
 Veritas gained 73 cents to $28.11. Shares of Veritas, which makes data-storage software, have jumped 12 percent on reports that it is in talks to be acquired by Symantec for more than $13 billion. Symantec, the world's largest maker of security software, slipped 7 cents to $27.38.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 13/32, to a price of 101 14/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dipped to 4.07 percent from 4.12 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Stores Are Hoping to Do Well By Urging Shoppers to Do Good

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON; Carolyn Marshall contributed reporting from San Francisco for this article, and Rachel Thorner from New York.

 BODY:
ABC Carpet & Home is selling water buffaloes for the first time this Christmas -- $135 buys one, delivered to a village in Cambodia.
 The Gap is offering $20 teddy bears. The $20 goes toward giving 70,000 coats to poor boys and girls in North America.
 Nike, Build-A-Bear Workshop and the Discovery Channel stores are selling $1 Lance Armstrong Live Strong bracelets, to finance cancer research. The bracelets often sell out and thousands of young people are buying them on eBay, with added profit to the resellers. 
 This Christmas season, Americans are the focus of a different kind of retail marketing: kinder, gentler campaigns that appeal to the emotions as well as people's oft-stated wish to share with the less fortunate. In a weakening retail climate, the campaigns also provide a new incentive for customers to visit the stores.
 ''This is the born-again Christmas,'' said John D. Morris, a retail analyst who for the last five years has led focus groups and ''shop-alongs'' with consumers who buy more than three times a week. ''This is the first year I have seen such an outpouring of charitable feelings. And while this is not a religious thing, per se -- certainly a lot of young people buying the bracelets don't consider it one -- it does have echoes of the heartland.'' 
 It may or may not be a coincidence that a significant number of national chains have for the first time decided to involve their customers in charities, either ones the retailers supported before through corporate contributions or ones created for this holiday season.
 ''Such retail-hosted charitable events and promotions have at least tripled since 2000,'' said Craig R. Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting group in New Canaan, Conn., ''and have clearly accelerated in the past year.''
 This season, analysts noted, even the mottos are different. Last year, the Gap's holiday motto was ''Get It. Give It.'' This year, it is ''Share the Warmth.'' 
 To many young people, buying a $1 bracelet is both for charity -- and to be cool. ''My uncle died of cancer and I support it because of that,'' said Emma Katherine Willis, 11, from Providence, R.I. ''But everyone in my school has one, too, and I wanted one.'' She went to Nike, but they were sold out, ''so I went on eBay under Live Strong bracelets and I paid $5. Target has the pink ones, for breast cancer, and I want to get one of those, too.''
 The Lance Armstrong Foundation reported that 150,000 of the bracelets are sold a day. So far, the charity has sold $28 million of the $1 bracelets. ''People are looking for positive ideas to get behind,'' a spokeswoman, Michelle Milford, said. ''We gave them a really simple way.'' The foundation, which began selling the bracelets in May, has raised more money this year than in the previous several years combined, she said.
 For two days early this month, Brooks Brothers gave $50,000 to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, a charity for children with life-threatening medical conditions. Casual Corner, which is under the same ownership as Brooks Brothers, did the same. May Department Stores has a joint promotion with Disney, selling Milestone Mickey plush toys and donating $1 each to St. Jude's Children's Research. Bloomingdale's is selling ''Phantom of the Opera'' T-shirts, with 5 percent going to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.
 There are, of course, many guesses -- some of them cynical -- as to why these charitable impulses have hit the marketplace in force this Christmas.
 ''The stores haven't changed; they're the same as usual,'' said Avalon Cass Taboada, 14, an eighth grader from Killingworth, Conn., who wears her yellow rubber bracelet even to sleep. ''They're doing it because it's fashionable. And Nike does it to sell shoes.''
 Merchants, in interviews, speculated on why so many of them had decided to go to their customers for help with their favorite charities this year. It could be, they said, that after a contentious presidential election or the continuing war in Iraq, people wanted to reach out in some way. Retail analysts cited social and economic conditions that may have made some consumers feel guilty about indulging themselves.
 But Paco Underhill, a retailing consultant and the author of ''Why We Buy,'' said he thought that merchants needed a new strategy.
 ''All the merchants woke up in the 21st century to realize the old tools -- the advertising or sales promotions, the tools they taught in business school -- don't work anymore,'' he said. With their customers shopping in Wal-Mart or even in thrift shops, ''merchants are taking a step back now and asking, 'How can we more creative?'''
 The charity approach is a clever one, Mr. Underhill continued. ''The stores are hoping to wrap themselves in a mantle that distinguishes them. Just as Whole Foods has wrapped itself in the mantle of organic, chemical-free food, this season's retailers are trying to identify themselves with charity.'' He paused. ''You know, a significant part of our nation is getting older, and as people get older, they get less interested in sex and more interested in spirituality.'' 
 Mr. Johnson, the retail management consultant, said that ''partnering with leading charities allows stores to avoid the price trap of trying to match the Wal-Marts and Targets of the world, and to 'do well while doing good' -- not a bad strategy during the Christmas season.''
 Some merchants say they are just responding to a need. ''The consumer was clearly ready for that kind of guidance,'' said Paulette Cole, chief executive at ABC Carpet's $80 million-a-year home furnishings business. ''The political climate seems ready; people are looking for leadership and direction post-9/11. I really do believe there is a strong progressive movement building and that I am helping to bring it to the mainstream. Merchants can set a tone.''
 Ms. Cole, the great-granddaughter of the company's founder, this year introduced a number of charitable options including an eye operation for a child in Asia or Africa ($100); a Kid for a Kid, a dairy goat to a Haitian family ($100 or $40 for a one-third share); and one year of shelter, food and training for a 12-year-old Masai girl who refuses to submit to female genital mutilation ($1,000). 
 Ms. Cole's ABC Home and Planet Foundation chose 10 worthy causes, each sponsored by a different charity, like the American Friends Service Committee and the Rainforest Alliance. Giving these gifts through a merchant, she said, ''can take away the emptiness of these consumer dollars just sailing off into the atmosphere.'' 
 It is too soon to determine if retailers' civic-mindedness brought in more business this season than last. But in a tough shopping environment like the one now, the merchants say privately that anything might help. 
 Yet they strenuously deny that they are offering the charitable gifts and donations solely to lure people into the stores -- and, in fact, they deny that it even helps business. ''In my opinion, it does not,'' said Paul S. Pressler, chief executive of Gap Inc., the Gap's parent company. Generally speaking, Mr. Pressler said, ''the ability of companies like us to create visual symbols of giving is a way to raise civic consciousness in young America.''
 Edward W. Solczak, vice president of J.C. Penney's After School Fund, agrees. Penney, for the first year, is reaching out to customers by offering CD's by the country singer LeAnn Rimes, with the profits from the $13.99 disc to go to after-school programs. ''We don't even sell records, normally,'' he said. But Mr. Solczak conceded that the CD, which the chain is prominently advertising, might be ''an impulse item'' that will generate traffic.
 ''Listen, this is pretty transparent, isn't it?'' another top executive said, after he had just denied for publication that there were any ulterior motives in charitable promotion. Asked to explain, he said: ''We have to think of our customer first and charity second. Anything to drive business in this challenging economy is good, and if it makes everybody feel good, so much the better.''
 Even with her idealistic views, Ms. Cole said she realized that running a retail business could not be totally altruistic. ''If they can buy a beautiful couch,'' she said, as well as educate a girl for six months in Afghanistan, ''they've created a home for themselves and also provided for a few people along the way -- then these Americans will feel good.''
 And customers do seem to feel good, and, in some cases, are having fun, too. Abercrombie & Fitch has a bold charity campaign, using a half-dressed male model who poses for Polaroid pictures with giggling teenagers for $1. ( A bikini-clad employee poses with the men, but that does not seem as popular.) At the Abercrombie shop on Market Street in San Francisco, a stream of teenage girls lined up to have their pictures taken with Jared McMullen, 21, a sales clerk there. The placard behind him read, ''Feeling a bit naughty but looking to spread some Yuletide joy?'' 
 The money collected, already $250,000, will go to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation; last year, Abercrombie raised $89,000 for the whole season.
 A few nights ago, J. Crew sponsored a bring-your-dog shopping night at its Columbus Circle store, with all the proceeds to go to the A.S.P.C.A. Jeffrey Pfeifle, the president, sounded offended when asked if such an evening made money for J. Crew as well. ''No,'' he replied. ''We do it because it makes our customers feel good.'' (Speaking of pets, Petco is asking people this season to donate $1 to $20 to its Tree of Hope program. At the store in San Bruno, Calif., the money raised will go to a charity called Cats Are Truly Special, which helps injured and orphaned animals.)
 While no one knows the total that will be raised for charity through the end of the holiday season, it seems clear that it will be more than in the past. At J.C. Penney, executives predict that contributions will double. 
 The stores have already raised significant amounts because of the new programs. American Eagle Outfitters, a youth-oriented sportswear chain that is roaring with success this season, has raised more than $800,000 from the sale of its copycat rubber bracelets. In exchange for $1, American Eagle gave each donor a Great Gifts bracelet. The money went to JumpStart, YMCA National Safe Place and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada.
 The program grew out of a survey conducted by American Eagle late in September. Slightly more than 1,000 consumers, age 15 to 25, were asked about their charitable feelings as the holidays grew nearer. The survey found that while 88 percent of those surveyed liked the idea of volunteering, 41 percent had never volunteered.
 This is the first year that American Eagle has done anything with charity involving the customers and the staff; in the past, the company made contributions, the chief marketing officer, Michael James Leedy, said.
 Alla Kogan, 20, a junior at St. John's University in New York, called the $1 rubber bracelets trendy. ''I guess it's a good way to get people to donate when they normally wouldn't because they want to be part of the crowd,'' she said and then paused. ''So I guess it's a good thing that it's becoming trendy, so you're no longer the moron giving your money away to something that isn't worth it.'' 
 Ms. Kogan grinned. ''At least you're getting a little bracelet in exchange,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Mending Fences With a New Meadowlands Plan

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: LYNDHURST, N.J., Dec. 15 

 BODY:
For the better part of three decades, the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission was an easy target for local elected officials. They complained that the commission, which was created by the state, robbed them of their home rule over development; was complacent in the face of Trenton's neglect; and deprived the municipalities of new commercial developments that could ease the burden of local property taxes. 
 The seven-member commission, created 35 years ago to oversee 32 square miles of former landfill and wetlands that touched on 14 municipalities, was seen as too aggressive, not aggressive enough or oblivious and removed -- or sometimes all of those things at the same time.
 But much of that has changed in recent years, say mayors, environmentalists and planners in the region. They say a body that once seemed autocratic and austere is reaching out to build consensus. And it, in turn, is being newly described as a steward of the Meadowlands' future. 
 On Wednesday, the commission took a step that is both symbol and substance of this change when they approved a five-year program earmarking $32 million of the commission's money to aid the localities in the commission's planning area. The money will go toward grants for the municipalities, creation of an employment center and establishment of a convention and visitors bureau whose major focus will be ecotourism for the wetlands. 
 The five-year plan also calls for creation of a regional transportation planning board and a bank specializing in redevelopment that will issue bonds for projects that seek to revive and reuse old and abandoned commercial sites in the 14 towns. The plan also designates preservation areas.
 The commission was an early effort at regional planning and governance for an area that includes a half a million people. From the start, it was a daunting task in a state with a spaghetti tangle of 566 municipalities, 611 school districts, 400 local authorities and 21 counties, and in an area where home rule has been akin to a civil religion.
 ''In the past, it was like big brother watching over all of the municipalities who didn't know what was good for them,'' said State Senator Paul A. Sarlo, who represents the region and who also serves as the mayor of Wood-Ridge, a small community at the boundaries of the Meadowlands Commission territory. 
 Mr. Sarlo and others recalled times when elected officials, frustrated developers and environmentalists, who were usually antagonists in the battles over the Meadowlands, agreed on one goal: the need to abolish the commission.
 ''When you are talking to towns with 3,000 or 10,000 people, you can't be viewed as arrogant and not trustworthy, as they were viewed,'' said Fred Dressel, the mayor of Moonachie and chairman of the Meadowlands Mayor Committee, an advisory group to the commission. 
 ''It was a shotgun wedding that originally brought the towns and the commission together, but early this year we renewed our vows in a happier atmosphere,'' Mayor Dressel added, referring to the adoption in January of the first revision of the commission's master plan in 30 years. That revision stressed redevelopment of brownfields and other developed sites rather than simply adding grand, new developments. 
 The plan created 10 redevelopment zones targeted for spending inside the towns and, to the glee of environmentalists, set aside 8,400 acres for preservation.
 ''We have a seat at the table now,'' said William Sheehan, who is the Hackensack Riverkeeper. He acknowledges that in the past his group opposed all development the Meadowlands, often butting heads with aggressive developers and ratables-hungry mayors who he said ''see the environment as an asset now.'' 
 Susan Bass Levin, chairwoman of the commission, said in an interview that the commission had come a long way from the time when groups in the region could not talk to one other. Under the direction of its executive director, Robert Ceberio, the commission has worked at compromising rather than forcing things down the throats of residents. The commission also recognizes that the wetlands, which had been dumped on, literally, for years, have value. Also new was the perception of the Meadowlands as a potential economic engine for northern New Jersey, said Ms. Levin, a former state legislator and Cherry Hill mayor who is commissioner of the state Department of Community Affairs.
 ''We have an asset in the Meadowlands that requires us to think big and see it as the gateway to the Northeast,'' Ms. Levin said.
 She said the potential of the area went beyond the sports complex, with its Giants Stadium, Continental Arena, racetrack and a planned $1.3 billion retail and entertainment complex called Meadowlands Xanadu. Ms. Levin said that one of the area's benefits was its proximity the Newark port, a location that makes it easier to establish a foreign trade zone where imported goods could be stored and their parts assembled, all duty-free, before being moved on.
 Economists, planners and elected officials who participated recently in the first Meadowlands Economic Summit heard studies by Rutgers University economists and planners, who cited the possibility of 137,000 new jobs, 3,800 new housing units and 8,400 acres of preserved wetlands under the revised master plan. 
 Michael Lahr, a researcher at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Public Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, said the plan could increase employment by 70 percent and add $7.7 billion in new wages annually.
 But there is still some friction. At Wednesday's commission meeting, the mayor of Secaucus strode angrily out of the room during the public comment portion when Mr. Sheehan, the Hackensack Riverkeeper, opposed a proposed fuel depot at the town's Wal-Mart.
 Margaret Schack, a councilwoman and acting mayor of Rutherford in the 1970's, accused the commission of buying off resistance by the mayors of the surrounding municipalities with the new pool of grants.
 But Mayor James Cassella of East Rutherford said that such attitudes were ''old-school'' and a newer generation of elected officials recognized the need for balancing development with environmental preservation while at the same time building their tax bases.
 ''I could spend time fighting them and going to court and making a name for myself,'' said Mr. Cassella, who has been mayor since 1996, ''but it wouldn't solve anything. I try to explain to people in my town that if we don't do this with the commission, we will get left behind.''

HEADLINE: Let My Textiles Go

 BODY:
It sure was nice to see the United States trade representative, Robert Zoellick, joining his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts this week in signing a historic pact to increase economic cooperation between those two Middle Eastern countries. The agreement gives Egypt duty-free access to some parts of the United States textile market if those products include some Israeli content. 
So it forces Egypt and Israel to work together.
 Congress voted to authorize this arrangement back in 1996, but the three sides dawdled for eight years before signing it. At first, the Israelis complicated things by alienating the Arab world with military incursions against the Palestinians. The Egyptians, of course, were in a snit about said incursions. Then, when the two sides finally decided to sign the pact earlier this year, the Americans added their own obstacle. The Bush administration at first refused to go along, citing concerns that the proposed arrangements could hurt the eternally coddled textile and apparel companies in the United States. 
 But finally, after cutting back the number of Egyptian special trade zones that can take advantage of the agreement, the United States approved the deal, which establishes free-trade areas in Cairo, Alexandria and the Suez Canal zone. Egypt and Israel will soon begin shipping cotton underwear, knit shirts and pants to America, duty-free. The pact's signing was accompanied by the ubiquitous protests from the usual hard-liners in Cairo, voicing the usual complaints about having to work with the Zionists. We hope that they'll be drowned out when Egyptian workers see their exports -- and incomes -- increase. It's a small step for Target and Victoria's Secret, but potentially a giant step toward peace in our time.

HEADLINE: Bush Puts Social Security at Top of Economic Conference

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
President Bush opened a broad campaign for his economic agenda on Wednesday, calling for a reduction in ''frivolous lawsuits'' while his economic team laid out the arguments for overhauling Social Security and the tax code. 
 Mr. Bush said the cost of ''frivolous'' lawsuits in some cases made it ''prohibitively expensive for a small business to stay in business or for a doctor to practice medicine.'' He added: ''Those who have been hurt ought to have their day in court. But a judicial system run amok is one that makes it really hard for small businesses to stay in business.'' 
 But much of the day was devoted to the public relations campaign to replace part of the current Social Security program with a system of private savings accounts. 
 Kicking off a televised two-day conference packed with like-minded economists and business executives, Mr. Bush's economic team laid out arguments for shifting responsibility from the government to individuals and for borrowing as much as $2 trillion to cover upfront costs.
 Vice President Dick Cheney warned gravely about the looming financial problems of Social Security, declaring that ''younger people are understandably concerned'' about receiving benefits.
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow acknowledged that shifting to personal savings accounts could require an unprecedented surge of new federal borrowing and predicted that ''Wall Street would applaud'' because the government would eventually meet its long-term obligations.
 And in a separate forum on Wednesday, a top White House official ruled out the last lingering suspicion that Mr. Bush might pay for his plan by raising payroll taxes.
 White House officials said they were planning a major public campaign to sell the nation on Mr. Bush's agenda, which also includes overhauling the income tax, reducing regulation of business and restricting lawsuits brought against corporations.
 But they made it clear on Wednesday that their priority would be Social Security. Anticipating intense opposition from many quarters -- including the huge lobbying group for retired people, AARP -- administration officials are enlisting support from a wide array of outside groups.
 The outside organizations include research groups like the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute and several new groups, some financed by business groups, with names like the ''Alliance for Worker Retirement Security'' and ''Women for Social Security Choice.''
 The conference on Wednesday served to preview many of the themes Mr. Bush is likely to invoke as he tries to sell the nation on his economic agenda.
 On overhauling the income tax, a panel of experts handpicked by the White House called for a system that would primarily tax consumption -- the money people actually spend rather than income from savings and investment.
 Administration officials strongly suggested that Mr. Bush had already decided on the main elements of his major initiatives.
 In overhauling the tax code to make it ''simpler and fairer,'' Mr. Bush plans to appoint a bipartisan commission later this month that will submit proposals to the Treasury Department.
 But Robert Nichols, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, said Mr. Bush would give the panel ''very specific instructions on what he wants'' and expect a set of recommendations by ''early next year.''
 The plans for Social Security are even clearer, because Mr. Bush already has three separate recommendations from a commission he appointed in 2001. 
 ''Social Security will be first, because that is where the momentum is,'' predicted Brian Wesbury, chief economist for an investment firm in Chicago and a participant in the White House conference.
 But Mr. Bush faces formidable opposition from Democrats and many powerful lobbying groups, as well as skittishness among some Republican lawmakers about voting for cuts in future retirement benefits.
 AARP charged earlier this week that Mr. Bush's plan for private accounts would undermine Social Security and put future generations of retirees at great economic risk.
 ''Just to switch to this new system could require as much as $2 trillion or more in benefit cuts, new taxes or more debt,'' declared William Novelli, the association's chief executive, in a statement shortly before the White House conference got under way. ''Most of us would then have to pay twice as much to gamble on this new plan.''
 Administration officials acknowledge that their plan would require unprecedented borrowing, because payroll tax revenues would plunge immediately, while government benefits to retirees would decline gradually over several decades.
 But administration officials said the long-term savings would more than make up for the transition costs, leaving the government in much better shape after 50 or 60 years. 
 ''If we fix Social Security, we'll reduce the long-term outlays and be able to finance the short-term transition costs,'' Mr. Snow said in an interview with Bloomberg News. ''The financial markets, the capital markets, the bond market, Wall Street will applaud the action.''

HEADLINE: Trade Data Show Another Record Deficit

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
The broadest measure of the country's trade and investment flows registered a record deficit of $164.7 billion in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
 With no relief in sight, some of the United States' closest allies are pressing the administration to take serious steps to rein in the trade and budget deficits that are propelling a decline in the dollar. The fall of the dollar, in turn, is hurting other countries' economies.
 Economists hope that the declining value of the dollar will narrow the trade gap. But so far, the deficit has only deepened, with the nation's imports exceeding its exports by 54 percent in the third quarter. 
 Based on the first three quarters, the United States is adding to its foreign debt at a record annual rate of $665 billion, or $5,500 for every household in the country, according to a new report by Josh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a research group.
 The report could have been worse. Many economists predicted that the third-quarter deficit could have been as much as $171 billion.
 The lower figure in the report prompted a rally by the dollar in currency markets on Thursday. But economists said this would have no effect on the overall economic forecasts that predict that the current-account deficit will rise about $100 billion a year for the indefinite future.
 ''There is a lag effect in the drop in the value of the dollar, so I expect the U.S. exports will be less expensive soon,'' said Claude Barfield, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a research group. ''But people are skeptical about the president's record to bring about the longer range turnaround of decreasing the federal deficit.''
 The one bright spot in Thursday's report was an increase of $9.6 billion in net foreign direct investment flows into this country, a ''big and welcome swing'' after a decrease of $22.7 billion in the second quarter, said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, a global markets research group in Valhalla, N.Y.
 American allies expressed their growing frustration with Washington this week, saying that the United States' economic problems were dragging down their own economies. Canada, Japan and the Europeans warned that the inability of the United States to stabilize its trade deficits and halt the dollar's slide threatened not only their economic well-being but the global economy as well.
 Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, one of Mr. Bush's closest European allies, raised the issue with him in a White House visit on Wednesday. Mr. Bush said that he understood the seriousness of the currency issue for the Europeans and said that he would work with Congress to cut what he called the short-term budget deficit and push his plan to change Social Security.
 The trade deficit, Mr. Bush said, is ''easy to resolve.''
 ''People can buy more United States products if they're worried about the trade deficit,'' he said.
 Economists had hoped that a falling dollar would strengthen exports and at least stabilize the trade deficit. But the imbalance has continued to grow, with American consumers buying exports from Europe and Asia, feeding those economies, while European and Asian banks are underwriting American debt.
 Japan and Europe could help by stimulating their economies to grow faster and buy more United States imports, as Mr. Bush said.
 But the biggest foreign stumbling block is China, which has continued to peg its currency to the dollar, letting the pain of the dollar's decline fall hardest on the Europeans and Canadians. China, one of 
 the world's most competitive economies, has become even more competitive by refusing to revalue its currency or let it float.
 ''The U.S. will be in a much better position to demand that the Europeans grow faster and the Chinese revalue their currency if the U.S. did something to deal with its underlying problem,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director for the Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington. ''But that means attacking some sacred cows, and I don't know if the president is ready to do that yet. 
 ''If he doesn't, then the dollar tanks, interest rates soar, the economy weakens and his own agenda is at stake,'' Mr. Bergsten added.
 A recent European Central Bank report said the United States' current-account deficit was a threat to the global economy, echoing concerns expressed all year by the International Monetary Fund. Rodrigo de Rato, the managing director of the monetary fund, recently said, ''This large imbalance is a risk not only for the United States economy but for the world economy.''
 But the Bush administration has rejected any idea of intervening on behalf of the dollar or organizing a conference to negotiate a foreign currency agreement with Japan, China and Europe to address the dollar's fall.
 Mr. Bush said this week that investors would determine the value of the dollar.

 BODY:
The United States, Europe and Arab countries are considering greatly increasing -- maybe even doubling -- aid to the Palestinians on condition that they and Israel take certain steps toward reducing their conflict, American and Palestinian officials say.
 A four-year package of $6 billion to $8 billion would be forthcoming, they said, if the Palestinian elections set for Jan. 9 occurred successfully and if the new government cracked down on militant groups and Israel lifted scores of roadblocks and checkpoints to ease the transit of goods and people in Palestinian areas.
 The possibility of an aid increase was the subject of intense discussions at a donors meeting on Dec. 8 in Oslo. According to participants, the aim of the meeting was to help moderate Palestinian leaders after the death of Yasir Arafat and to prepare for the fulfillment of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's decision to pull settlers and forces out of the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank. 
 The World Bank says the package, which would come from the United States, the European Union, Arab states and other donors, would be the largest per person international aid program since World War II. 
 The Palestinians are already the world's largest per capita recipients of international aid, getting about $1 billion for 3.5 million inhabitants, or nearly $300 per person. The contemplated aid package would increase that amount by 50 to 100 percent. 
 To support the new Palestinian leaders and send a signal to European and Arab leaders to step up their own aid programs, the United States announced in Oslo that it would add to the $200 million it contributed indirectly to the Palestinians this year by channeling another $20 million directly to the Palestinian Authority.
 ''What you are seeing is a new effort to coordinate with Europeans and the Palestinians on these issues,'' said a senior Bush administration official. ''The question is whether it will be possible after the Palestinian elections to reorganize Palestinian forces and get them to restore order. The answer so far has been no. But now there is a chance.'' No pledges were sought at Oslo, participants said. Instead the discussion focused on what aid might be realistic. 
 ''We are looking at the possibility of another $500 million a year or more, but it has to be in the context of conditions permissive to a much deeper development effort,'' Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian finance minister, said in a telephone interview from Qatar. ''That cannot happen unless conditions on the ground improve substantially.''
 Other officials said the target was an additional $500 million to $1 billion a year. Despite the large aid amounts in recent years, economic conditions have deteriorated and a lot of the financing was deemed wasted. Donors have complained of poor accounting practices.
 A large portion of the financing in recent years has gone not for development but to help the Authority meet its payroll of 130,000 employees -- a major jobs program that has prevented destitution for more than a million Palestinians.
 Donors have been increasingly unhappy that so much of their money has gone to keep the Palestinian Authority afloat, and not to long-term economic improvement, but they say that Mr. Fayyad has instituted reforms improving accountability and increasing tax collections. 
 ''He's taken a number of measures establishing tighter control over public finance,'' said Nigel Roberts, the World Bank's director for the West Bank and Gaza. ''But donors are also able to see that all their spending over the last four years has yielded very little, and they want to exercise some leverage over the situation.''
 Mr. Fayyad said the Palestinian uprising of the last four years, and the Israeli response of sending forces throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip had combined to devastate the economy. ''We've had an existence of hand to mouth, all kinds of arrears, late payments, a miserable existence,'' he said. ''We've been so preoccupied with cash management, it has been hard to focus on improving our economic infrastructure.''
 European and Arab donors are likely to call on the United States to pay more attention to their views in peace talks as they demand a say in return for their increased donations.
 The Palestinians have already started courting Arab countries for the money. This week Mr. Fayyad has been accompanying Mahmoud Abbas, who succeeded Mr. Arafat as chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization and is on a tour of Gulf countries, some of which have not come through on past pledges.
 Mr. Fayyad and Mr. Abbas, the leading candidate for Palestinian Authority president, are arguing that Arab countries can afford to be more generous because of high oil prices. In an important gesture to one donor nation, Mr. Abbas has also apologized to Kuwaiti leaders for Mr. Arafat's failure to denounce Iraq's invasion of their country in 1991. 
 ''If you have those things in place, plus improved internal governance by Palestinians, then you can legitimately go to the donor community and say, 'Maybe your $1 billion a year hasn't produced much, but we think there's a case for doing even more in the next three or four years,''' said Mr. Roberts of the World Bank.
 ''This is going to require a huge push for the donor community,'' he said, adding that while the Palestinians had instituted many reforms, many more were needed to establish the rule of law and eliminate payoffs and corruption.
 As for Israel's myriad checkpoints and roadblocks in the West Bank, the Bush administration has long been pressing Israel to remove them to make the coming elections easier to conduct. But Israeli leaders plan to do so for only a three-day period before the voting.
 A senior Bush administration official said Mr. Abbas's attempts to negotiate a cease-fire by Palestinian militant groups during the campaign period was welcome but must be followed by a genuine crackdown after the elections.
 ''Cease-fires are not the answer,'' the official said. ''But if the Israelis react to the Palestinian cease-fire by easing conditions, and the Palestinians react to that by getting control of security, you can have a kind of virtuous circle that has to be a step forward.''
 Some European leaders, anticipating increased leverage as European financing for the Palestinians increases, are pressing Israel and the Palestinians to start talking soon about difficult issues like Jerusalem, the boundaries of a Palestinian state and the status of refugees.
 The Bush administration and Mr. Sharon's government want those issues put off until the Palestinians show more progress against terrorism. ''We're trying to maintain a united front with the Europeans,'' the senior administration official said, ''and I think we've succeeded on that. We can achieve a solution by keeping our eyes focused on realistic goals and not talking about pie in the sky.''

HEADLINE: A Weekend With the Fishes

BYLINE: By EVE GLASBERG

 BODY:
BEFORE the crack of dawn on Thursdays and Fridays, hours before even the most devoted weekend-home owner has revved up the engine and charged toward the country, another band of getaway fanatics is already streaming out of town. They are weekend scuba divers, enthusiasts who think nothing of lugging 30 pounds of dive gear, along with the rest of their bags, onto a plane and heading to the Caribbean for as many underwater hours as they can cram into two or three days.
 As early as lunchtime, some of them will be performing underwater minuets with iridescent confetti-colored reef fish in coral gardens. By Monday or Tuesday, they'll be homeward bound, and it will be nose to the grindstone soon thereafter.
 Can it really be worth the trouble? 
 ''Absolutely,'' said Whitney Wilson, a freelance film distributor based in Manhattan who dives at every opportunity she has. ''Obviously, a longer trip is preferable, but these quick fixes keep me going. You can plan them at the last minute, and it's the perfect way to get a midwinter break.''
 Whirlwind diving weekends have long had devotees, but now they may be more popular than ever. ''The scuba market is riding the same wave as the rest of the travel industry,'' said Mary Kaye Nesbit, a promotion specialist at PADI Travel Network, a travel wholesale service and affiliate of the Professional Association of Diving Instructors. ''We're seeing more people taking shorter, spur of the moment trips. Turnaround dive weekends reflect that larger trend.''
 PADI Travel Network organizes dive weekends to Cozumel in Mexico, to the Cayman Islands, to Key Largo and Key West in Florida and to the Bahamas, primarily Nassau on New Providence Island and Freeport on Grand Bahama Island. The Cozumel packages are $1,000 to $1,200, for air fare from New York, hotel, diving, taxes and transfers; trips to the Bahamas and the Keys generally are $700 to $900.
 Peter Miklatek, a travel coordinator for Pan Aqua, a diving shop with branches in Manhattan and Brookfield, Conn., is also aware of the trend. ''Weekend dive trips to the Caribbean are very much in demand,'' he said. So much so that although Pan Aqua runs longer dive trips to destinations as far as Truk Lagoon of Micronesia and the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, its weekend trips account for 70 percent of its travel business. The shop's specialty is four-nighters to scuba spots like the island of Bonaire, the Caymans and Cozumel. (Its Grand Cayman package is $1,329 a person for air fare, hotel, diving, transfers and taxes; Curacao is $1,599.)
 Mr. Miklatek said that four nights is the perfect length for a long diving weekend, partly because to prevent decompression sickness, divers customarily wait 24 hours after the last dive before flying -- time for nitrogen built up in the bloodstream to dissipate. ''Friday to Sunday is tough because you won't reach your destination until midday, so you've probably already missed the boat taking divers to the dive site,'' he said. ''If you're locked into such a short time frame, pick a place that has shore dives, like Bonaire. You could dive Saturday morning, but not that afternoon because of the 'no flying after diving' rule.''
 With four nights, he said, ''you get three solid days of diving.''
 Like skiing, scuba diving is an expensive, gear-intensive sport. In the hobbyist stage, many divers buy a mask, snorkel and fins, and then rent the rest of their equipment. But as they get more experience and develop a passion for the underwater world, most buy much more -- their own regulators, gauges, buoyancy compensators, dive computers and the like. Getting all that gear from Point A to Point B is a major burden for just a weekend of diving, but some scuba lovers are more than willing to cope with it.
 Ms. Wilson hauls her heavy scuba gear, yet insists that ''these weekends are a breeze for me.''
 ''I keep a checklist handy of what I need to pack,'' she said, ''which is very little other than dive gear -- you're going somewhere warm, plus you're underwater most of the time. I throw it into a bag with wheels, hop on the plane, and I'm diving a few hours later.''
 She has taken brief dive trips to Nassau, Grand Cayman and Key Largo through Scuba Network, a chain of dive shops in New York, New Jersey and Florida, and has liked the way the trips were organized. ''I'm a single traveler, and I find solo trips boring, so I love the camaraderie of these weekends,'' she said. ''I've made lasting friendships on them with divers who I would travel with in the future. If, on the other hand, I'm exhausted after an intense day of diving and need time alone, I can have dinner on my own.''
 These weekend trips can be done on the cheap or for buckets of money. The easiest, most economical option is to sign up for a group package trip with a dive shop or a diving club.
 Fort Lauderdale trips organized by Scuba Network cost $499 a person for three nights at a hotel, three days of boat diving (featuring an introduction to wreck diving), tanks and weights, taxes, and transfers. Air fare is extra.
 AT the other end of the spectrum is a stay at one of the Caribbean's upscale resorts. Four nights for two at Palm Island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, for example, including meals but not air fare, is $3,520. Diving is extra; a five-dive package is $265 a person.
 For the same money, divers could choose a longer trip on a live-aboard boat, visiting the reefs and walls in the Red Sea or the Coral Sea -- if they had time. But time is exactly the point.
 Perhaps the biggest pitfall of a weekend trip is that with time so limited, there is little opportunity to make up for a bad day. If you end up spending hours at the airport because of a delayed flight or a missed connection, or there's inclement weather at your destination, you might end up doing very little diving, or none at all, before it's time to turn around and head home.
 Christopher Hunt, a magazine editor in New York, recalled a disastrous dive weekend to Nassau that he and a friend endured several years ago. ''For starters, we didn't like the hotel,'' he said. ''On our first day of diving, the water was so choppy that it threw me into the boat ladder while I was climbing back on board after a dive, and I got a nasty cut on my leg. After that, all diving was canceled due to a tropical storm. Worst of all, there was no refund.''
 A later trip to Aruba was more successful. Mr. Hunt took his dive gear along on a business trip and enjoyed time on a reef among the morays and the anemones.
 Some tour operators try to cut the diver's risk of a disappointing dive weekend.
 ''We usually have enough advance warning about storms and hurricanes to cancel a trip,'' said Scott Sirkin, operations manager of Scuba Network's New York stores. ''But if divers on a Scuba Network trip miss dives because of bad weather, we'll issue refunds or vouchers so that those dives can be applied toward a future trip.''
 Mike Kelin, a New York cabinetmaker, has had no such bad luck on his diving weekends. His first foray to Fort Lauderdale was last summer; he returned this fall with his girlfriend and is planning to go again in February.
 ''These trips are totally worth it for me,'' he said. ''I can easily spend several hundred dollars on a night out in New York. Double that, and look what I get -- the chance to get away to a new environment for a few days, where I can dive and have a ball.''

FLY AND DIVE
Organized Trips Put Warm Waters Within Easy Reach
 EAGER scuba divers can usually find several scheduled weekend trips from New York to the Caribbean, typically sponsored by dive shops and scuba clubs.
 The PADI Travel Network (800-729-7234, ext. 2; www.padi
.com), a travel wholesaler and an affiliate of the Professional Association of Diving Instructors, runs weekend packages from New York to the Bahamas and the Florida Keys for $700 to $900 a person; its trips to Cozumel, Mexico, are $1,000 to $1,200. The prices cover air fare, hotel, diving, taxes and transfers; meals are extra.
 Similar packages from Pan Aqua (800-434-0884, www.panaqua.com), a dive shop in New York and Brookfield, Conn., include trips to Grand Cayman on Jan. 13 to 17, for $1,329 a person, and Curacao on Feb. 17 to 21, for $1,599.
 Scuba Network (954-946-9595, www.scubanetwork.com), a chain of dive shops, arranges trips to several destinations, including three days of boat diving off Fort Lauderdale, Fla., at $499 a person with three nights at a hotel, diving, tanks and weights, taxes and transfers. Air fare is extra. Trips are currently scheduled for Jan. 29 to Feb. 1 and for April 21 to 24; others will be added. The Fort Lauderdale trips accept beginners.
 ''We have a lot of clients who want to learn how to dive in preparation for, say, the honeymoon to Fiji,'' said Scott Sirkin, operations manager of the company's New York stores. ''So they do their course work and pool work with us in New York'' and then complete open-water certification in Fort Lauderdale.
 For those making their own travel plans, it's worth combing through the ads and the travel columns in magazines like Scuba Diving, Sport Diver and Dive Training. Last-minute deals can sometimes be found online at Web sites like www.aquadreams.com and www.ultimatedivetravel.com.
 A typical do-it-yourself arrangement would be to book through Caradonna Caribbean Tours (800-328-2288, www.caradonna.com) for three nights at Casa del Mar, a dive resort in Cozumel. Including all meals, four boat dives and unlimited shore diving, taxes and transfers, the cost is $326 a person in January and $377 in February and March. Air fare is not included.
 Using Orbitz, the lowest round-trip air fare between New York and Cozumel over the Martin Luther King's Birthday holiday weekend, Jan. 14 to 17, is $568 a person; for Presidents' Day weekend, Feb. 18 to 21, the price rises to $658.
 A luxurious option is a four-nighter at Young Island (www.youngisland.com; 800-223-1108), a private island resort in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The daily rate of $745 is for two people and includes accommodation in a luxury suite with a private plunge pool, breakfast and dinner; taxes and transfers are extra. From Feb. 28 to March 31, the rate drops to $690. Diving is not included but can be booked through Dive St. Vincent (www.divestvincent.com; 784-457-4928). Using Orbitz, the lowest round-trip air fare from New York over the King weekend is $644 per person; over President's Day weekend, it's $709.
 Newcomers should be wary of choosing a destination on the basis of direct flights. ''Some of the best places for diving in the Caribbean -- Cozumel, Bonaire, the Caymans -- are serviced only through connecting flights,'' said Peter Miklatek, a travel coordinator for Pan Aqua. ''It's an inverse relationship. You have to work harder to get to the top scuba spots.''

HEADLINE: Jobs Seem Better, Housing Worse

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
First-time claims for unemployment benefits posted the sharpest drop in three years last week, but starts of new housing plunged in November, the most in nearly 11 years, government economic data showed Thursday. 
 The Labor Department reported that initial jobless-benefit claims dropped in the week ended Saturday to 317,000, the lowest level since July, Wall Street economists had expected a dip to 340,000. 
 Patrick Fearon, an economist with A.G. Edwards, said this ''brings the claims number back down to a level that's really very positive.'' 
 The Commerce Department reported that housing starts dropped 13.1 percent last month, the steepest fall since a 17 percent drop in January 1994. Housing starts slid to an annual pace of 1.771 million units in November from an upward revised pace of 2.039 million units in October. 
 Economists had expected only a slight easing, and some saw the report as a sign of brewing trouble in the housing sector, an engine of economic strength in recent years. 
 Building permits for future activity were less disappointing, falling 1.5 percent, to a 1.988 million unit pace. 
 Housing starts were down 14.2 percent in the Northeast, 19.4 percent in the Midwest, 13.2 percent in the West and 10.4 percent in the South.

HEADLINE: In Minutes, Fed Talks of Maintaining Discipline

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers wrestled with the best way to foreshadow the course of short-term interest rates at their November meeting, according to minutes released Thursday.
 After each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy, members release a brief statement on their interest rate decision and their thoughts on economic conditions, which are analyzed by investors for insight into the Fed's next monetary policy move. The minutes of each meeting are made public about six weeks later. 
 In November, some members said decisions on interest rates would probably become increasingly dependent on what economic data said about the prospects for economic activity and inflation, the minutes said.
 ''This might imply a more gradual path of tightening going forward than that of the last several months, or it might mean that the committee on occasion would need to firm policy more rapidly,'' the minutes said.
 At that November meeting, as well as at the committee's meeting on Tuesday, the Fed chose to stick with its gradual approach to raising rates. 
 At both meetings, the Fed decided to increase a crucial short-term interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Tuesday's rate increase was the fifth this year. It left the federal funds rate at 2.25 percent. Early this year it stood at a 46-year low of 1 percent before the Fed began its string of rate increases in June.
 The funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other on overnight loans, is the Fed's main tool for influencing economic activity in the United States. At the November meeting, Fed policy makers offered mixed opinions on the extent to which their ideas about the course of future monetary policy should be communicated to the public.
 ''A few members felt that because of greater uncertainties, it might become appropriate eventually to move away from the recent practice of providing guidance about the likely future path of policy, while others emphasized the desirability of continuing to be as informative as possible about the committee's perceived outlook,'' the minutes said.
 In the end, most members at the November meeting agreed that the language in the post-meeting statement provided ''considerable flexibility with regard to the committee's future actions and that market participants understood that flexibility.''

HEADLINE: The Great Powers of Europe, Redefined

BYLINE: By Timothy Garton Ash. 
Timothy Garton Ash, a fellow of St. Antony's College, Oxford, and the Hoover Institution at Stanford, is the author, most recently, of ''Free World: America, Europe and the Surprising Future of the West.''

DATELINE: Oxford, England 

 BODY:
LAST week I stood among flag-waving demonstrators in Independence Square in Kiev and heard the leader of Ukraine's ''orange revolution,'' Viktor Yushchenko, triumphantly declare that Ukraine was a European country. Not Western, not merely democratic, and obviously not American -- European. 
 Yesterday in Brussels, the leaders of the 25 member states of the European Union agreed to open negotiations with Turkey next year to join the union. Mr. Yushchenko, meanwhile, who will probably be elected president on Dec. 26, is also expected to seek a promise of eventual membership in the European Union for Ukraine soon after his inauguration. 
 These two large, poor states on the edge of Europe will pose a huge challenge to the adaptive capacity and internal coherence of the political, economic and security community that is the European Union. But their desire to become part of the union is a tribute to the magnetic power of a body that American policymakers have dangerously underrated in the last four years.
 There are signs that in his second term, President Bush is preparing to take the European Union more seriously as a union -- not just a collection of diverse states from which Washington can pick and choose its allies. This is a welcome development, since only by working together can the United States and the European Union hope to surmount the challenges that face these twin heirs to the Enlightenment in today's dangerous world.
 The most immediate challenge, of course, is terrorism. And one could make a strong case that the European Union's agreement to open membership negotiations with Turkey will be a bigger contribution to winning the war on terrorism than the American-led occupation of Iraq.
 Iraq is now a bloody playground for existing groups of Islamist terrorists -- and probably a breeding ground for new ones. The European Union's offer to Turkey, by contrast, sends a clear signal that Europe is not an exclusive ''Christian club,'' that the West is engaged in no crusade, and that a largely Islamic society can be reconciled not only with a secular state but also with the rules and customs of modern liberal democracy.
 It is also significant that the European Union's offer has been made to a Turkish government headed by a devout Muslim, Prime Minister Recip Tayyip Erdogan, who was jailed just five years ago for publicly reciting a poem containing the lines, ''The mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets, and the faithful are our warriors.'' Mr. Erdogan is now doing everything in his power to meet what Turks call ''European standards.''
 Why is it that Americans do not understand the power of the European Union? Is it because they are simply not well informed by reports from Brussels and other European capitals? Or is it because, as citizens of the world's last truly sovereign nation-state, Americans -- and especially American conservatives -- find it difficult to acknowledge the contribution of a transnational organization based on supranational law? It's as if they can conceive of power only in the old-fashioned terms of a classical nation-state.
 Robert Kagan describes the difference between America and Europe as the difference between power and weakness -- American power, that is, and European weakness. This description is sustainable only if power is measured in terms of military strength. In the way that some American conservatives talk about the European Union, I hear an echo of Stalin's famous question about the Vatican's power: how many divisions does the pope have? But the pope defeated Stalin in the end. This attitude overlooks the dimensions of European power that are not to be found on the battlefield.
 In economic power, the European Union is the equal of the United States: the combined gross domestic product of the union's 25 member states is some $11 trillion at current exchange rates, about the same as the G.D.P. of the United States. American business has long recognized the importance of the European market, and it is also beginning to understand the influence of its regulators. Three years ago the union blocked the merger of two American companies, General Electric and Honeywell -- after American regulators had already approved the deal.
 The European Union is also strong in a less tangible kind of power -- what is known as ''soft power.'' The European way of life, its culture and societies, are enormously appealing to many of its neighbors. Meanwhile, the policies of the Bush administration have prompted a wave of hostility toward America around the world, while its security measures have made it more difficult for foreigners to study or work in the United States. So Europe may currently have a comparative advantage in the exercise of soft power, if only temporarily.
 Yet the most distinctive feature of European power is a fourth dimension -- one that the United States wholly lacks. It is the power of induction. Put very simply: the European Union is getting bigger, and the United States is not. Haiti cannot hope to follow Hawaii into the American union, and even an American territory like Puerto Rico faces resistance in becoming the 51st state. But Ukraine can hope to follow Poland into the European Union.
 AS we have seen across central and eastern Europe, and now in the Balkans and in Turkey, countries that wish to join the European Union are prepared to make profound changes to their economic, social, legal and political systems in order to qualify. Indeed, in the run-up to accession, the union has intervened extensively in the affairs of candidate states, but it has done so with the consent of their democratically elected governments. This is regime change, European-style.
 The history of the European Union can be told as a story of the expansion of freedom: from the original six postwar democracies in western Europe; to 12 member states, including three former dictatorships in southern Europe; to 25, including many of the former Communist states of central and eastern Europe; and now on to the Balkans, Turkey and, one day, Ukraine. 
 It can't go on forever, obviously. If Europe is everywhere, it will be nowhere. So the European Union must decide what to offer neighbors that cannot be members. But for now, the European power of induction is working its magic on the streets of Kiev and Istanbul.
 ''The wisest use of American strength is to advance freedom,'' President Bush has said. Yet by overlooking the true dimensions of European power, America is failing to recognize the potential of what could be its greatest ally in the most hopeful project of our time: the advancement of liberty around the world.

HEADLINE: States' Pocketbooks Are Fuller, But Health Costs Stall Recovery

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
The fiscal condition of the states improved this year, but soaring health costs have made it difficult for them to recover from the worst fiscal crisis in six decades, the National Governors Association said Thursday.
 States ended the 2004 fiscal year with balances totaling $25.3 billion, equal to 4.8 percent of state spending. That represents a significant increase from the previous year, when balances totaled $16.4 billion, or 3.2 percent of state spending. 
 Such balances provide a financial cushion for states, with a 5 percent cushion considered healthy. Twenty-three states had balances of 5 percent or more, up from 12 in 2003.
 A recession in 2001 sharply reduced state revenues for two years. Now, the governors said, tax collections are more stable -- but still not sufficient to pay for the growth of Medicaid and other health costs.
 ''We have just come through a tremendously difficult fiscal period,'' said Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the governors association. ''The light at the end of the tunnel is beginning to appear, but unfortunately it's a long tunnel.'' 
 Scott D. Pattison, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, echoed that view. The latest nationwide survey showed ''relative improvement from the fiscal malaise of the past few years,'' Mr. Pattison said, but ''the states' fiscal situations will remain difficult for the foreseeable future.''
 Spending from state general funds -- the pots of money not earmarked -- increased by 3 percent this year, to $523.5 billion, after two years of hardly any growth. 
 Despite the signs of a recovery, states are keeping a tight lid on spending, and nine states reported a decline in general fund spending from 2003 to 2004. They were Alaska, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin.
 One mystery of the last recession is why welfare rolls continued to decline even as unemployment increased. States have poured money into education, training and child care to help welfare recipients get and keep jobs. Forty-four states said they would maintain cash assistance benefits in 2005 at the levels in effect this year. Five states -- California, Illinois, Michigan, South Dakota and Texas -- said they planned to increase cash assistance benefits next year, while West Virginia said it was planning a substantial cut.
 Collections of sales, personal income and corporate income taxes equaled or exceeded projections in 45 states this year. But, the report said, revenues came in lower than expected in five states: Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Oregon.
 States had two favorite sources of new revenue. They increased cigarette and tobacco taxes by a total of $888 million, and they approved sales tax increases totaling $710 million.
 In 2002, the governors association reported that ''nearly every state is in fiscal crisis,'' with the worst budget problems since World War II.
 Congress provided $20 billion in fiscal relief to the states last year. But the aid expired in June, and Congress has no plans to renew it.

HEADLINE: Guyanese Immigrants Cautious About Being Labeled

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Even if the welcome mat has not always been rolled out, immigrants have usually found their first foothold in the neighborhoods of their more established ethnic soul mates.
 Irish-brogue newcomers moved into already cloverleafed enclaves of the northwest Bronx, off-the-boat Italians went into a Bensonhurst of homes adorned with front-yard Madonnas, and Soviet Jewish refugees found shelter among the knish parlors of Brighton Beach. 
 But such an easy osmosis does not always happen. One group of newcomers that has ended up living quite apart from its more established forerunners are the Indians who came to the United States not directly from India but from Guyana, on the northern coast of South America, and other parts of the Caribbean. 
 These Indo-Caribbeans have not felt particularly embraced by the more flourishing Indian communities of Flushing and Elmhurst in Queens, nor have they made many overtures to the Indians. Instead they have cobbled together their own fragrant neighborhood of roti, saris and gold jewelry shops among the row houses of Richmond Hill, Queens. 
 ''From my experience, we're not Indian,'' said Latchman Budhai, 56, the former president of the Maha Lakshmi Mandir, a Hindu temple in Richmond Hill whose members are almost all Guyanese-Americans. ''We look like Indian, but we're not Indian.''
 The comparative chasm between two kindred communities tells volumes about the complex history of Diaspora Indians. It also tells a lot about the general tango of sensitivities between longer-rooted immigrants and their raw cousins. 
 Historians, for example, have noted how, during the late 19th century, some German Jews, a comfortable generation removed from Europe, kept less-polished Jewish arrivals from Eastern Europe at a condescending arm's length, although many created the institutions that helped the newcomers assimilate.
 Similarly, Cubans who fled the island in 1959 when Fidel Castro took power were sometimes less than welcoming to the refugees of the 1980 Mariel boatlift.
 ''Certainly the major impulse is to help the less fortunate parts of the community,'' said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York. ''But, at the same time, people giving help are the more assimilated, whereas people who need help are at the bottom and don't have the prestige and status. There's more of a tendency of the more established people wanting to distinguish themselves from the newcomers.''
 Some Guyanese talk with hurt about not quite being accepted as Indian. Mr. Budhai recalled how in 1978, his wife, Serojini, won an Indian beauty pageant but was never awarded the top prize, a trip to India, after the organizers learned she was Guyanese. 
 Still, some Indians think the chill is exaggerated. Uma Sengupta, a native Indian who is a Democratic leader in the 25th Assembly district, said the distance simply represents an encounter of two very different cultures. ''Even if they don't mix, that doesn't mean they look down,'' she said.
 Most Guyanese, and the smaller number of Trinidadians in Richmond Hill, are descendants of Indians who were brought over to the Caribbean starting in 1838 as contract laborers on sugar plantations after slavery was outlawed in the region's British colonies. The influx of indentured laborers continued into the first decades of the 20th century, and Indians eventually formed a majority of the population in Guyana, the former British Guiana, and they became 40 percent of the population of what is now the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. 
 In the political or economic upheavals of the 1970's and 1980's, Indo-Caribbeans began leaving for the United States, where Indian professionals from Asia had already settled more than a decade before.
 ''While these two groups share a common ancestry, their historical experiences and the timing and nature of their immigration set them apart,'' said Madhulika S. Khandelwal, an Indian immigrant who directs the Asian American Center at Queens College.
 For Guyanese, even those who grew up with Indian grandparents who had been indentured servants, the passage of time has worn away much of their Indian cultural character. For many, it has erased their fluency with Hindi or other South Asian languages and given their English a singsong lilt and Creole dialect. Guyanese curries are less spicy, and a shop that serves the flat roti bread with various stews is a distinctly Caribbean conception.
 Guyanese music, while Indian influenced, is marked by a faster West Indian style that has come to be known as chutney soca. Tofayel Chowdhury, owner of the Fabric Depot and one of only a handful of shopkeepers who came from India on Liberty Avenue, the Richmond Hill shopping thoroughfare, noted that few Guyanese women wear saris every day as many Indian women do. 
 Both those with Guyanese and Indian heritage are steeped in British and Hindu culture. But they pray in separate temples and play for different cricket teams. While Guyanese parents limit their children's dating choices to serious suitors, they do not insist on choosing spouses, something many Indian parents still do. Even Guyanese names are distinguishing, with common Indian first names serving as their last names because of how British planters addressed them. 
 The 2000 census identified 24,662 people in Richmond Hill who were born in Guyana and 7,384 born in Trinidad, and in this neighborhood the overwhelming proportions of both groups are of Indian descent. (The Census counted 130,496 Guyanese-born residents in all of New York City, but 43 percent were black, a majority of whom have chosen to live in Brooklyn's West Indian neighborhoods.) These figures do not count the large numbers of children of Guyanese and Trinidadian immigrants born here.
 Racial data is particularly fluid, according to a study of Guyanese teenagers by Natasha Warikoo, a Harvard doctoral student in sociology, because Guyanese find it confusing to identify themselves as Asian but are not white, black, or Hispanic either. 
 In Richmond Hill, Liberty Avenue's video stores are stocked mostly with romantic musicals from India's Bollywood industry, and Ms. Warikoo said that teenage Guyanese girls particularly look ''to an Indian culture based in India rather than the Caribbean for 'authentic' Indian-ness.'' But the coolness between Indians and Guyanese is apparent.
 ''They believe our grandparents quit India, so we are like strangers to them,'' said Outar Pooran, 68 a Guyanese who is retired from a porter's job at the Giorgio Armani store in Midtown and is a leader at Mr. Budhai's temple. 
 Mr. Pooran knows Indians, he said, who always speak to him with the expression, ''You Guyanese people.''
 ''When I speak I say, 'We Indians,''' he said.
 One thing Guyanese do not speak much about -- it is humiliating -- is what some detect as lingering elitism. In Guyana the elaborate Indian caste system has withered to virtual insignificance, while it has survived in India. The Indians who signed up as contract laborers emerged largely from India's working castes while those who came to New York from India in the 1960's were highly educated professionals largely from higher castes.
 Ms. Warikoo cautioned that the fact that Guyanese have set up a separate neighborhood should not be overinterpreted. India, she said, is so fragmented linguistically, religiously and geographically that many subcultures here have carved out their own enclaves.
 Indians from Gujarat, for example, have clustered in Forest Hills. In the past decade or so, almost 5,000 Sikhs -- native Indians with a distinctive religion who are recognizable to most New Yorkers by the turbans the men wear -- have settled in Richmond Hill to be near their main gurdwara, or temple. Still, the two communities live quite separately, people from both groups acknowledge. 
 Kris Oditt, the Guyanese owner of Brown Betty Restaurant, which serves such distinctive Guyanese desserts as pineapple tarts and Chinese cakes, says Guyanese have much warmer relations with other Diaspora Indians. Guyanese and Trinidadian leaders work together in an organization known as the Indo-Caribbean Federation. Mr. Budhai's son is engaged to a girl from Trinidad. Marriages with Indian immigrants from India, though not unheard of, are far less common. 
 Scholars and people in Richmond Hill predict that attitudes will eventually change. Bobbie Ramnath, a Liberty Avenue travel agent, notices that some Guyanese are arranging trips to India to search for their roots. When a Sikh spiritual leader was pummeled into unconsciousness in July by a group of people who ridiculed his turban, Guyanese joined in the protests. 
 More Guyanese and Indian students are crossing ethnic boundaries. Priya Mahabir, a 29-year-old Guyanese senior at Baruch College, said some Indian friends have told her she's ''not really Indian, and I would be really offended by that,'' but she has also formed close friendships with Indians. 
 When she walks into a classroom, the first people she notices are those of Indian descent, whether from India or Guyana. 
 ''We call it the Indian Connection,'' she said. ''I glance over at them and they glance over at me, and we exchange a smile.''

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Groups Agree to Airport Growth, for a Price

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
An $11 billion plan to expand and modernize Los Angeles International Airport includes an unusual agreement worth an estimated $500 million in measures to ease the expansion's effects on surrounding communities.
 The so-called community benefits agreement, part of the airport expansion plan approved by the City Council this week, is the largest of its kind in the nation and the latest example of a tactic increasingly employed by advocacy groups to extract concessions from developers and public entities proposing large projects on scarce urban land.
 Groups using the same approach are now negotiating deals with public officials and private developers in New York, Seattle, Denver, Miami and New Haven, according to Madeline Janis-Aparicio, executive director of the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, which was instrumental in winning the concessions.
 The money will pay for soundproofing schools in the airport's flight paths, training new workers, replacing diesel airport vehicles with cleaner-burning equipment and studying the health effects of expanded airport operations. 
 The measures secured some labor and political support for the airport expansion project, which has been the subject of 10 years of controversy and tens of millions of dollars of studies. The agreement also immunizes the city against the threat of costly and time-consuming litigation -- at least from the 25 community groups that signed the agreement.
 The parties to the agreement called it an unprecedented deal to address a host of traffic, air pollution, noise and economic concerns raised by the huge airport project, which will take a decade to complete if it wins federal approval next year. Mayor James K. Hahn called it a national model for airport development and a way to ''enhance the quality of life for those living around the airport.''
 But it was also the product of cold calculation on the part of the mayor and officials of Los Angeles World Airports, the public authority that runs the city's four airports. It is, in essence, a pre-emptive out-of-court settlement of potential lawsuits that could block or delay the project.
 ''This is not simply a case of 'Here's a half a billion dollars, go away,''' said Danny Tabor, of the LAX Coalition for Economic, Environmental and Educational Justice, who helped negotiate the agreement. ''This buys them some very necessary legal peace. The school districts came to table with the means and the intent to sue. The environmental groups have a history of opposing mayors' projects for LAX. This agreement says we won't sue if they fulfill their commitments.''
 In exchange for not bringing legal action, the coalition gets a large basket of benefits. The package includes as much as $200 million to install soundproofing, air-conditioning and air filter systems for schools near the airport.
 It also includes money for a study of the long-term health effects of noise and air pollution on those living near a major airport, as well as to reduce diesel emissions by using electricity to power the mobile corridors linking planes and terminals.
 Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza, the Los Angeles policy director for Environmental Defense, one of the parties to the agreement, said her group had frequently resorted to lawsuits to achieve gains like those reached by negotiation in the airport deal. 
 ''We certainly hope to create a non-litigation model,'' she said. She added that joining two dozen other community groups with varying agendas gave each group more clout than it would have wielded on its own.
 The alliance, which put together the community benefits agreement, is a nonprofit organization. In 1999, it negotiated with the developer of the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles to win green space and affordable housing around the arena, and earlier this year it worked with residents of Inglewood, a low-income suburb, to defeat plans to build a Wal-Mart store there.
 The alliance was a pioneer in this kind of work, which combines the tools of community organizing with the hard-nosed tactics of political and economic pressure. ''These agreements completely redirect the priority of economic development toward raising the quality of life in communities,'' said Ms. Janis-Aparicio of the alliance. ''It's a big switch in the mindset of all stakeholders.''
 She said the alliance had negotiated six such agreements earlier with private developers, but that this one was the first with a public entity and by far the largest.
 But the agreement with the community groups does not ensure smooth flying for the airport project. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has authorized a lawsuit against the project because of concerns about unchecked growth in vehicle and passenger traffic. Several communities not covered by the $500 million settlement are also considering lawsuits to block the expansion.
 And many officials are expressing reservations about a plan to move all passenger and baggage check-in to a remote terminal about a mile east of the airport, part of a second stage of the expansion. After checking in, passengers would take an automated rail system to the gates. 
 Jack Weiss, one of three people on the 15-member Los Angeles City Council to vote against the airport plan this week, said the remote terminal would make the airport much more vulnerable to terror attacks.
 ''Mayor Hahn has proposed spending $8 billion in public funds on a passenger check-in facility that not only won't protect against terrorism, but it may make for a more attractive terrorist target because it will concentrate all the passengers in one location,'' Mr. Weiss said. He said a recent Rand Corporation study had pointed out the security risks of the new passenger terminal.

HEADLINE: Behind the Masks, Portraits of Southern Gothic

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
OF all the photographers of the ordinary, Ralph Eugene Meatyard is perhaps the most oddball, giving reality a flip that often puts it into the realm of sur-reality. His creepy, staged shots of family and friends in strange masks but homey settings, or unmasked in derelict places that turn spooky, are weirdly unsettling while at the same time involved with the familiar interactions of everyday life.
 Like any fond father, Meatyard (1925-1972), now the subject of a major exhibition at the International Center of Photography, photographed his children growing up. But it wouldn't do just to shoot them in usual haunts. He liked to take his wife and their three children to broken-down houses around Lexington, Ky., the town he lived in most of his life, and depict them playing, jumping and rolling around, wearing masks or making faces, in dank interiors with broken windows, or standing aimlessly in front of the ruined facades.
 Wanting to capture the mysterious, inexpressible ties among people, Meatyard did not coax smiles or pleasing body language or any sentiment at all from his subjects. Vacant stares and brooding countenances are more the rule, the kinds of expressions you catch on people when they are lost in reverie, out of response mode. 
 In one memorable family portrait, his wife holds their baby daughter as she and the two older boys, an elderly man and a middle-aged woman -- perhaps his or her parents -- are deployed in front of a sagging structure that imposes a ghostly past on their relationship. They do not exchange looks or glances, yet their silent rapport is all but palpable. 
 In portraying his children, usually with their willing complicity, Meatyard was careful to avoid the sentimental cuteness that custom bestows on the young. In one shot, a boy yawns mightily as he stands listlessly in the dark doorway of an old building. In another, two boys burrow in the deep, neglected grass of an abandoned house, the face of one invisible, while the other sits apart, on his face a moody, moping look. In a third scene the three, sporting the grotesque Halloween masks that were a standard Meatyard prop, are snapped in a forest setting, one boy wearing his mask on the back of his head, so that his face lines up with his rear end.
 Possibly the best-known ''takes'' of this group, and the ones with the most obvious humor, are the so-called ''American flag'' pictures, in which the Meatyard children pose in various settings with a small Stars and Stripes. In one, a small boy sits in a rubbish-strewn room holding a flag to his face with one hand and with the other clutching a large nude doll; in another the flag sticks up from the surface of a pond, held by the hand of a completely submerged child.
 These family pictures, now titled (but not by Meatyard) ''Romances,'' form the bulk of the show ''Ralph Eugene Meatyard.'' This group of more than 150 mostly vintage images, selected by his friend, the poet and scholar Guy Davenport, is said to be the most comprehensive exhibition of his work to date and the first major showing in New York City.
 Other aspects of Meatyard's prodigious output are also on display, including landscapes, portraits and some of the series of fanciful grotesqueries he called ''The Family Album of Lucybelle Crater.'' But his ''Romances,'' apparently influenced by the poetic dailiness of William Carlos Williams's writing, is the most moving of his endeavors, and the one that best defines him as a photographer.
 An optician by trade, Meatyard was a voracious reader who became part of a local circle of intellectuals that included the poet and priest Thomas Merton and the writer and environmentalist Wendell Berry. He bought a camera when his first child was born in 1950. He was intrigued enough by the photographic process to begin serious study in 1954 with Van Deren Coke, the noted photographer, critic and teacher, and joined the local Lexington Camera Club led by Coke, whose leadership Meatyard took over two years later, at Coke's departure.
 At a 1956 workshop at Indiana University, Meatyard was exposed to advanced techniques of photographic practice by instructors like Aaron Siskind and Minor White. There he learned the finer points of black-and-white printing, which he was to explore so rewardingly, and became acquainted with the Zen philosophy that he felt was important to his work and that he dabbled in for the rest of his life.
 By 1959, as Meatyard stated in a lecture that year to the Louisville Photographic Society, he was involved in working on no fewer than 12 ''methods, series, subjects.'' Among them were what he called ''photographs made under the influence of Zen,'' shown here with the title ''Zen Twigs.'' While their minimalist economy of statement, dealing with growth and decay, is impressive, they are familiar enough to be looked over lightly. A particularly beautiful one (untitled, like much of Meatyard's work) shows a young trunk sprouting -- or seeming to sprout -- a branch that curls around it in a wiry loop, the whole almost a visual haiku.
 Other early works by Meatyard from the late 1950's include several groups of photographs meant to evoke the relationship of painting and photography. One was his out-of-focus shots of soft black shapes that had the minimal amount of information needed to make a recognizable form; another group consists of painterly abstractions achieved by photographing fields of frozen liquids and solids.
 As an outgrowth of his long ''Romances'' series, in 1969 Meatyard began using the masks that had sometimes played a role in it for a series he called ''The Family Album of Lucybelle Crater'' -- published as a book after his death -- that seems to me the most problematic of his works. The idea of the masks, according to an interview with Mr. Davenport in the catalog, came from the Belgian painter James Ensor, who often used masked figures in his work.
 Wearing the exaggeratedly distorted faces of an old man and an old woman, Meatyard's wife and friends and twice he himself posed as couples in everyday situations and locales. In the last photograph of the series, he wore his wife's clothes and she his. 
 The participants are joined by the complicity of age, the bodily distortions of their (seeming) years upon them. These simulated album snapshots were meant to mate poetry with photography, writes Cynthia Young, assistant curator at the International Center of Photography, in the catalog. But the mating of photography and poetry does not seem to come about. They are more like photographs of jokey freaks from a carnival show, subjects that could rather have sprung from the merciless lens of Diane Arbus (almost Meatyard's exact contemporary).
 More interesting, once Meatyard had left his ''Romances'' behind, are some of the other series he did before his death at age 46 from cancer, especially one called ''Motion-Sound.'' To make these blurry, vibratory views of the Kentucky landscape, aimed at suggesting the inner sounds it made beyond the realm of human hearing, the camera was moved gently up and down so that the ground, trees, hills and structures of the rural scene appeared to be swaying to their own internal music.
 A series of self-portraits made from 1965 until his death begins with a strapping man of 40 who looks out at the viewer with a fierce intensity. Several more mysterious ones depict Meatyard in rooms so dark that his form can barely be distinguished, and in one he's seen abjectly on hands and knees in a decrepit chamber, seeming to inspect a piece of trash. But the last photographs in the series, taken in 1972, the year of his death, are the most haunting. 
 Looking far older than his years, his once trim hair unkempt and shaggy, he sits outdoors on the equally unkempt grass of a hill, again gazing intently at the camera. In two sequential pictures, he gets up, turns for a last look, then walks laboredly away. He is leaving, and the show ends.

''Ralph Eugene Meatyard'' is at the International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)857-0000, through Feb. 27.

HEADLINE: Sharon Says Breakthrough in Relations With Palestinians Is Possible in '05

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: HERZLIYA, Israel, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
Next year could bring a ''historic breakthrough'' in Israel's relations with the Palestinians, a buoyant Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said Thursday, insisting that his plan to pull out of Gaza had united the country, even if it had divided his party.
 Mr. Sharon said that his government would carry out his proposal to dismantle all Israeli settlements in Gaza and four small ones in the West Bank on schedule, and that he wanted to coordinate the plan with a new, elected Palestinian leadership that turned its back on violence.
 ''In 2005 we have the opportunity for an historic breakthrough in relations between us and the Palestinians, a breakthrough for which we have waited many years,'' Mr. Sharon said at the annual Herzliya conference on policy and strategy. Israel also has the opportunity to ''establish a new partnership with the international community in the struggle against terror and regional and global instability,'' he said. 
 But to take advantage of those opportunities, Israel ''must take the initiative,'' he said. ''This is the hour, this is the time. This is the national test.''
 Leaving Gaza and fighting violence against Israeli civilians have united Israelis around the goals that matter, he said.
 ''It is uniting us in distinguishing between goals that deserve to be fought for, since they are truly in our souls -- such as Jerusalem, the large settlement blocs, the security zones and maintaining Israel's character as a Jewish state -- rather than the goals where it is clear to all of us that they will not be realized, and that most of the public is not ready, justifiably, to sacrifice so much for.''
 By the latter, Mr. Sharon meant the settlements in Gaza -- and by implication, a significant but unstated percentage of the settlements in the West Bank.
 He insisted that his understanding of Israel's ''most essential interests'' was shared with the United States and the Bush administration. He defined those issues as a refusal to return to 1967 borders, ''allowing Israel to permanently keep large settlement blocs which have high Israeli populations and the total refusal to allow Palestinian refugees to return to Israel.''
 In addition, he insisted that Israel had won the argument that there should be no movement toward recognizing a Palestinian state until the Palestinians ''take genuine action against terror until it is eliminated, advance real reforms and stop teaching hatred toward Israel.''
 Mr. Sharon was speaking to a national audience on television, on a day when his efforts to expand his minority coalition stalled temporarily, with the religious Shas Party refusing to join him and the Labor Party suspending negotiations in a bitter dispute about ministerial portfolios.
 But Mr. Sharon's mood was optimistic, and he promised that concrete steps by a new Palestinian leadership would be met in kind by Israel. ''Now there is a real chance that new Palestinian leaders will rise, those who will be elected, who will truly abandon the path of terror and instead will advance a strategy of reconciliation and negotiation,'' he said. Mr. Sharon said Israel would try to help the Palestinians to be ready to take over Gaza next year as an important first step toward an eventual Palestinian state.
 His aide, Ranaan Gissin, said Israel now backed, for example, a British proposal for a conference in London, probably in February, to help the Palestinians with security, economic and political reform in preparation for running Gaza. Israel would not attend, he said, given the Palestinian agenda, but would encourage Western donor nations to do what they could to help the Palestinians succeed in Gaza and see an economic incentive to stop violence.
 [Israeli troops raided the southern Gaza Strip on Friday, killing two Palestinians, wounding seven and demolishing houses, witnesses and medics said, according to Reuters.]
 Mr. Gissin described Mr. Sharon's policy as ''a breakthrough through a narrow valley'' that could lead to increased cooperation and coordination with the Palestinians after elections that would presumably be won by the moderate Mahmoud Abbas.
 In any event, Mr. Abbas will need money for the Palestinian Authority to keep paying the salaries of the various competing security services while it tries to rein them in.
 Mr. Sharon, his aides say, is reluctant to get caught up in any larger international forum on peace until the Palestinians get their house in order. While encouraged by the statements against violence from Mr. Abbas, Israeli officials also note that violence has not stopped.
 Most important, one official said, Mr. Sharon does not want to be ''trapped'' into a discussion of a Palestinian state, leaping to Stage 2 of the road map peace plan before Palestinians meet their commitments to stopping violence and incitement to violence, a requirement laid out in the first stage of the peace plan.

HEADLINE: Residents Rally For a Response To 8 Killings In Newark

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: NEWARK, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
Two days after four young people were killed in separate execution-style shootings, and three weeks after a similar slaughter, residents of this hard-pressed city rallied on Thursday to demand a response from Mayor Sharpe James, who they said was minimizing the violence.
 About 30 people showed up for a hastily called rally on the steps of City Hall to complain about the climbing murder rate and what they said was cold indifference from city officials. So far, 85 people have been killed here this year, police statistics show, compared with 83 in 2003 and 68 in 2002. Since Thanksgiving Day, there have been eight murders, the police say, a per capita rate that outpaced New York City during the same period. 
 Members of the clergy, community leaders and friends and relatives of the crime victims said Mr. James, who has been mayor since 1986, had not done enough to address the violence. 
 Russell Yancey, 45, an unemployed computer technician who attended the rally, said he had lost faith in the city's leader, after more than 15 years of support. 
 ''Sharpe James is more concerned with himself than with his city,'' Mr. Yancey said. ''He is out of touch with the people who put him in office.''
 The killings on Tuesday occurred within a two-mile section of the city's South and West Wards. The violence started around 2:30 p.m. Sutton Davis, 22, was shot five times on South 15th Street, the police said; about two hours later, Robert Brown, 26, was gunned down on Clinton Avenue; and Nyru Simmonds, 20, was shot later that night on Elizabeth Avenue near Meeker Avenue, and died at University Hospital in Newark at 1 a.m., according to the police. The fourth victim, Ronald Logan, 20, was shot about 8:30 p.m. in the hallway of an apartment at 416 Irvine Turner Boulevard. 
 On Nov. 26, the bodies of three men and a woman were found lying face down, side by side, with coats over their heads, in a vacant lot near a church in the South Ward. Each had been shot in the head, the police said. 
 At the rally and in telephone interviews, many residents said that the eight murders, coming so close together, had brought concerns about the city's priorities to the surface. 
 While Newark is enjoying a mild revival, with property values on the rise, clergy members and residents questioned whether neighborhood crime-fighting had been pushed aside by downtown building projects, like a proposed $310 million hockey arena. The city seems more concerned with newcomers, they said, than residents. 
 ''They ignore the plight of the population for the sake of buildings that will be used mostly for people from outside,'' said the Rev. Raul Comesanas, the pastor St. Thomas Aquinas Roman Catholic Church, next to the vacant lot in the South Ward where the four bodies had been dumped. 
 Salaam Ismial, chairman of the National United Youth Council, a youth advocacy organization, agreed. ''We're tired,'' he said. ''There are black people suffering and the only thing the mayor can do is talk about downtown.''
 Mayor James declined requests for interviews. He issued a statement praising the heroism of the police and denouncing the killings. 
 After the rally, the deputy mayor, Ras Baraka, said it was unfair to blame city government for problems that had their roots in poverty, unemployment and other social ills. ''The mayor could come to every meeting in the city,'' he said. ''That doesn't mean people will stop shooting each other.''
 The police director, Anthony Ambrose, said at a news conference on Wednesday that overall crime was down 9 percent from 2003, and that most residents did not have to fear violence, because it typically involved criminals attacking criminals. Mr. James has said that the four people shot on Tuesday were involved in gangs. 
 The police said that three arrests were made Tuesday night. Two of the suspects -- Tony Johnson, 19, and an unidentified 17-year-old -- were arrested after a chase that led the police to Elizabeth and ended with the suspects' car crashing into several parked vehicles on North and Newark Avenues. A third suspect, Noel Riddick, 26, was arrested when he walked into University Hospital with a gunshot wound and was recognized by an officer who had exchanged gunfire with one of the suspects. Despite the arrests, Stephen Adubato Sr., a local power broker and founder of the North Ward Center, a social services agency, said that the entire city had been shocked. ''We're turning the corner economically, so it would seem that this is a time where we would be safer since there is more reason to protect what we have,'' he said. ''But instead, there's this.''
 Friends of at least one of the victims also took issue with the mayor's charge that everyone involved in the shootings had ties to gangs. Nichelle Woolridge, 27, Robert Brown's fiancee, said that Mr. Brown, an aspiring rapper, only wanted to make music and get married. 
 Kent Stokes, 33, a friend of Mr. Brown's who said he was with him when he died, criticized the mayor and the police for assuming that the victims were criminals. ''You see a cop get killed and they find a suspect,'' he said. ''But they can't find who killed my brother.''

HEADLINE: A Promise To a Son Who Fell Alone

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
THERE are no Christmas lights for Margaret and Thomas J. Brick, not this year. Holiday wreaths will have to wait for another time. So will other decorations.
 Decking their house in Auburndale, Queens, used to be the responsibility and the joy of their son, Firefighter Thomas C. Brick. That was until just before last Christmas. 
 That was a lifetime ago.
 A year ago yesterday, Firefighter Brick of Ladder Company 36 in upper Manhattan died while fighting a fire at a warehouse on 10th Avenue. 
 ''He was Mr. Christmas to us,'' Mrs. Brick said over coffee in her kitchen. Without him around to do the decorating, enough holiday spirit has seeped away that she ''can't handle it.'' Not now.
 That doesn't change her promise to him, though. Three Decembers ago, she recalled, on the day ''my Tommy'' graduated from the Fire Department's training academy, he extracted a pledge. ''Whatever happens,'' he had his parents agree, ''we will never regret your going into the Fire Department.''
 ''Obviously, if we had known '' Mrs. Brick's voice trailed off. But then it regained strength. ''I did make that pledge to him,'' she said, ''so I have to stick to it.''
 It is the Bricks' painful distinction that their son, who was 30, is the only New York City firefighter since Sept. 11, 2001, to have died in the course of battling a fire. They would love nothing more, they said, than to have that ''only'' last forever. But they know too well that for firefighters' families, death is ever poised to come calling.
 Yesterday, however, was about celebrating life.
 In Firefighter Brick's honor, several hundred people turned out for a Mass at St. Kevin's Roman Catholic Church, a few blocks from the family's house. Tommy Brick was once an altar boy there. Today, city officials will gather at another place sacred to him, his firehouse on Vermilyea Avenue, in Inwood, where a memorial plaque will be dedicated.
 These are time-honored rituals. They are observed for the one who dies alone. They exist for those who die en masse, like the 343 firefighters who did not walk away from the World Trade Center.
 But you would have to be willfully blind not to notice differences in the calculus of public grief. It can be unforgiving.
 Cash cascaded into various funds that were created for the 9/11 victims. A Rand Corporation study issued last month put the average compensation for the families of uniformed workers at more than $4.2 million.
 Be assured that the money available for Firefighter Brick's daughter and son -- Madeline, 5, and Aden, 4 -- does not begin to approach that level, even though their father was just as valiant and is just as mourned as anyone who died on Sept. 11. But then, death is no less unfair than life.
 Not that the Bricks are complaining. They did not bring up the subject of money. And when it arose, they spoke of how the children will be provided for and how generous people have been, both within and outside the Fire Department.
 IN a sense, Mrs. Brick said, her son was a beneficiary of the terrorist attack. That may sound odd, she said, but it is so.
 All his life, she explained, he wanted to be a firefighter, him with a smile that seemed never to fade. After the devastation of 9/11, fire officials quickly ran a new class through the academy. Tommy Brick was on the list of those waiting to get in.
 ''I always used to say that if anybody got anything good out of 9/11 -- if you could put it that way -- it was him, because he got into the Fire Department,'' the mother said. Firefighter Brick's sister, Megan, echoed the thought: ''Being a firefighter gave him greater happiness than any job he ever had.''
 The family is familiar with the ways of death. Mrs. Brick is a nurse, her husband a funeral director. 
 ''It's a world that's kind of home to us,'' Mrs. Brick said. ''The kids grew up with it. They always had a healthy attitude about wakes, funerals.''
 But can anything prepare a parent for that dreaded knock on the door?
 Mrs. Brick was home with the flu last Dec. 16, on the phone with her other son, Christopher, when she heard the knock. There stood several Fire Department officials, including men from Ladder 36, still in their firefighting gear.
 It is a strange thing, the mother said. ''Hope just kicks right in. I kept thinking that any minute now they're going to tell me he's in the burn unit. 'We're going to take you. Don't get excited.'
 ''They never said that.''

HEADLINE: Harlan County A.T.V.

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
BY 9 a.m. on a recent Saturday, the municipal parking lot in Evarts, a coal town at the foot of the Black Mountains in eastern Kentucky, was overflowing with A.T.V. riders. There was a group in from Cookeville, Tenn., and two married couples, avid off-roaders, from Bardstown, Ky. Jason Powell, 31, made the two-hour drive up from Bristol, Tenn., hauling behind him a trailer that carried his ''fully snorkled'' Honda Foreman. 
 The out-of-town riders were joined on this cold morning by several members of the Harlan County Ridge Runners, a local all-terrain vehicle club, which had organized the ride. And while everyone checked their machines one last time, the club's president, Preston McLain, played the affable host. ''Right now, we have a 130-mile loop, but we're trying to access more land,'' he told one of the Cookeville riders, seeming somehow to be addressing a larger audience not yet present. ''You'll be able to ride from Evarts to the highest point in the state. That's the goal. And the ride is free. That's the way the county wants it. Say it's to promote tourism.'' 
 Even without the additional acreage, Harlan County, an isolated mountainous region near the Virginia border better known for its violent labor battles, is fast becoming a popular destination for off-roaders. Each weekend, crowds of people show up with A.T.V.'s or modified four-wheel-drive vehicles called rock crawlers, eager to climb the steep, rocky hillsides and cutback hollows that have been made even more rugged by years of surface mining. ''In Johnson City, which is near me, there's only one trail,'' Mr. Powell said, ''but up here there's hundreds.'' 
 In many places off-road vehicles are looked upon as noisy irritations and are banned. In Harlan County, where the fortunes of the residents have risen and fallen along with the coal industry, and where fortunes are currently down, the riders are seen as a salvation. They rent rooms at the Mount Aire Motel in Harlan and fuel up at the service stations in Evarts, pumping money into the struggling economy. 
 In the spring the county leased a 7,000-acre parcel of land from a mining company and it plans to turn it into an off-road park. By next year the county hopes to secure another 30,000 acres, giving it the potential for a 280-mile trail to rival the popular Hatfield-McCoy system in West Virginia. Andy Jones, director of strategic development for the county, said that Harlan, known by many people as the subject of Barbara Kopple's 1976 documentary film about the local miners' struggle to unionize, is a place where people have been known not to get along, ''but this is something that folks have really gotten behind.'' 
 The off-road park won't officially open until June, timed to the annual Poke Salad Festival, but local groups are already working to prepare the land. The Ridge Runners share the property with the Kentucky Mountain Crawlers, a local rock-crawling club, and both groups spend weekends clearing brush, christening trails and excavating the ancient mining and logging roads that hug the narrow ridges. 
 ''We've still got a lot of work to do,'' said Ronnie Shoope, a Mountain Crawler from Harlan who dropped by the morning the A.T.V. riders were in town. ''We weren't expecting this type of enthusiasm so soon.''
 The sound of revving motors signaled the readiness of the A.T.V. riders, however. Soon the group, led by a mustached Ridge Runner named Jerry White, were bouncing along the rough switchbacks that wind their way up Little Black Mountain. Because detailed maps of the trails will most likely not be ready until summer, many out-of-town riders rely on locals like Mr. White and Mr. McLain, both adept guides. 
 Throughout the morning, as he navigated dozens of overgrown mining roads that plunged farther into the woods, at times winding in on themselves, Mr. McLain was never at a loss. ''I used to squirrel hunt up here,'' he said approaching the top of an overlook. Pointing to a rock overhang, he said, ''There's a pool of water that collects in those caves. I used to swim there as a kid.'' Eventually he drove up to a high peak known as Ball's Knob. It was flat and muddy and treeless, as if someone had come along and chopped off the top of the mountain -- in fact, a mining company had done just that.
 Mr. McLain had driven ahead of the other riders and now he fixed his eyes on a rutted mining road on the ridge below. ''Here they come,'' he said happily, and just then the group of 18 appeared from behind the hillside, their engines issuing a high-pitched buzzing noise that downshifted into a glorious roar as they wound their way up to where Mr. McLain stood. 
 The riders, wearing overalls and heavy boots, milled about and took in a view that stretched beyond Black Mountain, the highest point in Kentucky, and into Virginia. On a nearby ridge, a coal seam was being worked by a mining company, a reminder of the human hand that had shaped the area.
 One reason the county is so encouraging to off-roaders is because the land they use is considered damaged. Mining companies are required by law to ''reclaim'' land, to return it to its natural state, but a mined piece of property bears its violent scars. Washouts plague the roads, making them rutted and bouldered; dense forests open unnaturally to grassy domes where trees have been clear-cut to extract coal; deep cuts in the mountains allow for water drainage. 
 Such rugged conditions would send most drivers speeding for the nearest paved superhighway. For A.T.V. riders, however, and especially for rock crawlers, who traverse unholy terrain in modified Jeeps and pickup trucks, the wooded moonscape of Harlan County is like an off-road autobahn -- albeit one traveled at 5 miles an hour. 
KEN CRIDER peered out the window of his blue 1979 International Scout II and looked calmly at his front left tire, which rested on a large muddy rock; the right wheel was suspended in mid-air above an abandoned logging road. ''A lot of people will say this isn't fun,'' he said, gently administering throttle. ''To build a truck and go where you aren't supposed to -- that's fun to me.''
 Mr. Crider, a state police detective who lives in Harlan and talks in the even, measured tones of his profession, became interested in rock crawling after his son ''kept talking about 4-by-4 this and 4-by-4 that.'' He paid $600 for the International, modifying it with lower gears; ''Detroit'' lockers, which send power to all four wheels simultaneously; and oversized ''Super Swamper'' tires. 
 Mr. Crider drove slowly and carefully along the undulating roadbed, eventually stopping at a vertical grade as narrow as it was steep. Normally he would have thought nothing of taking the hill head on, but a week before, on a Mountain Crawlers Thanksgiving ride, he had developed engine trouble, so now he was leery of tackling the climb. 
 As his copilot, a shy, bearded man named Chris Creech, looked on impassively, Mr. Crider thought for a moment. Then he clamped his foot on the throttle and steadily motored up the hill, making it halfway before the engine stalled and the vehicle hung precariously on the mountain. 
 ''The carburetor flooded,'' he said. 
 Despite his engine problems, Mr. Crider is pleased with rock crawling in Harlan County. For the Thanksgiving ride, two dozen enthusiasts had shown up in Suzuki Samurais and modified Jeeps to plod through obstacles like the Mason Jar and the Rock Garden, a rock bed put in by a mining company to minimize erosion. To the riders, the event suggested that the area might one day become a destination on par with Jellico, Tenn., and Hazelton, Pa., two other mining towns that form a kind of coal circuit for the rock-crawler crowd. 
 Indeed, throughout the county there seems to be a sense of optimism about the off-road scene. Before heading to the trails, Mr. McLain had offered a brief tour of Evarts. In its many abandoned, weed-grown lots he saw ample parking for riders; in the vacant storefronts along Yocum Street he envisioned A.T.V. rental and repair shops; and atop the surface-mined hillsides, he saw hundreds of riders barreling through the eastern Kentucky woods. 
 ''I know we're going to have a good crowd coming,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Florida Changes Insurance Rules to Help Hurricane Victims

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Joseph B. Treaster contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
The Legislature on Thursday approved $185 million in aid to people whose homes were ravaged by hurricanes this year and altered Florida's insurance rules, a move that lawmakers said would increase costs statewide. 
 Borrowing up to $150 million from a state catastrophe fund, the relief package will help at least 30,000 homeowners who had to pay multiple deductibles when four hurricanes hit the state in six weeks, legislators said. In Florida, the deductible is generally 2 percent to 5 percent of a home's value. 
 Under the plan, homeowners who paid two deductibles this year will qualify for up to $10,000 in state reimbursement, and those who paid three or more will qualify for up to $20,000. The bill also eliminates multiple deductibles for hurricane victims in the future, so that Floridians need pay only one deductible per hurricane season even if hit by several storms. 
 Sam Miller, executive vice president of the Florida Insurance Council, said his industry supported the change even though premium costs would rise by perhaps half a percentage point to replenish the catastrophe fund over the next few years.
 ''We did not intend to impose the hurricane deductible three and four times on folks,'' said Mr. Miller, whose group represents Florida insurance companies. ''The increase is going to hopefully be negligible.''
 Eliminating multiple deductibles will lead to a separate, larger cost increase of 1 percent to 4 percent on home insurance policyholders, he said. 
 The Republican-dominated Legislature also approved a plan to give tax rebates of up to $1,500 to people who paid property tax on homes they could not live in after the hurricanes. The legislation sets aside $20 million for the rebates, available to people whose homes were uninhabitable for at least 60 days and who apply by March 1. 
 An additional $15 million will provide sales tax refunds to storm victims buying replacement mobile homes. Lawmakers also approved a $100 million loan program to help school districts make hurricane-related repairs while they wait for federal aid, and $68 million to help restore damaged beaches.
 ''I don't think that you can ever do too much for people who have lost everything,'' said Senator James E. King Jr., a Republican from Jacksonville. ''We recognize the loss. We're going to step in and help.''
 Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican who called the weeklong special legislative session to address hurricane and education issues, said he was pleased with the relief package. But he added: ''There's more to be done. This next session will be full of opportunities to learn from the lessons of the four storms.''
 Some lawmakers fought the plan to borrow money from the state catastrophe fund, which was created after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 to help insurers pay for especially large hurricane losses. They wanted the money to come instead from the state's general fund, but they were outvoted by others, including Mr. Bush, who said that would threaten the state's fiscal health. 
 Some lawmakers also complained that the relief package did not provide nearly enough money for people who desperately needed it. The Red Cross has estimated that about 25,000 homes were destroyed in the four hurricanes, which hit in August and September, and that an additional 50,000 suffered major damage.
 But Tom Gallagher, the state's chief financial officer, said he thought the package sufficed. 
 ''I think the money is pretty close to right,'' Mr. Gallagher said of the deductible reimbursement plan. ''It won't take care of everybody, but it will take care of 75 to 90 percent, maybe even higher.''
 Florida has often been a trendsetter on insurance. In 1996, it became the first state to establish hurricane deductibles based on a percentage of the insured value of houses and condominiums. Now, many states along the Atlantic Seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as Hawaii, have such deductibles.
 Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York, said he did not think other states would follow Florida's lead on applying only one deductible per hurricane season. The general practice in insurance, he said, is that a deductible is applied for each damage claim.
 ''If someone has ice damage in a Northern state in January and a similar claim in March, it is going to be two deductibles,'' Mr. Hartwig said.
