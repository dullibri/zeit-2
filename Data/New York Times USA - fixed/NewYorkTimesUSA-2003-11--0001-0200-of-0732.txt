HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW; 
Sondheim Guides Two Brothers On a Tour of Life

BYLINE:  By BEN BRANTLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Life unfolds like a road map, neatly creased and popping with place names, in "Bounce," the singing itinerary of a show from Stephen Sondheim that opened on Thursday night at the Kennedy Center.
 This ardently awaited musical, Mr. Sondheim's first since "Passion" in 1994, lays out the biography of Addison and Wilson Mizner, two tirelessly enterprising American brothers from the early 20th century, as a voyage that covers four decades and thousands of miles. "Bounce" journeys from Gold Rush-era Alaska to revolutionary Guatemala, from the New York of the Gilded Age to the final frontier of the afterlife. 
 Yet somehow "Bounce," directed by the mighty Harold Prince, never seems to leave its starting point. The map lies tantalizingly before you, its routes and destinations marked in bright colors. But it remains a wistful diagram, rarely closer to three dimensions than the outsize, hand-tinted tourist postcards that frame the set. It's like a travel agent's pitch for a wondrous vacation. 
It should go without saying that "Bounce" is a big deal, being the first complete new show in nine years from the reigning genius of the American musical. And it arrives at a moment when the form is starved for the substance and inventiveness with which Mr. Sondheim has always nourished it.
What's more, the show auspiciously reunites the composer with Mr. Prince, his collaborator on watershed productions like "Company," "Follies" and "Sweeney Todd." (This is their first full-scale project together since "Merrily We Roll Along" in 1981.) And the show's book is by John Weidman, who wrote the scripts for "Pacific Overtures" and "Assassins," Mr. Sondheim's most radically venturesome works.
Seen earlier this year at the Goodman Theater in Chicago and before that in a workshop production in New York in 1999 (under the title "Wise Guys"), "Bounce" -- which also briefly bore the name "Gold" -- has led many lives. Mr. Sondheim originally had the idea for the show in 1952. So it's appropriate that it should be, above all, a hymn to American resilience and tenacity.
That spirit is embodied with vaudevillian buoyancy in the title song and opening number, performed by Addison Mizner (Richard Kind), an architect of extravagant whimsy, and his younger brother, Wilson (Howard McGillin), a silver-tongued hustler of many trades.
This song, by the way, is performed after the brothers' deaths. They have met, to their astonishment, in heaven, which allows them to comment on their antithetical characters, their combative love for each other and the corkscrew turns of their improbably eventful lives.
Mr. Kind and Mr. McGillin execute this self-introduction charmingly, translating wryness and ruefulness into a breezy soft-shoe sensibility. But in a sense, when they have finished the song they have already delivered the whole show. 
The picaresque antics that follow feel only marginally more specific than what we've already witnessed.
"Bounce," which features the vibrant Michele Pawk as a zestful gold digger (of both Klondike and jazz-age varieties) and Jane Powell as the Mizners' mother, only rarely kicks into a higher gear than the one that gently propels the opening duet.
You are told that the discreetly gay Addison and womanizing Wilson are men of profound energies and appetites. Certainly, their unorthodox resumes would seem to confirm this, crammed with tales of life-or-death poker games in a Klondike saloon, fixed horse races and the real estate boom and bust in Boca Raton, Fla., in the 1920's, for which the brothers are here held responsible.
Yet as embodied by Mr. Kind and Mr. McGillin, the Mizners never exude much urgency. Even as they accumulate and squander fortunes, win and lose in love and follow their restless hearts to far-flung places, their trajectory feels as straight and flat as a time line in a history book. The bounce in "Bounce" is never very high. It's more like a close-to-the-floor dribble by a basketball player stalling for time.
To some extent, this approach is deliberate. Mr. Sondheim has said that after the somber, intense "Passion," he wanted a livelier, lighter endeavor. And with a book that traffics brazenly in chestnuts of jokes and all-American stereotypes, "Bounce" seems always to keep a quaint distance from its subjects, as if viewing them through a stereopticon.
The same effect is carried out in Eugene Lee's sets, bright scrims and cutouts that suggest hybrids of architect's drawings and music hall scenery, and in Mr. Prince's relentlessly linear staging. (The minimal choreography is by Michael Arnold.) And while Ms. Pawk brings a welcome, full-bodied lustiness to a character that evokes the man-trapping heroine of "Little Me," the performers register principally as cutout figures in a panoramic landscape.
It's fun to see Ms. Powell, the star of MGM musicals like "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers," onstage. But her ladylike mien and small soprano don't capture the gutsiness of a loving, ferocious mother who drives her sons to wild and woolly deeds.
More crucially, Mr. Kind and particularly Mr. McGillin, a romantic tenor who just doesn't have it in him to look devious and debauched, fail to add other strata to the initial impressions they make. And neither can give their more brooding songs -- like "The Game," Wilson's philosophical credo, or Addison's angry reprise of the title number -- the required sense of a walloping emotional climax.
Much of the music, while whispering of earlier, more flashily complex Sondheim scores, has a conventional surface perkiness that suggests a more old-fashioned, crowd-pleasing kind of show than is this composer's wont. But his extraordinary gift for stealthily weaving dark motifs into a brighter musical fabric is definitely in evidence, mellifluously rendered in the peerless Jonathan Tunick's orchestrations.
Another Sondheim specialty, the intricate layering of melody lines, is put to tasty use in the show's musical high point, in which Addison and his young lover, Hollis Bessemer (the shiny-voiced Gavin Creel), proclaim their devotion and ambition over the excited buzz of a chorus of Palm Beach socialites.
That the lyrics, by and large, are simpler than usual for Mr. Sondheim doesn't mean he has lost his way with a rhyme. Listen, for example, to the economically clever opening lines of Hollis's portrait of himself: "When I was a tyke/ I said, 'What I like/ Is art.'/ I know I'm a boy/ But what I enjoy/ Is art."
That's Mr. Sondheim for you, reinventing a cliche with simple, elegant strokes. More often, though, you wind up feeling that all the time spent on "Bounce" has worn his customary sheen to a duller, more dutiful finish. Though often characterized as overly cerebral, Mr. Sondheim's work usually speaks directly and, yes, passionately from one man's heart as well as his mind.
"Bounce," on the other hand, feels more distanced and calculated, a show designed expressly to entertain. (Mr. Sondheim has compared it to the old Bing Crosby-Bob Hope "Road" movies.) There's nothing wrong with that. But Mr. Sondheim is a great artist, with all the personal investment that entails, as well as a first-class craftsman.
It is the craftsman who dominates "Bounce." Since this composer has set such extraordinarily high standards -- for himself and for everyone who has followed him -- it's impossible not to regret the absence of the artist.

HEADLINE: From Noah's Curse to Slavery's Rationale 

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
As stories go, this one has all the elements of good soap opera: nudity, sex and dysfunctional families.
 For many scholars, though, the enigmatic tale in Genesis 9 describing how Noah cursed the descendants of his son Ham with servitude remains a way to explore the complex origins of the concept of race: how and why did people begin to see themselves as racially divided? 
 In the biblical account, Noah and his family are not described in racial terms. But as the story echoed through the centuries and around the world, variously interpreted by Islamic, Christian and Jewish scholars, Ham came to be widely portrayed as black; blackness, servitude and the idea of racial hierarchy became inextricably linked.
By the 19th century, many historians agree, the belief that African-Americans were descendants of Ham was a primary justification for slavery among Southern Christians. 
The debate about just what the story of Ham and Noah means has marched on into the 21st century. Today scholars are increasingly reading documents in the authors' original languages and going further back in time and to more places, as well as calling on disciplines like sociology and classics. Their ambitions are also bigger than just parsing Ham. 
"What I've been trying to do for 40 years is move the emphasis of scholarship about slavery from a parochial emphasis to looking at early times," said David Brion Davis, the director of the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance and Abolition at Yale and a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian. That often means going to biblical or prebiblical sources and commentary, he said. 
On Friday the center will begin a two-day conference on "slavery and the construction of race," in which the origins of the idea of race will be discussed. 
"People are just going back and doing a lot more research, a lot more probing of sources," said George M. Fredrickson, the author of "Racism: A Short History" (Princeton University Press, 2002) and an emeritus professor of history at Stanford.
As for Ham, he said, "It's been a flexible curse -- Jews, peasants, Tatars, have been considered cursed over the years." 
David M. Goldenberg, a historian and a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, spent 13 years investigating every reference to blacks in Jewish literature up to about the seventh century. He is publishing the results of his research next month in "The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity and Islam" (Princeton University Press). Among his surprising findings, he said, is evidence that a misreading of Hebrew and other Semitic languages led to the mistaken belief that the word "Ham" meant "dark, black or heat."
He concludes that in biblical and post-biblical Judaism there are no anti-black or racist sentiments, a finding that some scholars dispute. He also contends that the notion of black inferiority developed later, as blacks were enslaved across cultures. His findings, he said, dovetail with those of other scholars who have not found anti-black sentiment in ancient Greece, Rome or Arabia.
"The main methodological point of the book is to see the nexus between history and biblical interpretation," Mr. Goldenberg said. "Biblical interpretation is not static."
Stephen R. Haynes, a professor of religion at Rhodes College in Memphis, is less interested in the origins of Ham's supposed blackness than in why certain cultures have found the story so alluring.
"It appealed to racial slavery because Ham acted like you expected a black man to act," said Mr. Haynes, who published "Noah's Curse: The Biblical Justification of American Slavery" (Oxford University Press) last year. "Slavery was necessary in the white Southern mind to control the ungovernable black. Slavery is the response to Ham's rebellious behavior." 
In the Bible, Ham finds Noah drunk and naked in Noah's tent. He tells his brothers, Shem and Japheth, who proceed to cover their father without gazing at him. When Noah finds out what happened, he curses Ham's son Canaan, saying he shall be "a servant of servants." Among the many questions attached to this tale are what Ham did wrong. Was it looking at his father or telling his brothers or some implied sexual transgression? And why was Canaan cursed for Ham's actions? 
"The reason the text was so valued by 19th-century people was that it was about honor," Mr. Haynes said. "Ham acted dishonorably, and slavery was life without honor."
While thousands of people have tried to interpret Noah's curse, Mr. Haynes writes: "Scholars of history and religion alike have failed to comprehend that pro-slavery Southerners were drawn to Genesis 9:20-27 because it resonated with their deepest cultural values." Too often, he writes, historians have a superficial knowledge of the Bible, and scholars of religion have a limited knowledge of Southern culture.
Benjamin Braude, a professor of history at Boston College and co-director of its program in Middle Eastern and Islamic studies, argues that scholars are focusing on Ham and religious sources with wider lenses. He agrees with Mr. Goldenberg about the absence of racism in the ancient world and with his argument about the misinterpretation of rabbinic passages but disagrees with his assertion that there was no color-based identity in the ancient Near East or the Bible.
"In 18th- and 19th-century Euro-America, Genesis 9:18-27 became the curse of Ham, a foundation myth for collective degradation, conventionally trotted out as God's reason for condemning generations of dark-skinned peoples from Africa to slavery," says Mr. Braude's paper for the Yale conference. "In prior centuries, Jews, Christians and Muslims had exploited this story for other purposes, often tangential to the later peculiar preoccupation."
Like other scholars, Mr. Braude concludes that later social and economic forces turned Ham into a justification for slavery. "Before the 16th or 17th century, the racial interpretation of Ham is absent or contradictory," he said in an interview. "The clearest element is in Islamic culture, but even there it is contested and not universally accepted." 
John O. Hunwick, a professor of history and religion at Northwestern University, agrees that an examination of slavery in Islam, a subject he thinks has been neglected, may hold some answers. He theorizes that because Ethiopians were the first group held as slaves in Arabia, blackness became associated with servitude.
One of the pitfalls in answering questions about race is finger-pointing, said Werner Sollors, a professor of English and African-American studies at Harvard, who has written widely about race, including the curse of Ham. 
"The question is: where does this thing we call racism or racial hierarchy start, and it's been very contentious," he said. "It's a huge question and has a big blame attached to it. Is it the Christians, the Muslims or the Jews? You find evidence for all three." 
While the questions are not new, serious academic attention to blacks in antiquity began only in the 1960's, with books by Frank J. Snowden, a classics professor at Howard University, which is historically black, Mr. Sollors said. 
And now, Mr. Braude said, "a lot of people are pushing the questions about race much further in time and reinterpreting texts that have been misunderstood from the Renaissance onward."
"This society is obsessed with race and color," he continued. "There is, in fact, in the academy a commitment to understanding the social construction of race, but we don't look at the construction site. We are trying to see the elements that go into this -- to pull them apart and to see what fits and doesn't fit." 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 4, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Arts & Ideas on Saturday about Noah's curse on the descendants of his son Ham and its relation to the concept of race misstated a view of Benjamin Braude, the co-director of Boston College's program in Middle Eastern and Islamic studies. He says that he believes that there was little or no color-based identity in the ancient Near East and in the Hebrew Bible. He does not disagree with that assertion by another scholar, David M. Goldenberg.

 Re "Economy Records Speediest Growth Since the Mid-80's" (front page, Oct. 31): 
 The economy may be on the upswing, but at what cost? Huge deficits for now and in the future, unaffordable health care, uncertain solvency of Medicare and Medicaid, abysmal financing for education and terrible relations abroad.
Many Americans are struggling to pay their bills and praying that they don't get hit with anything chronic or expensive healthwise and that they keep their jobs. Wall Street and the Republicans may be happy, but some of us on Main Street are not.

To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman (column, Oct. 31) asserts that the Bush administration is about to preside over "the biggest budget deficit in the history of the planet." 
Economists and market analysts focus on the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product, which hit a record of 6 percent in fiscal 1983. It was below 4 percent in fiscal 2003 and is likely to stay below 4 percent in this new fiscal year. 
 More important, there has been a dramatic improvement in receipts to the federal government, as corporate earnings surge and the economy recovers. Cassandras like Mr. Krugman have been warning that deficits will soon exceed $500 billion a year, but that now seems unlikely. The bottom line, of course, is whether deficits produce significantly higher interest rates -- and on that score, the markets have yawned.

 The fact that a welfare state like Finland now ranks ahead of the United States in economic competitiveness ("Countries Rated by Cost of Doing Business," Business Day, Oct. 30) gives lie to the notion that high social expenditures are bad for business. 
Finland spends almost twice as much as the United States on social expenditures -- 29 percent versus 15 percent of gross domestic product in 1997 -- proving that you can have your cake and eat it, too. 
 This Finnish cake includes 30 days of vacation a year, 26 weeks of maternity or paternity leave at 66 percent of salary, day care, and universal health and pharmacy benefits. All this proves that what's good for people is not necessarily bad for business.

 The company, which will officially change its name to MCI then, will turn its attention to increasing its revenue and rebuilding its profit margins. The competitive climate in the industry is tough, and analysts say a wave of consolidation is likely, with MCI a possible target. Page C3. 

S.&P. Hits a 17-Month High
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 3.77 points, to 1,050.71, its highest level in 17 months, as strong earnings and merger news helped the stock market shake off a weak consumer spending report. For the week, the S.&P. gained 2.1 percent and for the month, it jumped 5.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 14.51 points, to 9,801.12, and was up 2.3 percent for the week and 5.7 percent for October. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.48 point, to 1,932.21, but gained 3.6 percent for the week and 8.1 percent for October. C5.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Beats Clinton 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BROOKS; E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Dick Gephardt strides into a family restaurant in Pocahontas, Iowa, and finds two species of mammals waiting for his campaign event, Iowans and reporters.
 The 24 Iowans in this small room are unpretentious Midwesterners. There are farmers in dirty work coats. There are women in floral sweaters with gray hair, for they are as likely to color their hair as they are to sprout wings and fly to Mars. The Iowans are almost all elderly. (If you judged by the crowds at Iowa campaign events, you'd think the voting age was 70.) 
 The 23 reporters are from New York, Washington, London and such places, and are fully gadgeted up. We have phones, pagers, P.D.A.'s and various digital devices. We are 1,000 percent more likely than the Iowans to have college degrees, 10,000 percent more likely to think Jon Stewart is funny, and an infinite percent more likely to know what the words "Manolo Blahnik" refer to. 
Dick Gephardt has brought the two groups together, but he is more one of them than one of us. He's from St. Louis, a city that has lost well over half of its population in his lifetime, and has spent his career as a party leader fighting for the Midwestern farmers and factory workers who have been on the losing side of economic history.
With reporters he is notoriously aloof and miserable, but you stick him in front of a bunch of retired union guys, and he radiates passion and sincerity.
His stump speech, which he hasn't altered since the start of the campaign, doesn't include anything on social issues or gun control. Instead, it's an unfurling of government programs: a drug program, a farm program, an energy program and so on. Like his hero Harry Truman, you can't get much more bread-and-butter than Dick Gephardt.
I judge these speeches by wheeling out the nod-o-meter. When a politician says something that directly touches the experiences and convictions of voters, you begin to see heads bobbing up and down in the audience. 
Gephardt gets the heads bobbing when he tells the story of his son's nearly fatal bout with cancer and concludes, "People with health insurance get better treatment than people without." 
But the issue that Gephardt is most passionate about, which gets the heads bobbing most vociferously, is trade. At the climax of his speech, Gephardt describes his visits to factory towns in Mexico and China, where he saw factory workers living in shipping boxes with raw sewage running through the streets. 
He describes his meeting with Bill Clinton at which he told the president he would not support Nafta unless there were international standards built in. He ridicules his Democratic opponents for their primary-season conversions on the issue. Sure, they are against free-trade pacts now, he points out, "but I was there when the jobs were on the line!"
Heads are bobbing all around. 
The fact is, he's won. For three decades the Democrats have been split on trade, but you'd never know it from this campaign. Just as the Democratic field is chasing Howard Dean on Iraq, it is chasing Dick Gephardt on trade -- and repudiating Clinton. It is impossible to imagine the next Democratic presidential candidate pushing free-trade deals the way the last one did.
How has this shift happened? George Bush has played a role. Opposition to his policies has mobilized the liberals and quieted the Democratic centrists, pushing the party left on a number of issues. The unions have played a role. Under revitalized leadership, they've increased their influence on the party, if not the country.
But Gephardt has been crucial. If he had abandoned his position when the New Democrats were in vogue, or when Al Gore was crushing Ross Perot in debate, the protectionist side of the arguments would have collapsed. 
Moreover, he's made his trade position politically palatable. He used to project himself as an economic nationalist -- as the protector of American jobs against those low-wage foreigners. Now he presents himself as a global liberal, insisting on international environmental and worker standards before trade deals are signed. The policy results are the same -- more trade barriers -- but now it sounds more humane.
Put aside the merits of Gephardt's case -- and personally I think free trade helps many more people than it hurts. Here is an unglamorous man who, after a lifetime's slogging, has brought his party around to his point of view. 
That's sort of impressive.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: OCCUPATION; 
Congressional Unit Analyzes Military Costs in Iraq

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
A new analysis by the Congressional Budget Office suggests that the military costs for the occupation of Iraq could range from $85 billion over four years to $200 billion over 10 years, even if the Pentagon sharply reduces the forces there.
 The analysis was requested by Representative John M. Spratt Jr., the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. The budget office calculations were based on four hypothetical plans for troop levels supplied by Mr. Spratt, as well as the office's analysis of Pentagon data. 
 With about 130,000 troops now in Iraq, the Pentagon says the occupation has been costing about $4 billion a month. The Senate is close to approving about $51 billion for military operations in Iraq next year, a figure included in all of the plans worked out by the budget office.
The Pentagon has said little about future troop levels, although some military planners have sketched out their own plans for a possible reduction by next year. Just Tuesday, President Bush declined to say whether he could promise a reduction within a year.
In the most expensive hypothesis examined by the budget office, troop strength declines to 102,000 by 2005 and drops to 50,000 by 2008, remaining there until 2013. Total spending would come to about $200 billion, including about $22 billion in 2005. Spending would then fall to about $14 billion in 2008, and rise from there in line with inflation through 2013.
All of the office's versions include the costs of supporting the occupation, including troops involved in air operations and those training reserve units before deployment or filling administrative jobs vacated by troops going to Iraq. They do not include the costs of reconstruction or classified intelligence activities.
The least costly plan, at about $85 billion, calls for troop levels to decline to 76,000 by 2005 and for all troops to be withdrawn by 2008. That version predicts spending $16 billion in 2005.
A third calls for about 106,000 troops during 2005 and 2006, dropping to 64,000 by 2008 before a gradual pullout completed by 2011. That would cost an estimated $155 billion, including $23 billion in 2005. 
In a fourth plan, costing an estimated $100 billion, troop levels would decline to 76,000 by 2005 and 64,000 in 2006, and all troops would be gradually withdrawn by 2009.
Mr. Spratt, of South Carolina, has been critical of the Bush administration for not offering more information about the military costs of the occupation. "Continuing to treat these enormous costs entirely outside our normal budget process now that the combat phase is over is bad policy," he said, adding that the practice "fosters the illusion that these costs do not contribute to our ever-mounting budget deficit."
A spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget declined to comment on the analysis, except to say, "The president is committed to our mission in Iraq and will work with our commanders in the field to make sure our soldiers have the full resources necessary to succeed."

HEADLINE: In Search Of Back Pay For Heroine Of Civil War 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
Harriet Tubman earned her spot in American history. Born into slavery, she freed herself, then helped free hundreds of others through the Underground Railroad.
 But even though she served in the Civil War as a spy and a scout in the Union Army, neither she nor her descendants ever received a military pension for her service. 
 "Every person who is in the service gets paid, and I think that she deserves it, too," said her great-grandniece, Pauline Copes Johnson, of Auburn, N.Y. "I think she really deserves every honor she can get." 
This week, the United States Senate made an effort to remedy the problem, by including $11,750 in an appropriations bill at the urging of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. If President Bush signs the bill, which has already been approved by the House, the money will be used to help maintain the Harriet Tubman Home, a historic site in Auburn, a small city between Rochester and Syracuse where Mrs. Tubman lived for many years. 
But while the money is appreciated, it is not quite what Mrs. Tubman's relatives and supporters were looking for. The pension, it turns out, is for her second husband's military service, not hers.
"She has never gotten a pension for her service as a scout or a spy, her actual military service," said Ward DeWitt, executive director of the Harriet Tubman Home Inc. "It's an obligation, I think, of the United States."
No one yesterday could say for sure why Mrs. Tubman never received a pension even though she and her descendants had asked for one, or why she was shorted on her husband's.
But Mrs. Johnson had no doubt.
"The reason why they ignored her is because she was black for one thing and because she was a woman for two," Mrs. Johnson said.
Harriet Tubman was born into slavery in Maryland around 1819, and escaped to Philadelphia when she was 25. There, she became one of the most famous leaders of the Underground Railroad, the system set up by abolitionists to help slaves escape to free states or to Canada. For years, at personal risk, she helped lead hundreds of slaves to freedom. Blacks called her Moses, and awards promised for her capture totaled $40,000 at one point.
During the Civil War, Mrs. Tubman was by turns a soldier, a spy and a nurse, serving for a time at Fortress Monroe in Virginia and in Hilton Head, S.C.
In 1869, she married for the second time. Her husband, Nelson Davis, served in the Union Army from 1863 to 1865 as a member of the Eighth Regiment, U.S. Colored Infantry. Mr. Davis died in October 1888, and two years later Mrs. Tubman began receiving a pension of $8 a month, as the widow of a Civil War veteran.
In 1899 the federal government raised that amount to $25, but even then paid Mrs. Tubman only $20 a month until her death in 1913, according to Senator Clinton's office. 
Eighty-nine years later, in 2002, Chris Mercogliano, a teacher at the Albany Free School in the state's capital, took his seventh- and eighth-grade students to Mrs. Tubman's former home in Auburn. These were inner-city children, inspired by her work. Mrs. Tubman's great-grandniece, Mrs. Johnson, who was working there, told them about the unpaid pension.
"They were outraged she had been stiffed by the government," Mr. Mercogliano said yesterday.
The class wrote to Senator Clinton, who met with them in Washington as they retraced Mrs. Tubman's route from Maryland to freedom in Philadelphia. A year and a half later, the senator has delivered -- at least in part.
The money that will go to the Tubman house and its museum and library represents the part of the widow's pension that Mrs. Tubman never received. The figure is adjusted for inflation, but does not include interest.
If the government were now to pay the equivalent of a pension of $20 a month from the end of the Civil War in 1865 until Mrs. Tubman died in 1913, she would be owed -- in 2003 dollars -- about $210,000, not including interest.
Senator Clinton said yesterday that she would seek a pension for Mrs. Tubman, but considered the $11,750 a start.
"I certainly hope that people view this step as another one on the journey to ensuring Harriet Tubman's rightful place in our country's history," she said.

HEADLINE: Promising Vote on Global Warming 

 BODY:
John McCain has failed in his first attempt to persuade his Republican colleagues in the Senate to give the issue of global warming the urgent attention it deserves. By a margin of 55 to 43 on Thursday, the Senate rejected a proposal he sponsored with Joseph Lieberman to impose mandatory caps on the emissions from utilities and other industries that scientists believe are heavily responsible for global warming. But Mr. McCain, as we know, does not give up easily. He started his quest for campaign finance reform in 1995 and prevailed six years later. He promises to be just as tenacious on this issue. 
 The outcome was heartening on several levels. Mr. McCain and Mr. Lieberman are now within striking distance of a majority. This reflects not only lobbying from environmental groups but a growing realization among governors, mayors and businesses large and small that the long-term costs of climate change could be far greater than the costs of bringing it under control. 
 The bill also found surprising support among Democrats and Republicans from big industrial and coal-producing states, where opposition to any legislation having to do with curbing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases usually runs high. This support materialized despite furious opposition from reactionaries like Oklahoma's James Inhofe, who stubbornly denies the science of global warming, and from the White House -- which, true to form, warned of an economic Armageddon.
The bill is in fact a modest version of the 1997 Kyoto accord, which President Bill Clinton embraced but Mr. Bush rejected. Kyoto would indeed have required big changes in how we use and produce energy, as any determined assault on global warming eventually must. But McCain-Lieberman aims merely to accustom the nation gently to doing business in a different way. One suspects that the Senate will someday wake up to the fact that the White House sees bogymen where none exist.

HEADLINE: What Chance Justice Is Done? Russia's System Is Questioned 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Anton V. Drel arrived at the grim Mastrosskaya Tishina prison here last Saturday and signed the papers declaring him the official counsel of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest tycoon. Then a prosecutor presented Mr. Drel with a summons to be questioned as a witness.
 "Even in the Soviet Union, that never happened," he said. 
 The jailhouse summons, which prompted an outcry from Russia's bar, was the latest in a series of aggressive and, lawyers say, illegal tactics in an investigation lasting months into Mr. Khodorkovsky and others connected with his company, Yukos Oil. 
Whether Mr. Khodorkovsky is guilty of the fraud and forgery alleged by prosecutors is much debated here and abroad, particularly given the murky nature of most big business in Russia. The real question, however, is whether he has any chance of due process or, should it ever come to it, a fair and open trial.
Few here believe he does -- even the deputy chairman of President Vladimir V. Putin's advisory committee on the judiciary, Sergei E. Vitsin. "I would say there are more features of political games here than of justice," he said in an interview.
Mr. Putin has often called for cementing the rule of law in Russia, but the Khodorkovsky investigation has underscored just how far short the country is of that goal. 
Russia's post-Soviet Constitution arguably offers its citizens rights comparable to those of Europe or the United States, and a new criminal procedural code enshrines such basic concepts as jury trials and habeas corpus. Yet justice in practice remains arbitrary, selective and often corrupt, lawyers, legislators and analysts here said.
The courts, whose judges serve by presidential decree, rarely challenge, let alone overrule, prosecutors. Defense lawyers have little recourse to appeal. The same prosecutors wield tremendous control over criminal cases up to and through trial, eroding the adversarial relationship essential to any defense.
Indictments and evidence are most often secret, while hearings and even trials are closed to public scrutiny. The trial of two men accused of bombing two apartment buildings in Moscow in 1999 -- a notorious crime that killed nearly 300 people and helped to ignite the second war in Chechnya -- began Friday shrouded in secrecy. 
The absence of scrutiny and independent judicial review, defense lawyers and legal experts say, has allowed prosecutorial abuses to flourish. Those abuses, they say, have increased steadily under Mr. Putin.
Formally, the law is observed, said Andrei M. Borovkov, a lawyer who for three years has represented Nikolai A. Glushkov, a former Aeroflot executive accused of embezzlement who remains in prison to this day. But the prosecutor's office, he said, "knows its hands are untied and it feels it can do whatever it wants."
Masked agents seized Mr. Khodorkovsky on a Siberian runway last Saturday after prosecutors accused him of ignoring a summons that, Mr. Drel said, he never received. His partner, Platon Lebedev, has been in jail since July and has not yet appeared in an open court hearing. He, like Mr. Khodorkovsky, has been ordered held until at least Dec. 30.
Agents of the Federal Security Service, the domestic successor to the K.G.B., even appeared at the public school of Mr. Khodorkovsky's daughter, demanding a list of her classmates. Mr. Drel called the visit a naked act of intimidation. 
On Oct. 9, investigators raided Mr. Drel's own law office -- without a warrant and without his presence, he said -- and seized his mobile phone, electronic notebook and files involving business deals with international companies. As for the summons, Mr. Drel refused to appear as ordered. After the public outcry, the prosecutors withdrew it.
"Some dangerous precedents are being created in this case," Mr. Drel said in an interview this week at Yukos's headquarters in Moscow. "If this is the way they treat the richest and one of the most influential men in Russia, then they can confiscate an apartment or a kiosk from any small-rent trader," he said. "And if they treat the lawyer of the richest man in Russia like this, how will they treat ordinary lawyers in, say, small Siberian towns who represent ordinary businessmen?"
Prosecutors defend their handling of the investigation. On Monday, Mr. Putin himself said the arrest was a result of a "democratic and well-balanced system" of justice and said it was essential that the nation's laws be applied to everyone from "a modest clerk" to "a top businessmen."
But the handling of Mr. Khodorkovsky's case -- perhaps because of the stakes, perhaps because of his cultivation of senior officials in the United States and Europe -- has increasingly raised concerns, and not only here. In Washington, the State Department's spokesman twice this week expressed doubts about the fairness of Russian justice, as have officials in Europe. 
It is almost universally believed here that the growing investigation into Mr. Khodorkovsky and his associates at Yukos is not legally, but rather politically motivated. 
In fact, it began in June with a request by Vladimir I. Yudin, a pro-Putin member of Parliament, that the Prosecutor General's office investigate the privatization of a mining concern, called Apatit, that is at the heart of the charges against Mr. Khodorkovsky. 
Mr. Yudin, who previously worked in the fertilizer industry, said Apatit, after coming under Mr. Khodorkovsky's control, had monopolized the concentrate needed by fertilizer producers, abusing the spirit of privatizing former state industries. 
"Those who consider themselves offended start crying and say it's politically motivated," he said of investigations into the privatization deals of the 1990's. "Of course, I cannot deny there is not an influence, but we are talking about purely economic things."
Another deputy, Konstantin V. Remchyukov, said the problem was that the prosecution of Mr. Khodorkovsky appeared selective, undercutting confidence in the judicial system. "The law used equally for all is law," Mr. Remchyukov said. "The law used selectively is just plain arbitrary."

HEADLINE: Some Clues to '04, However Faint, Are Set to Emerge 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 31 

 BODY:
With a presidential campaign well under way, leaders of both parties are searching for signs, any signs, of favorable trends for November 2004. For the next two weeks, the best place to look is the South, where three states will hold elections for governor.
 On Tuesday, voters in Kentucky and Mississippi will determine whether the reins of power remain in Democratic hands, and 11 days later a runoff in Louisiana will decide who succeeds a Republican. 
 While a handful of races for the statehouse may not serve as an unambiguous measure of President Bush's leadership -- even after Arnold Schwarzenegger's victory in California made him the nation's 27th Republican governor -- Mr. Bush plans a whirlwind of rallies on Saturday in Kentucky and Mississippi. 
Mr. Bush, who won Kentucky in 2000 by 16 percentage points over Al Gore, and Mississippi by 17, remains enormously popular in both states. His two appearances in each on Saturday could go a long way toward drawing undecided voters and a growing number of conservative Democrats to the Republican columns. The appearances could also hold rewards for Mr. Bush's own campaign, especially if the Republican candidates win.
Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democratic Network, a national organization that supports centrist Democrats, said that if nothing else, a day of campaigning in friendly environs would give the president a brief respite from cantankerous Washington.
"He needs a change of subject now," Mr. Rosenberg said. "The national news has been tough for him. He's gambling that hecan pick up a couple of wins and get some good news out of it."
Still, it is uncertain what this small number of elections might foretell for next year. Ed Gillespie, Republican national chairman, conceded, "I see some national intersection with these elections, but there's a risk to overstate it."
Each party will nonetheless be seeking to make the best of any result, as Democrats did in suggesting that Mr. Schwarzenegger's election reflected an anti-incumbency spirit among voters that could carry over to the presidential campaign.
"You always want to point to momentum," said Tracey Evans, chief operating officer of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, an organization that tracks political advertising. "If Republicans win, they'll point to momentum for the party going into the presidential election. If Democrats win, they'll use it to say it's not good news for Bush."
Here in Kentucky, where Gov. Paul E. Patton, a Democrat, is stepping down after two terms as required by law, Representative Ernie Fletcher, a third-term Republican, is running against the Democratic state attorney general, Ben Chandler. In Mississippi, Haley Barbour, Washington lobbyist and former Republican national chairman, is challenging the Democratic incumbent, Ronnie Musgrove.
And in Louisiana, Bobby Jindal, a former health policy adviser in the Bush administration who finished first among 17 candidates in a nonpartisan primary three weeks ago, is facing the Democratic lieutenant governor, Kathleen Blanco, in the runoff. Gov. Mike Foster, a two-term Republican, is barred by law from running again.
Polls show all three races to be exceptionally tight, a circumstance that has prompted a swirl of activity and spending on advertising as the campaigns wane, with both parties promising huge get-out-the-vote efforts.
A presidential visit's benefit for Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Barbour is obvious, at least to them.
"I don't think the election depends on him being here," Mr. Fletcher said, but "if I can get the president to come in, I think that's a good thing."
But so does his opponent. Mr. Chandler places equal blame for a state budget gap of nearly $250 million and the loss of 67,000 jobs in Kentucky since 2001 on the president and Mr. Fletcher, whose voting record strongly mirrors administration positions.
"I'm glad he's coming," Mr. Chandler said of Mr. Bush. "He energizes our people, gets them all juiced up."
The same is true in Mississippi, said Rickey Cole, the Democratic chairman there. "Bush coming here," Mr. Cole said, "is the best tool we have to mobilize people."
Both candidates in Kentucky are campaigning on themes of change, pointing to eight tumultuous years under Mr. Patton that have included a sex scandal involving him, indictments of two close advisers on charges of violating campaign finance law and a state economy that has foundered.
Mr. Fletcher, who would be Kentucky's first Republican governor in 32 years, has made this his campaign mantra: "We need some fresh faces. We need to clean up the mess."
On the attack, he has described Mr. Chandler as part of the problem. But Mr. Chandler, in his own version of events, boasts of being the Democratic attorney general who took on a Democratic governor by bringing indictments against his chief of staff and labor liaison and leading other investigations into corruption.
"Change is a message we've pushed hard," Mr. Chandler said. "With independence and courage, I've demonstrated one time after another that I'm willing to take on even my own party."
Racial politics has also emerged as an issue in Kentucky, as it has in Mississippi.
The Kentucky Republican Party has announced plans to send poll-watchers to a number of black precincts to ensure the integrity of the vote. Poll-watching anywhere in the state is a right of either party, and Mr. Fletcher and other Republican officials say the precincts at issue have produced irregular results in past elections. But Democrats call the plan an effort to suppress black turnout.
In Mississippi, Mr. Barbour's wearing a lapel pin that bears a Confederate logo has roiled some black voters. If it spurs them to vote, it could well help Mr. Musgrove, who needs a big black turnout to offset Mr. Barbour's greater appeal among whites. Blacks account for about a third of the state's voting-age population.
The larger issues in Mississippi, where the campaign's cost of more than $16 million has made it the most expensive in state history, have been Mr. Musgrove's stewardship during a time of economic decline, and whether Mr. Barbour is the better choice to reverse the trend.
That question has crystallized in the debate over who has been doing what for the last four years. Mr. Barbour has a home in Yazoo City but has spent most of the last two decades in Washington, where he counts Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney as close friends. He says that would be an advantage to the state.
Mr. Musgrove, arguing that Mississippi's problems are a result of national policies, links Mr. Barbour to those who set them.
Four years ago, in victory, Mr. Musgrove failed to reach 50 percent of the popular vote. So by law, the race was decided by the Mississippi House of Representatives. Luckily for him as another tight campaign nears conclusion, Democrats still hold an enormous margin there.

To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman ("A Big Quarter," column, Oct. 31) points to the true statistic of the last quarter: increased debt. 
It is obvious that President Bush's tax cuts didn't give people enough money to buy cars, homes and high-priced entertainment systems. It is likely that the little cuts he did provide, when combined with the Fed's irresponsibly low interest rates, inspired more Americans to go into debt. 
 This shortsighted economics is enough for a myopic White House to do a victory lap, but it should not be seen as a success. Once again, Mr. Bush is postponing the problem till the next generation.

HEADLINE: An Infuriating Success; 
Schumer Draws Fire for Tactics Blocking Judicial Nominees

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When Charles E. Schumer recommended using an extreme tactic the filibuster -- to block some Bush administration nominees for federal judgeships, he put himself in the cross hairs of the president's Republican and conservative allies. 
 Over the last two years, Mr. Schumer has used almost every maneuver available to a Senate Judiciary Committee member to block the appointment of the more controversial judges nominated by the Bush administration, drawing fire from the political right for both his method and his success. 
 As a member of the panel, he has chided certain nominees and their supporters,most famously when he accused Miguel Estrada, a Washington lawyer nominated to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, of stonewalling. He also asked him to cite Supreme Court cases he most admired and deplored. Mr. Estrada refused to answer, earning him the reputation among Democrats as the Bush administration's stealth right-wing candidate. 
It was also Mr. Schumer's staff that dug up controversial information about certain Bush nominees and then disseminated it to reporters and Democrats. Among the handouts were the writings of James Leon Holmes, a lawyer and former president of Arkansas Right to Life, who wrote that conception from rape occurs with "the same frequency as snowfall in Miami" and who compared abortion-rights advocates to Nazis.
Most important, people on Capitol Hill say, Mr. Schumer urged Democratic colleagues in the Senate to use a tactic that some were initially reluctant to pursue, and that has since roiled the Senate: a filibuster on the floor of the chamber to block votes on nominees he and other Democrats had decided to oppose. The resulting standoff has Democrats and Republicans on the committee so tense that some joke that they need to come to work with bodyguards.
All of this has made Mr. Schumer, the senior senator from New York, a lightning rod for Republican and right-wing critics, ranking him right up there on the loathing scale with Hillary Rodham Clinton, New York's junior senator, and Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts senator.
Talk radio, newspaper columns and Internet sites are filled with wrath over what they see as the senator's self-appointment as the arbiter of who is worthy of a federal judgeship. One conservative group has included him in a pack of playing cards as one of the 55 most dangerous liberals in America.
Conservative leaders and columnists have called him anti-Catholic because of his opposition to nominees espousing traditional Catholic values, such as Mr. Estrada and Bill Pryor, the Alabama attorney general. He has also been accused of being anti-Hispanic for opposing Mr. Estrada, and of being anti-black for opposing Janice Rogers Brown, a conservative member of the California Supreme Court.
"It's obvious to me that many of the president's judicial nominees want to return us not just to the 1930's, but to the 1890's," Mr. Schumer said as hearings on the Brown nomination opened last month.
The conservative wing of the Republican Party immediately struck back. Thomas Sowell, the conservative economist and writer, excoriated the senator in a column that ran under the headline "A Lynch Mob Gathers."
"Why this bitter determination to prevent Justice Brown's nomination from even being voted on?" he wrote. He said that Justice Brown came across as "a very thoughtful, intelligent, and articulate black woman" during the hearings. "It could be hard for some senators to go against public opinion and vote against her. To people like shameless Schumer, the obvious answer is to prevent any vote at all."
Some of this has Mr. Schumer puzzled. He sees himself largely as a moderate, and he said he has tried to avoid partisan battles. Some Democrats say the Schumer camp fears that some fights might lead the senator to be marginalized in a Congress that is dominated by Republicans.
Rather, Mr. Schumer has tried to cast himself as a bipartisan pragmatist, in the tradition of one of his political idols, former Senator Jacob K. Javits, a Republican moderate from New York.
He has, in some ways, been so successful that he has drawn criticism from the left for backing other major portions of the Bush agenda, like expanded police powers to combat terrorism, a Congressional resolution authorizing war in Iraq and scores of other Bush judicial nominees.
Political strategists say the moderate reputation he is cultivating provides him political cover to wage an ideological fight over judges and minimizes opposition among New York's moderate swing voters.
Mr. Schumer emphasizes the discretion he says he has used in opposing nominees. He said he picked his battles carefully, blocking only the nominations of those he finds to be out of step with the ideological mainstream of both parties.
The senator, in a recent interview, noted that he has opposed only 11 out of the 159 people the president nominated for seats on the federal bench.
Mr. Schumer also said he actually voted in favor of several nominees whose views are inconsistent with his own, including Jay Bybee, a conservative legal scholar who was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and Deborah Cook, a conservative on the Ohio Supreme Court who was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.
"You have to pick your shots," he said.
"I don't relish this fight," the senator continued. "Rather, I feel it is something I have to do. It's happening because the president is nominating such far-right nominees."
Some fellow politicians and political strategists said the reaction he has stirred clearly underscored his effectiveness in controlling the debate over the ideological shape of the nation's courts.
"If you fail, you're not a problem to them," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., referring to conservatives. Mr. Biden, a Democrat from Delaware who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation battles over Clarence Thomas and Robert H. Bork, said Mr. Schumer, better than most, knows how to get under conservatives' skin.
"There are some senators who have the same views Chuck has," Mr. Biden said. "But conservatives don't worry about them because they're not effective."
Meanwhile, back home in heavily Democratic New York, it cannot hurt Mr. Schumer much to be slapped with a lefty label. At the same time, he continues to enjoy significant backing even among Republicans in New York.
A recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac College found that Mr. Schumer enjoyed a higher level of support among Republicans (47 percent said they approve of him, while 35 said they do not) than Gov. George E. Pataki, a three-term Republican incumbent, did among Democrats (36 percent said they approve of him, while 52 percent said they do not).
Mr. Schumer can also afford to pick this fight for another important reason, political strategists say. He has amassed nearly $18 million in campaign funds, even as Republicans are scrambling to find a candidate to run against him next year.
Even conservatives in New York, who have criticized Mr. Schumer bitterly for his stance on judges, acknowledge that he is in a strong position politically as he enters an election year.
"Chuck Schumer doesn't have the negatives of a Hillary Clinton," said Michael Long, New York's Conservative Party chairman. But Mr. Long reiterated his long-held contention that Mr. Schumer has shown a bias against judicial candidates who display deeply held Roman Catholic beliefs against abortion and gay rights.
"He's not a bigot," he said. "But he has a very strong bias."

HEADLINE: Investment in Technology Is Roaring Softly Back 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The government's economic report on Thursday showing a surge in business investment in computers and software came as no surprise to the team at Reel FX Creative Studios, a producer of special effects for television commercials and movie studios.
 This year, it has purchased 80 new machines that render the computer-generated images that are the company's products -- ranging from the brightly colored droplets of sweat trickling off athletes in Gatorade ads to the fires, explosions and dust storms in "Saving Jessica Lynch," a docudrama scheduled for broadcast on NBC tomorrow night. 
 This new low-cost hardware and software has helped Reel FX, based in Dallas, save money and take on new work, too, encouraging its decision makers to add another 80 computers by year-end. "It all adds up to dollars and new opportunities," explained Chuck Peil, executive director of business development for Reel FX. 
Business investment in technology is finally picking up across much of the American economy. Consumer spending, lifted by tax cuts and a home mortgage refinancing boom, was the primary reason the economy grew at its fastest rate since 1984 during the three months ended in September. Yet business spending on information technology -- computer hardware, software and services -- increased at an annual rate of more than 15 percent. This, in fact, was the second consecutive quarter of encouraging growth for information technology investment, which also rose more than 15 percent in the three months ended in June.
"We're seeing sustained growth in this sector in a way we have not seen since early 2000," said Brent Moulton, chief of the division of the Bureau of Economic Analysis that calculates changes in gross domestic product, the scorecard for the economy.
Technology spending is by far the largest single component of business investment, so the recent rise is an encouraging sign that the economic recovery may finally be gaining force as corporate managers become more confident about the future.
Most industry analysts say the government statistics somewhat overstate the strength in technology spending. The investment figures, as with the G.D.P. report itself, are annualized, meaning it is assumed that the quarterly activity continues for a year. That, analysts say, tends to magnify short-term trends.
Another repeated criticism of the government measurements of technology investments centers on the efforts of the Bureau of Economic Analysis to adjust for inflation and product improvements over time. A computer with a microprocessor that runs twice as fast as another or has twice the data-storage capacity, analysts say, is not necessarily twice as valuable or productive. Still, the 15 percent gain in information technology investment in the recent quarter is the measurement in current dollars, rather than the one adjusted for price and performance changes over time, which shows an even more dramatic increase of more than 18 percent.
"The technology sector is not as good as it looks in the government numbers, but it's still strong," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. 
Mr. Milunovich noted that the third-quarter results for the 100 technology companies that Merrill Lynch tracks averaged a 9 percent gain in revenue and a 27 percent gain in profit.
But a crucial question, analysts say, is whether the recent strength in technology spending can be maintained. Some of the gains, analysts and industry executives say, are a result of companies' finally buying new personal computers and getting rid of machines that were purchased years ago but were not replaced during the economic downturn. That effect may fade in the months ahead.
"In the corporate market, it is about classic replacement cycles," said Jim McDonnell, senior vice president for sales in Hewlett-Packard's personal computer division. "The machines are getting old, some are coming off lease and many companies are upgrading."
In the United States, personal computer shipments increased 19 percent in the three months ended in September, compared with the year-earlier quarter, according to Gartner, a research firm. The revenue gain was about half that level, because of lower prices, and the consumer market was stronger than the corporate market.
But on the plus side, sales of notebook computers equipped with wireless communications were strong in the corporate market, because more companies want their employees to work efficiently as they travel.
Economists say the consumer spending cycle -- in part because it was helped by the recent tax cuts and in part because many Americans spent so readily right through the downturn that there is less pent-up demand -- is probably more fragile than technology investment.
"The technology equipment cycle should be strong for longer because of the need for productivity growth for companies to remain competitive," said David A. Wyss, chief economist for Standard & Poor's. "And information technology is the main productivity tool in our economy."
That is certainly the view at Capital One, a large bank and credit card marketer. Its technology budget is growing by about 10 percent a year, notes Gregor Bailar, the chief information officer. That is somewhat less than Capital One's assets and profits have increased recently, but regardless of the economic cycle technology is regarded more as a competitive tool than as a target of cost-cutting. At its seven data centers in the United States, the bank uses data-analysis software and business-intelligence systems to help tailor credit card and loan offerings to customers, reduce loan delinquencies and improve profitability.
"Information technology is a big piece of our strategy," Mr. Bailar said. "Our businesses are fueled by technology."
The technology investment by small and medium-size companies has so far been stronger than by large corporations, who have tended to be the most reluctant spenders. Yet signs are emerging that big companies, too, are getting ready to spend more.
Perhaps more than anyone else, I.B.M. is the technology supplier to big companies. When I.B.M. reported its quarterly results last month, Samuel J. Palmisano, the chief executive, said, "As we look to 2004, more customers are expected to increase their investments in information technology." And Mr. Palmisano took the unusual step of saying that I.B.M. planned to add 10,000 workers in fields of emerging demand over the next year.
Most industry analysts are predicting that overall information technology spending next year will increase by 4 percent to 6 percent -- respectable growth but nothing like the late 1990's when double-digit annual growth was the norm.
"But within that modest growth is a tidal shift in where the dollars are being spent," said Martin Reynolds, a research fellow at Gartner.
That shift is the advance of technology from the personal computer industry and the Internet into all facets of computing, especially data centers that have traditionally been the bailiwick of mainframes and big computers running Unix software. Increasingly, these costly machines are being supplanted by lower-cost computers powered by PC microprocessors, produced by Intel or Advanced Micro Devices, and running Microsoft's Windows or the open-source Linux operating system.
Software applications written by companies are increasingly conforming to Web technology standards, which can be written quickly and are available for access on any device that has browsing software.
Even companies that have been paring their overall technology spending in recent years are, at the same time, investing in lower-cost PC-based computers and shifting their software development to Internet and Web standards.
General Motors, for example, has steadily trimmed its information technology budget in recent years. Yet it spends about $500 million a year in developing new software applications for internal use and tweaking existing applications. "I can't think of anything really that we do today that isn't Web-based," said Daniel G. McNicholl, chief strategy officer for the information systems and services group at General Motors.
In Dallas, Reel FX is also trying to capitalize on the use of low-cost industry standard hardware and software to gain an edge. Until recently, the company had done its special-effects work exclusively on more costly machines, running versions of the Unix operating system. But this year's big purchases have all been computers made by Dell Computer, powered by Intel microprocessors and running the Linux operating system, distributed by Red Hat.
Mr. Peil estimates the cost savings at more than 30 percent, but also cited greater speed and flexibility in its operations. Reel FX has taken on more work and doubled its payroll in the last year, to 60 people. The company is now working on its own feature-length computer-animated movie. It may not be a Pixar or ILM yet, but Mr. Peil says Reel FX is on its way.
"The technology," he declared, "has really allowed us to enter this world."

HEADLINE: Barometers of Economy Register Gains 

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
The mood of American consumers brightened a little in October, according to reports yesterday.
 A separate report on Midwest businesses showed a jump in activity in October and an encouraging lift in employment there to its highest level since January 2000, bolstering optimism that the economic recovery is on solid ground. 
 The University of Michigan said its index of consumer sentiment for October rose to 89.6 from 87.7, the first increase in three months and one in line with forecasts. 
The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago reported that its business barometer rose to 55.0 from an unexpectedly weak 51.2 in September. The figure was close to forecasts but included an unexpected surge in the employment component to 53.1 from 45.3.
That increase has raised hopes that the national payrolls report for October, expected next week, could show another moderate gain after the rise in September, which was the first in eight months. Preliminary forecasts are for a rise of 55,000 jobs, after the gain of 57,000 in September. 
Even though the economy has gathered steam in recent months, the labor market has lagged. More than 2.7 million jobs have been lost in the last three years. 
"This is the same reluctant hiring we saw in 1992, but it will transform into a more optimistic trend if the economy does not falter in the next couple of quarters," said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial. 
The Federal Reserve has said plainly that it has no intention of raising interest rates until it is sure the economy is firing on all cylinders, and the risk of a fall in inflation has been removed. This week, the Fed voted to keep its short-term interest rate target at a 45-year low of 1 percent. The report on the Chicago area showed a further sharp drop in inventories, which suggests businesses are not keeping up with demand and will have to increase production in coming months to restock their shelves.
The Commerce Department said yesterday that personal spending fell 0.3 percent in September after upwardly revised gains of 1.1 percent in August and 1.0 percent in July, showing consumer spending losing momentum as the third quarter ended.
Adjusted for inflation, spending was off a sharper 0.6 percent.
Much of the slowdown was anticipated because auto and retail sales weakened in September.
"Consumer spending should be down noticeably this quarter to about 2 to 2.5 percent, compared to 6.6 percent last quarter," said Joseph LaVorgna, a Deutsche Bank economist.

HEADLINE: Arrest of Russian Billionaire Captures Attention of Germany 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
The shock waves from last week's arrest of the Russian billionaire Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky have spread widely, but not evenly, through the club of international investors.
 Here in Germany, Russia's largest trading partner, large-scale investors said that they remained committed to the country. That is hardly surprising, given that they have poured billions of euros into energy-distribution deals, pipeline projects and even equity investments in Russian companies. 
 But experts say would-be investors within Europe, particularly midsize companies, are likely to shelve their plans until the legal storm surrounding Mr. Khodorkovsky and his oil company, Yukos, dies down. 
"This comes at a very unfortunate time," said Alexander de Faria, the chairman of the East-West Development Group, which advises European companies on investing in Russia. "Middle-sized companies had been lining up to go to Russia. Those investments are going to be deferred."
Mr. de Faria said the confusion stirred by the arrest, and the Russian government's freezing of $12 billion in Yukos shares, could reverse many of the country's recent strides in attracting investors.
Russia's sovereign credit rating, he said, had recently been lifted to investment grade by Moody's Investors Service. The German financial press had begun writing about Russia's robust growth and the stable government of President Vladimir V. Putin, rather than seamy tales of corrupt oligarchs.
"German investors always say they worry about the mafia or about having their property expropriated," Mr. de Faria said. "But that attitude was relaxing. People were calling to ask me about Russia."
In the wake of the Yukos affair, they may revert to their old fear of Russia as a political tinderbox.
"Investors have been paying too much attention to the improvement in Russia's credit ratings, and too little to domestic political tension," Jonathan Garner, the managing director of global equity strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston, said in a conference call on Friday with clients.
A German retreat would hurt Moscow more than Berlin. Germany is Russia's fifth-largest foreign direct investor, accounting for 8 percent of its $19.4 billion in cumulative foreign investment, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
More important, Germany is Russia's largest trading partner, soaking up 20 percent of its exports in 2002, much of it natural gas. Russia, by contrast, is Germany's 14th-largest trading partner, trailing France, the United States and even the Czech Republic.
Germany does rely heavily on Russia for imported gas, which may explain why the German natural gas distributor, Ruhrgas, played down the effect of the Yukos crisis on its Russian supply lines.
"Our cooperation with Russia is of a long-term nature and has never been disturbed in the past by isolated events," Burckhard Bergmann, the chairman of Ruhrgas, said in a statement. "It is not possible to objectively judge the Yukos case without knowledge of the facts."
A spokeswoman for Ruhrgas, Astrid Zimmermann, noted that the company had imported gas from Russia without interruption since 1973 -- weathering an oil crisis, cold war tensions, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the economic and political dislocations of the 1990's.
In 1998, Ruhrgas bought a stake in the Russian gas giant, Gazprom, which has since grown to 6.5 percent. That stake jumped in value on Friday after President Putin pledged to lift restrictions on the foreign ownership of Gazprom's stock, sending the company's shares soaring. 
Mr. Putin also named the chairman of Gazprom's board, Dmitri A. Medvedev, as his new chief of staff, replacing Aleksandr S. Voloshin, who had resigned to protest the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky.
Ruhrgas, part of the E.ON group, is currently negotiating with Gazprom to build a $5.7 billion gas pipeline that will snake from Russia, under the Baltic Sea, to Germany and other parts of Western Europe.
The divergent fortunes of Gazprom and Yukos suggest to some foreign investors that this crisis is a personal feud between Mr. Putin and Mr. Khodorkovsky, not the start of a campaign by the government to renationalize all the assets it sold to the oligarchs during the Yeltsin era.
"Some of these oligarchs were more pushy than the others," Mr. de Faria said. "Khodorkovsky was one of the pushy ones."
Some German executives noted ruefully that they had hoped Mr. Putin would crack down on corruption in business, particularly the role of the oligarchs. The arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky, with its political overtones, illustrates the old saying "be careful what you wish for."
"Investors just have to swallow some things," said Werner Hein, a lawyer who represents German companies investing in Russia. "The situation goes up and down, and one has to take the long view."
The damage from the Yukos affair could flow both ways. While some German investors question their plans to go to Russia, Russian companies with international ambitions worry that they will betainted.
Christoph Walther, a German public relations executive who handled the 1998 merger of DaimlerChrysler, spent this week in Moscow, meeting with Russian companies who are interested in expanding abroad or raising capital from foreign investors. The subject of Yukos dominated his meetings.
"They are definitely concerned that this could have long-lasting negative effects on how they are perceived," Mr. Walther said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Close Mixed, but S.&P. Hits a 17-Month High

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed to its highest level in 17 months yesterday as strong earnings and merger news helped the stock market shake off a weak consumer spending report. The three main gauges posted a weekly and monthly gain.
 Trading was choppy as the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. bounced above and below 52-week highs for most of the day. Analysts said largely positive economic news persuaded investors that the economic recovery was on track. 
 "There have been two competing forces," said Brian Pears, head equity trader at Victory Capital Management in Cleveland. "Although stocks are somewhat fairly priced, investors feel it's reasonable to purchase securities at these levels because the news has been so good."
The S.&P. 500 index rose 3.77 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,050.71. It was the highest level since May 31, 2002, when the index closed at 1,067.14.
The Dow Jones industrials gained 14.51 points, or 0.2 percent, at 9,801.12, for a five-day gain of nearly 219 points. The blue chips fell short of a 52-week high reached on Oct. 14, when the Dow stood at 9,812.98.
Technology stocks edged lower, however. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.48 point, or 0.02 percent, to 1,932.21.
For the week, the Dow rose 2.3 percent, the Nasdaq gained 3.6 percent, and the S.&P. rose 2.1 percent. For October, the Dow advanced 5.7 percent, the Nasdaq rose 8.1 percent, and the S.&P. gained 5.5 percent.
Before trading began, the government reported that consumers kept a tighter grip on their wallets in September, reducing spending by 0.3 percent. Analysts had expected a 0.1 percent drop. Consumer spending had risen 1.1 percent in August and 1 percent in July. Still, Americans' incomes rose 0.3 percent in September for the third consecutive month, slightly better than the 0.2 percent increase analysts had expected. 
Heavy consumer spending in the summer months helped bolster economic growth to a 7.2 percent pace in the third quarter, the strongest performance in nearly 20 years, according to a government report released Thursday. 
Stocks got some support from news that the Israeli company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries said it would acquire Sicor of Irvine, Calif., for $3.4 billion. Shares of Teva fell 79 cents, to $56.92, but Sicor rose $1.81, to $26.78.
A spate of merger news, including the announcement on Monday of Bank of America's planned purchase of FleetBoston Financial, has given investors more confidence in the business climate over the last few sessions.
But analysts cautioned that the market was probably due for pullbacks in the weeks ahead. With the earnings season winding down, and stocks at or near new highs, investors will have little incentive to send stocks higher.
"We are becoming very skeptical about the market's prospects for further near-term gains," said Richard Dickson, senior market strategist at Lowry's Research Reports in Palm Beach, Fla., in a market commentary. Describing much of the last week's trading, he said the action of the market "appeared to indicate a rally that was rapidly running out of momentum."
Companies reporting higher earnings were rewarded yesterday.
Anadarko Petroleum and ChevronTexaco reported third-quarter earnings that beat analysts' estimates. Anadarko shares rose 77 cents, to $43.62, while ChevronTexaco advanced $2.54, to $74.30.
The health insurer Cigna also reported better-than-expected profits and projected that net earnings from health care would rise 10 percent this year from last. Its shares were up $9.08, or 18.9 percent, at $57.05.
Archer Daniels Midland, the agribusiness giant, said earnings rose about 40 percent from a year ago. Its shares rose 78 cents, to $14.35.
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, to a price of 99 21/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 4.29 percent from 4.35 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 1 1/32, to 103 19/32. The bond's yield dropped to 5.14 percent from 5.20 percent on Thursday.

 EDISON AND THE ELECTRIC CHAIR
A Story of Light and Death.
By Mark Essig.
Walker, $26.
 One of Thomas Edison's most important inventions was the incandescent light bulb. Mark Essig focuses on a deadly parallel to the popularization of Edison's breakthrough. "Although in 1887 Edison had said he would 'join heartily in an effort to totally abolish capital punishment,' a year later he became the most powerful advocate of this new method of scientific killing," Essig writes in his first book, "Edison and the Electric Chair." "Like other defenders of the electrical execution law, he claimed that a powerful current would be far more humane than hanging." Although Edison was truly concerned with human suffering in executions, he was more concerned with his own financial interests; in what Essig aptly describes as "one of the strangest hustles in the history of American business," Edison backed the invention and use of the electric chair to expand his business empire. His system for home and office electrification ran on low-voltage direct current, while that of his main competitor, George Westinghouse, was powered by high-voltage alternating current. Edison argued that executions should use alternating current because it was more deadly, implying that it was more dangerous to the public as well. And the best way to protect the public was by replacing Westinghouse's wires with Edison's. Ultimately, his plan was a complete failure. Not only did the more economical alternating current become the norm, but also, as Essig writes, "by making executions appear painless, Edison helped the death penalty survive." John D. Thomas

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
Europe and U.S. at Odds On Airlines and Privacy

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: Paris 

 BODY:
TWO years after Congress passed the Aviation and Security Act of 2001, requiring airlines to collect information on their passengers so that Customs officials could check for security threats, Europe is objecting that the amount and the kind of information its airlines are required to supply violate European privacy laws. The trans-Atlantic differences have put Europe's airlines in a bind. If they comply with American requirements, they violate European law; if they don't, they may be penalized by the United States.
 So far no European airline has been punished for noncompliance. But the potential penalties are severe. They could begin with the authorization of individual passenger interviews at the arrival of each flight, a procedure that would delay some passengers up to several hours; they could include fines or the revoking of landing rights, penalties that would severely punish European carriers flying to the United States. 
As much as some European authorities would like to help their airlines, European Union privacy laws prohibit full compliance with the demands imposed by the American legislation. The Department of Homeland Security has composed a list of 39 categories of information about each foreign passenger planning to fly to the United States, ranging from name and date of intended travel to luggage tag numbers, but also including sensitive payment information and billing and e-mail addresses, to be supplied before a passenger arrives.
 European officials maintain their willingness to stand by the United States in its war against terrorism. But by and large Europe has been more sensitive about divulging personal information in the computer age than the United States has. Much of the housing and personal-finance information that is readily available about Americans is protected by strict European privacy laws. 
 European officials justify their stand by citing recent examples of the privacy issues that have been raised by the Bush administration's airline-security campaign. Two federal agencies announced in September that they were investigating JetBlue Airways in response to the airline's admission that it illegally provided a Pentagon contractor with information about more than one million of its passengers as part of a program to track high-risk passengers. They cite news reports that the Bush administration is using expanded authority under the U.S.A. Patriot Act in criminal investigations that have little or nothing to do with terrorism.
 Last March the European Union gave airlines permission to comply temporarily with the requests from the United States even though they violate European privacy laws. Now the E.U. is trying to negotiate a formal solution that will respect European privacy laws while providing the United States the information it says it needs.
 In recent weeks the union's commissioner in charge of data-protection issues, Frits Bolkestein, has been meeting with Asa Hutchinson, the under secretary for transportation security at the Department of Homeland Security, to reach a compromise. This summer, Homeland Security appointed a chief privacy officer, Nuala O'Connor Kelly, in part to allay European concerns. But the Europeans have argued that since Ms. O'Connor Kelly reports to the department's hierarchy, she cannot be considered an independent arbiter.
 After the last meeting in Brussels in September, Mr. Bolkestein and Mr. Hutchinson continued to disagree about the kind of information the airlines should be required to provide, how long it should be kept and for what purposes it should be used.
 Mr. Bolkestein told Mr. Hutchinson that access to the information should be limited to anti-terrorism purposes. A further meeting in Washington last month, between Mr. Bolkestein and Tom Ridge, the Homeland Security secretary, also made little headway. Although both men said after their meeting that they hoped to reach an agreement by the end of the year, they did not say how.
 European officials say the number of questions asked should be limited to 19, down from the present 39, and that the answers should be stored for no longer than three years, not seven years as the United States wants. The European Union objects to requests for information like how tickets were paid for and a passenger's billing and e-mail addresses, as well as information in a vague category described as "general remarks." Moreover, the Europeans oppose using the information to investigate crimes -- like armed robbery and murder -- that do not involve terrorism, although they do not object to its use in investigating drug traffickers and money launderers, whose activities are sometimes used to finance terrorism.
 Mr. Bolkestein said recently that any bilateral agreement with the United States should be only a first step toward an accord involving many countries. "The question about passenger data is an international problem," he said.
 The airlines, for their part, have embraced a proposal put forth by Austria to create a European data-storage facility to which the airlines would transfer passenger information. The European Union would then decide what information to give to the United States, lifting the burden from the airlines.
 "It essentially takes us out of the loop," said David Henderson, the spokesman for the Association of European Airlines in Brussels. But agreement is blocked, he said, by a dispute about who should provide the estimated $193,000 needed to build the storage facility. "The commission believes the airlines should not be penalized," he said, referring to the European Union's executive arm. "But they're having a dreadful time convincing the national governments."

HEADLINE: SAN FRANCISCO FOR LESS GOLD 

BYLINE:  By MEGAN HARLAN; MEGAN HARLAN is a writer and poet who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO may have swooned, for a while, over the $1,000 tasting menus and college-dropout millionaires of the dot-com boom. But since the economic and tourism slumps, the city not only offers deals to travelers, but its arts scene -- as if awakened from a nap -- seems refreshed and ready for work. Call it the creative upside of the downturn.
 My assignment -- or challenge, as I thought of it -- was to spend an inexpensive cultural weekend in San Francisco. A $500 budget was to cover a marathon run of the city's arts scene for myself and my husband, Matthew, and food and a hotel. 
 I wanted to see a play, hear live music, and view as much art as I could process in a weekend. For events, I relied on Citysearch.com and SFArts.org (the latter, sponsored by San Francisco Arts Monthly, is a boon for budget travelers, allowing searches for free events by date). 
 But we did much more: besides seeing a play, we logged five music performances, a poetry festival, dance recital, walking tour and dinner at a trendy new restaurant. I visited more than a half-dozen museums and galleries. We kept stumbling across artistic happenings; short of hiding in a Gap dressing room, it seemed we couldn't avoid them.
 None of this would have been feasible without an affordable hotel -- and as San Francisco residents, we knew the challenge this could pose. So my very first task was to scour listings on sites like Expedia and Orbitz, where I found bargains in the $120 range. Still, I felt I needed to go cheaper, and settled on the Andrews Hotel, two blocks west of Union Square, with $99 rooms for the warm, late-September weekend we checked in.
 Built in 1905 as a Turkish bathhouse and now affiliated with the stylish local hotel management company Joie de Vivre, the 48-room Andrews doesn't scream hip. But the reservation for our clean, cozy, queen-bed room decorated in floral prints, with full bath, came directly through the Andrews, so I avoided fees from discount travel Web sites. Another plus was that the Andrews offers a disappearing luxury at downtown San Francisco budget hotels: Continental breakfast is included. This proved crucial to staying within our means. 
 With tax, two nights came to $225.72. That left $274.28 to eat, drink and make merry. Friday evening, we kicked things off on a thrifty note with free glasses of wine -- one per guest per night from 5:30 to 7 p.m. -- offered by the Andrews at Fino, a restaurant off the lobby (tip: $2). 
 Just around the corner, we enjoyed a quick pretheater dinner at Akiko Sushi Bar. The mint-green space is tiny, the sushi fat and fresh. Two chef's specials, one with a large beer, cost $25.16.
 For theater choices, I'd considered "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" by the wonderful American Conservatory Theater at the Geary Theater, a block from the Andrews. That afternoon, I visited the TIX Pavilion, Union Square's discount ticket counter, which had $70 orchestra seats at half price (still too much), with second-balcony seats running $19. I chose instead $16 tickets for the West Coast premiere of David Lindsay-Abaire's postmodern comedy, "Wonder of the World," playing at the Eureka Theater, a 200-seat classic black space a 10-minute walk away. After the funny, frisky production, we nibbled brie at the cast party, and decided that this experience beat the worst seats in a fancier house. 
 The balmy evening inspired us to continue. Back on Market, we caught a refurbished vintage Chicago streetcar, the Green Hornet (free, because of a broken meter), down to Cafe du Nord, a crimson, candlelight music club and former speakeasy. For a $10 cover, we heard a local psychedelic pop band, Oranger -- a fresh shade of the city's musical past. Two drinks at the gleaming redwood bar were $10 with tip. After a hook-filled set, a streetcar back down Market was $1.25 each.
 Day's total: $204.52.
 Saturday, Matthew and I woke early to raid the Continental breakfast -- fresh pastries, fruit, juice and coffee, handily laid out on each floor. Then we headed off to the 10 a.m. tour meeting outside SS. Peter and Paul Church in North Beach. 
I am not a tour person. But I'm glad I kept an open mind for this eclectic -- and free -- walking tour of North Beach, one of several dozen by San Francisco City Guides (supported by the San Francisco Public Library). The personable guide, Gail Todd, pointed out wild parrots in Washington Square Park and the gentrification of Grant Avenue, amid stops at former Beat haunts like the Coffee Gallery (now the bar Lost and Found), where she confessed to having seen Allen Ginsberg read poetry back in the day. Tip: $5.
 After two hours of passing the neighborhood's fragrant Italian bakeries and restaurants, we were famished, and stopped for lunch at a local landmark, the Molinari Delicatessen. Two subs -- huge, delicious and a steal at $4.75 -- eaten in the small sidewalk seating area, sustained us until dinner. Total: $14.90. 
 We caught a bus ($2.50 total) to the wooden bayside warehouses of Fort Mason Center, a vibrant association of theaters, museums and galleries in the Marina District. The Mexican Museum ($3 apiece) had only two rooms, but was worth it just for Alfonso Soteno's marvelous, towering ceramic "Tree of Life," lavishly petaled with flowers, people, angels and animals. 
 Three warehouses down, the Museum of Craft and Folk Art ($4 for me, since my husband passed) displayed work by artists using everyday materials. Exquisite metal suitcases by Mariko Kusumoto, filled with little numbered doors opening, like Advent calendars, onto such objects as Buddhas and treasure chests struck me as metaphors for travel and discovery. 
 And they set the mood for the Asian Art Museum ($10), in a serene, Beaux-Arts building at the Civic Center (bus ride free with transfer). Inside, we took in a mesmerizing Indonesian dance recital in the Samsung Hall, host to performances each afternoon. Then, after coffee and a piece of candy ($3.91 total) in the cafe, we lost ourselves in the tranquil galleries. I lingered in the jade room, with its milky rainbow of vases, and before the Tibetan thangkas, or sacred wall-hangings, with powdered pigments symbolizing aspects of wisdom, and depicting the Buddha on mountains threaded with rivers.
 Feeling rather meditative, we strolled to the day's final art stop, the unassuming office building at 49 Geary. On the fourth floor, the renowned Fraenkel Gallery is celebrating a quarter-century of showing photography with "The Eye Club" through Nov. 29, featuring haunting portraits by artists like Berenice Abbott and Paul Strand. We wandered through the floor's several other galleries, including Lizabeth Oliveria's, showing playful, cartoon-style thangka paintings by the local artist Stella Lai.
 After a quick rest at the hotel, we took the train ($2.50 total) to the Mission District, where we had reservations that turned out to be essential at the recently opened Last Supper Club. The open-kitchen atmosphere attracts a young, easygoing crowd. Homey cheese ravioli and a grilled half-chicken (both $12), mashed potatoes ($4.25) and a beer came to $43.35, with tip. 
 Walking four blocks, we arrived at Bruno's, a dark jazz club, at 8:50 p.m. -- thereby avoiding the $7 cover charged after 9:30 p.m. Refurbished to its early-60's lounge splendor, Bruno's boasts huge, semicircular white vinyl booths. We nursed our $7 martini-glass cocktails ($17 total) until Dapp Theory came on. The five-man jazz-funk ensemble unleashed dizzyingly layered rhythms, with the John Coltrane of harmonica players and a spoken-word vocalist. We said: Cool, daddy-o. And the thing is, it really was.
 Saturday's total, with $2.50 for a bus back to the hotel: $234.52.
 A COUPLE we had met at the club raved about the gospel ensemble at Glide Memorial United Methodist Church. On Sunday, we walked three blocks to the packed 9 a.m. service, in which the charismatic Rev. Douglass Fitch welcomed all faiths and quoted the Dalai Lama. But it was the diverse, 140-strong choir that moved churchgoers to tears belting out gorgeous powerhouse gospel. Donation: $5. 
 Ready for more inspiration, we proceeded to the soaring, striped-granite turret of the Museum of Modern Art in SoMa (South of Market). I'd bought two $15 tickets online, which included a $5 charge for the Marc Chagall exhibition -- five rooms of his dreamily narrative visions of artists, lovers and animals on view until Nov. 4. A starker humanism was found at the exhibit from the museum's excellent photography collection, "Picturing Modernity," with unsentimental highlights like Robert Frank's "Iowa," capturing a dance hall.
 We revived at the museum's light, bright Caffe Museo, with lunch treats like smoked salmon salad ($10.30) and chicken focaccia sandwich ($8.50) -- worthy of a foodie town. Total with latte: $20.70 
 Across the street glistened the waterfalls, esplanades, gardens and galleries of Yerba Buena Center for the Arts -- a two-block contemporary-art complex in Yerba Buena Gardens. And outside the center, we happened upon oneof a series of free events, showcasing Italian art, organized by the Yerba Buena Gardens Festival. The classical guitarist Peppino D'Agostino played supple flamenco, and San Francisco Lyric Opera stars sung popular arias. We roused ourselves from an excerpt from "La Boheme" to catch a bus ($2.50) to the International Poetry Festival.
We climbed Russian Hill to the graceful Italian-inspired buildings of the San Francisco Art Institute. We were late, so we missed all but the last, very moving reader, Peter Streckfus, who won this year's Yale Series of Younger Poets competition. The school's top terrace had views of the Bay, and on our way out, we visited the Diego Rivera Gallery, devoted to student art and Rivera's mural, "The Making of a Fresco Showing the Building of a City," full of invention and motion.
 For a weekend exploring urban creativity, it provided a fitting final image. And the gallery was free, bringing the weekend's grand total to $497.24.

Using Stamford's Master Plan to Steer Development

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
THE city of Stamford adopted its latest master plan barely a year ago, but the document has been getting heavy use. It formed the basis for zoning changes that require affordable multifamily housing and is being employed by a number of citizen groups to try to head off or change development proposals that they object to.
 The plan was approved in October 2002, incorporating input from Robert Lane of the Regional Plan Association; John Shapiro of the planning firm of Phillips Preiss Shapiro Associates; Robin Stein, the land use planner for Stamford; the Stamford Planning and Zoning Boards; and the public. 
 Rather than presenting the plan as a fait accompli, the planners held two or three meetings in each of 11 city neighborhoods, and residents vented their frustrations and argued over details. "Each neighborhood brought to bear a certain passion," Mr. Shapiro said. At least 30 suggestions were incorporated into the 500-page document. 
In July, an element of the plan dealing with affordable housing was codified when the Zoning Board created an new inclusionary zone category. This Mr. Stein said, "will allow teachers, fire and police men and women to live in town." It requires developers of multifamily projects to set aside 10 percent of the units for families earning no more than 50 percent of the Stamford median of $112,000 a year. Rent for a family of four is around $1,200 a month; for a family whose income is no more than 30 percent of median, the rent is $600, requiring government subsidy. 
Before the master plan was adopted, developers were not obligated to build what is called affordable housing -- generally, housing affordable by families earning 50 percent or less of an area's median income -- because 13 percent of Stamford's housing units were in that category, exceeding the state's goal of 10 percent per municipality. 
Nevertheless, two years ago, Mr. Stein initiated a requirement that developers make 10 percent of their units affordable, but only for a limited Planned Development District downtown. One result was a 306-apartment rental building called Greyrock. Built by AvalonBay Communities, it was the first of the company's six Stamford projects to include an affordable component. Now that requirement has been extended to new multifamily projects throughout the city. 
The master plan's rationale is to attract a labor force by providing affordable housing. This cause has become a focus of Sacia, the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association, a Fairfield County corporate group. "We hope to create a $20 million second mortgage pool from Stamford businesses and banks for first-time home buyers of existing housing," said Joseph J. McGee, vice president of public policy. It would serve families earning $30,000 to $80,000.
The fund will be administered by the Housing and Development Fund, a private nonprofit agency, which has a $23 million pool from 13 Fairfield County banks and businesses. This money is to be used by developers for acquisition, construction and permanent financing of multifamily housing, said Joan Carty, executive director. 
Residents too seem to be learning how to use the master plan. "We thought things would happen automatically," said Christie Fountain, secretary of the Glenbrook Neighborhood Association. Her area is located just north of the Connecticut Turnpike and west of the Darien line.
"We've seen many commercial businesses change hands," she said, "but not according to the master plan. We were naive. The master plan is just a blueprint. When Mr. Lane came to speak to us recently, we finally understood that the city's zoning categories and the master plan's land use categories don't necessarily match." 
Bearing that in mind, her association has scheduled a hearing before the Planning Board on Thursday requesting that a proposed subdivision of five single family homes at Hope and Frisbie Streets be reduced to four because it is not in keeping with the character of the neighborhood -- a condition spelled out in the master plan. 
Mr. Lane said: "Because Stamford is fully developed, it offers more in-fill opportunities than construction. Residents are extremely interested in how things look."
The Springdale Neighborhood Association, immediately north of Glenbrook, was founded as an antilitter group, but it has planted trees and flowers and installed a tall town clock, and now it works with the Glenbrook association to preserve a community atmosphere. It was jolted when a carwash was built under current zoning in what Marilyn Trefry, president of the group, called "a countrified residential area." 
GLENBROOK and Springdale were independent towns until 1949 when they were incorporated into the city of Stamford. They still have their own train stations on the New Canaan Branch of Metro-North, schools, post offices, shopping and industrial areas, but over the years Hope Street, a north-south artery that runs through both neighborhoods has become a thoroughfare from downtown to the back country, where there are large houses on large lots, and the neighborhoods are targets for spreading commercial and residential development that many residents find unsuitable.
Stamford's population has grown to 120,000 from 108,000 in 1990, and it swells daily with 60,000 inbound commuters, turning highway access and train station parking into bottlenecks. Outbound commuters unable to find space at the Glenbrook and Springdale stations converge on the central Stamford station, where a new 1,100-car garage recently opened behind the existing garage, bringing the total number of spaces to 2,000. Mani Poola, a city traffic engineer, said that may soon be insufficient. 
There are some who doubt that the master plan will have much practical effect. Renee Kahn, founder of Stamford's Historic Neighborhood Preservation Program, said, "Based on past experience over 25 years and two previous master plans, I am a little cynical." A champion of preserving what remained of Stamford's character after its downtown was demolished during urban renewal, she went to the planning meetings initially, but, she said, "If somebody has a better offer for a historic building or anything else, the master plan gets changed."
Citing the master plan's description of East Main Street in the Glenbrook neighborhood as "a commercial-residential neighborhood," she said: "but the mayor wants to turn it into an expressway to relieve traffic on I-95. The neighborhood will be very different as a result." 
Mayor Dannel Malloy has applied to the Federal Transit Administration for $90 million to widen East Main Street and three railroad underpasses at East Main, Atlantic and Elm Streets. The agency would pay 80 percent of the cost, if approved.
"East Main is critical because it's a local road that many people hopping off I-95 use to avoid choke points on the highway," he said. "We've also called for a train stop at East Main that would allow for a substantial number of people living in the area to commute into downtown and New York." 
The master plan builds on plans for Stamford's downtown that were put in motion over the past several years. Dock Square, a $44 million project that is to be financed up to 80 percent by the Federal Transit Administration, is one. It is to provide direct access, now blocked by the railroad and turnpike, from Jefferson Street in the South End to the central train station and downtown Stamford, and from Myrtle Avenue to South Main Street. Negotiations are in progress to acquire 70 properties in its path. 
Sandy Goldstein, executive director of Stamford's Downtown Special Services District, is pleased that the master plan encompasses an initiative by the Planning Board and her organization to make downtown the center of retailing, instead of sprawling south of Interstate 95 and elsewhere. Property owners in the 15 square block area controlled by the Special Services District pay a tax surcharge to provide garbage collection, security personnel, street beautification, an economic development lobbying presence and concerts in Columbus Park.
The effort has caused big stores like Target and Burlington Coat Factory, which recently came to Stamford, to open stores that are different from their standard designs. They installed street level windows and facades that are designed to be compatible with surrounding structures.
Retailing in general is described in the master plan as "not working," and the Town Center Mall, built on about five square blocks of the business district, is given a "modest success" rating. But it is said to have marginalized retailing elsewhere.
Office development or redevelopment is now at a standstill, but under the master plan it is to be limited to downtown. Other issues addressed by the plan include protecting little parks, controlling the clearing of trees by homeowners, preserving low density in the back country, and retaining the diversity of the South End, Waterside and the West Side by upgrading dilapidated housing and stores while maintaining upscale waterfront condos, homes, offices and industrial plants. 
The plan encourages more downtown night life, cultural uses and historic preservation, but says the city should curtail the trend of having offices and businesses move into industrial space.
"Before the master plan," Mr. Stein said, "people could go to a public hearing and object to a project, but if it was within zoning they would end up losing. Now they can go to the Zoning Board beforehand and make the zoning conform to the master plan."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
From Suburban Office Parks to Korean Mega-Project

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA

DATELINE: FLORHAM PARK 

 BODY:
IT is a bit of a stretch to imagine the geopolitical implications of a real estate development half a world away being discussed in this New Jersey suburb of low-rise office buildings, college campuses and single-family homes.
 But the Gale Company, which is headquartered here, is the principal developer of New Songdo City, a mixed-use development on reclaimed land that is part of the city of Inchon in South Korea. 
 The 10-year, $20 billion project is planned to include 40 million square feet of office space, 30 million square feet of residential space, 10 million of retail space, 5 million of hotel space and 10 million of public space. It will be the first new city in the country in hundreds of years, developers say. 
The development is to be tied to the new Inchon International Airport by a six-mile bridge over what Koreans call the West Sea that is now under construction. Promoters say it is to be the front door to Korea and an access point to the burgeoning economy of China.
"This is a huge symbolic and substantive project," said Donald P. Gregg, the president of the Korea Society in New York and a former ambassador to South Korea. He said the country's economic growth, while impressive, had been "hampered by the last remnant of the Cold War."
That is where the geopolitics comes in. The national and city governments are going ahead with the project, despite its being within range of the North Korean cannons massed just north of the zone separating the two countries.
The north's resumption of its nuclear weapons program and the resulting tensions in the region were "a real bump in the road," Mr. Gregg said. But he said the project is expected to proceed because officials in the south "do not expect a military explosion."
Stanley C. Gale, the third generation chairman of the privately owned company, said he did not go looking for a mega-project in the Far East. "We did not plan to do this," he said. "We got an invitation from Korea."
The invitation -- it arrived about three years ago -- was apparently the result of Korean officials' approval of the way Boston is reviving its waterfront and improving the connection between the harbor and the central business district. The Gale Company had recently signed a 20-year lease with State Street Bank for an entire 33-story 1.1-million-square-foot office tower in the downtown area. 
"Our Boston office got a call from representatives of the city of Inchon," Mr. Gale said. "My Boston partner, John Hynes, and I were asked to look at an island in the harbor that they were planning to turn into a city that would be the logistical center of northeast Asia, the way Hong Kong is in the south."
Although the Gale Company -- formerly Gale & Wentworth, until Finn Wentworth went off to become president of the YankeeNets organization -- is best known as the developer of suburban office parks, it had evolved in recent years into a national organization with major offices in Boston and California. It manages 50 million square feet of office space, including the entire AT&T portfolio, and has an ownership interest in 15 million square feet of offices.
It has developed solid links to Wall Street, which provides the financing for its development projects. Mr. Gale said his company is one of the largest real estate partners of Morgan Stanley, a major investment banking company.
"We have evolved from a regional company to a national one that is one of the two or three largest privately owned commercial real estate companies," Mr. Gale said. "And then three years ago we got this invitation."
Since then, the South Korean government has revised its laws and regulations to make Songdo -- the word means pine tree -- attractive for outside investors. Last week Mr. Gale, representatives of Morgan Stanley and others were in Inchon for formalities marking the official start of the project. Construction is expected to commence next summer.
The legal changes make Songdo a Free Economic Zone with economic and social provisions intended to lure foreign investments and executives. These include breaks on taxes and land prices, and financial support for amenities like hospitals and schools. 
These changes reflect South Korea's progress from its position as the poorest country in Asia at the end of the Korean War in the early 1950's to the 13th largest economy in the world. "Most Americans' images of Korea are based on old 'M*A*S*H' reruns," Mr. Gregg said. 
The Gale Company's construction partner will be a unit of Posco, a Korean company that is one of the largest steel makers in the world. The first phase will cost about $2 billion and include two hotels, 5,000 housing units and 1 million square feet of office space. "That is just 10 percent of the project," Mr. Gale said.
THE first phase will also include a trade and convention center, one private and four public schools, a golf course and Central Park, covering 60 acres.
The project is built on land created by dredging sand from the sea and piling on the material on the shallow flats near where Gen. Douglas MacArthur made his counterinvasion during the Korean War. More than 5,000 acres was created this way, with about 1,400 acres devoted to the Songdo project. 
It is described as an "intelligent city," where industrial, commercial, residential and recreational areas are being planned around carefully placed transportation links. In the end, about 30 percent of the project is to be open space, with the large Central Park and smaller neighborhood parks and greenways to connect them. The architect for the project is Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates of New York.
Songdo represents the first major effort by South Korea to reach out to the rest of the world, Mr. Gale said. "Seoul is not an outreaching international city," he said. "This is outreach; the first move to bring outside business into Korea."
Companies with offices at Songdo will be able to use the nearby airport tomake connections in China. "Singapore is about an hour's flight away," Mr. Gale said. That is a big improvement over trying to penetrate Chinese markets from the United States. Gale executives report that the flight from Newark Liberty International Airport to Seoul takes about 17 hours nonstop.
It is no accident that Korean officials chose a New York-area developer and a New York architect to design and build Songdo, Mr. Gale said. With rising prosperity, many Koreans want to improve their lifestyles after working long hours, six days a week. "We are not just talking bricks and sticks here," Mr. Gale said. "We are doing software as well, designing in space for cultural, historic and art uses."
He said the retail portion of project was being designed to attract the types of exclusive and trendy stores that line New York's Fifth and Madison Avenues. "They want New York cool," he said.

HEADLINE: Leaving Mitchell-Lama: Many Paths, All Bumpy 

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
THE battleground is increasingly familiar: on one side, there is the developer of a Mitchell-Lama building entitled under law to take it out of the low- and moderate-income housing program after 20 years of rent ceilings. On the other, there are the tenants, fearful they will lose their homes to soaring rents or that their buildings will be transformed into luxury condos. 
 For projects completed before Jan. 1, 1974, the outcome is predictable. If they leave the Mitchell-Lama program, they automatically become subject to rent stabilization, with increases limited by the city's Rent Guidelines Board. But if they are among the 144 Mitchell-Lama projects finished after that date, owners are free to set whatever rents they wish, provided they pay up their mortgages and fulfill other conditions, including proving there were no covenants in the deeds restricting use of the land. 
 The last of the Mitchell-Lama buildings went up in 1978, and with the 20-year mark past, the pace of landlords leaving the program has been quickening. Buyouts are pending at eight Mitchell-Lama developments in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn and one in Queens, according to the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. 
The potential effects of the buyouts have drawn the attention of political leaders, with both Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, proposing new safeguards for Mitchell-Lama tenants.
How the transition from regulation to free market evolves differs from one case to another. But the experiences of three developments currently in the process of leaving the program illustrate the ways duels between owner and resident can play out.
An unusual resolution has been unfolding at Cathedral Parkway Towers, a 309-unit complex on the Upper West Side near the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. 
There, thanks to a patchwork quilt of financing from city, state and nonprofit agencies and private sources, the tenants have become the owners, albeit indirectly, through their tenants' association. For the time being at least, they will remain under the Mitchell-Lama umbrella and continue to pay rent. 
In Brooklyn Heights at the Middagh Street Studio Apartments, with 42 spaces designed for artists, the tenants' future is more tenuous. The longtime owner of the building, a former candy factory that was converted into studios in 1975, took it out of the Mitchell-Lama program on June 13 and promptly sold it to a new owner, Charles Herzka, who has yet to divulge his plans. The Brooklyn tenants had earlier filed a lawsuit seeking to restore rent stabilization practices that were once in effect. They lost their initial case, and that verdict is now on appeal. 
At Independence Plaza North, three 39-story towers and 69 two-story low rises in TriBeCa, tenants came face to face with their new landlord, Lawrence Gluck, for the first time last month in a confrontational meeting. 
Tenants say they worry that they will be priced out of their apartments and that an influx of more affluent renters will mean the end of economic and ethnic diversity.
But Mr. Gluck has vowed to obtain federal rent subsidies for everyone eligible, a total he estimated at 68 percent of the complex's residents. 
Spurred in part by situations such as these, Mayor Bloomberg announced a proposal Wednesday to extend rent regulation to tenants in developments leaving the Mitchell-Lama program. The proposal, which would give new tax breaks to landlords and remove the 6 percent cap on their return on equity under Mitchell-Lama, would require action by the State Legislature.
Mr. Bloomberg's proposal followed the recent introduction of a City Council bill by Mr. Miller that would stiffen the conditions under which Mitchell-Lama proprietors leave the system. Mr. Miller's proposal would compel owners to give 18 months notice of their intentions to buy out, rather than the 12 months now in force, levy an administrative fee of $1,000 for each unit to be removed from the program and require the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to conduct a community impact study. 
The loss of small single structures like the Middagh Street Studio Apartments, also known as 20 Henry Street, or large enclaves like Independence Plaza diminishes the inventory of moderate income housing at a time when the mayor has proposed a $3 billion, 65,000-unit five-year construction plan at an estimated cost of $300,000 per unit.
All told, more than 400 Mitchell-Lama projects with a total of 165,000 units were built in the 1960's and 70's.
Of those, 135 with 60,000 units were sponsored by the city (70 rentals, 65 co-ops). Twenty of them have been brought out for a loss of 7,000 units.
The state sponsored 269 developments, containing 105,236 units (76,500 of them in the city). Fifty-four owners (22 of them in the city) with 16,800 units have opted out. 
As conditions of their federal mortgages, most of the post-1974 city-sponsored Mitchell-Lama projects offer additional protections after they leave the program, according to Carol Abrams, the spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Federal vouchers are available to bridge the gap between one-third of income and the market-rate rent for households earning less than 95 percent of area median income -- $59,600 for a family of four.

Cathedral Parkway Towers
Rentals Preserved In a Unique Alliance
A singularly happy resolution to more than 25 years of feuding with their landlord is in sight for the residents of two Mitchell-Lama towers at 424 Cathedral Parkway and 125 West 109th Street. Through their tenants' organization, the United Tenants Association of Cathedral Parkway Towers, in partnership with Robert S. Nelson, a Mitchell-Lama developer, they have taken title to the buildings. Under terms of the transaction, the buildings will be preserved as rentals under the Mitchell-Lama banner, for the time being at least.
The resolution, unique in the annals of the housing program, is the result of collaboration by state, city and federal agencies; three of the city's pension funds; Sonyma, the state mortgage agency; and the Community Development Corporation, a nonprofit consortium of banks, insurance and mortgage companies, which banded together to find ways to finance the project.
The Community Development Corporation financed the purchase for $3.5 million and the renovation for $7.5 million. After construction is complete, the city pension fund will assume the permanent financing for $35 million over a period of 10 years, with that loan to be insured by Sonyma.
Mr. Nelson, who has owned and managed 3,500 units of Mitchell-Lama housing over 18 years and who worked on the Cathedral Towers plan for four years, is continuing to play a key role. 
"I am the project developer and acquired the property, refinanced the deal and am doing the construction," he explained. "At the point where we convert from a construction loan to a permanent loan, I will step out of the picture, and the tenants will control the corporation. This deal is as complicated as any I have ever seen and the cooperation it involved is unique. The fact that so many different interests were satisfied is a monumental achievement." 
The eventual goal is to convert the apartments to limited equity co-ops, which means residents would be able to buy their apartments for less than market value, but should they sell would not be able to reap any profits. 
The transfer brings to a close an exceedingly troubled past. Cathedral Parkway Towers was plagued with problems almost from the day it opened in 1975. Within a year, residents were on rent strike. 
"Basically there were leaks, loose bricks, elevators that didn't function properly, an unreliable heating system and other structural problems," said Aury Bennett Stollow, who has been the tenants' lawyer for 20 years. 
The state Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which had oversight of the complex, stepped in and persuaded the developer to relinquish day-to-day involvement, letting the tenants assume management responsibilities. 
"If new cabinets were needed, they were made by the tenants," Mr. Stollow said. "They hired the employees andran a day care center and summer camp on the premises."
In 1979, Cathedral Parkway Associates agreed to turn over the complex to the residents after 20 years. "That was their dream -- the day the developer would step aside and they would own it," he said. "But they didn't want glitz and glamour; they wanted to continue the style of living they had had under Mitchell-Lama." 
That agreement was about to come to fruition in June 1999 when the building's facade to crumble.
"We brought in engineers to determine the scope of the problem and negotiations between the state and the developer ground to a halt," Mr. Stollow said. "Then we discovered that the developer had been trying to sell the property to outsiders. We ran to court to compel them to honor their agreement." 
David Katsky, the lawyer for Cathedral Parkway Associates, said the developer had no comment on any aspect of Cathedral Parkway Towers' history. "The party sold its interest in the project, and the transaction is over," he said. 
With the renovation under way and the way clear for eventual ownership by the tenants, Judith A. Calogero, commissioner of the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, considers the outcome a triumph. "The affordable housing world is looking on in interest to see how we're doing this," she said. "We are creating a new model to preserve affordable housing."

20 Henry Street
A New Owner And Fears of Eviction
The outlook is far more uncertain for the residents of the 42-loft building at 20 Henry Street, who have yet to learn what the new owner of their home had in mind when he bought it in June and who await an appeals court ruling on their right to rent stabilization. 
"The mood here is very angry," said Jack Bales, an architect and co-chairman of the 20 Henry Street Tenants Association, who has lived there since 1990. "People who set up these programs were not thinking 20 years down the road, and I don't think what they had in mind was a full-scale eviction of a community."
Built in 1870 and formerly the Peaks Mason Mints candy factory, it was scheduled for demolition in the early 1960's under the Cadman Plaza Title 1 Urban Renewal Plan, when it was discovered by Lee Harris Pomeroy, an architect, who was determined to save it and convert it into live-work studios for artists. 
"Artists were not permitted to live in lofts in Lower Manhattan, so this was intended to be an answer to that," he said the other day. "We had to reinvent the definition of 'apartment' to qualify for Mitchell-Lama." 
He drew up plans in 1963 that began winning awards long before construction in 1975. The project was beset by numerous stumbling blocks; four sponsors came and went. Ultimately, the Frederick Richmond Foundation, headed by a congressman who was later indicted on a variety of charges, including tax evasion, stepped in. 
Mr. Pomeroy preserved the front of the red brick structure emblazoned with the Peaks Mason Mints sign and punctuated by tall arched windows, but installed a ultramodern stucco and steel rear, including a sculpture garden where a Louise Nevelson piece stood for a while. 
Even with city aid, though, the rents, initially $325 to $481, were too high for many artists, so although it continued to attract them, that requirement was dropped. Sometime in the mid-1970's, the building was acquired by Edward I. Penson, who announced his intention of leaving the program about four years ago.
That move galvanized the tenants into an effort to negotiate acceptable rents with the landlord or buy the building themselves. "We have a lot of tenants on restricted incomes -- senior citizens and artists who don't make a lot," Mr. Bales said. "He initially offered us a 30 percent increase every year, going to market rate after the third year. We rejected that and pursued legal action." 
The suit, filed in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, claimed that because some tenants had been given stabilized leases in the past, they were entitled to them after the buyout. 
"They got rent stabilized leases from 1982 to 1983 and renewal forms from 1988 to 1992," said Jacques F. Rose, partner at Hartman, Ule, Rose & Ratner, and a lawyer for the tenants. "We take the position that he entered into an agreement to grant the tenants rent stabilized status even though they did not come under coverage of the statute." 
The judge, Gloria C. Aronin, ruled in favor of the owner, and the case is now pending before the appellate division. 
Gerald Goldstein, a partner in Davidoff & Malito, who represents the Penson Corporation, conceded that stabilized leases had been in force, but he said: "They were given out in error and did not contain rent increases. It is our position that no one in the building was ever entitled to rent stabilization and they can't gain rights they were not entitled to." 
In August, tenants received notices advising: "The premises are not subject to rent stabilization or rent control. Consequently, at the expiration of your lease, you will be expected to vacate your apartment." 
Then, in what they claim came as a complete surprise, they received another letter announcing the sale of the building. They say they have yet to hear directly from the new owner, Charles Herzka.
"It is up to the owner to determine what he wants to do, and we are trying to figure that out right now," Mr. Herzka's lawyer, Howard B. Hornstein, a partner at Fischbein Badillo Wagner Harding, said. "We are new in the building, so there are a lot of things to look at, to get our arms around."
Should the appellate court rule against the Penson Corporation, Mr. Hornstein said he would probably go to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court. 
In the meantime, Karen Zebulon, a co-chairwoman of the tenants committee and a 28-year resident of 20 Henry Street, wonders where she will duplicate the $710 monthly rent she pays for a loft that she says is about 800 square feet. Two years ago she opened a gift and crafts shop in Boerum Hill called Gumbo. "The only way I could take a chance and start my own business was because I had affordable rent," she said. "If I didn't live where I do now, I don't know how I could do that." 
Some government officials, in particular Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, have attempted to help the tenants buy the building themselves by bringing community housing groups and lenders like the Community Development Trust, a private investment firm, together.
"We tried to come up with ways to purchase the building so the tenants' association could own and manage it, but we could never get quite enough financing," said Richard Bearak, deputy director for planning and development in the borough president's office.
But, despite the finality of the building's sale, he is not giving up. "That doesn't mean we will go away," he said. "If we can be in the ballpark of $6.6 million, we will approach the owner and convince him to do good here."

Independence Plaza North
An Owner Proposes Vouchers for Tenants
On a larger scale, the anxiety over the situation at Independence Plaza North, a complex of three 39-story towers and 69 two-story low rises stretching from Duane to North Moore Streets in TriBeCa, shows no signs of abating.
The tenants there tried and failed to forestall its sale and acquire the property themselves when the owner, Duane Street Associates, put it on the market about a year ago. Lawrence Gluck bought it in June for $156 million, according to his broker, William Wagner, and promptly announced his intentions to pull out of Mitchell-Lama after the requisite 12 month wait. 
Fear spread among the tenants that they would be driven out by drastically higher rents and that, with an influx of affluent newcomers, they would lose their hallmark economic and ethnic diversity. 
At a contentious standing-room-only meeting last month at Intermediate School 89, Mr. Gluck vowed that he would obtain assistance for about 68 percent of the 3,000 tenants, who would qualify for federal subsidies known as enhanced vouchers. The subsidies make up the difference between the market rent of an apartment and 30 percent of a household's income and enable landlords to get what they would on the open market.
"I met with the tenants before we had a concrete plan in place so that we could begin the process of communication," he said the next day. "I am intending to keep the project as a rental, and two-thirds of the people at Independence Plaza are protected from rent increases by the federal enhanced voucher program. For the other third, I am allowed to take the rents directly to fair market value at the termination of the leases, but I would not seek to do that. We envision phasing in those increases. There are many ways to do that which reflect the wealth level of the tenants." 
According to a survey conducted by Mr. Gluck's company, Stellar Management, residents of 869 units, who have a median income of $22,200, are eligible for the vouchers. They represent 67.5 percent of the tenant roster. 
Neil Fabricant, president of the tenants' association, whose proposal to buy the complex from Mr. Gluck was rejected, said: "With the vouchers, he will get a tremendous cash flow that he will use to make repairs and turn it into a luxury rental. He would not give us a guarantee that two-thirds or even 50 percent of the tenants will get vouchers. So there is no assurance that people will be in their homes a couple of years from now."
Furthermore, Mr. Fabricant, president emeritus of the George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management, continued: "We know the Section 8 voucher program is shaky, and the Bush administration has already made a move to make it part of the state block grant program, which always means reduction. People are terrified." A bill that could reduce the number of vouchers awarded is now moving through Congress. 
In his view, going to market rate will only promote further gentrification of the area. "Under the most recent census, Independence Plaza represented more than 20 percent of the population of TriBeCa," he said. "We are the only people of color, the only people of moderate income in TriBeCa. Take us out of TriBeCa and what do you have? An upper class white ghetto with designer restaurants and $2 million lofts."

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Punishing the Pell Grant Program" (editorial, Oct. 29): 
 The grant program continues to grow, not shrink, both in financing and in the number of recipients. 
That's because the Bush administration has invested more money than ever before in helping the economically disadvantaged attend college -- $11 billion this year and a proposed $12.7 billion in 2004. 
All told, a record 5.1 million students are expected to receive Pell grants in 2004, an increase of 283,000 from the year before.
Every student who is eligible under the Higher Education Act will receive a grant for the 2004-5 award year.
For the record, the Higher Education Act, when reauthorized in 1992 under a Democratic Congress, required the department to update the tables of state and other tax allowances used in calculating awards. The department updated these tables in May 2003, using the most up-to-date Internal Revenue Service data available.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
How Scandal Can Help The Fund Industry

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
ALLIANCE CAPITAL. Janus. Putnam Investments. Strong Funds. Bank One. Bank of America. 
 That is a partial list of companies accused of allowing late trading or market timing of their mutual funds, to the detriment of ordinary shareholders. Investigations of the mutual fund industry by the New York State attorney general, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators are still under way. 
 John C. Bogle, the founder and former chief executive of the Vanguard Group, talked last week about the industry's problems.
 Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Why do you think that the current scandal is a good thing, in some respects?

A. This industry has lost its way. We have turned a very good profession into a business that is good for the businessman, but not for the investor. This is not just a business. It is a profession, that of protecting other people's money.
 The great thing about these scandals is that they have not only illuminated market timing, but also the heavy fees and marketing drive to bring out funds in the interests of managers, not investors. 
 Over 440 technology-related funds were started in the 1990's to help people hop onto the new-economy bandwagon. Those funds took in over $500 billion. Investors lost two-thirds of their money. Meanwhile, the managers made about $50 billion in fees.

Q. Are more fund families going to be implicated in this scandal?

A. In my opinion, we are not through it. We will see other firms that have played the game in an unethical way. We will also see how embedded these market-timing things have gotten into their affairs. Everybody is trying to make it the easiest for people to get their money in.

Q. You have proposed two reforms to deal with market timing: close the transaction window at 2:30 p.m. instead of 4 p.m., and charge a 2 percent redemption fee for shares held less than 30 days. How would this help?

A. At Vanguard, the index funds close the door to new money at 2:30 in the afternoon. That gives us the time to get the money to the fund manager by about 3:45. Those logistics tie in with accounting purity. If the money comes in after that time, it gets invested the following day.
We put a 2 percent redemption fee on our taxable funds some years ago. It kept our redemption rates extremely low and kept sales of the funds low, because a lot of people don't want to pay the fee.

Q. What structural changes would you like to see in the industry?

A. Cut the management company's representation on boards of directors to one person, and have a system where the newly independent directors provide them with staff. I also recommend amending the Investment Company Act statute to require that directors have a fiduciary duty to see that funds are organized, operated and managed in the interests of shareholders, rather than advisers and distributors. We also need disclosure on all management compensation.

Q. How much money do these managers make?

A. Don't pay any attention to surveys that show the average is around $350,000 a year. This industry takes in revenues of $70 billion a year. Of that, only $4 billion to $5 billion is spent on investment management, or research. About 40 to 45 percent of the total is profit to the managers. I know some managers at one large firm who make $5 million a year.

Q. Which criteria are the most important in assessing a mutual fund?

A. First, what does it cost? Low cost is better than high cost. What is its turnover? There is a very high correlation between high turnover rates and low returns.
 Third, look for managers that are not starting a new fund at the drop of a hat. Also, look at how long the average shareholder stays in the fund. Fifth, look at how much money the managers have in the fund, and their tenure.

Q. Are exchange-traded funds, which trade all day on the stock exchange, an acceptable alternative to mutual funds?

A. I think E.T.F.'s are a terrific way to own the stock market and hold it forever. They are more or less equal to index funds, and you might get a slightly lower expense ratio. Unfortunately, they have one huge disadvantage: they are used for trading. The turnover in S.P.D.R.'s, the E.T.F. for the S.&P. 500, is about 2,000 percent. So investors will shoot themselves in the foot by trading them.

Q. What lessons do you think investors will learn from this scandal?

A. The idealist in me says people will be much more intelligent in their selection of funds. The realist says that a lot of other people will opportunistically be saying that I can do better. But the mutual fund is the greatest instrument for long-term investors in the mind of man.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Robert N. Gensler; 
T. Rowe Price Media and Telecommunications Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
INVESTORS in media and telecommunications stocks have particular need to think globally, said Robert N. Gensler, manager of the $606 million T. Rowe Price Media and Telecommunications fund.
 "What's going on at Vodafone, the biggest wireless player, affects Nokia, which makes handsets, and Texas Instruments, which makes semiconductor chips," Mr. Gensler said from his office in Baltimore. Vodafone is based in Britain, while Nokia is in Finland. 
 In choosing stocks, Mr. Gensler estimates that he travels more than 100 days a year. Since Sept. 1, he said, he has ventured twice to Europe and once to Asia and to Silicon Valley of California.
 He works with a dozen T. Rowe Price global industry analysts and keeps a spreadsheet of more than 500 media and telecommunications companies worldwide with market capitalizations of more than $1 billion.
 The fund lost 4.9 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, placing it in the top 5 percent of telecommunications funds. That group lost 24.8 percent, annualized, over that time, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 7.9 percent, according to Morningstar Inc.
 The fund returned 48.5 percent in the last 12 months, compared with 35.5 percent for its group and 19.3 percent for the S.&P. 500. 
 Mr. Gensler, 46, is a vice president of T. Rowe Price Associates, the fund's adviser. He picks the fund's approximately 60 stocks from among global companies of all sizes and says that media companies, in general, are very appealing at the moment. 
 "The improving economy and the 2004 cycle with the elections and the Olympics is good for broadcasting, radio and content companies like Viacom," Mr. Gensler said. Viacom is among the fund's holdings.
 He looks for companies whose finances should benefit over the next few years from factors like rising prices or profit margins, increasing market share or new products.
 "People look for top-line fundamental growth and valuation," Mr. Gensler said, "but they miss a lot of the subtle changes that can go on in how businesses evolve when you look out over the next year or two." He aims for sustainable long-term growth, he said, adding that each company in the portfolio had "a moat around its business," like a specialized business model or license, that protects its franchise. 
 Ideally, he seeks annual earnings growth averaging at least 20 percent over the next three to five years.
 Mr. Gensler recently added shares of Vodafone, the fund's biggest holding, at more than 6 percent of assets. He projects that the company will have annual earnings growth of more than 10 percent over the next three to five years and 12 percent average annual growth in free cash flow because of slower capital spending and reduced debt.
 He paid the equivalent of $1.68 a share, on average,for the entire position; the shares now trade at $:1.24, or roughly $2.10.
He started buying shares of Sogecable of Spain in April. Sogecable, which in July acquired the satellite division of Telefonica, provides multichannel video and paid subscription TV via satellite and has "10 or 15 years of really good growth ahead of it," Mr. Gensler said.
 While about 80 percent of American households pay for subscription television through cable or satellite services, he said, only 18 percent of Spanish households currently subscribe, leaving plenty of room for growth. 
 He paid the equivalent of $17.91, on average, for the shares. On Friday, they closed at 21.97 euros, or roughly $25.45.
 Another holding, Multimedia Games of Austin, Tex., makes slot machines and other gambling devices and installs them in casinos, splitting the income with the gambling establishments and creating recurring revenue streams, Mr. Gensler said. "They've got the wind at their back because they're one of the leading providers," he added. 
 The company has a strong working relationship with Indian tribes that operate casinos, he said.
 The fund began buying shares in September, paying $37.89, on average; the stock closed on Friday at $37.61.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: WEST MASPETH; 
A Tunnel to Reduce Truck Traffic Might Add Trucks

BYLINE:  By JIM O'GRADY

 BODY:
Peter Keane, the owner of V.I.P. Auto Body on Rust Road in West Maspeth, Queens, looked across the street at the cleared and desolate 40 acres of the old Phelps Dodge copper smelting plant and, beyond it, Newtown Creek. He had heard that the city might build a freight yard there as part of an ambitious plan to link a citywide network of railroad tracks to a proposed tunnel under New York Harbor between Bay Ridge, Brooklyn and either Bayonne or Elizabeth, N.J. 
 He pointed to a small lake in the middle of the site. "The problem with the property is the creek is seeping into it," he said. "See that water? It's always there." 
 But a bigger potential problem for Mr. Keane and other nearby business owners is that the city will need 100 acres to build the yard, according to a draft environmental impact statement shown to local officials by the city's Economic Development Corporation. That means the city may approach Mr. Keane and others about buying their land. 
"I hadn't heard that," Mr. Keane said.
Alice Cheng, a vice president of the agency, tries to be reassuring. In an interview, she said that the dozens of property owners in the area, from welding shops to shipping firms to auto businesses, could negotiate a fair sale price and that the taking of land by eminent domain would be considered only as a last resort. (The seepage at the Phelps Dodge site can be easily fixed, too, she said.) 
A major goal of the plan is to decrease truck traffic in the region by allowing more goods to arrive and circulate through New York by ship and rail. But at some point, much of those goods would still need to be put on trucks, a transfer that would occur at the Maspeth freight yard. 
That worries City Councilman John C. Liu. "It would be very beneficial to our whole regional economy and would tremendously bolster new jobs," he said. "But it would not reduce truck traffic in the borough of Queens. That's a big problem."

OVER the last 30 years, stock investors could have beaten a buy-and-hold strategy by following a simple market-timing model based on the price of oil.
 That is the conclusion of a new study by Ben Jacobsen, an associate professor of finance at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and two of his students, Gerben Driesprong and Benjamin Maat. 
 While many researchers have found that the price of oil affects the American economy, Professor Jacobsen could find no previous studies that measured the extent to which changes in oil prices could predict the stock market's performance. He and his colleagues studied the relationship between oil prices and the American stock market from October 1973 to April 2003. (They chose their starting date because the price of oil generally changed infrequently before 1973, and by small amounts.) The researchers found that "changes in oil prices strongly predict future stock market returns." 
 The study recently began circulating in academic circles as a working paper. It is available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=460500.
 To illustrate the implications for investors, the researchers constructed a hypothetical portfolio invested entirely in the domestic stock market, as measured by the U.S.A. Total Return index from Morgan Stanley Capital International, whenever the price of oil declined during the previous month. The portfolio shifted entirely into short-term Treasury bills whenever oil prices rose during the previous month by more than 5 percent. When the oil-price increase was less than 5 percent, the researchers kept the portfolio in stocks, theorizing that the negative impact of more expensive oil was probably not enough to counteract the long-term historical tendency of the stock market to rise.
 During the period studied, this market-timing portfolio, after transaction costs, gained 11.5 percent, annualized. By contrast, a buy-and-hold strategy in the stock market throughout that period gained 10.4 percent a year, on average. Better yet, the market-timing portfolio was 30 percent less risky than buying and holding, as measured by the volatility of its returns.
 Although he said the results were statistically significant, Professor Jacobsen acknowledged that he would be more confident if he could replicate them over other periods. That is not possible now, because oil did not trade freely before 1973.
 Nevertheless, he and his students conducted several other tests that increased their confidence that the market-timing model was worth betting on.
 In one test, they examined the impact of oil prices on the stock markets of 17 other industrialized countries over the same period. In addition, they studied the markets of 30 emerging-markets nations over shorter periods for which data were available. They found that changes in oil prices had considerable predictive power in those markets, too. In a number of countries, in fact, the researchers' oil-based market-timing model was even more profitable than it was in the United States.
 In another test, the researchers divided the 30-year period into two parts -- 1973-1988 and 1988-2003 -- and analyzed them separately. Their market-timing model was profitable in both periods.
 ALTHOUGH the researchers' results were statistically significant, they found that the stock market moved in the direction suggested by the model only 52 percent of the time. The strategy was so profitable, however, because the portfolio generally lost only small amounts when the model's predictions were wrong; the portfolio tended to perform very well indeed when the predictions were correct.
 In October, the stock market behaved as the researchers' model predicted. The price of crude oil fell 6.2 percent in September, suggesting that October would be a strong month for the market. The U.S.A. Total Return index rose more than 5 percent for the month.

Little Ba nks Learn to Compete With Merger Mania

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
THREE years ago, BankAtlantic, a community bank based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., declared its own war of sorts against the big-bank competitors that were swallowing up neighborhood banks throughout its home state.
 To help keep its customers -- and more important, to lure new ones -- it began extending the operations at its 73 branches to seven days a week from six, and it started a grass-roots advertising campaign to let everyone know. 
 There's the walking No.7 mascot that appears regularly at community events and in bank buildings, and the small fleet of cherry red Volkswagen Beetles, called 7-Day Bugs, that outstanding employees are permitted to borrow for a month.
 Whenever BankAtlantic signs up a new customer, its tellers shred unused checks from the customer's former bank and sound a large brass bell to celebrate. In each branch, a poster displays a running number of new customers from various competitors. 
 "Many of these customers feel abandoned by their banks and disillusioned that they have lost personal contact," said Alan Levan, the chairman of BankAtlantic, which has $5.8 billion in assets. "So the banking market was wide open for an aggressive, customer-oriented bank to fill the void that was left." 
 BankAtlantic's efforts seem to be paying off, to some degree. According to Mr. Levan, former customers of acquired banks -- particularly banks bought by Wachovia or Bank of America in the last few years -- account for more than three-quarters of the 144,000 customers his company has gained over the last two years, as well as the 145,000 estimated for this year.
 Of course, a few thousand customers are a drop in the bucket when compared with the millions of customers, and thousands of branches, that banks have gained in the recent spate of acquisitions.
 Bank of America's planned $48 billion acquisition of FleetBoston and its 12 million customers, announced last week, would create what the companies say is the first truly national bank, with 5,700 branches across 29 states, plus 16,500 automated teller machines. 
 BankAtlantic and other community banks do not appear terribly concerned about that prospect. In most industries, the arrival of a large, well-known competitor makes smaller businesses squirm, but not in banking. Smaller banks seem to have discovered over the years that a merger of competitors often signals an opportunity to grow -- and that usually benefits the consumer as well. Quite simply, said Diane Casey-Landry, president and chief executive of America's Community Bankers, a trade association, "what community banks see is an opportunity to go after disaffected customers."
 For some small banks, that means offering better rates on loans, savings accounts and other products. Most focus on improving or personalizing services.
 In Mercer County, N.J., Fleet bought Summit Bank's branches in 2000, while First Union acquired Wachovia in 2001 and applied the Wachovia name to its branches. In response, Yardville National Bank, which is based in Yardville, N.J., and has 20 branches in central New Jersey, sent mailings promising a 3 percent annual yield on its checking accounts for the first six months, plus unlimited check writing. (Fleet offers a rate of 0.10 percent on checking at its branches in central New Jersey.)
 Calling itself "Your Neighborhood Bank," Yardville National also offered to pay people $10 for bringing in the leftover checks from their accounts with other banks. And to show that it could compete in the big leagues, it advertised in national publications, like Time, Newsweek and Sports Illustrated, that allow advertisements within specific regions. 
 When Fleet bought Bank Boston in 1999, Eastern Bank, a community bank also based in Boston, offered free checking. That caught the attention of J. Dayne Lamb, and her husband, Gardner Stratton, both financial planners in Boston and Bank Boston customers. Concerned that service would suffer after the merger, they switched their personal accounts to Eastern, and they have reported no regrets.
 "They offer a truly no-fee checking account," Ms. Lamb said. "The tellers are just fabulous. They have a popcorn machine there, and they always have something like CNBC on TV. I deeply hope that small institutions stay around, because they feel just entirely different." 
 In the two years after Fleet's acquisition of Bank Boston, Eastern won 41,500 new checking accounts -- an increase of 110 percent, it said.
 Fleet's acquisitions inspired smaller banks to band together. Working with the Massachusetts Bankers Association, they formed a fee-free A.T.M. network to compete with Fleet's large network of A.T.M.'s.
 The big banking companies say that the smaller banks do provide valuable services to their communities, but they add that there is room for both types of institutions.
 "We are a global bank, but we compete on a local level," said Eloise Hale, a spokeswoman for Bank of America. "Because of the resources that we have, we have a breadth of products that community banks just can't support -- we have a wealth of lending opportunities." 
 James Schepker, a spokesman for FleetBoston, said that certain customers are entitled to discounts on home equity loans and bonus rates on C.D.'s.
 The entrance of large companies can also spur local branches of smaller banks to broaden offerings. West Bank, which is based in Des Moines and has 10 branches in the area, recently acquired a local asset manager, began offering additional types of home equity loans and raised introductory rates on certificates of deposit. 
 After all, said Thomas Stanberry, the bank's president and chief executive, it is now competing with Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America.
 Over all, community banks, which generally include banks with fewer than 100 branches, had a 7 percent increase in deposits during the five years ended in June 2002, according to the First Manhattan Consulting Group in New York. 
 By contrast, the 30 banks with the country's largest consumer divisions gained only 1 percent in deposits after subtracting customers added through acquisitions. James McCormick, First Manhattan's president, attributed the gains largely to a higher level of customer service among the smaller banks. 
 But not all big banks ignore those basics, he added. Bank of America, for instance, has been improving its share of consumer deposits, "largely due to taking a page out of the small-bank book," he said. 
 The company said that it plans to build 550 branches by 2006 and has charged 153 employees nationwide with fostering community ties through such acts as attending service club meetings. 
 Among larger banks, Mr. McCormick said, Commerce Bancorp of Cherry Hill, N.J., has done the best job of winning new customers on its own, as opposed to buying other banks.
 Vernon Hill II, the president of Commerce, said: "Our growth has come from the big players in the market, and it's because the customers are tired of being abused. And every major merger in the Northeast has caused major disruptions in service."
 So look for small-bank promotions when the potential for inconvenience is at its greatest -- as merged banks struggle to blend their operations.
 That happened last year when the BB&T Corporation, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., with assets of $90 billion, acquired the Bank of Louisville and the Area Bank of Owensboro, Ky. The branches of both acquired banks had to close for almost three days and reconfigure their A.T.M.'s as they merged operations. 
 The Republic Bank & Trust Company of Louisville, a competing community bank with 30 locations, ran newspaper advertisements announcing that it was extending its hours for two of those three days and that it would cash any payroll checks. It also offered $50 bonuses to anyone who opened an account that weekend.
 Last winter, as U.S. Bancorp was taking over Bay View bank branches in California, Borel Private Bank and Trust of San Mateo, Calif., sent Valentine's Day cards to people asking, "Looking for a new relationship?"
 The valentines were reminiscent of the newspaper advertisements Borel ran when Wells Fargo acquired First Interstate in 1996. One longtime Wells Fargo customer, Tom Chakos of Hillsborough, Calif., said he thought that the bank was spreading itself too thin through its acquisitions. So after 25 years with the bank, Mr. Chakos eventually took his accounts to Borel, -- as well as those of his three small businesses.-- 
 AFTER BB&T acquired several bank branches in Georgia, West Georgia National Bank, which has seven branches, wanted to help customers switch. So it trained its employees to transfer all of the automatic transfers linked to people's checking accounts, including direct deposits and automatic drafts. It also offered to go to people's workplaces to get signatures for any account or loan openings. 
 "It was an opportunity for us to go out and bring business from the other bank," said Rocky Lipham, an executive vice president of West Georgia National.
 Before the BB&T acquisitions, West Georgia National's slogan was, "We want to be your only bank." After, it changed it to, "Taking your banking personally since 1946."
 Many small banks seem to be adopting similar slogans as they emphasize personalized services, something at which they say they excel. 
 In Connecticut, after Fleet acquired Shawmut National, People's Bank of Bridgeport ran print ads warning, "There's a stranger in town who just got a hold of your bank account."

HEADLINE: Is the Party Ending For Home Builders? 

BYLINE:  By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
BUOYED by low mortgage rates, the housing market has boomed over the last three years and shares of home-building companies have soared.
 This year alone, the Standard & Poor's Supercomposite Homebuilding index, which includes companies like Centex, Lennar and the Ryland Group, is up 87 percent. Because of recent upward moves in mortgage rates, however, investors are divided over whether the sector's good times can continue much longer. 
 Barbara Allen, a senior analyst at Natexis Bleichroeder, a New York investment research firm, warned that the home builders were cyclical companies and that their shares were likely to decline as mortgage rates rose. 
"Investors should be aware that they are essentially betting on the direction of interest rates," Ms. Allen said.
 But several portfolio managers said they remained bullish on the sector. Ken Heebner, manager of the CGM Realty fund, for example, said the stocks of home builders were still a good buy. He said that demand for housing would remain strong even if 30-year mortgage rates, now averaging about 6 percent, rise to 7 percent in the next year or two. And the larger home builders, he said, could keep growing by acquiring smaller companies.
 "If I can buy companies growing at 20 to 25 percent or more, at seven to eight times my estimate of next year's earnings, that's a great bargain," Mr. Heebner said. 
 Sam Lieber, who manages the Alpine real estate funds, said that improved management at the big home builders should let them continue to increase earnings, even in the face of rising mortgage rates. Compared with their situation a decade ago, he said, the companies are "much more streamlined, with something approaching just-in-time manufacturing." 
 Some analysts said that the industry was less tethered to interest rates than it was just a few years ago. "Demographics are on their side," said James F. Wilson, a research analyst at Jolson Merchant Partners in San Francisco. He said that immigration trends should keep the population growing in many regions and that the proportion of home owners should rise as the population ages.
 ANOTHER factor, he said, is a scarcity of land in important markets, partly because of tighter regulations.
 "Go back 10 or 15 years, and it was really only difficult to get land developed in California and New Jersey," he said. But within the last five or six years, some kind of development restrictions have been enacted in 38 states, either statewide or locally, he said. "That gives home builders pricing power," he added.
 Looser lending standards, as reflected in the rise of zero-down-payment mortgages, are also driving demand, said Ivy Zelman, a research analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. She said she thought this trend would mitigate the negative impact of rising rates.
 Shares of the big home builders tend to move in a pack, but Mr. Lieber particularly likes Ryland because it has expanded by buying land rather than by acquiring smaller construction companies, as many of its competitors have done. This strategy gives Ryland one of the cleanest balance sheets in the business, he said, with a debt level of 33 percent, compared with 40 to 50 percent for many other builders. 
 Ryland intends to stick with this strategy, said R. Chad Dreier, the company's chief executive, who added it could grow significantly without acquisitions. 
 "Organic growth takes a little longer, but I think it's easier to achieve," Mr. Dreier said.
 Despite their high cash flow in recent years, most home builders have kept dividends low; Ryland's yield is only .09 percent. Mr. Dreier said big investors had told him that they preferred share buybacks to dividends; the company is purchasing two million sharesin 2003, he said.
 Lennar, another large builder, broke ranks with the group in September by raising the company's annual dividend to $1 a share from 5 cents, for a current yield of 1.09 percent.
 "We have confidence in our ability to generate significant cash flow, so we felt this was a prudent time to increase the dividend," said Bruce Gross, the chief financial officer.
 But Ms. Allen said the sector was very vulnerable because low interest rates and zero-down-payment mortgages had inflated the housing market.
 "We don't know how much of that stimulated demand that should have happened over the next three years," after first-time buyers saved up for down payments, she said.
 Single-family home construction rose 6.7 percent in 2002, a rate Ms. Allen said was unsustainable. 
 She expects the pace of earnings growth to slow, she said, because the widespread inflation of home prices will ease. In many markets, she said, homes have sold for more than builders expected when construction began. Those quick increases have helped earnings and margin growth. "That's pure gravy, because the cost of building remains the same," she said. 
 But she predicted that prices would level off -- even if mortgage rates did not rise very much -- because homes would become unaffordable for buyers whose incomes were not rising at the same breakneck pace.

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY; 
Why Do Employers Pay for Health Insurance, Anyway?

BYLINE:  By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
NOBODY expects employers to provide groceries, housing or clothing, but for odd historical reasons American employers have evolved into providers of health insurance. Nearly two-thirds of Americans under 65 rely on health coverage from an employer. 
 Some of America's largest companies, maybe eager to level the playing field, favor requiring employers to provide insurance. But they have it backward. They should be advocating an end to employer-financed health coverage altogether. 
 Why should we hate the employer-financed system? Let us count the ways:
 It makes it difficult or sometimes even impossible for people to change jobs, not only damping economic efficiency but reducing the competition for labor and, therefore, reducing wages. Without alternative health coverage, there is "strong evidence for job lock," wrote two economists, Jonathan Gruber and Brigitte C. Madrian, in a National Bureau of Economic Research study released this year.
 It suppresses the creation of new businesses because, for many potential entrepreneurs, quitting a job means forgoing health insurance, a risk too big to take.
 It handicaps traditional industries like autos and steel, whose medical burden for retirees is staggering. The estimated lifetime expense for today's steel retirees alone is $14 billion. In the auto industry, General Motors alone provides coverage to nearly one-half of 1 percent of the American people; One analyst, Gary Lapidus of Goldman Sachs, calls Detroit's Big Three "H.M.O.'s with wheels."
 It unfairly excludes the unemployed, the self-employed and low-skilled workers. And it can shortchange single people, whose employers effectively pay higher wages to workers with families when providing dependent coverage.
 On top of everything else, our employer-based system seriously obscures who is paying what, making cost controls difficult. Workers may think they are getting something for nothing, but employer-paid insurance premiums usually are provided in lieu of higher wages. And while companies dislike soaring premiums, at least they can deduct their cost from their income taxes, thus transferring a big hunk of the cost to the federal government. 
 Employers and employees alike, meanwhile, may be unaware that they pay some costs for the uninsured. Hospitals recover the unpaid costs of treating uninsured patients by charging insurance companies more, and insurers then build these costs into employer premiums. 
 There is no good reason for any of this, aside from historical accident. During World War II, federal wage controls prevented employers from wooing workers with higher pay, so companies started offering health insurance as a way around the law. Of course, this form of nonmonetary compensation is still pay. When the war ended, the practice stuck.
 WITH a presidential election campaign under way, it is time for employers to put the issue of national health coverage back on the agenda. Either party might find it appealing: a recent ABC News-Washington Post poll found that, by a margin of almost 2 to 1, Americans would prefer a government system covering everyone instead of the employer-based system. (Support drops sharply if the government plan would limit choice of doctors or mean longer waits for nonemergency treatment.)
 The status quo is untenable. Survey results released in September by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that health insurance premiums rose nearly 14 percent this year, on top of many double-digit increases in previous years, so that the annual cost of a typical family plan -- regardless of who's paying -- now exceeds $9,000. More than one-seventh of all Americans have no health insurance at all. 
 We can expect the numbers of uninsured to rise. The Employee Benefit Research Institute recently asked people what they would do if their medical premiums rose. Two of three respondents said they would drop coverage if premiums rose $200 a month; a quarter said they would cancel coverage if premiums rose $100 a month.
 Ending employer-sponsored coverage, of course, would not stop the cost surge. But a properly designed universal system could help. Plenty of competition would need to be built into it, along with significant individual co-payments. The best path may be to give everyone a voucher good for basic coverage; people could buy more elaborate coverage if they chose.
Such a plan would be expensive, but so is the current system. This year, total spending for private health insurance will top $500 billion, according to the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group. Why not spend it rationally, and lift the yoke of medical insurance serfdom from employers and employees alike?

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Beneath The Smiles, A Churning Anxiety

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
WE live in a manic-depressive economy, and right now we're in the manic phase. The annual growth rate, 7.2 percent in the third quarter, was spectacular. The Keynesian-style stimulus has been wonderfully effective. But the depressive phase may kick in again soon, as growth slows and millions of employed and unemployed Americans struggle to make up for lost incomes. 
 They are out there trying now, earning $40,000 or $50,000, for example, rather than the $50,000 or $60,000 they made before they were laid off and took pay cuts to get work again. The Labor Department does not calculate their growing numbers, and neither does anyone else. 
 But who notices these days? Consumer spending carried the economy in the summer and early fall, accounting for two-thirds of the third-quarter growth rate. Tax cuts and mortgage refinancing put hundreds of millions of dollars into people's pockets -- offsetting lost income -- and low interest rates cut borrowing costs.
 The 7.2 percent growth rate is not sustainable. Nearly every forecaster concedes that. A month into the fourth quarter, the growth rate has probably fallen back to 4 percent or so. That is still robust, but not enough to dispel the sadness that will set in as we climb down from euphoria. 
 Part of the sadness lies in the obstacles to re-employment. The corporate sector remains plagued with overcapacity and may require many months of 4 percent growth just to make full use of those currently working. Job creation has to move above 200,000 a month, most economists say, before we can begin to shrink the pool of nearly nine million unemployed. We haven't gotten to six-digit job creation yet, much less sustained it. No wonder the unemployed spend 19.7 months, on average, seeking work, the longest stretch in nearly 20 years. 
 "The breadth of the unemployment is almost unprecedented," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com. 
 Of the nine million unemployed, five million were laid off or fired, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The remainder are new entrants or people returning to the labor force after a voluntary absence.) Most of those five million will work again, but for less pay. The bureau's wage data, from its "job displacement" surveys done every two years, are clear on this point. Three people are laid off, and three years later only one has regained the lost wage or risen above it. 
 Labor economists describe the process: You are forced out of a $25-an-hour job and, after six months of job hunting, find work at $20 an hour. Two years later, having struggled back to $23 an hour, you are laid off again, and you slip back into the next job at $21 an hour. During this period, your standard of living suffers not only from the lower wage, but also from the income lost during unemployment and the loss of the raises you would have received if you had never been laid off.
 How many millions of people are living this experience? Such a number, if it existed, would be an effective indicator of our standard of living and our ability to sustain economic growth through consumer spending. Among the currently unemployed, most are expected to face lower pay in their next jobs. But how many Americans now working lost one or more jobs in the last 20 years as layoffs spread? 
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests the number is high. It has been tracking 10,000 people, a cross section of the population, since 1979, when most were teenagers and the permanent layoff was just becoming a national phenomenon. They are in their 30's and 40's now, and over the years each has held, on average, 9.6 jobs. The survey does not include reasons for so much job-changing, but the average is high enough to suggest that at least one or two of the jobs followed layoffs. 
 IN a similar vein, Ann Huff Stevens, a labor economist at the University of California at Davis, working with data from a 1992 health and retirement study, found that among men and women 51 to 62 years old who had been laid off, 47 percent had been laid off more than once. 
 Such surveys suggest that tens of millions of Americans are struggling to get their incomes back to where they were. The struggle dampened wage gains even in the booming 90's and has sapped confidence. "They have lost their seniority and their confidence that they can ride out succeeding waves of layoffs," said Katherine Newman, a sociologist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "And they see now that education does not protect them anymore. It used to, but it doesn't anymore. It shakes their faith in their capacity to control their lives."

 CORRECTION:
The Economic View column last Sunday, about the struggle of the formerly unemployed to make up for lost income, misstated the average time that an unemployed worker spends looking for another job. It is 19.7 weeks, not 19.7 months.

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD; 
Does Brazil Have Italy on the Ropes?

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: SANTO CRISTO, Brazil 

 BODY:
THANKS to an offbeat wooden chair dreamed up by the Brazilian designers Fernando and Humberto Campana, a tiny family-owned factory in this sleepy town has found itself suddenly -- and somewhat unexpectedly -- at the vanguard of change sweeping through Brazil's furniture industry.
 It took almost a leap of faith for Wilson Schuster, the factory's director, to agree to build the Campana brothers' chair, which is made from bits of leftover timber nailed together apparently at random. It is named Favela, after Brazil's chaotic, haphazardly built shantytowns. 
 "When I first saw the prototype, I must admit I thought they were joking," Mr. Schuster said. 
 Less than a year later, Mr. Schuster, 42, is glad he took the plunge. Favela, now commissioned by Edra, a leading Italian furniture company, was one of the stars of the trend-setting furniture fair in Milan this year. It retails for more than $1,800, and orders are coming in from around the world. 
 Today, six carpenters -- a tenth of the staff at the company, which is also named Schuster -- are building Favela chairs full time at the factory here, deep in southern Brazil near the border with Argentina. Exports, virtually nonexistent last year, will account for 10 percent of revenue this year.
 With their traditional domestic market languishing in recession and the local currency weaker against the dollar and Americans increasingly buying cheaper furniture, more and more Brazilian furniture makers are looking to the North American market.
 But a few, like Schuster, have ambitions that go beyond shipping off containers full of cheap wardrobes, desks and chairs copied from American models, as their Chinese rivals do. Instead, they have in their sights the high-end design furniture industries of Italy and Spain, which are losing out in the United States these days because of the strengthening euro.
 Last year, Americans bought $262 million worth of Brazilian furniture, according to United States government data. Although that was only a quarter of what Italy shipped to the United States and less than 5 percent of the $5.7 billion sold there by China, it was still up 35 percent for the year. And that gain came on top of a 34 percent increase in 2001.
 "The sustained growth indicates Brazilians increasingly understand how to meet the demands of the American market," wrote Brian Carroll, editor of Furniture/Today, a trade magazine, in a recent issue.
 Robson Oliveira, who is preparing to open the Terra do Brazil Design Center, a 12,000-square-foot showroom for Brazilian design in Miami, says he believes that in four years Brazil can match Italy's $1 billion in sales to the American market, which soaked up $14.2 billion of furniture imports last year.
 American manufacturers are already hurt by cheap Chinese imports. More than 47,000 furniture workers have lost their jobs since 2000, according to the American Furniture Manufacturers Association. This month, United States companies are expected to file an anti-dumping petition against China with the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission, a federal agency.
 But Brazilian exporters say they are not worried because they do not need to keep pace with China. They say they would be more than pleased just to catch up with Italy.
 "What Italy makes, we can make too," Mr. Oliveira said, adding that Brazilian companies used high-quality hardwood but offered prices that were "40 percent lower." The potential for export growth is huge. Although it has traditionally exported more timber than tables, Brazil is the world's 10th-largest furniture manufacturer. But of its $3.5 billion in sales last year, only $500 million came from exports.
 Much of the export drive comes from Brazil's southern states, settled early in the last century mainly by German and Italian immigrants, who brought with them family business traditions of hard work and austerity. Today, 10,000 of Brazil's 13,500 furniture manufacturers are small and still family-owned, like Schuster.
 "Southern Brazil is just like northern Italy -- full of small firms capable of producing quality furniture," said Humberto Campana, who spent three years developing the Favela chair. "Now there is a growing consensus that, instead of copying their furniture, we should be copying their model." 
 Italy's furniture industry invests about 10 percent of its revenue in design and, with brands like B&B Italia, Cappellini and Edra, has nearly a fifth of the global market. Its exports earn the country nearly $13 billion a year.
 In Brazil, the story is different, as the Campanas' experience shows.
 Hailed abroad for their originality and the Brazilian-ness of their designs, the Campanas have four pieces in the permanent design collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But they spent years trying to break into the local market.
 From 1993 to 1998, they managed to sell just five copies of their Red Chair, made from the thick, soft cord used in hot-air balloons, piled on a tubular frame like spaghetti on a plate, at a price of $900 each.
 Then, Massimo Morozzi, Edra's design chief, decided to produce the chair in the company's own factory, improving its components. Today it is a global design icon, gracing not only MoMA postcards but also top hotels, stores and restaurants around the world -- including Brazil. The chair sells for 4,000 euros, or about $4,700, in Europe and the United States, but $7,000 in Brazil because of steep import duties. 
 "That shows our industry has to take design more seriously," said Marilene Bittencourt, Schuster's sales director. "Our manufacturers must see that profit comes from originality, not from copying others."
 For Schuster, the approach seems to be working. Just after the Edra deal, Ms. Bittencourt signed a contract to supply Cliff Young, a distributor in New York, with bedroom furniture and television stands.
 While declining to reveal financial details, Ms. Bittencourt said the two export contracts meant that Schuster would be producing on such a scale that by next year it would be moving to a new factory twice the size of the current one.
 In Sao Paulo, in Brazil's industrial heartland, larger-scale factories with up-to-date technology have also won important contracts from Italian manufacturers.
 Living Divani and Porro, two top-end Italian brands, have furniture made in Brazil for South American markets. It is the first time either company has licensed production outside Italy. The move is a huge vote of confidence in Brazil's furniture industry, said Marcio Barbosa, corporate director of Grupo Atrium, a design furniture distributor in Sao Paulo.
 "Their standards are rigorous, but with the euro rising and the real falling, it makes perfect sense to produce locally," Mr. Barbosa said. "It also shows we are not only strong in artisanal manufacturing, but also in high tech."

New Global Trade Lineup: Haves, Have-Nots, Have-Somes

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
THE end of the cold war did away with the East-West split and made fashionable the notion of a North-South divide. Forget Communism versus capitalism. Now it was rich versus poor. But even as negotiators continue seeking a global trading system that might lift economies in both categories, that idea now appears to be coming apart at the seams. 
 Just as old military alliances are changing, familiar trade alliances and rivalries are mutating or dissolving under pressure from forces far stronger than ideology: in this case, competition for profits and markets. 
 This week in Washington and later this month in Miami, trade ministers from across the Americas are to meet again to try to adjust the rules that would govern free trade in the hemisphere, and the exchanges promise to be caustic. The prospect of a global agreement or even a hemispheric pact like Washington's pet project -- the Free Trade Area of the Americas -- seems to be receding, replaced by a fragmented panorama in which resentment and bitterness set the tone.
That became clear in September, when representatives of the 146 nations that make up the World Trade Organization gathered in Cancun, Mexico, for negotiations intended to reduce barriers to trade. The talks broke down amid mutual accusationsof bad faith. One factor was a familiar sore point for nations with what Wall Street likes to call emerging markets: the United States and other industrialized nations insist on a right to continue subsidizing their own agricultural products. 
But there was also a striking new development: the emergence of a coalition of not-so-poor nations that no longer fit the profile of either have or have-not. Calling itself the Group of 20-plus, the bloc was conceived by Brazil and India as a way to bring together large, resource-rich and economically dynamic nations from the South -- a not strictly geographical label since it includes China as well as Indonesia, Thailand, South Africa, Nigeria, Mexico and Argentina.
These countries have the clout to demand greater access to the markets of industrialized nations because together they account for more than half the world's population -- and they also have substantial manufacturing centers of their own.
The United States and Europe, faced with an opposition more cohesive and vocal than they were used to, responded with petulance. "The improvised articulation led by Brazil is something from another planet," said Franz Fischler, the European Union's agricultural commissioner. "They need to come back to earth quickly."
But Charlene Barshefsky, who was United States trade representative in the Clinton administration, sees the Brazilian-led coalition as a logical development -- "an additional power center, much better organized and more savvy," with a stake in the world trading system. 
"Years ago, the North-South divide was largely ideologically based," she said, with the poorer countries looking to shield themselves, through protectionism, from the risks of free trade. Now, she said, there are "floating combinations of countries, in which essential economic interests, and not ideology, are the guidepost."
In that context, the Cancun talks were also notable for the gulf that arose between the Group of 20-plus and the rest of what is known as the developing world. The conference was brought to a halt -- over the question of American and European agricultural subsidies -- not by Brazil and its allies but by a larger, separate coalition of less developed countries, mostly African and Caribbean, that felt disenfranchised and ignored. "If it were just up to the Group of 20-plus, the meeting would have ended with a decision to keep negotiating," said Rubens Ricupero, a Brazilian who is the director of the United Nations Commission on Trade and Development.
Members of the Group of 20-plus, in fact, account for a growing slice of world trade and have a broad range of interests. Brazil, once thought of as just an agricultural exporter, now counts airplanes and automobiles and car parts as its leading export items.
The danger now, especially for the weakest nations, is that trade talks will be transformed into what the economist Jagdish Bhagwati calls a "spaghetti bowl" of bilateral and regional agreements. More than 300 such accords already exist, each with a slightly different set of rules. Dr. Bhagwati, a Columbia University professor, notes that "poor countries are singularly unequipped to cope with the chaotic regime."
The Bush administration's current strategy seems to be divide and conquer. In an article for The Financial Times in September, the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, warned that "as W.T.O. members ponder the future, the U.S. will not wait: we will move towards free trade with can-do countries."
Members of the new bloc also seem to be taking a patchwork approach, seeking new trade patterns among themselves that make political sense even if at the cost of economic efficiency. India, for example, has bypassed Boeing and Airbus in favor of Brazil's Embraer as it tries to modernize its fleet of government planes.
Whether the Group of 20-plus can continue to hold together is another question. While the coalition has forced the United States, Europe and Japan to take note and rethink their plans, it does not speak with a single voice on all matters. "India and China don't have the same interests as we do in Brazil, because they are not big agricultural exporters, but rather importers," said Felipe Lampreia, a former Brazilian foreign minister. "But that doesn't mean developing countries can't come together on particular themes."

Saying 'No, Thanks' to Board Memberships

BYLINE:  By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
So with all those executives raiding, inflating or otherwise tinkering with the corporate cookie jar, and with "Sue the directors!" the primal reaction of the aggrieved, the question is: Why would anyone want to sit on a companys board? 
 Far fewer people do, apparently. According to a Korn/Ferry International study, 23 percent of Fortune 1000 directors said no when asked to take on additional board seats in 2002, up from 13 percent the year before. 
 As Charles King, an official at Korn/Ferry, put it, "The minimum acceptable participation level keeps rising." Or, more simply, they've got to pay attention now.
 In the last year, board diversity has hardly changed. HUBERT B. HERRING

HEADLINE: The Nation: Guru Nation; 
Every Recession and Every Recovery Has a Nostradamus

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
SIGNS of economic spring are all around: stocks are up, profits are surging and companies might even be hiring again. 
 Can the gurus be far behind? 
 Back in the bubble days, the gurus were everywhere. There were the market gurus talking up stocks and options and fanciful derivatives, and technology gurus preaching revolution in fat magazines like Wired, Red Herring and the Industry Standard. 
In books like "The Long Boom," by Peter Schwartz, Peter Leyden and Joel Hyatt, new economy gurus promised that high technology would smooth the ups and downs of the business cycle and lead to an age of endless prosperity. 
There were also plenty of examples of that sum of all gurus, the Visionary C.E.O. -- leaders like John F. Welch Jr. of G.E., Bernard J. Ebbers of WorldCom and Kenneth L. Lay of Enron.
Then the business cycle reminded everyone that it was still there. The irrationally exuberant markets crashed and suddenly, the gurus were no longer a big part of the talking-head-ocracy.
"Basically, the only place you see the business gurus is on milk cartons," said Paul Saffo, a research director at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif.
Gurus, of course, serve a purpose -- as do cheerleaders, security blankets and Dumbo's magic feather. Some, of course, can offer real insight. But many offer only comfort and courage in an uncertain world. Their fractious community waxes and wanes with the ups and downs of the economy. 
In hard times, their numbers dwindle and they tend to offer hope in the gloom. When the seasons seem ready to change for the better, they re-emerge, passionate about the Next Big Thing. And if the good times become too good, and the bubble bursts, they quietly move away from the spotlight (or, in a few cases, to jail), and bide their time until the economic season of hope comes around again. 
To Mr. Saffo, whose nonprofit research group helps companies deal with uncertainty and risk, the guru class has had little choice but to seek a lower profile, given that so much of what it had to say during the boom of the 1990's was just plain wrong. "The biggest mistake you can make is to confuse what you wish would happen with what you think might happen," he said.
But one of the grandest gurus of all, Tom Peters, a co-author of the 1982 best seller "In Search of Excellence," says the field is too varied to draw simple lessons. 
"Certainly the C.E.O.-as-hero took a hit," he said, but "consulting academics" like himself did not have so far to fall. "If there is a guru industry -- which even though there clearly is, I'm not willing to acknowledge it, because it's such an awful idea -- there are presumably numerous flavors thereof," he said.
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the associate dean of executive programs at the Yale School of Management, said that chief executives, especially, have shied from the spotlight. In a recent article for a McKinsey & Company quarterly, he wrote, "The inevitable fall of the once breathless apostles of e-commerce -- such C.E.O.'s of 'the new economy' as Yahoo's former C.E.O., Tim Koogle, Priceline's Jay Walker and Webvan's George Shaheen -- also doomed the appeal of their self-promotional style." 
In an interview, Mr. Sonnenfeld said many of today's baby-boomer executives took the warning of recent history to heart, and "have decided to try to minimize the cult of personality that had grown up around their predecessors."
In fact, he says, the current crop goes too far, and needs to speak out as part of their role in leading their companies. "It's very much part of the job," he said.
This new-found reticence, however, is only proper, said Thomas Frank, a social critic of the boom years. "They should lose their guru cards after their performance in the 90's," he said. 
To Mr. Frank, much of the guru-ification during the go-go 90's was, at its core, not an economic phenomenon but a political one abetted by journalists, in which business was portrayed as rational and trustworthy, and government was portrayed as "the enemy of markets, arbitrary imposer of taxes and regulations."
To Mr. Saffo, however, the audience that lapped up the rosy forecasts and exhortations shares equal blame. "People only listened to the news they wanted to hear," he said.
There may be new siren songs on the way. 
"It has been a period blessedly free of business guru books," Mr. Saffo said, "but I also have no doubt that there is a huge wave coming in over the horizon, and we will be drowning in Guru Inc. before long."
The wave is already rising. Clayton Christensen, whose 1997 book "The Innovator's Dilemma" vaulted him to instant guru status, is back with "The Innovator's Solution: Creating and Sustaining Successful Growth." Mr. Peters, too, has a new book: "Re-Imagine! Business Excellence in a Disruptive Age." And perhaps representing a new guru generation is Jerry Bowyer, a Pennsylvania radio and television talk show host, whose new book, "The Bush Boom," claims that President Bush has repaired the damage done to the economy by Bill Clinton.
As gurus and their publishers start their engines, however, it might be worth noting one other book that is not likely to appear on any best-seller list. It is a 1959 children's classic: "Will Spring Be Early? Or Will Spring Be Late?" by Crockett Johnson. In it, a groundhog mistakes a flower in the snow as a sign of a very, very early spring.
"I have never made a better prediction than this!" he says to himself, excitedly.
The other animals cheer him as a hero -- all except the grumpy old pig, who refuses to accept the single leading indicator as evidence of a broader trend. And in a moment that echoes the end of the great tulip bulb bubble of the 1600's, when a skeptic, according to legend, took a bite out of a bulb to mock the trading frenzy and crashed the market, the pig takes a bite out of the flower, and declares that it is made out of paper and wire. 
"I have a prediction to make," the pig says. "It's going to snow." And it does.
The word guru, by the way, comes from Sanskrit. It forms the root of another common English word: grieve.

The Middle Class Spends Its Way to Recovery

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
WHETHER the object of desire was a new car, a new coat or a new indulgence, American consumers opened their wallets wide in the third quarter -- helping the economy expand at the fastest rate since 1984, according to the government.
 But after enduring three years of a sluggish economy, what, exactly, were people rushing out to buy? 
 In large part, people were not buying tickets to Paris. Instead, people seemed to be letting loose but in a practical, deliberate way. They were buying necessities: cars, refrigerators, clothing. And this being the American consumer, there was a frivolous little thing (or two or three) thrown in. But even that spending reflects the new priorities of a sober consumer. 
"The rich don't have to put off their purchases," said W. Michael Cox, senior vice president and chief economist of the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. "This is the consumption of the masses driving the economy."
Spending on furniture and other items for the home rose 20.7 percent, and automobile spending rose 38.9 percent. Indeed, purchases of durable goods -- meaning any item with a three-year warranty -- rose 26.9 percent in the quarter, said Drew T. Matus, chief economist for Lehman Brothers. 
That spending was a response by consumers comforted by lower interest rates for credit cards and home mortgages. 
"You could look at durable goods as the most interest-sensitive part of the economy," Mr. Matus said. 
But the purchases also showed that consumers are, perhaps, acting more responsibly than in the past. "Spending on durable goods reflected a certain maturity among consumers," said Mr. Cox, of the Federal Reserve. "People waited until they could afford the payments."
Consumers displayed a similar restraint when it came to spending for nondurable goods, a category that includes clothing, food and energy. Spending for nondurables grew 7.9 percent in the third quarter, Mr. Matus said, and in that category, spending on clothing showed the largest gain, growing by 10 percent. 
Spending on services, which includes housing, transportation, medical care and recreation, grew even more modestly, at 2.2 percent.
In other words, consumers weren't spending a lot on personal trainers or facials. "A lot of the service spending seems to be necessities," Mr. Matus said, referring to categories like health care. "Given how the rest of the economy performed, it is not a lot of money."
Practicality, of course, only goes so far. There are signs that recreational shopping also drove spending. But even here, spending was measured.
At Wal-Mart, shoppers carted home toys, electronics, paint and lawn and garden products, a spokesman said. Sales rose 6.6 percent in August, compared with the same month in 2002. The growth for September was more subdued, at 5.6 percent for the five weeks ending Oct. 3.
At Sears, big sellers include plasma and liquid-crystal display television sets, starting at $450 and soaring to $10,000, as well as laser tools for building projects, said Ted McDougall, a Sears spokesman.
Even this high-end electronic gadgetry, it could be argued, is not a complete extravagance nowadays. "Do you know what $2,000 will buy?" asked Mr. Cox, of the Dallas Federal Reserve.
He ticked off a list of almost two dozen items, including a computer, a television, a microwave oven, an MP3 player and a digital camera, that could be purchased together for less than $2,000. 
Consumers are buying with a sharp eye for discounts. Emily Chapman of Locust Valley, N.Y., reported buying a new refrigerator recently. At the same time, she bought clothes at a discount store, like a pair of Pucci trousers for $100, marked down from $1,500.
"The buyers are not necessarily traditional luxury consumers, but people who are very close to scrimping," said James B. Twitchell, a professor of English and advertising at the University of Florida. "Luxury is moving its way down into objects that are chocolate bars or bottled water. They are not out of reach, and that's what makes them so alluring."
Despite their spending in the third quarter, many Americans have not emptied their bank accounts and still seem to be holding onto their cash for the coming holiday season, Mr. Matus said. 
"Almost every economist overstated the size of the spending" ahead of the results, he said. "There's a lot of money out there that we can't account for, and the best guess is that it's going to be used for Christmas."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Rolls-Royce Phantom; 
Keeping Up With the Maybachs

BYLINE:  By KEITH MARTIN

 BODY:
COMMONERS can become instant lords and ladies in Britain, simply by buying a title. Automakers, too, can gain nobility with a check, and the Germans have been on a snob-appeal shopping spree.
 In a flurry of acquisitions in recent years, Volkswagen bought Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini (and arranged an alliance with Maserati), and BMW acquired Rolls-Royce. Mercedes-Benz countered by creating a new ultraluxury brand (whose name, Maybach, revives a German marque that ceased to exist in 1941). 
 Why this rush to buy operations that in many cases have minuscule sales and produce profits that are, at best, limited? Perhaps it is as simple as keeping up with the Joneses (or the Schmidts). For Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes, owning your own extraordinarily expensive nameplate makes you a serious player in the high end of the market. It also lends you cachet that may rub off on your more mundane cars, the ones that sell for $100,000 or $60,000. 
 VW picked up Bentley in 1998, along with all of the Rolls-Royce and Bentley manufacturing capabilities and a worldwide distribution network, for nearly $800 million. For $65 million, BMW got automotive rights to the Rolls name, but no factory or dealers. The first all-new BMW-designed Rolls, the Phantom, was unveiled early this year. The car is built at a new plant in Goodwood, England.
 Mercedes had already shown its Maybach, which went on sale at roughly the same time. Just as the Maybach relies heavily on the big Mercedes S-Class sedan for its mechanical components, the Rolls is primarily a custom frame and body, plus a bespoke interior, surrounding a slightly modified engine, transmission and suspension from the BMW parts bin.
 Both cars are wildly expensive, the Maybach 57 with a suggested list price of $308,000 and the Phantom starting at $324,000, including delivery. For better or worse, cars in this rarefied price range are judged by their own set of standards, which do not include fuel economy, ease of parking or towing capability.
 Those who can afford a Maybach or a Rolls are looking for a visual statement of wealth, truly elegant appointments and superior, if unobtrusive, performance. 
 I test-drove the Maybach earlier this year around Los Angeles, and then drove a Phantom through the tony Santa Barbara countryside. I took the Rolls on expressways, urban streets and challenging mountain roads. Judging by the reception the car received, the Phantom is the hands-down winner in the visual-impact category. Wherever we went, we were met with thumbs-up, rather than class resentment, from the common folk.
 And although the Rolls is surprisingly easy to maneuver in traffic, it is even better when enjoyed from the back seat, with a chauffeur in place. The rear quarter is designed so that when you sit back in your seat, your face is hidden. To see the proletariat, it is necessary to lean forward slightly. When you do, it seems appropriate to give a gracious royal wave.
 The Phantom is no shrinking violet. Not only is it large, at 19.1 feet in length (the hulking Cadillac Escalade ESV is 6 inches shorter), it is heavy at 5,577 pounds. And it is powerful, with 453 horsepower from its 6.75-liter V-12 engine.
 The upright front grille is, by far, the most debated part of the car. The Phantom's designer, Marek Djordjevic -- he was personally chosen by Chris Bangle, chief designer for BMW -- said in an interview that his goal was "to achieve the same type of assertiveness and presence that the Rolls of the 30's, 40's and 50's had." He added, "Rolls-Royces of recent years have been understated, almost as if they were ashamed of being Rolls."
 Oddly, the small rectangular lights high on the fenders, near the hood, are actually pairs of turn signals and driving lights. The actual headlamps are round, and they are mounted low, near the bumper, where you expect the turn signals to be. The mixture of round and angular lights is visually unsettling. 
 The grille is massive and imposing; if laid on its side over a flame, you could probably barbecue enough hamburgers on it to satisfy all the New York Jets at once.
 The styling of the rest of the car is more successful. The back half has cues from the R- and S-Type Bentleys of the 1950's and 60's. The rear window is small; the taillights seem tiny by today's standards. 
 To foil sticky-fingered miscreants, the famous Rolls mascot, the Flying Lady, cleverly disappears into the grille at the touch of a button. (She can also be programmed to go into hiding when the car is locked.) The liquid-filled hubcaps rotate independently of the wheels, and when the car is stopped, the RR logo in the center is always in an upright position. 
 The car rides on huge 31-inch-high Michelin tires of a run-flat design, so no spare is necessary. But because of the tires' stiff sidewalls, a surprising amount of road noise is transmitted into the car. By contrast, the Maybach is as hushed as an Egyptian tomb. 
 As you might expect from a car with 531 pounds-feet of torque, the Phantom proceeds effortlessly and, according to Automobile magazine, reaches 60 m.p.h. from a stop in 5.7 seconds. Surprisingly, the body leans noticeably on corners. A company spokesman said that this was intentional, that Rolls had decided not to employ adaptive suspension technology -- as used in some BMW's -- to keep the car flat in turns. Rather, they felt that some lean provided a more natural feeling to passengers.
 As a result, on the highway the Phantom is not as surefooted as you might expect. The Maybach, by comparison, seems much more secure at high speeds. Above 90 m.p.h., the front end of the Phantom felt as if it were getting lighter and was starting to "float." 
 Quick lane changes were not the car's forte, and it felt uncertain and overweight when pushed hard on a country road. Admittedly, few Rolls-Royce owners will ever drive their Phantoms in such a spirited fashion, but in an age when computer-controlled suspensions are increasingly the norm on high-end cars, more roll stability should have been built into this Rolls.
 The Phantom's strong point is a cabin that wouldn't look out of place in one of the world's finest yachts. The dash is an elegant mix of retro and modern elements. The gauges are analog -- the speedometer, a combined fuel and water temperature gauge, and, unique to Rolls-Royce, a gauge labeled "power reserve" that provides an estimate of how much power remains at any instant. Chauffeurs with a hot-rodding inclination will note that there is no tachometer to report the engine's speed.
 Cows and trees should be wary of this car; up to 16 hides swathe each interior, which is also trimmed with as many as 60 pieces of individually lacquered wood. The steering wheel is elegant, with a hard, thin, leather-wrapped rim that has raised grips at the 4 and 8 o'clock positions, rather than the customary 2 and 10. This is another clue that Rolls-Royce expects you to drive in a relaxed manner.
 The Phantom features a version of iDrive, the widely decried computerized control system used in big BMW's. Butin a telling concession, Rolls lets you essentially bypass iDrive: the stereo and air-conditioning systems have separate, intuitive controls that are almost as clear as those in a $25,000 Honda Accord, a first for a German-designed luxury car.
 Should you wish to use iDrive, a panel in the center of the dash -- it contains an analog clock -- rotates to reveal the iDrive screen.
 The center console must be opened to gain access to the seat-positioning controls, which means that neither you nor your passenger can have your arms resting on the armrest if the seats need adjusting.
 On the Interstate, aside from tire noise, the car offered an experience fit for a king. The rear seat sits higher than those in front, so rear passengers have a view of the road as commanding as the driver's. 
 The interior is acoustically engineered so that with four people in the car all voices are clear, crisp and easily heard.
 Rolls-Royce plans to build only 1,000 Phantoms a year, with just 400 or so for the United States, so you are unlikely to see yourself coming and going at the mall, even if your mall is a very exclusive one.
 Both the Maybach and the Phantom, when equipped with the optional rear buckets, are priced at about $80,000 a seat. With the Mercedes-derived car, the owner gets a big sedan with unremarkable styling but impressive performance, along with an interior festooned with the latest in electronic gadgets. 
 The Phantom takes the opposite approach. It is visually arresting, with an opulent interior in the traditional English luxury-car style. With its lack of high-tech distractions, it entreats you to sit back and enjoy the ride in regal style.
 The Maybach is the better car, but the Phantom is the more striking statement of success.

ECONOMIC NEWS FOR OPTIMISTS

BYLINE:  By David Leonhardt

 BODY:
Many economists greeted last week's rosy economic news with a chorus of "Yes, but . . . "
 Sure, they said, the economy grew at an annual rate of 7.2 percent during the three months ending on Sept. 30, more quickly than any quarter since 1984. 
But employment still declined during the quarter, leaving many Americans with little to show for the boom. 
 This criticism -- and the fact that the calendar is about to turn to an election year -- has increased the attention on the Labor Department's next jobs report, to be published on Friday. Most forecasters expect a gain of about 50,000 jobs in October, similar to the increase of 57,000 in September, the first rise since January.
That would be far short of the 150,000 or more new jobs needed each month to keep pace with population growth, but would still represent progress compared to most of this year.
In other words, an increase of that size would be just enough to keep the optimists optimistic and the pessimists pessimistic.

 BODY:
 Dec. 5

FIVE SIDES OF A COIN -- A documentary about the power and culture of hip-hop, with Run DMC, Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmaster Flash, De La Soul and at least three dozen other artists. Paul Kell directed.

FORGET BAGHDAD -- A documentary about Jewish and Arab stereotypes, especially as seen in 100 years of film. Examples include Hollywood features, Israeli boureka comedies and Egyptian musical comedies. The film also focuses on the experience of Sephardic Jews, who may feel like foreigners in their own country. Directed by the Iraqi-born video artist Samir, whose family moved to Switzerland when he was a child.

FROM HERE TO ETERNITY -- The love scene on the beach (Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster clinched and drenched) is well known. Frank Sinatra's performance, as the scrappy Private Maggio, revived his stalled career and won him the Oscar for best supporting actor (one of eight Oscars the film received, including best picture). Montgomery Clift is Private Prewitt, the reluctant boxer, and Donna Reed is the ladylike hooker he falls for. The film, based on James Jones's novel about a military base in Hawaii just before Pearl Harbor, is exactly 50 years old. Fred Zinnemann, who did "High Noon" and went on to do "A Man for All Seasons," directed.

HONEY -- Jessica Alba (who made her name in the futuristic Fox series "Dark Angel") stars as an inner-city dancer who makes it big as a choreographer of music videos. Then she encounters sexual harassment. The cast also includes Lil' Romeo and Mekhi Phifer. Directed by Bille Woodruff.

THE LAST SAMURAI -- It's been a long time since Tom Cruise appeared on screen in period costume (and that was as a vampire). In this 19th-century epic, he's Nathan Algren, an alcoholic Civil War veteran who's been called to Japan to teach its army all about modern warfare. Which will mean the end of the samurai, and Algren becomes unsure that that's a good thing. Edward Zwick (whose film credits include "Glory") directed, and he wrote the screenplay with his former "thirtysomething" partner, Marshall Herskovitz, and John Logan. Tony Goldwyn, Billy Connolly and Ken Watanabe are Mr. Cruise's co-stars. A related article is on Page 6.

MONSIEUR IBRAHIM -- Omar Sharif plays a Muslim grocer who becomes good friends with an emotionally needy Jewish boy (Pierre Boulanger) in 1960's Paris. Mr. Sharif shared the best-actor audience award (with Benicio Del Toro for "21 Grams") for this role at the Venice International Film Festival. Francois Dupeyron directed.

PRISONER OF PARADISE -- In 1944, the Nazis decided to make a propaganda film about Theresienstadt, painting it as a utopian community rather than the death camp it was. To make the film, they chose Kurt Gerron, a German Jew who had been arrested in Amsterdam. Gerron was not just another prisoner. He had starred in "The Blue Angel" with Marlene Dietrich and had introduced the song "Mack the Knife" in the original Berlin production of "The Threepenny Opera." When the film, "The Fuhrer Gives a City to the Jews," was completed, Gerron was sent to Auschwitz and gassed. Malcolm Clarke (who did the Oscar-nominated short documentary "You Don't Have to Die") and Stuart Sender directed this film, which was nominated for best documentary feature of 2002 and is now being released commercially.

WHAT ALICE FOUND -- A drama about truck-stop prostitution. Emily Grace plays a young woman driving south to Florida. Bill Raymond and Judith Ivey are the seemingly nice couple who stop to help her when she has car trouble. They have some career ideas for her. A. Dean Bell wrote and directed.

Dec. 10

BIG FISH -- Tim Burton goes for heart-warming in this adventure drama about a dying father (Albert Finney) and his not-that-close son (Billy Crudup), who wants to know whether the tall tales that Dad told all those years were true. Really, where does a traveling salesman run into giants and witches? Jessica Lange is the dying man's wife, and Ewan McGregor and Alison Lohman play the couple's younger selves. The screenplay is by John August, who wrote "Go" (which everyone loved) and "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle" (which they didn't).

POWER TRIP -- During the Soviet years, a lot of people in Georgia didn't pay their electricity bills and nothing happened. But when AES, an American company, bought the power plant in the capital city, Tblisi, and bills weren't being paid, the company did things the American way: they turned off the power. Paul Devlin's documentary is about the fiasco.

Dec. 12

GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING -- Dad is suddenly unemployed after an accident at work. His 16-year-old daughter goes to work to help out the family. Then she falls in love with her married boss. In Peter Webber's film, this timeless story takes place in 17th-century Holland and the girl's employer is Johannes Vermeer, whose most famous paintings include a portrait of an unknown young woman, "Girl With a Pearl Earring." Colin Firth plays Vermeer and Scarlett Johansson, currently having her star-making moment in "Lost in Translation," plays Griet, the teenager turned housemaid. Based on the best-selling novel by Tracy Chevalier.

LOVE DON'T COST A THING -- We're remaking 1987 movies already? Sixteen years ago, "Can't Buy Me Love" starred Patrick Dempsey as a high school nerd who pays the prettiest girl in school to go out with him so people will think he's cool. This teenage romantic comedy stars Nick Cannon ("Drumline") as a high school nerd who pays the prettiest girl in school (Christina Milian) to date him for the same reason. Steve Harvey plays Mr. Cannon's father. Directed by Troy Beyer, who wrote and starred in "BAPS."

SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE -- We haven't seen Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton together since his Eugene O'Neill seduced her Louise Bryant in "Reds." This time his middle-aged character is dating her character's daughter (sexy Amanda Peet), but after he has a heart attack he realizes it's the older woman he really loves. But a young doctor (Keanu Reeves) feels the same way about her. Nancy Meyers, who wrote and directed, also wrote "Private Benjamin" and "Baby Boom" (starring Ms. Keaton) and directed "What Women Want."

THE STATEMENT -- For a man who turned 70 this year, Michael Caine is awfully busy. In this political thriller from Norman Jewison (whose last feature film was "The Hurricane"), Mr. Caine plays a former Nazi executioner who has led an undisturbed postwar life in France until he is suddenly on everyone's hit list. The cast also includes Tilda Swinton, Charlotte Rampling, Alan Bates, Jeremy Northam and Ciaran Hinds.

STUCK ON YOU -- The Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter, have given moviegoers comedy about multiple personalities, morbid obesity, dogs in body casts and wayward ejaculate. Now they turn to the world of conjoined twins. Bob (Greg Kinnear) and Walt (Matt Damon) share a liver, get along beautifully and make a great hockey player in their hometown. But now Bob wants to go to California to pursue his dream of becoming an actor, and Walt says he won't hold him back. In their new life, they come into contact with Cher, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, Jay Leno and Luke Wilson, who play themselves.

Dec. 17

THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING -- The end has come for Peter Jackson's film trilogy, based on J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy novels. Since all three films were shot at the same time, this one is likely to be as spectacular as the first two. When last we saw Tolkien's characters, Frodo (Elijah Wood) was getting a much-needed pep talk, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) was looking kingly and Gandalf the Gray (Ian McKellen) was looking grand on a white horse. Now the battle for Middle Earth begins, and someone has got to get that ring to Mount Doom and throw it into the fires. Other returning cast members include Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee. Gollum (Andy Serkis, plus computer generation), who won best virtual performance at the MTV Movie Awards, is back, too. A related article is on Page 6.

Dec. 19

THE BUTTERFLY -- An 8-year-old girl bonds with the elderly entomologist next door. A family drama starring Michel Serrault and Claire Bouanich. Directed by Philippe Muyl.

CALENDAR GIRLS -- In Britain, apparently, if you are desperate for funds, the thing to do is take off your clothes. It worked for the unemployed men in "The Full Monty." And it worked for the ladies of the Rylstone Women's Institute in Yorkshire. To raise money for leukemia research, they decided to pose for the group's annual calendar wearing pretty much nothing but pearls. The models were all in their 40's, 50's and 60's. Helen Mirren and Julie Walters star in the film version of this true story. Nigel Cole, who did "Saving Grace," directed.

THE FOG OF WAR -- "This is a movie filled with existential dread," says Errol Morris, the director. "There's this surreal sense that nothing has changed." The documentary in question is about Robert S. McNamara, secretary of defense during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. The film focuses on McNamara's involvement in the Vietnam War, the Cuban missile crisis and the World War II fire-bombing of Japan. When it was shown at the New York Film Festival last month, Stephen Holden, writing in The New York Times, called the film a "sober, beautifully edited documentary portrait."

THE HEBREW HAMMER -- Finally, a Jewish action hero. Jonathan Kesselman, the young writer and director of this satire, enjoys playing with stereotypes. The title character, whose real name is Mordechai Jefferson Carver (Adam Goldberg), is a Brooklyn private eye who, in his spare time, saves the world of Jewish culture and tradition. But, as the filmmakers point out, his mother still wishes he'd done more with his life. The Hammer is battling Santa Claus's son Damian (Andy Dick), who is out to eliminate Hanukkah. Mario Van Peebles plays the head of the Kwanzaa Liberation Front. Peter Coyote plays Bloomenbergansteinthal, head of the Jewish Justice League, which includes members of the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy.

MONA LISA SMILE -- Here's Julia Roberts, barely 36 and already playing the older woman. In this drama from Mike Newell, whose films include "Enchanted April," "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and "Donnie Brasco," Ms. Roberts plays an open-minded Berkeley graduate who takes a job teaching art history at Wellesley in 1953. She has wonderful students but is horrified to realize that they have no interest in using their minds beyond whatever it takes to land a husband. And so she questions their values and tries to shake things up. Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles and Maggie Gyllenhaal play students.

Dec. 24

CHILDREN OF LOVE -- ("Les Enfants de l'Amour") From Belgium, one weekend in the life of a family separated by divorce, focusing on the three children. Geoffrey Enthoven, the writer and director, began doing research for a documentary but turned it into a docudrama instead. The cast includes Nathalie Stas, Winnie Vigilante, Michael Philpot and Olivier Ythier.

MONSTER -- Newspapers called Aileen Wuornos the first female serial killer. She was a highway prostitute and drifter who killed at least six men and was executed last year in Florida. Wuornos has been the subject of a television movie, a feature documentary, an opera and an Off Off Broadway play. In the latest film version, written and directed by Patty Jenkins, Charlize Theron takes the role, playing way against type, and Christina Ricci portrays her young lover.

Dec. 25

CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN -- Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt seem made for each other as a pair of busy professionals with 12 children. This isn't exactly a remake of the 1950 film starring Clifton Webb as an efficiency expert who liked to test his theories on his own huge family: Mr. Martin plays a football coach who gets a new, time-consuming city job and Ms. Hunt is an author on a book tour, and both could use some time-management guidance. Their children include Piper Perabo, Tom Welling (the young Clark Kent on "Smallville") and Hilary Duff. Ashton Kutcher plays a boyfriend that Dad doesn't like. Mr. Martin has plenty of opportunities for physical comedy, including swinging from a chandelier. Shawn Levy ("Big Fat Liar") directed.

COLD MOUNTAIN -- Anthony Minghella's last two films, "The English Patient" and "The Talented Mr. Ripley," were major winners. Now he's written and directed this Civil War drama, based on Charles Frazier's novel of the same name. Jude Law plays a badly wounded Confederate soldier who leaves the hospital and begins a long walk home to North Carolina and the woman he loves (Nicole Kidman). She, meanwhile, is trying to manage her dead father's farm. Luckily a helpful drifter (Renee Zellweger -- an American!) turns up and stays. North Carolina's film industry may be thriving, but this film was shot in South Carolina, Virginia and Romania. A related article is on Page 1.

THE COMPANY -- It's going to be hard for Robert Altman to top his last film, "Gosford Park," but he's giving it a go with this backstage story of the ballet world. He says he hopes to capture "the work itself in all its demanding beauty." Barbara Turner (a co-writer of "Petulia," Richard Chamberlain's best movie, and the glorious "Pollock") did the screenplay, based on a story she wrote with Neve Campbell. Ms. Campbell ("Party of Five") is the central character, a young ballerina on the brink. The cast also includes James Franco, who gave an uncanny performance in TNT's "James Dean"; Malcolm McDowell; and members of the Joffrey Ballet.

PAYCHECK -- Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck), a computer engineer, has two big problems in this sci-fi thriller: his $4.4 billion paycheck has been canceled and his memories of the last two years have been erased. (That's the way he manages to work on top-secret projects without confidentiality dangers.) In trying to figure out what happened, he's aided by the woman he both works with and loves (Uma Thurman). Aaron Eckhart is back in bad-guy mode as Jennings's boss. John Woo directed, and Dean Georgaris wrote the screenplay, based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, whose stories and novels have been turned into films including "Blade Runner," "Total Recall" and "Minority Report." Related articles are on Pages 9 and 28.

PETER PAN -- After Mary Martin, Sandy Duncan, Cathy Rigby and Mia Farrow comes a Peter Pan actually played by a 14-year-old boy (Jeremy Sumpter). P. J. Hogan, who did "My Best Friend's Wedding," directed, and Michael Goldenberg ("Contact") wrote the screenplay, based on J. M. Barrie's classic, and frequently filmed, British play. The cast also includes Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy in the second Harry Potter movie) as Captain Hook, Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy and Ludivine Sagnier (the sexy teenager in "Swimming Pool") as Tinker Bell.

YOUNG BLACK STALLION -- A prequel to the 1979 film "The Black Stallion," based on the Walter Farley novel. Seems that before the mysterious Arabian horse met
his best human friend at sea and bonded with him during a shipwreck, he had a significant emotional relationship with a little girl who had been separated from her father. The cast includes Biana Tamimi, Richard Romanus and Patrick Elyas. Simon Wincer ("Free Willy" but also "Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles") directed. Jeanne Rosenberg, who was one of three co-writers on the first "Black Stallion" movie (which was directed by Carroll Ballard), did the screenplay. This is Disney's first dramatic feature made for Imax and other large-screen formats.

Dec. 26

HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG -- Sometimes the American dream doesn't come easy. Ben Kingsley plays an Iranian immigrant, a former member of the Shah's inner circle now reduced to doing menial jobs. He jumps at the chance to buy a house for back taxes, but it turns out that the house was seized erroneously and the evicted owner (Jennifer Connelly) has troubles of her own. Ron Eldard, who impressed New York theatergoers in "Death of a Salesman" and "Bash," is a deputy sheriff who gets far more involved than he should. Vadim Perelman, a Russian-born newcomer, wrote and directed. Based on the 1999 novel by Andre Dubus III.

MODERN TIMES -- Charlie Chaplin's last silent film and one of his comic masterpieces. Chaplin, who wrote and directed, stars as a factory employee -- his classic character the Little Tramp -- who has a nervous breakdown shortly after a test of an automated "feeding machine" (created so workers won't have to take breaks while eating lunch). He ends up in jail (he loves it there), goes back to a factory (where some large wheels eat his tool box and a co-worker), gets a job as a department store night watchman, becomes a hero while under the accidental influence of cocaine and ends up as a singing-dancing waiter with Paulette Goddard, his favorite waif.

JAPANESE STORY -- Which, of course, takes place in Australia. Toni Collette stars as a geologist stuck with baby-sitting a prospective client (Gotaro Tsunashima) who won't be satisfied with the usual city tour. She dislikes him on sight and he doesn't seem to care for her either, but at his request she takes him into the outback, where they eventually face a life or death situation. It's a love story, an adventure, a culture clash and an odd-couple comedy all in one, directed by Sue Brooks and written by Alison Tilson. This is Ms. Collette's return to her home country's film industry after appearing in a number of American and British movies ("The Sixth Sense," "About a Boy," "Far From Heaven").

Schwab Thinking Small in Subleasing in Jersey City

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
CHARLES SCHWAB & COMPANY made the decision before the gleaming glass 19-story, 577,000-square-foot office tower built to its specifications on Jersey City's waterfront was even complete: go to Plan B.
 It was not that the building itself, Plaza 10 at Harborside Financial Center, had somehow fallen short. It was that the San Francisco-based brokerage house's need for it shrank in the economic downturns of late 2000 and 2001, as the structure was going up. Schwab had signed a 15-year lease for the entire structure, built and owned -- until recently -- by the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation. It put the entire building up for sublease in late 2001. 
 After the Sept. 11 attack on the financial district in New York, two large financial service companies moved in: Mizuho Bank, a Japanese bank taking 107,000 square feet, and Instinet, an electronic brokerage service arm of Reuters, taking 144,000 square feet. The rest of Plaza 10 -- 326,000 square feet -- remained vacant, though, as the economic slump went on, new buildings continued to rise on the Hudson riverfront, and more and more sublease space was thrown onto the commercial office market. 
Last spring, Schwab and its brokers -- Cushman & Wakefield and Handler Real Estate Services -- decided it was time for Plan C: break up the floors of the building, if necessary, and recruit smaller tenants aggressively -- offering them all the amenities Schwab had built into Plaza 10, as well as architects and builders to customize a tenant's space and a big break on the rent. Schwab's long-term lease is for $34 per square foot annually, but sublease deals of about $25-a-square-foot are being offered, for terms as short as five years or less. 
Schwab's real estate director, Paul J. McDevitt, said Cushman's broker-analysts came up with the approach. "Cushman recommended that this low-hanging fruit was being ignored by others," Mr. McDevitt said. "We thought we would take the opportunity to go after it."
Jersey City has traditionally been sought after as a site for large administrative and back-office operations for Manhattan financial services firms and other corporations. But the market for such big-fish tenants has slowed drastically in the last several years. 
"UBS Paine Webber, over at the Newport Office Center VII, a stone's throw away, is in virtually the same situation as Schwab," said Richard Donahue, a Cushman broker, referring to the fact that that company has had a half-million square feet of space available for sublease for almost two years.
He also mentioned a Goldman Sachs building nearing completion at the harborfront. Goldman Sachs has said it will occupy all of its own building, but brokers expect it will occupy only a fraction of it. Also, Lehman Brothers has 375,000 square feet on the market for sublease in Jersey City, he said. 
When these mammoth firms, and others, came to Jersey City in the 90's, "the market was hot as a pistol, with virtually no vacancy," Mr. Donahue said. "But financial service firms are not in an aggressive growth mode any longer -- is that an understatement, or what?"
Last summer, Schwab and Cushman held a large reception for real estate brokers to begin the new pitch to smaller users. "Mr. McDevitt made it irresistible for brokers to bring deals," said a Jersey City realtor, Skip Dolan, who heads Dolan Realty, which deals primarily with small-office tenants. "He said: 'We will not be undersold.' "
"I didn't let any grass grow under my feet," Mr. Dolan said. "I brought over eight tenants, and there are six transactions pending."
Mr. Donahue, who is handling the Schwab subleasing for Cushman, said deals with five new tenants had closed in the last six weeks, and two more were on the brink.
The seven deals will fill only 13 percent of the available space. "But we have momentum," Mr. Donahue said. "Obviously, it takes more time and work to fill a large office space with smaller tenants, but we are discovering there is a real market in it."
THE new tenants at Plaza 10 include Park Avenue Capital, which will relocate from Park Avenue at 57th Street in Manhattan, taking 3,500 square feet; Unigestion Ltd., a Swiss financial firm opening its first United States office, taking 4,521 square feet; and Perr & Knight, an insurance company based in Pacific Palisades, Calif., opening its first East Coast location and taking 4,181 square feet.
Two other tenants are relocating from within Jersey City: Arlington Hill Investment Management, taking 5,120 square feet, and Welgrow International, a shipping company, taking 3,972 square feet.
Lease terms on the five new deals range from five to 15 years.
One factor making the deals easier, Mr. Donahue said, is that Mack-Cali no longer owns the building, although it continues to manage it. Mack-Cali owns five other office buildings totaling more than three million square feet of Class A office space at Harborside Financial Center. Its agreement with brokers had been that any potential tenant shown space at Plaza 10 also had to be shown available space in the other buildings as well.
Plaza 10 was sold on Sept. 29 to a Manhattan-based investor, IStar Financial, for $194 million. Real estate executives believe that is the highest price ever paid for a building in the area but noted it is still a bargain by Manhattan standards. The purchase price came to $336 per square foot. Last year, 399 Park Avenue, a trophy property in Manhattan, sold for more than $600 a square foot. The landmark G.M. Building recently sold for more than $800 a square foot.
"When Mack-Cali sold," Mr. Donahue said, " the benefit for us was that it became wonderfully easy to go after tenants our own way. The complications with Mack-Cali disappeared." Mr. Dolan said he now told potential tenants for the Schwab building that "all tenants are being treated like 100,000-square-foot tenants."
"Smaller companies needing space don't have the people in house to do a build-out when they sign the lease," Mr. Dolan said. "They don't have time to hire a contractor, an architect, etc. But Schwab is providing those things. If a tenant needs X number of private offices, a server room, a pantry and a certain size bullpen for its employees, they make their reqests -- and within a few days' time, they get a set of plans."
Paul Spiegel of Handler, the brokers working with Cushman, said the Schwab property raises the bar as to what is available to smaller tenants in the New York metropolitan area. The building offers space with substantial glass, partitioning and tenant-controlled air-conditioning, since the systems were installed floor by floor.
If all that were to be available to a small tenant in Manhattan, it would almost certainly cost more than what Schwab is charging now, Mr. Spiegel said.
In addition, he said, the Jersey City building has an added amenity: the view. "The best views of Manhattan, the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge are from the Jersey side of the Hudson," Mr. Spiegel said. "Everybody knows that."
Mr. Donahue said he could not speculate on how long it might take to fill up the building, small tenant by small tenant. "All I know," he said, "is that this is working, after a long period of things that weren't working, so we're going with it."

HEADLINE: Did the Tax Cut Help the Economy? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Spotted: Evidence That Tax Cut Worked" (Economic View, Oct. 19): 
 Critics of President Bush's tax plan do not address the short-term, and possibly short-lived, economic gains of the tax cut. 
Instead they are worried about the effects on long-term growth, and their criticisms are still very valid.
 The Bush tax cut, combined with increased government spending, is creating huge projected deficits. These deficits are even more alarming if we take account of needed Social Security reform. 
 Other, less regressive tax cuts would have resulted in a bigger stimulus in the short run, making the bitter pill of large deficits a little easier to swallow. Low income people do spend a larger percentage of their income, thus suggesting that less regressive cuts would have resulted in a larger stimulus.

Disaster Aid: The Mix Of Mercy and Politics

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH'S declaration last week that the wildfires in Southern California were a "major disaster" was the 50th such declaration he has issued this year.
 That is more than one disaster a week, double the average annual figure in the 1980's. At the rate he is going, Mr. Bush's total for the year could approach the record of 75 disasters declared by President Clinton in 1996, his re-election year. 
 When a president declares a region a disaster zone, like the four counties in California hit by fires, millions, even in a few cases billions, of federal dollars become available overnight. The residents can be eligible for assistance ranging from unemployment benefits to temporary housing to low-interest loans, and the communities receive grants to cover expenses like debris removal, repairs to damaged buildings and emergency public services. 
No one seriously believes there are more floods, fires and pestilence than there used to be. What has happened, in the view of students of the subject, is that presidents have discovered the political utility of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster program.
Without question, the fires last week left a terrible trail of devastation, destroying more than 3,100 houses and other structures. But in a comprehensive analysis of disaster declarations over the years, two economists, Thomas A. Garrett of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and Russell S. Sobel of West Virginia University, found this year that "nearly half of all disaster relief is motivated politically rather than by need."
They used as the takeoff point for their paper this quotation from Congressional testimony in 1996 by James Lee Witt, then the director of the emergency management agency: "Disasters are very political events."
Mr. Witt declined to be interviewed for this article. Several other politicians and officials said they agreed with Mr. Witt's description, but they said it only after being promised their names would not be used.
"It's so awkward to talk about," said Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon. "You don't want to appear mean-spirited."
The reluctance of politicians to speak out leaves criticism of the disaster programs primarily to an odd alliance of free-market conservative economists and avid environmentalists.
Even the most ardent libertarians do not hold that the federal government should offer no help when communities are devastated -- by a big earthquake, say, or a powerful storm. 
"There are national emergencies in which there is clearly a legitimate role for the government," said John Frydenlund, a senior fellow at Citizens Against Government Waste, a conservative research and lobbying organization. "But what's happening in agriculture, for instance, is that some part of the country has a little too much or too little rain, and there is pressure to declare a disaster area."
When assistance is too freely available, Mr. Frydenlund and some other economists say, it can result in more harm than good.
They hold that private disaster insurance is more expensive and less widely available than it should be because federal relief programs reduce the demand for private coverage. They also argue that the programs induce risky behavior, allowing Californians whose homes are destroyed by fire, for instance, to rebuild on fire-prone hillsides.
Other economists are more concerned about what they see as the inequity in requiring struggling taxpayers in, say, North Dakota, to pay taxes to cover the expenses every time a hurricane strikes affluent taxpayers in South Florida. In many parts of the country, statistics show, the farther people live from the coastline, where the property is most vulnerable to storms and flooding, the less well off the people are likely to be.
The case against the relief programs that environmentalists make is that natural disasters are part of the normal ecological cycle.
Federal flood insurance, to take one example, has often resulted in people building or rebuilding on high-risk flood plains that are "some of the richest and most important ecological areas in the country," said David Conrad, a water resources specialist at the National Wildlife Federation.
But these arguments carry little weight with the politicians. Rarely does any lawmaker take issue with offering money to regions where disasters have occurred. One reason, some suggest, is that the day may come when their states or districts will be seeking relief.
The disaster relief law is vague on how it should be applied, so presidents have great latitude. The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, has recommended more specific guidelines and standards for years, but Congress has never seen fit to enact them.
Mr. Clinton was a master at showing compassion and spreading the wealth. Time and again at countless fires, floods and blizzards, he showed up to hug victims and offer the government's largess. The television correspondent Brit Hume once called him "almost the national chaplain to those in distress."
Mr. Bush has picked up where his predecessor left off. People are likely to remember the California fires and Hurricane Isabel for years to come. But how many remember even now the ice storm that struck South Carolina last January, the winter storm in upstate New York in April or the heavy rains in New Hampshire and Vermont in July, all belonging to the president's list of 50?
Still, even the president's staunchest political opponents in Congress are not complaining. To the bill providing $87 billion for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq, Congressional negotiators last week added $500 million for "disaster relief activities associated with recently declared disasters, such as Hurricane Isabel and the California wildfires."
The words "such as" were added at the end of the negotiations to appease lawmakers whose states and districts were not affected by the fires or the storm, but perhaps had some other emergency.

HEADLINE: Half a Step on Iraqi Security 

 BODY:
The Bush administration made a smart decision last week to speed the training of an Iraqi civil defense militia to help patrol the seething Sunni Arab area around Baghdad. Yet not even tens of thousands of new civil defense officers can relieve America of its larger military responsibilities in Iraq. Until there is a sovereign Iraqi government with a rebuilt national army, purged of top Baathists and carefully balanced among Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, substantial international military forces will be needed. And until the United States occupation gives way to an international administration, most of those troops will have to be American. 
 With White House political strategists eager to see American troops headed home before next year's election and Pentagon planners scrambling to keep weary Army and Reserve units in the field, the administration should be eager to transfer sovereignty and internationalize the occupation. Yet despite cosmetic concessions in the latest Security Council resolution, Washington clings to its unrealistic insistence on unilateral occupation. Iraqis and Americans are paying the consequences. 
 It isn't surprising that President Bush now calls for training thousands of Iraqi militiamen. Violence is spiraling, American troops are stretched to their limits and no significant foreign military contributions are in sight. Even if more American troops were available, having them patrol cities and towns is a bad idea. 
Using heavily armed American troops for policing risks fanning resentment and plays into the hands of the Saddam Hussein loyalists, religious fanatics and extreme Sunni nationalists believed to be behind recent terrorist attacks. Along with relief organizations and Iraqis working with Washington, American soldiers have become regular targets. Over the past month, the number of attacks directed against the 130,000 United States troops in Iraq has grown to nearly three dozen a day. 
Some 90,000 Iraqis now work for American occupation authorities, including police, border patrol officers and guards protecting vital infrastructure. About 5,000 have been given civil defense training, with another 10,000 scheduled for training. The White House wants to quicken that schedule so that tens of thousands of Iraqi militiamen can be sent into the region around Baghdad. 
The training should not be abbreviated too drastically. Some of the trainees are men in their late teens, others could be former Iraqi Army members. Care must be taken to vet those joining the new militia force so that it is not infiltrated by hard-core Baathists or other extremists. If these precautions are observed, accelerated recruitment and training is a good idea. Not only can it ease tensions between Iraqis and American troops, it can also free more Americans to hunt Saddam Hussein and his inner circle and to hold mutually suspicious regions together while a constitution is drafted, elections held and the economy rebuilt.
Those tasks will very likely require 100,000 or more foreign troops for many months to come. That will strain American military capacities unless significant help is provided by countries like France, Russia and India. None seem eager to offer troops. But they will be more likely to do so if the request comes from a real Iraqi government.
Lack of security in Iraq is holding up relief work, economic revival and constitutional progress. Washington says that transferring more power to Iraqis and the international community must wait until there is more stability. Achieving that stability will require substantial Iraqi and international help, some of which will be available only when Washington loosens its grip on power in Baghdad.

THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS -- As the trailer says, "Everything that has a beginning has an end." And this is it for Andy and Larry Wachowski's trilogy about a world in which everything humans think they know is just a computer simulation. Keanu Reeves carries on as Neo, who may or may not be the One to save humanity. Alien ships invade Zion, the city where the last free humans live. There's something about a train and rogue programs, and if you don't know who the Sentinels are, you could be lost. Laurence Fishburne returns as Morpheus, Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. Mary Alice plays the Oracle, replacing Gloria Foster, who died two years ago of complications from diabetes.

THE REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED -- (a k a "Chavez: Inside the Coup") California hasn't been the only place dealing with a recall referendum. Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela since 1998, has faced a general strike, the near collapse of his country's economy and a coup (in April 2002) that ousted him from office for a weekend. He now faces a recall movement, with the possibility of a vote early next year. Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain, documentary filmmakers from Ireland, were in the right places at the right times.

ANYTHING BUT LOVE -- If "Far From Heaven" was a tribute to 1950's melodramas and "Down With Love" a fond remembrance of the Doris Day and Rock Hudson comedies around the same time, this film, directed by Robert Cary, is a tribute to the Technicolor musicals of that era. But this one is set in the present. Isabel Rose, who wrote the film with Mr. Cary, stars as Billie Golden, a 21st-century woman obsessed with 1940's and 50's glamour. She's also torn between two men: the boy she adored in high school and a jaded pianist. Which one will make her feel more like Rita Hayworth?

BILLABONG ODYSSEY -- A docudrama about some of the world's best surfers, and you can probably guess what they're doing. Yes, searching for the biggest wave on the planet. Locations include California, Mexico, Hawaii, Australia and Tahiti. Surfers include Mike Parsons, Ken Bradshaw, Layne Beachley and Brad Gerlach. Philip Boston is the first-time director.

ELF -- Will Ferrell, whose last notable film was "Old School," plays a human brought up among elves at the North Pole. Having always felt different, he travels south to find his biological father (James Caan) and learns that New Yorkers have forgotten the true meaning of Christmas (a problem they've had at least since "Miracle on 34th Street," in 1947). Ed Asner plays Santa Claus. Directed by Jon Favreau, who's gone in unexpected directions since "Swingers."

GLOOMY SUNDAY -- ("Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod") A restaurateur, a pianist, a waitress, a Nazi and a very depressing song in 1930's Budapest. The song is "Gloomy Sunday" ("Angels have no thoughts/ Of ever returning you/ Would they be angry/ If I thought of joining you?"), written by Rezso Seress and later given English lyrics by Sam M. Lewis. And it's true that the song became notorious for supposedly driving people to suicide when they heard it. Erika Maroszan, Joachim Krol, Stefano Dionisi and Ben Becker star in this romantic-triangle drama about moral choices and betrayal. Rolf Schubel directed.

HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT -- Ever wonder where the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega went to school? The same place as Roberto D'Aubuisson of El Salvador. It's the Western Hemisphere Institute of Security Cooperation (formerly the School of the Americas), a military training facility for Latin American soldiers and police officers. The odd thing is that it's in Fort Benning, Ga. And some people are unhappy about that, including John H. Smihula, the director of this documentary.

IN MY SKIN -- A French drama about self-mutilation. Marina de Van, who was Francois Ozon's co-writer on "Eight Women" and "Under the Sand," wrote, directed and stars. She plays a woman who has an accident and becomes so fascinated by her wounds that she starts inflicting new ones on herself. Her boyfriend (Laurent Lucas) doesn't quite know what to do. Lots of graphic gore.

JUST AN AMERICAN BOY -- What kind of American artist would write a song about John Walker Lindh, the American who joined forces with the Taliban? That would be Steve Earle, a longtime singer, songwriter and political activist, who told Jason Zengerle in The New York Times Magazine last year, "I felt like no one was trying to even consider for one second how he got to where he got." This combination concert film (shot during a 2002 tour) and documentary was directed by Amos Poe, who did "Alphabet City" in 1984.

LOVE ACTUALLY -- Things have worked out well before when Hugh Grant and the screenwriter Richard Curtis worked together ("Four Weddings and a Funeral," "Notting Hill," "Bridget Jones's Diary"). In Mr. Curtis's first film as a director, an ensemble romantic comedy set mostly in London, Mr. Grant plays a bachelor prime minister who falls in love with the young woman (Martine McCutcheon) whose job is to bring him tea. Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth and Laura Linney (token American?) are among his co-stars, involved in relationships of their own. Billy Bob Thornton plays the president of the United States, which no longer seems strange at all. A related article is on Page 3.

LOVE FORBIDDEN -- ("Defense D'aimer") If you're going to question your sexual orientation, what better place than in an Italian villa? In this psychological drama from France, a young student, Bruce (Rodolphe Marconi, who also wrote and directed), has a chance to live and study in Rome. He leaves his girlfriend behind in Paris and soon meets a villa employee, Matteo (Andrea Necci), who seems both interesting and interested. But both men are absolutely sure they're straight.

MARTIN AND ORLOFF -- A black comedy about a failed suicide attempt. Matt Walsh and Ian Roberts of the improvisational group the Upright Citizens Brigade star. The troupe's other members, Amy Poehler and Matt Besser, make appearances, as do Janeane Garofalo, Andy Richter, Tina Fey and David Cross. Mr. Roberts is the suicidal patient, a mascot-costume designer traumatized because of the drowning death of a man in an egg-roll costume. Seems Mr. Roberts's character forgot to include eye holes. Mr. Walsh plays his psychotherapist, who turns their sessions into odd field trips. Lawrence Blume is the first-time director.

Nov. 12

MY ARCHITECT -- Louis Kahn designed, among other things, the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Tex., and the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., but it's his unorthodox private life that gets people's attention. He had three "wives" at once and a child by each. A son, Nathaniel Kahn, wrote and directed this documentary about Kahn, who in 1974 was found dead in a Penn Station men's room. When the film was shown at the New Directors/New Films festival in March, Stephen Holden, writing in The New York Times, called it "a meticulously structured portrait of a complicated man" with an "extra twinge" of poignancy.

Nov. 14

THE GOSPEL OF JOHN -- Not to be confused with Mel Gibson's film "The Passion." The life of Jesus, with Henry Ian Cusick, a Royal Shakespeare Company actor, as Jesus. Christopher Plummer is the narrator. Philip Saville, who has done mostly television work here and in Britain, directed. The screenplay is by John Goldsmith, using word-for-word dialogue from the American Bible Society's Good News Bible, in which John 3:16 becomes "God loved the people of this world so much that he gave his only son so that everyone who has faith in him will have eternal life and never really die." Nobody said it was pithy.

A HOUSE ON A HILL -- This one rings some "Life as a House" bells. Philip Baker Hall plays an elderly architect turned teacher who has pretty much given up on life and on the hillside, ocean-view house he began building decades ago. When a young couple want to buy it and have him finish it, everyone starts evolving emotionally. With Laura San Giacomo and Shirley Knight. From Chuck Workman, best known for his documentaries ("100 Years at the Movies," "Superstar: The Life and Times of Andy Warhol") and an Oscar winner for his short film "Precious Images."

LOONEY TUNES: BACK IN ACTION -- And so they are. Daffy Duck, fed up with Hollywood, teams up with a stunt man (Brendan Fraser -- all of him, not just his voice) to search for a missing diamond. Jenna Elfman, Joan Cusack, Steve Martin, Timothy Dalton and Heather Locklear (whose character's name is Dusty Tails) also star, in live action, alongside animated favorites including Porky Pig, Tweety Pie, Sylvester and Yosemite Sam. Directed by Joe Dante, whose credits include "Gremlins" and "Innerspace." A related article is on Page 3.

MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD -- Peter Weir directs his countryman Russell Crowe, who is in period costume again. This time Mr. Crowe is Jack Aubrey, the early-19th-century sea captain of Patrick O'Brian's seafaring novels. Paul Bettany plays Aubrey's best friend, the ship's doctor. And if the water looks familiar, that's because it's in the same gigantic tank the makers of "Titanic" used. Mr. Weir rarely misses (from "Picnic at Hanging Rock" to "Witness" to "The Truman Show"), but can Mr. Crowe live up to Johnny Depp's new reputation as sexiest movie swashbuckler?

THE SINGING FOREST -- Reincarnation can be so inconvenient. Two gay lovers who died in the Holocaust come back, meet and fall in love all over again. The only problem is that one of them is the fiance of the other man's daughter. Written and directed by Jorge Ameer, whose past films have included "Strippers" and "My Straight Boyfriend." With Craig Pinkston, Erik Morris and Shelley Price.

TUPAC: RESURRECTION -- The rap star Tupac Shakur was only 25 when he died in September 1996 (from wounds inflicted in a drive-by shooting), but he was already a famous and controversial figure. Lauren Lazin's documentary about him appeared at the Sundance Film Festival in January; Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times wrote that it lacked a "clarifying vision," but the film was still a work in progress at the time.

I VITELLONI -- ("The Loafers") Federico Fellini's third film and one of his best, released in Italy in 1953 and in the United States three years later. It's the story of five young men in the provinces, wasting their lives and concerned about turning 30. (Fellini was 33 when the film was first released.)

Nov. 19

THE MISSING -- Ron Howard goes western. (His last film, "A Beautiful Mind," was a northeastern.) Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett star as an estranged New Mexico father and daughter who are forced together when the daughter's own daughter is kidnapped. With Evan Rachel Wood, Jenna Boyd and Aaron Eckhart. Ken Kaufman ("Space Cowboys") wrote the screenplay, based on Thomas Eidson's novel "The Last Ride."

TICKET TO JERUSALEM -- A drama about a Palestinian projectionist who travels from place to place showing movies to schoolchildren. One day a teacher asks him to bring his show to some students in Jerusalem, which presents a challenge. With Gassan Abbas, Areen Omari and George Ibrahim. Rashid Masharawi wrote and directed.

Nov. 21

THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS -- ("Les Invasions Barbares") Denys Arcand's group of oversexed Montreal dinner-party intellectuals (friends, lovers, exes) from "The Decline of the American Empire" is back. This time Remy (Remy Girard) is on his deathbed and determined to reconcile with everyone, although he's divorced from Louise (Dorothee Berryman) and not really speaking to his son (Stephane Rousseau), who's living in London. The first film was witty and delightfully talky, and the Cannes Film Festival judges seemed to like the second one. They gave awards to Mr. Arcand's screenplay and to Marie-Josee Croze, who plays a drug addict, as best actress.

BLUE GATE CROSSING -- From Taiwan, a high school romantic triangle with extra complications. Girl A acts as go-between for her best friend, Girl B, and Boy A. But Boy A likes Girl A better, and as if that weren't enough, Girl A really wants Girl B. Written and directed by Chin-yen Yee. With Bo-lin Chen, Lun-mei Guey and Shu-hui Liang.

DR. SEUSS' THE CAT IN THE HAT -- Theodor Geisel's large, mischievous kitty was a flop on Broadway as narrator of "Seussical!," but then the show didn't have Mike Myers. Mr. Myers plays the title role (it had to be he or Jim Carrey), who really messes up the house one day. It all starts with eating cake in the bathtub. The cast also includes Dakota Fanning (cute little girl of the year), Spencer Breslin, Kelly Preston, Alec Baldwin and Sean Hayes (as the voice of the Fish). Directed by Bo Welch, who has stuck mostly to production design ("Men in Black," "Primary Colors," "Edward Scissorhands") until now.

DUCK, YOU SUCKER -- ("Giu la Testa") It was Sergio Leone's penultimate credited film, released here in 1972, and many people consider it his most underrated. James Coburn plays an I.R.A. soldier far from home at the turn of the last century, and Rod Steiger is a Mexican bandit getting involved with his country's revolution. They team up and learn how different their values are. The film was also known in English as "A Fistful of Dynamite."

GOTHIKA -- Halle Berry, Robert Downey Jr. and a vengeful spirit? Good start. In this horror thriller from Mathieu Kassovitz ("La Haine"), Ms. Berry plays a psychologist who wakes up one day to find herself a patient in the mental institution where she works. And she finds herself accused of the murder of her husband (Charles S. Dutton), head of a prison psychiatric ward. Ms. Berry's character begins behaving strangely, but the cause may be something spookier than mere insanity. Mr. Downey plays a colleague and Penelope Cruz a disturbed patient. The screenplay is by Sebastian Gutierrez. Related articles are on Pages 9 and 28.

EL LEYTON -- From Chile, a romantic triangle that turns into a thriller. Two fishermen, longtime friends, are set against each other when one man has an affair with the other man's wife. Gonzalo Justiniano directed.

MAIL ORDER BRIDE -- If you're a Russian mail-order bride and you want to scam some lonely American man, don't pick a guy connected to the Mafia. When Nina (Ivana Milicevic) makes this mistake, an American mob boss (Danny Aiello) sends his nephew Anthony (Robert Capelli Jr.) to Moscow to retrieve her and the money. Sadly, Anthony isn't all that bright and neither is the Moscow mob boss's son (Slava Schoot) assigned as his partner. It's an action comedy directed by Mr. Capelli and Jeffrey Wolf. And my, how Moscow has changed!

THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE -- ("Les Triplettes de Belleville") Animated comedy written and directed by Sylvain Chomet, whose 1998 "Vieille Dame et les Pigeons" was nominated for the Oscar for best animated short. A related article is on Page 1.

21 GRAMS -- So far this drama from the team that did "Amores Perros" -- Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the director, and Guillermo Arriaga, the writer -- is talked about mostly for the meaning of its title. Seems that right after death, the human body weighs 21 grams less than before, and some like to say that's the
weight of the soul. But this is quite a cast, including Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro, in a drama about a college professor, an ex-con and a formerly reckless wife-and-mom whose families are thrown together after a tragic accident. Last month, when it was the closing night selection at the New York Film Festival, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times that the film was "an extraordinarily satisfying vision" that "may well be the crowning work of this year."

Nov. 26

BAD SANTA -- John Ritter's next to last film ("Manhood," the last, hasn't been released yet) is a crime comedy. Mr. Ritter, who died in September, plays a shopping mall manager who is understandably upset when two con men (Billy Bob Thornton and Tony Cox) pose as Santa Claus and his right-hand elf and do some store-to-store shoplifting. But you can be sure someone will teach them the real meaning of Christmas before it's over. The cast also includes Bernie Mac and Lauren Graham. Terry Zwigoff, whose last two films were "Ghost World" and "Crumb," both a little off-center, directed.

EL BONAERENSE -- A touch of "The Big Easy," a touch of "Cops," a lot of Argentina. Jorge Roman stars as a locksmith who gets into trouble in his provincial hometown and has to be sent to the big city. He becomes a member of the Buenos Aires police force and quickly learns that corruption is all around him. With Dario Levy and Mimi Ardu. Written and directed by Pablo Trapero.

THE COOLER -- Bernie Lootz (William H. Macy) is the unluckiest man in Las Vegas, and his bad luck is contagious. Which makes for an odd career opportunity: a casino owner (Alec Baldwin) employs him to hang around and jinx customers who are winning too much. But when Bernie falls in love with a cocktail waitress (Maria Bello), his luck changes. And that's not good for the casino. Wayne Kramer directed.

THE HAUNTED MANSION -- Basing a movie on a theme-park ride seemed like a stupid idea a year ago, but that was before "Pirates of the Caribbean" earned $46 million on its opening weekend. This time we have a family horror comedy about a workaholic dad (Eddie Murphy), a real estate broker charged with selling a house that has a history. There are zombies, there are dark spirits and there's a friendly ghost (Martin Klebba), who may teach Mr. Murphy's character something Disneyesque about making time for family. Directed by Rob Minkoff, who did both "Stuart Little" movies. Written by David Berenbaum, a newcomer who also wrote "Elf."

IN AMERICA -- Jim Sheridan tells his own story or at least a variation on it. After "My Left Foot," "In the Name of the Father" and "The Boxer," all set in his native Ireland, Mr. Sheridan sets this family drama in the United States. It's about a young Irish immigrant couple (Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton) who move to New York with their two daughters, no money, a dream of a new life and overwhelming grief for their dead child.

TIMELINE -- Things are going smoothly for a group of student archaeologists working on a medieval dig in France, until their professor (Billy Connolly) disappears. He's traveled back to the 14th century and now they have to follow him there and keep him alive or there will be dire consequences. At least that's the way it worked in Michael Crichton's novel. Richard Donner ("Lethal Weapon," "Superman") directed. With Paul Walker ("The Fast and the Furious"), Frances O'Connor (the mom in "A.I."), David Thewlis ("Naked") and Anna Friel ("The Land Girls").

Nov. 28

HUKKLE -- ("Hiccup") When this film was shown at the New Directors/New Films series this year, Stephen Holden, writing in The New York Times, called it a "luminous directorial debut" for Gyorgy Palfi. And although it's mostly a beautifully photographed nature film ("a pastoral symphony"), there is also a plot: a murder case in a rural Hungarian village. With Ferenc Bandi, Jozsefne Racz and Jozsef Forkas.

INDEPENDENT SPIRITS: FAITH HUBLEY/JOHN HUBLEY -- The Hubleys, a mom-and-pop operation that made it big in American animation many decades ago, won three Oscars -- for "Moonbird," "The Hole" and "Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature" -- plus the jury prize (shared with Garry Trudeau) at the Cannes Film Festival for "The Doonesbury Special." Their story is about more than awards, though. This documentary, directed by Sybil DelGaudio, also covers John's involvement with the 1941 Disney strike, his blacklisting in the 1950's and Faith's struggle for recognition in a male-dominated field. A related article is on Page 11.

THE LEGEND OF LEIGH BOWERY -- Bowery, one of the central figures in Boy George's new musical, "Taboo," was a costume designer, a performance artist, a musician, a club kid and a gay icon. This documentary reflects on his life and on London in the 1980's. Interview subjects include Boy George, Damien Hirst and Michael Clark. Charles Atlas, who also did "Merce Cunningham: A Lifetime of Dance," directed.

MY FLESH AND BLOOD -- Mia Farrow has nothing on Susan Tom. Ms. Tom is a divorced California mother in her 50's who has taken in and is bringing up 11 "special needs" children.That isn't always easy, especially when one of the children, a mentally unstable teenage boy, is threatening to kill one of his siblings. Jonathan Karsh, the director, brought in the cameras during the worst year of their lives, but Ms. Tom wouldn't have had it any other way. It was "like a free year of therapy," she said.

VALLEY OF TEARS -- All these decades after Edward R. Murrow's "Harvest of Shame" comes another documentary about the plight of migrant farm workers. This one, focusing on a 1979 Mexican-American onion workers' strike in Texas, at least has a hopeful ending. Hart Perry directed.

HEADLINE: Shall We Dance? 

BYLINE:  By William Norwich

 BODY:
The best things in life may be free, but current economic indicators suggest that demand now exceeds supply. 
 Job losses continue, the gap between the rich and the poor widens, the poverty rate is up, and new books have titles like "The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke." Suffice it to say, we are not pushing caviar in this issue, nor, on the other hand, are we advocating hair shirts and crackers on Saturday nights. 
 After all, you have to dream to survive, just as Narciso Rodriguez Sr., the father of the fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, did when he left Cuba for the United States in the mid-1950's. If we can't dream, then God help us all. Fortunately, these days, there is reverie aplenty. Have you noticed, for example, how much dancing -- the choreography of dreams -- has returned to the cultural imagination?
No fewer than two major discos have opened in New York this fall, Deep and Avalon, which also has established a West Coast version in Hollywood. Hugh Jackman is hoofing it up on Broadway in "The Boy From Oz." The high-heeled Beyonce is doing the work of what seems to be four sets of hips gyrating as one, and just about everyone under the age of 30 worth her (and in some cases his) low-slung blue jeans has at the ready an imitation of her ecstatic swayings.
While clothes of the 20's and the 70's are inspiring the fashion crowd, we must also thank the iPod for getting people moving again. If I've seen it once, I've seen it a dozen times in recent weeks: a zillion songs are downloaded, a desktop speaker is attached and suddenly every space from cramped galley kitchen to stadium-size downtown loft becomes an instant disco, a rave.
Shall we dance? Yes! Figuratively, literally, politically, economically. Even if it is just in our dreams. When you consider the alternatives, why not? Might as well get up on the dance floor and "boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more."

HEADLINE: 'I Did It Frank's Way' 

BYLINE:  By Alex Witchel; Alex Witchel is a style reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
If it's not exactly "Call Me Ishmael," it's a classic all the same:
 "Summer 1968. The only man in America who was less interested than me in sleeping with Mia Farrow was her husband and my boss, Frank Sinatra." 
 So begins "Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra," by George Jacobs, Sinatra's valet from 1953 to 1968, and William Stadiem, a memoir devoted to deep dish on the life and times of the Chairman of the Board and those who loved him: Ava Gardner and her drinking; Marilyn Monroe and her personal hygiene, or lack thereof; Judy Garland and her desperate sexual advances -- not all of them spurned. Published by HarperEntertainment in June, the book is now in its sixth printing, and has gone from being one of this summer's guiltiest pleasures to one of this fall's. 
It was in 1968 that Jacobs, now 76, unwittingly made what turned out to be the worst decision of his life. On his way to meeting Gardner one night (at his boss's instruction), he stopped into the Candy Store, a Beverly Hills disco. Farrow came in soon after and asked him to dance. They did. But timing is everything, as they say. Though Sinatra and Farrow had been estranged for some time, their divorce was about to be finalized. When the gossip columnist Rona Barrett reported that Sinatra's much younger wife was doing the watusi with her husband's black valet, Jacobs found himself fired and, within 24 hours, shut out of the Sinatra homes in both Bel Air and Palm Springs, Calif.
After 15 years on the inside of paradise, Jacobs was banished with a wrath that was practically biblical, not to mention vintage Sinatra; the singer had similarly excised from his life Peter Lawford, Lauren Bacall and Hank Sanicola, his original manager. The only difference, Jacobs says, is that he never thought Sinatra would do it to him.
He still seems shocked. On a late summer afternoon in Palm Springs, when the desert was drenched by intermittent downpours and the temperature hovered near a soggy 108 degrees, Jacobs braved his painful sciatica and glaucoma to prepare a Sinatra-style lunch. "Everything I learned about cooking for him was from his mom and dad," Jacobs said, stirring the marinara sauce. Dressed in a white linen shirt that stayed remarkably clean, Jacobs moved slowly, clutching his back. He never used the glasses that hung on a black cord around his neck.
"I made this so many times I could make it in my sleep," he said. "His dad, Marty, was an even better cook than his mother." After tasting the Dolly Sinatra marinara sauce, you can take his word for it. The base of the sauce is three serving spoons full of olive oil, which produces heartburn, Hoboken style, almost instantaneously. Jacobs shrugged. "You can put some water in the tomato can, thin it out a little," he said, pouring himself a straight vodka. He ran a hand through his white hair. "My back is killing me, man," he said to no one in particular.
Stadiem, a writer based in Santa Monica, Calif., was introduced to Jacobs by a mutual friend, the lawyer Henry Bushkin, made famous by his former client Johnny Carson, who called him Bombastic Bushkin on the air.
"What the hell did I do with the cover?" Jacobs asked, searching the small kitchen for something to speed the pasta's cooking. The Chicken Vesuvius was ready, and Stadiem was starving, but Jacobs didn't like being rushed. "I want it al dente," he said, "but not too hard."
Jacobs was born in New Orleans and learned to cook from his mother. "She was half Jewish, half Creole,"' he said. "And my father had a Jewish grandfather. My mother cooked for rich families, and she taught me to cook. Then I was in the Navy and went to the Cooks and Bakers School in Bayonne, N.J."
Having given up on finding a cover, he stirred the pasta. "Since I cooked for Sinatra, it's been 35 years," he said, suddenly looking a little self-conscious. "Relax, sweetheart, look around." The walls of the apartment were covered with pictures of Sinatra and his parents, Dean Martin, Marilyn Monroe, the Rat Pack. And one very peculiar head shot near the dining room table: "To George, Wishing you the very best, Mia."
He keeps a picture of the woman who danced him into unemployment? He nodded. "I had no idea it was a sin what I did," he said, "but it became an embarrassment to Mr. S. that on the night of his divorce I was dancing with his ex-wife. Hell, she was like one of my children. I got shoes older than her."
Through her manager, Judy Hofflund, Farrow said: "I have only the best feelings about George Jacobs. He is a wonderful man. George was dismissed after Frank and I broke up, and his dismissal had nothing to do with me."
Stadiem agreed. "Frank flew into one of his rages, and that was it," he said. "It certainly wasn't her fault."
With the pasta finally cooked, Jacobs settled at the square dining-room table he had bought at Goodwill. It was neatly set, with a green salad, grated cheese and a bottle of Kraft Zesty Italian dressing. There was also a bowl of one of Sinatra's favorite dishes: canned spinach tossed with olive oil, topped with chopped raw onions. "He likes it cold like that," Jacobs said. As people tend to do with their better days behind them, he loses track of his tenses. "The oil helped his throat," he went on. "He liked thin steaks, thin sandwiches. He ate very small portions. An egg for breakfast, lightly turned over with soft bacon."
Sinatra proved to be as provincial an eater as he was picky. When he traveled to Italy, he shunned restaurant cuisine, eating only the Italian food from New Jersey that Jacobs cooked in the hotel suite. And in Paris, when Sinatra went to the famed La Tour d'Argent, he had a steak and a cup of tea. He preferred Campbell's Pork & Beans straight from the can; Jacobs stocked up at Fauchon.
"He liked good food, not fancy," Jacobs said in his defense. "I miss him so much, man, it's frightening. I think about him all the time." Although both of his guests ate Jacobs's food hungrily (canned spinach excepted), he didn't eat a bite. He was clearly in pain, both from his back and his memories, and it took a few hours of talking and drinking for him to grow calm again.
One topic that can still amuse him is his employer before Sinatra, the agent Irving (Swifty) Lazar. As Jacobs tells the story, Lazar was fond of caviar, if not its price tag, and he had no interest in cultivating Jacobs's taste for it. "Blacks can't digest caviar," Lazar told him. "It gives them gout." Jacobs, who could digest caviar just fine, got in the practice of carrying a spoon with him to Nate 'n Al, the Beverly Hills deli where Lazar bought his supply. "I would eat some, and when he asked what happened, I told him they must have done it at the store," Jacobs recalled, laughing.
Jacobs is a good storyteller, and a few times a month, he appears at Sinatra's original Palm Springs house on Alejo Road to talk to tour groups about his former life. (The house's owner has an arrangement with a local events company.)
"I say, 'Ask any questions you want,"' Jacobs said, though discretion does not always seem the better part of his valor. He could barely conceal his contempt for Frank Sinatra Jr., who, in a recent interview about Jacobs's book and its gossipy contents with the Palm Springs newspaper The Desert Sun, said, "I haven't seen him in 40 years," adding, "I hope it's another 40 years before I see him."
Jacobs snorted. "That kid had nothing to do with me, and I had nothing to do with him," he said. "He thinks he's a singer. He thought he could be his father, and he wasn't."
Referring to the separate living arrangements that Sinatra maintained with his ex-wife Nancy and their three children, Nancy Jr., Frank Jr. and Tina, Jacobs said: "You had to be in his house to know what was going on. I had nothing to do with any of them kids. They only called when they needed me to help serve dinner or do the dishes, anything they didn't want to do. And that Tina was so snappy. She must have been 14, and I was driving her to school, in my white jacket, dressed like a servant, and the police stopped me. She said real loud, 'Tell him who you work for, George.' After that I said, 'Mr. S., I don't want to pick Tina up anymore."'
In his book, Jacobs writes about Sinatra's penchant for pulling practical jokes: on tour in Israel, Jacobs woke up one morning to find his employer and the rest of his entourage gone, leaving him with no money or plane ticket home.
That's funny?
Jacobs shrugged. "It didn't bother me," he said. "He always pulled those kinds of jokes if he'd been drinking or something. I admired this man, I had a good job, and I was well paid. And after I was fired, you can't believe the people who turned on me."
It would be 10 years before Jacobs saw Sinatra again, at Don the Beachcomber, a Palm Springs restaurant. "It's hard to talk about it," he said, choking up. As he wrote: "I took one look at him and broke down into tears. I couldn't stop crying. Mr. S put his arm around me. 'Forget about it, kid,' he said. 'It isn't so bad."' Although Jacobs kept crying, Sinatra left.
"My heart hurt," Jacobs said now, wiping his eyes with a paper napkin. "It was such a shock, it tore me apart. You have to understand, I spent 24 hours a day with him. I washed his underwear by hand on the road, I carried everything to take care of him, and it ended in such a miserable way. The way it was supposed to be, I guess. That was his way." He shook his head. "I danced with Ava and Marilyn and Rosalind Russell, too. I always wore a suit and tie, I wasn't a bum off the street." His tone was still baffled.
Stadiem, who has heard some version of this story possibly 1,000 times, nodded with the automatic yet genuine sympathy of a veteran bartender. "Any other day, George," he said gently, "you could have danced with Mia, and it wouldn't have mattered. Any other day." That might not be true at all -- Sinatra never mentioned Jacobs in any interviews -- though hearing it said seemed to placate him. He nodded. "I lived over it. I'm still here. Two wives divorced me for all the time I spent with him. But that was my life." 
After Sinatra fired him, Jacobs worked for Steve McQueen, George Hamilton and Bill Cosby, though he never lived in with anyone again. "They all thought I had Sinatra's phone book, it drove me crazy," he said. "I took off to Europe, disappeared for about three years."
When he returned, he took a stab at show business, appearing on "The Dating Game" and singing on "The Gong Show." Eventually, he moved to Van Nuys, Calif., and became a carpenter. He married a third time (and was divorced a third time) and had two daughters, now teenagers, with whom he remains close. Of his six other children, one son died of a heart attack, a daughter was murdered, and another son committed suicide.
Sinatra died in 1998, and Jacobs said that Barbara Marx, the final Mrs. Sinatra, cut him from the funeral's guest list. Though the two didn't marry until 1976, Sinatra had known her for years. Jacobs remembered asking him what he saw in her. "Grace Kelly with my eyes closed," was his answer.
Jacobs takes solace in believing that Dolly Sinatra, who continued to see him in spite of her son's banishment, hated Sinatra's last wife as much as he does. "She would tell me, 'He was better off with you than her,"' Jacobs recalled. He said that Dolly disliked her daughter-in-law so much that in January 1977, she demanded that a separate plane take her to Sinatra's Caesars Palace concert in Las Vegas. It crashed on takeoff and killed her.
"All things considered, I got away clear," Jacobs said, draining his drink. "I enjoyed my stay. I had more fun on the game than I did off." His smile ran deep with satisfaction. "And they were the best years of his life, too." 

Chicken Vesuvius
Sinatra Style
13 1/2-pound chicken, cut into eighths
4 or 5 small red potatoes (about 3 ounces each)
1 small red bell pepper
1 small red onion
1 small white onion
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
Salt and pepper to taste
Minced fresh parsley for garnish.
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the chicken into a 13-by-9-inch baking dish. 
2. Quarter the potatoes. Seed the bell pepper and cut it into 8 pieces. Quarter the onions through the root ends. 
3. Add the vegetables to the chicken and sprinkle with pepper flakes, salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Smooth out the vegetables, and make sure the chicken pieces are skin side up. Bake until the chicken is browned and the skin is crisp, about 40 minutes. Poke holes in the chicken skin so the juices flow. Stir so the vegetables are glazed. Continue baking until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes longer. 
4. Arrange on a serving platter and spoon the juices on top. Sprinkle with parsley.
Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

Sinatra's Spinach
Sinatra loved this dish because it isn't fattening and he believed the olive oil was good for his voice.

1 (1-pound) can whole-leaf spinach
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup finely chopped red onion or other mild onion.
1. Drain the spinach and place in a serving dish. Drizzle with the oil and toss to coat. Sprinkle with the onion.
Yield: 4 servings.

Dolly Sinatra's
Marinara Sauce
This amount is for 1 pound of pasta.

1/2 cup olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes with puree
1 sprig fresh oregano, finely chopped
1 teaspoon dried basil, crumbled
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, crumbled
Salt and pepper to taste.
1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until the oil is fragrant and is seasoned, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, and puree. Heat to simmering, and cook on low heat until the sauce thickens, about 20 minutes.
2. Add the oregano, basil and Italian seasoning, and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Cook on low heat for another 15 minutes or so as it thickens.
Yield: 4 servings. 
Note: Jacobs served these dishes with a green salad topped with sliced tomatoes, a bottle of Kraft Zesty Italian dressing and sliced Italian bread.

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
Julia Jordan Beats the Odds, Then Beats Them Again

BYLINE:  By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
THE Knicks winning the N.B.A. title. Halley's comet shooting through the sky. An unknown female playwright receiving four New York productions in one year. Some things just don't happen very often, and when they do they can provoke a certain surprise.
 The playwright Julia Jordan understands this better than most. She knows that getting produced once, or even twice, means you have beaten the odds. And if it happens three or, as is the case with Ms. Jordan, four times, jealous peers will suspect you sold your soul to the Devil. 
 "Tatjana in Color," which opened last Thursday at the Culture Project in the East Village, is the third of Ms. Jordan's plays to open in five months. The first two were over the summer: "St. Scarlet," about a dysfunctional family, at the Ontological Theater at St. Marks Church and "The Summer of the Swans," an adaptation of a young-adult novel by Betsy Byars and Ms. Jordan's second Theaterworks/USA production. (She also wrote the book to the 2002 musical "Sarah, Plain and Tall.") In April, Ms. Jordan will make it a quartet when Primary Stages presents "Boy."
"I suppose that some playwrights must hate me," Ms. Jordan said recently, looking melancholy in the SoHo restaurant Lucky Strike, where she once worked as a manager to make ends meet. "It's weird. I feel a little guilty."
In a telephone interview, David Auburn, the author of the play "Proof" and a friend of Ms. Jordan's, said: "I think that's crazy. She's paid her dues like nobody's business."
Indeed, before she started getting her telephone calls returned by producers, Ms. Jordan, who is in her 30's ("that's all I'll say"), struggled through an awkward series of post-college careers. After graduating from Barnard, she worked as an actor ("didn't have the talent for it"), a painter ("mediocre") and a copywriter for CNN ("I was good . . . I hated it"). "I was unemployable except as a waitress or a manager," Ms. Jordan said. 
Eventually, she decided to take her mother's advice and become a writer. She wrote her first play to complete an application for the Juilliard playwriting program in 1995. The play is about two girls hanging out under a railroad bridge and flirting with an older man. It never made it to the stage but it did get her into school, and she returned to this romantic dynamic again.
At Juilliard, Ms. Jordan made invaluable connections. Christopher Durang and Marsha Norman were her teachers, and Ms. Jordan's precocious class included Stephen Belber ("Tape") and Mr. Auburn. All four playwrights have been influences, and they formed the beginnings of Ms. Jordan's vast artistic social circle.
"Julia is one of those people who knows everyone in the scene," Mr. Auburn said. "She is the connective tissue for many theater artists." While Ms. Jordan is far too self-conscious to be a name-dropper, she counts Jesse Peretz, a musician and film director, and the playwrights Stephen Adly Guirgis and Lucy Thurber among her good friends.
Once she graduated, Ms. Jordan was chosen for a yearlong residency at the Manhattan Theater Club and saw her second play, "Tatjana in Color," anthologized in "Women Playwrights: The Best Plays of 1997." Still, the offers to produce her plays did not roll in.
This was a difficult period for Ms. Jordan. She was often broke, and endured a three-year writer's block. "I doubted myself and thought I wasn't good enough to be a writer," she said.
No producer would touch "Tatjana in Color." The problem, Ms. Jordan assumed, was its sexual subject matter. Set in 1912, the play is loosely based on the real-life relationship between the Austrian Expressionist painter Egon Schiele and a 12-year-old named Tatjana. When her father discovered that his daughter had been the subject of nude portraits, Schiele was accused of statutory rape.
"There are a lot of stories about an artist who bends the rules sexually and artistically," Ms. Jordan said. "In this story, what caught my eye was that she testified, but not against him. That takes guts. Tatjana is not a victim. If she was, the play would have had a message and it probably would have had an easier time getting produced."
For her next play, Ms. Jordan set out to write something commercial. ("What's the point of writing shows if they don't get produced?" she asks.) This new work would have one set, a naturalistic living room and kitchen, and, she emphasized, "no naked girls." The result was "St. Scarlet," her breakout drama. 
Set in Minnesota, where Ms. Jordan was brought up, the play follows three quarreling sisters on an extraordinary snowbound day. In The New York Times, Bruce Weber wrote an encouraging review: "Ms. Jordan understands how much it takes to fill a stage with a play's worth of material, and that her 'wrighting' skills are ahead of her life experiences. She's a storyteller; wait'll she grows her own stories." 
While Ms. Jordan has shown an impressive ability to work in different genres, she has consistently returned to the same theme: the awakening sexuality of a young girl. 
Asked about this preoccupation of Ms. Jordan's, Mr. Belber replied in an e-mail message: "At the risk of sounding foolishly analytical, Julia's incredibly well suited to take on the tricky task of young girls exploring sexuality. She came to New York right out of high school with classic, Midwestern values hitched to the desire to push a couple envelopes and see where it all led."
The need to push envelopes began earlier. When she was 15, she scared her parents by pursuing a 25-year-old man. "I'd be out all night and my mom and dad wouldn't get much sleep," she said. "It was all very glamorous." Did she finally get him? "No comment."
In "Boy," however, Ms. Jordan departs for the first time from that subject matter. She described the new play as "about people trying to write happy endings to the stories they live and tell."
With positive reviews for "St. Scarlet" and "The Summer of the Swans," Ms. Jordan has started thinking about her future. Asked whose theatrical career she would most like to have, she laughed and said, "Tennessee Williams without the alcoholism."

HEADLINE: HOLIDAY MOVIES; 
A Mom-and-Pop Shop for Animation That Married Art and Life

BYLINE:  By STUART KLAWANS; Stuart Klawans is the film critic for The Nation.

 BODY:
LIKE elves puttering in a cottage in some latter-day fairy tale, John and Faith Hubley made films by hand, then carted their wares to market -- and won Oscars for them. 
 Seven times, from 1960 through 1978, animated films by the Hubleys received Academy Award nominations. Three times the Hubleys won, gaining fame as the first successful mom-and-pop operation in an otherwise industrial field. 
 As John knew from his years at the Walt Disney studio, many hours of assembly-line labor are normally required to create a few seconds of animated magic. The Hubleys' films were labor-intensive, too, but the work was never regimented. 
Sybil DelGaudio's admiring, hourlong documentary "Independent Spirits: Faith Hubley/John Hubley" reminds us of how abnormal those methods were. And four short films by the Hubleys that are being screened with the documentary provide an introduction to their inimitable artisanal messiness -- which looks as startlingly free today, in our era of computer-generated imagery, as it did back when "Lady and the Tramp" was the norm. This small Hubley sampler, opening on Nov. 28, also helps to suggest why their blots and smears of color, their pulsing lines and infinitely pliable shapes, were precisely right for the subjects at hand.
Their very first joint production, "Adventures of an *" (1957), celebrates their own escape from regimentation, embodying the postwar decade's worst fears about itself in the figure of an office worker who spends his days pulling papers from an overflowing file cabinet and stamping them robotically. To some viewers, this satire of social conformity may seem to choose an easy target -- but the Hubleys had earned the right to aim at it.
John Hubley, a draftsman of wizardlike facility, had lost his job at the Walt Disney studio in the bitter strike of 1941. Following his wartime service, he got back into the animation business by helping to found United Productions of America (UPA), a distinctly non-Disney outfit where the boldly simplified drawings were all loops and the content all crotchety angles. UPA got off to a strong start -- especially with the figure of Mr. Magoo, whom Hubley helped to develop -- but soon ran into trouble from the House Committee on Un-American Activities. When it was Hubley's turn to testify, he refused to name names; and so, like many other filmmakers of the period, he became independent by becoming unemployable, with the assistance of the committee.
Faith Elliott Hubley needed no such help. A child of Hell's Kitchen who had dropped out of high school, she learned about life on the streets, at the New York Public Library and in the galleries of the Museum of Modern Art. Her love of movies eventually took her to Los Angeles, where she found work at Columbia and Republic and was trained as an editor, over the initial objections of their all-male staffs.
Los Angeles gave Faith not only a trade but also a lifelong companion. She met John Hubley on Hollywood Boulevard, toward the end of World War II. With an artist's eye for the characteristic feature and a rebel's robust self-esteem, she recalled seeing his face as one big toothy smile, while thinking, "Hey, somebody who looks like me." The friendship was immediate; the decision to marry took 10 years. Why the delay? Perhaps a part of the answer may be found in the Hubleys' 1958 film "The Tender Game," with its portrait of two shy and gawky people courting in a park.
With the arrival of their children, the Hubleys got another topic for film and eventually their first Academy Award as well. They recorded the kids talking, then used the ramblings as a soundtrack for their illustrations -- in the 1959 "Moonbird" (their original Oscar winner) and subsequently in "Windy Day" (1968) and "Cockaboody" (1974). People from outside the family were also welcome to contribute an improvised soundtrack, provided they were vivid enough, like Dizzy Gillespie. The Hubleys worked with Gillespie several times, using him both for his music and for his multidirectional talk -- the best of which may be heard in the Oscar-winning "The Hole" (1962), a two-character film about construction workers pondering the likelihood of nuclear war.
Militarism, feminism, overpopulation, urban blight: these were just a few of the topics that the Hubleys made fanciful, entertaining and eye-catching. "They could take on anything as subject matter," notes the film historian John Canemaker in "Independent Spirits." "They seemed to be limitless in terms of their daring." Given the back-and-forth nature of their partnership, it's not surprising that the Hubleys conceived many of these films as dialogues. You're always listening in on a conversation -- between Father Time and Mother Earth, Life and Death, little Emily Hubley and Georgia Hubley and, ultimately, between John and Faith themselves.
That last, long-running conversation came to an end with John's death in 1977. From then until her own death in 2001, Faith made films on her own, in a style that combined her old Museum of Modern Art favorites, Paul Klee and Joan Miro, with influences from tribal traditions throughout the world. If her solo films lacked some of the fluidity of her pictures with John, as well as the saving whimsy, they fulfilled her ambition of working simply and solely as an artist. The reason she disliked the term "animation," she said, was that it referred not to the film itself but to a craft that went into its making. During her last decades she consistently looked beyond that craft to draw and paint films about whatever was important to her.
This conviction, that a tool is just a tool, may be an especially valuable legacy of the Hubleys, now that so many people are dazzled by the possibilities of computer animation. Digital tools can be used to produce the immaculately rendered, highly modeled images that audiences now associate with animation. (Some of the results, as in "Finding Nemo," are very good, and others not so terrific.) But the computer is also useful for other, more artisanal-looking work -- the blobby yellow "Simpsons," for example, or the paper-doll figures of "South Park."
Maybe these later cartoons lack the painterly sophistication of "Tender Game" or "The Hole" -- but they are animated, in the true sense, by something like the Hubleys' cheerfully renegade spirit.

HEADLINE: PRELUDES; 
Reality Television Vs. Real Careers

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IT'S a shame that reality television as we know it didn't exist when I was getting my start as a journalist in the early 1990's.
 I might have sent a tape of myself to a show like "Extreme Makeover," "Jackass" or "Road Rules," or maybe even allowed a Webcamto follow me around in my apartment while I vacuumed or put on my makeup. 
 Granted, many competitors on these shows seem to view themselves as just one break away from megastardom. But a few young people are using reality television and advertising to prod their careers along in this sluggish economy. 
 Cary Williams-Nunez, 29, the owner of Prime Time Boxing, a fitness gym in Sacramento, says business has been up by about 40 percent since she appeared as a contestant on "Fear Factor" this year. Never mind that she had to devour a bull's snout, spinal cord and spleen on national television as part of the competition. The attention she received made it worthwhile. 
 "My whole purpose was to get publicity to promote the business," Ms. Williams-Nunez said, adding that she didn't train at all for her culinary experience. "As soon as I knew it would air, I was in all the local media and I got inundated with calls." She has done so well that she is releasing a boxing DVD; she has even hired a publicist. 
 Some reality shows appear to be trying to capitalize on the difficult economy and job market. Consider, for example, "The Million Dollar Idea," now in its second season on KSTC, an independent television station in Minneapolis. The premise is this: Inventors, mostly in their late 20's and early 30's, compete for $50,000 worth of advertising, marketing and design services (in addition to the invaluable television exposure). Viewers choose the winner.
 "In a time of downsizing, people are becoming very entrepreneurial," said Todd Walker, who created the show with his best friend from high school, Jean Golden. "We wondered: What form could we give them to present their product to the marketplace, and to offer them a prize package that would then allow them to turn their dream into a reality?" 
 Then there is "The Apprentice," scheduled to be broadcast next year on NBC. The show was created by Mark Burnett, who also invented "Survivor." But instead of competing in the wilds of the Amazon, contestants struggle in the business jungle. The grand prize is a one-year position as a president or co-president of a division of the Trump Organization. Donald Trump, the company's president and chairman, is the host of the show. 
 Not everyone who auditioned for it had visions of owning skyscrapers and hotels. "My primary motivation was the thought that if I were to make it to the show, it would benefit me in terms of name recognition," said Eric P. Strauss, 31, a founder of City Date Connection, a dating service in Minneapolis, who made it to the second round of tryouts. "Reality TV is really changing how people are able to promote themselves and their businesses."
 Roz Dunn, a real estate broker and bartender in Manhattan, said she feels the same way. Ms. Dunn, 24, competed in the Miss Rheingold contest sponsored by the Rheingold Brewing Company. Nearly 300 women applied for the chance to win $10,000 and have their picture plastered on billboards. Ms. Dunn said she used the contest "as a trampoline to get to the next level." She said she eventually wants to run her own music club.
 ANTHONY MORA, a Los Angeles publicist and author of "Spin to Win" (Hawk Publishing), is a bit more pessimistic about the effects of reality TV in general on careers. The chances of being discovered through the shows, he says, are slim.
 "The chances are much greater that they'll be humiliated" by a show's outlandish requirements, said Mr. Mora, whose clients include Ms. Williams-Nunez. She was unique, he said, because she wanted only to promote her business. In most cases, he added, "Putting the camera on you and turning it on isn't going to change your life." 
 He may be right, but that won't stop people from trying. I am thinking about creating and, of course, competing in a show for writers, called "The Scoop." Eight fledgling reporters will vie to unearth a big story, then report it on live television. The winner gets a chance to write an article about himself or herself in a national magazine. 
 If that doesn't push my career into high gear, nothing will.

HEADLINE: Executive Life; 
Fear of Technology, Quietly Conquered

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER S. STEWART

 BODY:
THEY meet in crowded bookstores or public libraries, where anonymity is guaranteed. For sessions at work, they settle in behind closed doors, typically early in the morning or after hours.
 Yes, when an executive finally learns how to work a computer, secrecy can be crucial. 
 Over the years, many of these executives managed to put off computer training. But they have reconsidered as computers have become an unavoidable part of the business world. Rather than face derision from colleagues -- or worse, appear obsolete -- some are seeking out teachers and coaches who can educate them on the sly. 
 "It's a lot like those people who were illiterate in the work force years ago and talked very secretly about learning to read," said John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm. "In the past, it was a point of pride to say you didn't buy into technology. But now it's our life, and the late adopters really feel guilty about it."
 One trainer of executives, Jennifer Shaheen, says that many of them ask her to tutor them clandestinely. "I call myself a 'tech therapist' because so many business people want to be taught in confidence," said Ms. Shaheen, who charges $300 a session, which generally last an hour. "What I do is a lot like therapy -- the getting over the fear of technology and being embarrassed."
 More than half of Ms. Shaheen's 20 executive-level clients (she will not offer many names) request some degree of confidentiality. She describes the training sessions -- covering fundamentals like setting up a computer and sending e-mail messages, as well as more advanced software issues like putting together a PowerPoint presentation -- as resembling some sort of cloak-and-dagger enterprise. Usually she contacts her clients by cellphone or on private lines and meets them before work or at night or at their homes over the weekends.
 One executive at a national transportation company asked her to work with him at a Barnes & Noble bookstore in New Jersey until they decided there were too many people around and moved to a private room at a nearby public library. "He showed up with a laptop that he'd just gotten and said, 'What do I do?"' Ms. Shaheen recalled. Another man, who "didn't know what the right mouse button did," instructed her that if anyone asked about her visits to help him, she should say she was "just a consultant for the company."
 While statistics are hard to come by for how many executives are untrained in using computers, Andrew Sherwood, chairman and chief executive of Goodrich & Sherwood, an outplacement firm in New York City, said he thought the number was substantial.
 "You'd be surprised how many don't knowanything," said Mr. Sherwood, who estimated that more than 75 percent of his clients lacked basic computer skills. "A lot of these executives work 16-plus hours a day and they've never had time to get into computers or had very skilled administrators working for them. They tend to fudge their computer skills, and just smile." 
 Among those caught in the learning gap are executives who previously had two or more assistants managing all their computer work, from sending and receiving e-mail messages to typing proposals and correspondence. As companies started cutting the size of their work forces in a sluggish economy, some executives were left stranded without such help. 
 Ann Rose, the president of Montville Carpet and Flooring in Montville, N.J., said that until a few months ago, she had relied on others to do her computer work. But she decided that she was in danger of becoming outdated and chose private tutoring at the Career Center, a career and management firm in Manhattan that specializes in technology-related work. "I didn't want anyone to know at first," said Ms. Rose, who is 54. "The fact that I missed the boat on computers, it's embarrassing. Particularly when the young ones come in and know everything. It's a way of life with them."
 The difficult job market has made more executives aware of their tech shortcomings. But a fear of being discovered, and stigmatized, is driving many executives underground for help, said Debbie Ringler, a founder and vice president of the Career Center. "Many of them are scared of being exposed," she said. "Some of their staff is leaving, and they don't have the skills to pick up the slack. Or they're looking for a new job and don't have the most fundamental computer skills to make the leap."
 MS. RINGLER recalled one executive who was sent to her by his company to learn a specific program. In fact, the executive knew nothing about computers, so instead of studying the program, he used the time to learn skills like word processing, spreadsheets and navigating the Internet. He made her promise not to give up their secret, she said.
 Dan Kenyon, corporate sales manager at ExecuTrain, an international training firm, said it did very little teaching that was truly secretive.
 Still, he said, "most of the executives that come in prefer privacy." Mr. Kenyon's company has tutored about 100 executives in the New York metropolitan area this year, a slight increase from previous years. "It's not a surprise," he said of the abundance of executives who need to be taught the basics. "It's more of a giggle."
 Some relatively self-reliant -- and guarded -- executives are turning to tutoring programs that run on a computer. One is the Video Professor, a suite of computer CD's that allow users to learn everything from Windows to Lotus 1-2-3 to PhotoShop at their own desks, by themselves.
 Still, secrecy can be hard to maintain. Michael Gallin, vice president of one of the oldest building contractors in New York, John Gallin & Sons, brought Ms. Shaheen to the office for secret instruction on using e-mail and mobile technology, like a personal digital assistant.
 "We started out with her as a regular visitor," said Mr. Gallin, who is 46. "She didn't make any noise."
 But eventually, he said, "people started to ask questions and the cat was out of the bag."
 "So I told them, 'She's here teaching me the computer and she's great,"' he added. "'You should all try her out."'

HEADLINE: New Malaysian Leader's Style Stirs Optimism 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
The new prime minister of Malaysia, Abdullah Badawi, a consummate diplomat abroad and well connected to the Islamic community at home, cuts an entirely different image from his volatile predecessor, Mahathir Mohamad. Mr. Abdullah is popularly known here as "Mr. Nice Guy," an endearment that could hardly be conferred on Dr. Mahathir. 
 But the new leader's basic policies are likely to provide a continuum for a prosperous nation that survived the Asian economic crisis better than most and is headed for nearly 5 percent growth this year, analysts said. 
 Mr. Abdullah, 63, comes from a patrician family on Penang, the island that is the base for the technology firms, including Dell and Intel, that provided the exports for Malaysia's economic success in the 1990's. One of his main challenges will be how to keep Malaysia competitive as China becomes the fulcrum for low-cost manufacturing in the region, and India becomes a base for cheap back-office services.
A former foreign minister and defense minister, Mr. Abdullah wasted no time in sizing up the competition from China. In preparation for taking power, and in recognition of the fact that China has become Malaysia's fastest growing trading partner, he visited Beijing several months ago. 
At the same time, he is well regarded by American officials, who say he is unlikely to repeat the anti-Western and anti-Semitic remarks of Dr. Mahathir.
"The different style of leadership provides a firm foundation for turning a new page in U.S.-Malaysia relations," said Ernest Z. Bower, the president of the U.S.-Asean Business Council, a group of major American companies with investments in Southeast Asia. "There are clear signals from both the administration in Washington and the American private sector on the value of not prejudicing America's future relations with Malaysia and the new prime minister based on the past." 
One of Mr. Abdullah's strengths appears to be the way he combines the traditional values of Islam with a modern outlook. His father and grandfather were religious leaders, and Mr. Abdullah graduated from the University of Malaya with a degree in Islamic studies. 
"The religious leaders had a loathing for Mahathir -- he was too secular for them," said Karim Raslan, a Malaysian writer and lawyer. "But they can't write Badawi off." 
For that reason, leaders of the governing party, the United Malays National Organization, believe that Mr. Abdullah will be able to retrieve some of the ground the party lost in the last election in 1999 to the conservative Islamic party known as PAS. 
Some of the swing away from the governing party was attributed to Dr. Mahathir's prosecution and jailing of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, and to allegations of cronyism within the party. Mr. Abdullah has made clear his distaste for some of the mega-infrastructure projects of the Mahathir era, including the extravagant new political capital, Purajaya. His reputation for clean government and his interest in rural development could help bring back some voters who fled to the Islamic party, the analysts said. 
But Mr. Abdullah will not be making crass appeals to the conservative Islamic forces, they said. His wife, Endon Mahmood, projects herself as a modern Muslim woman who appears in public without covering her head. Ms. Endon started a campaign, "Sisters in Islam," that encourages monogamy as an ideal for religious Muslims. 
On his first day in office, the new prime minister ignored the ultra-modern capital here and traveled to his home village, Kepala Batas, to see his mother and to break the Ramadan fast with his family. Festive signs along the homecoming route greeted him as Pak Lah, an affectionate diminutive of Abdullah, meaning "Uncle Lah," a far cry from the correct titles given to his predecessor.

HEADLINE: Ex-Guatemalan Rebel Tries Her Hand at Democracy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ

DATELINE: ESCUINTLA, Guatemala 

 BODY:
Makrina Gudiel gave up her identity to survive. 
 As a teenager who accepted neither a woman's place in this macho society nor Guatemala's military government, she grabbed a rifle, embraced the nom de guerre Ana and joined the guerrillas. 
 Worn down by combat, she spent five years in exile in the United States, protected by the so-called sanctuary movement organized by Americans protesting United States policy in Central America during the civil wars of the 1980's. 
But she is hiding no more. Now she is a congressional candidate of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity in elections being held on Nov. 9. The rebels founded the party after peace accords in 1996 ended the country's 36-year civil war. 
Ms. Gudiel welcomes campaigning openly in a land no longer at war. But it is far from peace: poverty is rampant, society is polarized and men with guns linger at the fringes of her campaign stops. Like a flashback, even Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who presided over the counterinsurgency when Ms. Gudiel was with the rebels, is running for president. 
"The conditions that brought us to war are still present," she said. "Those who massacred us are still there. Friends and family tell me to be careful. Don't say much. Guard your life." 
She was born 40 years ago in a society that was highly protective of women. But despite her father's teachings that spouses were equal and indigenous people deserved respect, local life showed otherwise. Men staggered home drunk and beat their wives, and Mayan girls in their long woven skirts were shunned in public. By her teenage years, she knew something had to change.
"I did not like the life that women had," she said. "It was grow up, get married and have children. I wanted more."
Not long after her brother, Jose Miguel, announced that he was joining the rebels in the mountains, she followed, spending a year with the guerrillas and taking part in raids. The time with the guerrillas was not easy, she said, and it rattled her nerves so badly that she was sent into exile with another rebel who would father their three children. 
Contacts in Mexico put her in touch with the sanctuary movement in Arizona, which smuggled her into the United States. Still calling herself Ana and hiding behind a kerchief, she and her family wound up living in the tower of Riverside Church in Manhattan, one floor below the huge bells. 
The sanctuary movement had established itself among liberal religious groups opposed to the American government's aid to Central American armies that committed numerous human rights abuses while combating leftist rebels. The American government said the asylum seekers were economic refugees, at best.
For the next year or so, Ms. Gudiel and her companion, who had taken the name Federico, gave talks about the war and helped arrange for others to come to the United States to give testimony at the United Nations. While her audiences were sympathetic to her stories of military oppression, she did not touch on her own time fighting in the mountains. 
"My North American brothers did not look well on the decision the people of Guatemala took in rising up when there was no rule of law," she said. "For North Americans, a guerrilla war is incomprehensible unless they have lived through it." 
Such an admission might have complicated the often romantic view held by some people that Ms. Gudiel and her family were innocents caught between armies. 
"They simply didn't tell us very much and we didn't want to know," said Mary Ann Lundy, who helped her. "We were much more concerned about people not being sent back. I don't apologize for not knowing." 
Ms. Gudiel's time in the United States -- about five years until 1989 when she returned to refugee camps in Mexico rather than flee farther north to Canada -- changed her. 
"To get to the United States was to breathe, to havehope," she said. "There I learned the responsibilities of civilians, that it was not enough to just go vote every four years. I learned you have rights, to study, to have a roof. To feel protected. I also learned to value what I had in Guatemala." 
Those lessons filter through her campaign. She is considered to have a shot at winning. She talks about how people have a right to know government budgets and a say in how the money is spent. When she talks about health care or school, it is not an abstraction: she is now a single mother raising three boys while keeping up a breakneck pace dashing to campaign stops in a pickup truck. 
At campaign rallies, grandmothers and teenage girls alike surround her. "She shows us we can get ahead," said Alejandra Ramirez, 56. "The government had for so long only used the hard hand against the people, so people got used to the harshness of guns and the military. Now it is changing a bit. Now women can protest this situation." 
Just not too much. Campaign consultants to Ms. Gudiel have suggested that she not speak about the war. 
"People in Guatemala do not believe in political parties, they only see people," she said. "And people do not want to hear anything about the war. I do not reject my past, but for the electoral struggle we do not need to mention it." 
The signs of her past were evident as she rode in a campaign caravan. Another candidate wore a bulletproof vest. On the street, wiry men with steely gazes, some with missing fingers, nodded at her like the former comrades in arms they once were. 
She would do it again, she said, even the hardship, the exile, the loss of friends and family.
"I could have been like a Guatemalan, get educated and do nothing," she said. "It is easy to ignore reality when you are ignorant. But when you know, then you have a commitment."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
For Homeless, the Gift of Hope

BYLINE:  By ARTHUR BOVINO

 BODY:
Gloria Hernandez tries to be strong for her five children, but strength, like privacy or full stomachs, does not come easily when you and your family live in a shelter for the homeless. 
 "The children say, 'Mommy, when are we going to get out of here?' " Ms. Hernandez, 40, said softly, her eyes downcast. "You see it in their faces: they don't speak, but they show it. They say it's your fault." 
 For 10 years, Ms. Hernandez and her children lived in the same apartment in Corona, Queens. But what appeared stable was anything but. Ms. Hernandez said a new landlord wanted the apartment for himself. There were other units, she said, but her landlord said her family had "too many people." 
After more than two years of legal wrangling, Ms. Hernandez agreed last November to leave if her landlord gave her until the end of April to find a home.
"Every time I called to ask about apartments the answer was always 'No, no, no,' " said Ms. Hernandez. " 'We don't want no children. We don't want no programs from the city.' " 
So Ms. Hernandez and her family became a few more among New York City's more than 38,000 homeless. She learned about the crowding and unpleasantness of shelter life, along with the hardships of a hand-to-mouth existence.
But unlike so many others on the streets, she was fortunate to learn about something else: the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
The fund, whose annual campaign starts today and runs through Jan. 31, has been aiding and comforting New Yorkers in distress since 1912. The homeless, the gravely ill and the down and out: these are the people who have been aided by the fund, and by the seven New York charities it supports. 
For Ms. Hernandez, the fund gave her and her family a bit of needed stability, and hope.
Ms. Hernandez, a widow for 11 years, used to clean homes but lost her job when her employers moved. Now she stretches $231 in public assistance every two weeks and $350 in food stamps each month to raise her family. Without money to store their belongings, Ms. Hernandez faced losing everything. A friend suggested she call Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, one of the fund's seven beneficiary agencies. There, her caseworker, Patricia Cadavid, secured $462 from the fund so the family could store their living room furniture and irreplaceable albums of baby pictures.
Ms. Hernandez and her children stayed with friends until it became too crowded in July, then went to the city's Emergency Assistance Unit in the Bronx. They spent four days at a Bronx shelter, in a small room that her youngest child, 9-year-old Jeffrey, still recalls. "The hotel was dirty and it had flies all over," he said. "There are nice places and bad places. The place we went to that night had big old rats."
Eventually, they were placed in a room at a shelter in an industrial part of the East New York section of Brooklyn. But the family is together, the children are in school. And in five months, they hope to be in a new apartment.
The small amount of money from the fund, along with the continuing support of Catholic Charities, gave them what many homeless people do not have: breathing room to sort out options and try to get back on their feet.
Today, more and more people are without that breathing room. According to the city's Department of Homeless Services, homelessness has climbed to record levels in New York this year. The peak was in May, when 38,660 people were homeless. On Thursday, 38,357 homeless men, women and children were sleeping in the shelter system. The Coalition for the Homeless, a court-appointed monitor of the city's shelters, said that figure was almost double the number five years ago. 
Many of the people behind those statistics have fallen victim to the same things: unemployment, an overloaded shelter system and a lack of affordable housing. "We have these two New Yorks," said Dr. John Ruskay, executive vice president and chief executive of the UJA-Federation of New York, another beneficiary of the fund. "One which is reasonably O.K., even in bad times, and looking forward to renewed prosperity. And we have another group of elderly and immigrants and large families who increasingly find themselves on the cusp of not being able to make it."
Though some people believe the economy shows signs of renewal, the homeless are not feeling a rush of optimism just yet. According to the coalition, the number of homeless single adults has increased by 33 percent since 1994, to 8,100 per night from 6,100.
The recent increase in overall numbers of sheltered homeless -- 38,463 in January 2002, up from 31,064 a year earlier, was the largest one-year increase since the Depression, the coalition said. And, earlier this year, Homeless Services counted another 1,780 people sleeping in streets and subway stations.
But if the situation appears dire to many, some have found help and hope through the fund. 
The fund serves people in all manner of distress. And, over the years, it has helped pay for all manner of needs -- from food and rent to furniture and health care. Last year, it raised over $8.8 million in donations, the second-highest amount in its nine-decade history.
Among the recipients -- those facing grave illness, sudden calamity, unanticipated loss -- the homeless occupy a special place, for it was a story of homelessness that inspired the fund's creation.
It happened on Christmas Day in 1911, when Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times, chanced upon a shabbily dressed beggar. The experience inspired Mr. Ochs to use his newspaper to help the poor.
He decided to publish their stories, hoping readers would feel compassion for fellow New Yorkers. 
In 1912, the fund's first year, there were 117 contributions, totaling $3,630.88. In its 92 years, it has raised over $136 million. This is in addition to the $62 million raised by a related fund for those affected by the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack. The Times pays the fund's expenses, so all contributions go directly to the charities, which use them to provide services and cash assistance.
This year, the campaign has special significance as the fund has passed a milestone: Total donations since its inception have exceeded $200 million. Helping to open the campaign is an event tomorrow called Children at Risk: Protecting New York City's Youths, 1653-2003, at the New-York Historical Society.
Mr. Ochs's great-grandson, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the current publisher of The Times, said that even as the newspaper has reached out to a broader national audience, the fund has remained important.
"We still have the 'New York' in our name," he said. "It speaks to the constancy of purpose -- we're in here for the long haul. This has been a part of us for a very long time. There are some things that you stay with year after year because they just work. And my goodness, does this work."
While the fund's mission has remained constant, the problems it has addressed have not.
Unemployment is way up, with 240,000 jobs lost in the city in the last three years alone, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group. Some 1.4 million New Yorkers are living below the federal poverty level.
And a recent study by the United Way shows another disturbing trend. Families with children are the largest and fastest-growing segment of the homeless. As of January 2002, 42 percent of people in shelters were children. According to the Coalition for the Homeless, the average length of time families spend in the shelter system is now 11 months, more than double the 1990 average.
Linda Gibbs, commissioner of homeless services, says that in the battle against homelessness, "It's not ultimately going to be about building more shelters. Our focus has to be much more on engaging communities in preventing people from becoming homeless."
A 110 percent increase in rental assistance resources has begun to help relocate homeless families, but Ms. Gibbs said that demand has continued to rise. She said there are two fundamental needs that need to be addressed. The first, she said, is "Whether there are resources for people to stay in housing if a family is in danger. And the second is, do we know who they are and where they are and how to help them before they become homeless."
With national welfare reform, public assistance caseloads have dropped sharply in New York. But people continue to live on the brink.
"In a good economy you can assume they got jobs," said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, senior vice president and chief executive for agency services of the United Way in New York. "Things happen, you get ill, you have to go into the hospital and that wipes you out."
Aside from unemployment, there is also a shortage of new and affordable housing. According to the United Way, occupancy at the city's public housing developments exceeded 99 percent last year.
And then there are those who are on the brink of joining the city's homeless, as Latwanda Manson was last spring. Without the help she received from the fund, she said, she might have been in a shelter.
Ms. Manson, 34, a secretary for the State Health Department, lives in the same apartment building in the Bronx with her two children, Timara Manson, 13, and Taia Bell, 5, that she grew up in. 
Like Ms. Hernandez, Ms. Manson said she ran into trouble after a change of landlords. In February 2002, the new landlord began renovating the building. The family was relocated for four months. When they returned, they were told they were going to have to start paying for electricity. A few months later, Ms. Manson got the first bill: $649.
She juggled resources until she could not stretch her pay, $760 every two weeks, any further. Ms. Manson's salary is $30,000 a year, of which almost $7,000 goes to her $581.56 monthly rent. 
"You borrow from Peter to pay Paul and you hope you can pay Peter back," she said. 
In November, she was behind on her bills. In January, the landlord told her to pay the balance of over two months' rent or leave. The case was tied up in court for two months.
"The judge, the social workers try to give you resources, but when you go to those, the resources are at its limit," she said. "Many days I would come out of that courthouse with tears. I didn't want to go into the system or lose my home or lose the stability for my kids. I was scared." 
Ms. Manson was denied public assistance in February, but was given until June to pay the back rent. In May, she could not pay for Taia's child care and needed Timara to pick her up from school. Timara attends an after-school pregnancy prevention program at Intermediate School 90, run by the Children's Aid Society, another beneficiary of the fund. The staff members noticed that Timara was acting out and leaving early. Simone Oliver, a caseworker, called Ms. Manson to see if everything was O.K.
"When I first met Ms. Manson, her heart was heavy," said Ms. Oliver. "When I told her that I was going to be able to help her, she was a little skeptical." 
A week later, Ms. Oliver secured $1,297.34 from the fund for the rent, and the family averted disaster. 
"The hardest thing now is to keep food in the house," said Ms. Manson. "Because you don't want to fall behind on the rent." 
The fund was also there for Mary Strong, 55, a mother of three. She became homeless in October 2002 when her landlord had to sell the building she lived in in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
Ms. Strong stayed with friends and relatives for a month. A cousin took her daughters, Christen, 20, and Avis, 14, but there was not enough room for her.
"My son took me to the shelter. He has his own family so I couldn't stay with him," she said. "I was going through a lot; I was depressed and I ended up in the hospital." 
From 1978 to 1993, Ms. Strong had worked as an administrative assistant at the Legal Aid Society, where she made $34,000 a year. She liked her job and the salary was good. But she was laid off when the office was modernized with computers.
"Even though I was there for a long time, I was at the bottom of the list," she said. She looked for a comparable job and worked for temporary-work agencies. But there are unfortunate truths about temping: "The only thing about that is they don't last long." 
So she took whatever work she could find, cleaning houses and working as a bus matron for public schools in the Bronx. By the time she lost her home, things seemed hopeless, she said.
Now at the Transitional Living Community, a program run by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service at the Brooklyn Women's Shelter in East New York, Ms. Strong has a cot in a room with nine other women. She gets counseling at least once a week, one of the services provided by the bureau, another fund beneficiary. Ms. Strong receives $22.50 from public assistance every two weeks. It is barely enough to cover car fare to visit Avis; Christen, who works at Toys "R" Us to put herself through Berkeley College; or Ms. Strong's son, Willis Killebrew, 32.
Maritza Santos, Ms. Strong's caseworker, secured $800 from the fund, which Ms. Strong used to buy warm winter clothes for her and her daughters. Ms. Santos has also helped Ms. Strong apply for a housing subsidy and is helping to find her a permanent place to live.
In the meantime, Ms. Strong continues counseling and enjoys working in the shelter's garden, tending vegetables and flowers. She looks forward to more planting in the spring, though she would be happier to leave the shelter before then.
Though Ms. Strong's future remains uncertain, she, like Ms. Hernandez and Ms. Manson, is grateful for the boost -- financial and emotional -- that the fund provided. They, like so many past recipients, appreciate the compassion of those who are more fortunate, and fear where they might now be without it.
"Every day there are more people coming," Ms. Hernandez said of the Emergency Assistance Unit. "And it's a big place and it's a lot of people and they start fighting. I'm just hoping to have a place to stay, to be normal."

HEADLINE: AROUND THE MAJORS; 
Showalter Only Looks As Free Agency Nears

BYLINE:  By Jack Curry

 BODY:
Texas Manager Buck Showalter flipped through a list of free agents while sitting at his desk last week, reviewing dozens of players and circling those he thought the Rangers should try to sign. Reluctantly, but not surprisingly, Showalter breezed by the marquee players because their potential price tags would make them difficult fits for a team slashing its payroll.
 "I'm probably not highlighting the ones fans would be interested in," Showalter said. 
 So Showalter did not mark outfielders Vladimir Guerrero and Gary Sheffield or shortstop Miguel Tejada; he moved past the starting pitchers Bartolo Colon, Kevin Millwood and Andy Pettitte, who has not officially filed for free agency; and he avoided scribbling the names of relievers Ugueth Urbina, Keith Foulke and LaTroy Hawkins. 
They are all superb choices and Showalter would love to have several of them in a Rangers uniform next season.
But like numerous teams that have seen the Anaheim Angels and the Florida Marlins win the last two World Series championships on modest payrolls, the Rangers are thinking austerity and are trying to devise a winning plan thatis, most importantly, economically feasible.
The Rangers are listening to offers for Alex Rodriguez, who still has $179 million left on his $252 million contract, and the Boston Red Sox put Manny Ramirez on irrevocable waivers Wednesday in hopes that some team would claim him and the $104 million remaining on his $160 million deal.
Obviously, those teams feel constrained by the contracts and would rather have the surplus of $20 million a year to add several critical pieces, not lavish it on one player.
"I think the very long-term contracts have proven to be very, very risky and we'd be concerned about very long contracts," said Fred Wilpon, the Mets' owner, essentially telling fans not to expect Guerrero in right field at Shea Stadium next season.
When the free-agent auction starts in nine days, most teams, one baseball executive said, will not be as eager to "be the first to strike" on players anymore and will want to be "cautious and not outbid themselves." Mets General Manager Jim Duquette said he expected the process to be slow-moving while teams judged how the market was developing and what they could afford.
Still, Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, said everything he had seen, heard and read convinced him that there would be "a flurry of activity on the great players." Beane said he would be only an onlooker, because his goal is to try to retain Tejada and Foulke; realistically, he thinks the A's will end up with only one of them.
The Yankees will probably pursue Guerrero or Sheffield, the Red Sox may chase Colon or Millwood, and the Dodgers, the Braves and the Orioles will also be aggressive, but Showalter said some teams would be able to sign only more reasonably priced, second-tier free agents. Although Showalter would not reveal who appealed to the Rangers, figure that they are interested in Sterling Hitchcock, Kenny Rogers, Pat Hentgen, Jason Grimsley, Scott Spiezio and J. T. Snow.
"I know teams were cutting back last year," Showalter said. "I think there's going to be even more cutting back this year."
The Yankees have typically been aggressive in singling out a splashy player on the first day a team can make an offer, a strategy that helped the Philadelphia Phillies sign Jim Thome last season. But Duquette, who utters "nontender" as often as he utters "hello," said patience was necessary for a slew of teams because a second wave of players who are not tendered contracts would become available next month.

Texas: Big and Bigger
How big is everything in Texas? Big. How big is Roger Clemens in Texas? Real big. How big of a lure would it be for Clemens to eschew retirement and pitch one final season for the Texas Rangers? The Rangers hope the chances of that happening are big, too.
While Showalter merely said he wondered if the 41-year-old Clemens would really retire, one American League official who has spoken with the Rangers said the team was hopeful of offering Clemens a one-year deal and persuading him to follow Nolan Ryan by finishing his Hall of Fame career in his home state. Those close to Clemens did not think he would be swayed.
"When I asked him if he was really retired, he said, 'This is it, boss,' " Randy Hendricks, one of Clemens's agents, said in an e-mail message.
If anything, the Yankees believe Clemens would return to them late next year as a possible pitching mercenary. Clemens is keenly aware of his place in baseball history and probably wants to be remembered for finishing his career as a Yankee.

Support for Little
As much as the Boston Red Sox insisted that Manager Grady Little was not dismissed because he left Pedro Martinez in to pitch against the Yankees in the eighth inning of Game 7 of the American League Championship Series, it is hard to believe them. Little was on shaky ground and the decision to listen to Martinez, who blew a 5-2 lead, surely cost him any chance of keeping his job. To one former Yankee, that criticism was unfair.
"I think you have to leave Pedro in that game," Joe Girardi, who could be on Joe Torre's staff next season, said. "I don't care what the other guys in their bullpen had done. They're not Pedro Martinez."

Trade Soriano?
Alfonso Soriano had a dreadful postseason, setting a record with 26 strikeouts and being benched for one game in the World Series. The dismal performance raised speculation that the Yankees should shift him to the outfield or trade him.
Because the 25-year-old Soriano is the team's youngest starter and its most talented, although flawed, player, trading him would be dubious. The Yankees should instruct Luis Sojo, who is likely to be added to the coaching staff, and Willie Randolph that their mission is to teach Soriano better footwork, smarter positioning and improved throwing technique at second base.
"Teams are saying this is a good time to pop George on Soriano," one decision-maker from a major league team said, referring to George Steinbrenner. "They just might be haphazard and go and get rid of Soriano."

Hip-Hop on First!
OutKast, the hip-hop group featuring Big Boi and Andre 3000, includes a musical interlude on its double compact disc that parodies Abbott and Costello's "Who's on First?" routine.
The interlude, called "Good Day, Good Sir," focuses on a character named Bentley Farnsworth. As a second character tries to confirm Farnsworth's identity, other characters -- Fantasticly Well, Spectacular, Fine and Exactly -- are introduced. Those character names, some of which are also feelings, create the same type of confusion as having Who on first, What on second and I Don't Know on third.

HEADLINE: In Race for Mayor of Yonkers, Its Experience vs. Experience 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: YONKERS, N.Y., Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Voters will decide between the current deputy mayor and a former chief of the city's troubled school system when they go to the polls on Tuesday to choose a new mayor.
 The deputy mayor, Phil Amicone, a Republican, seeks to replace his political mentor, Mayor John Spencer, who is barred by term limits from seeking re-election. Joe L. Farmer, a Democrat and a career school administrator who was schools superintendent for three years, seeks to become the city's first black mayor. 
 In a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans almost two to one but Republicans have dominated City Hall for the past decade, the outcome is anything but certain. Gov. George E. Pataki came to Yonkers to endorse Mr. Amicone, and a steady stream of state and local Democrats have campaigned heavily for Mr. Farmer.
Mr. Amicone has campaigned on a promise to continue the course set by Mr. Spencer, emphasizing economic development and the overhaul of city schools.
"In spite of an economic recession around the country and state, Yonkers has continued to move forward and progress with our leadership," Mr. Amicone said.
Mr. Farmer said that his experience in the schools and as a special deputy in charge of creating moderately priced housing made him best able to tackle the city's biggest problems.
"I have the experience in the critical areas," Mr. Farmer said.
The race follows a hard-fought primary, in which Mr. Amicone faced Assemblyman Michael J. Spano, a longtime rival of Mr. Spencer. But rather than throw his support to Mr. Amicone after losing the messy fight over the nomination, Mr. Spano stayed in the race, seeking victory on the Conservative and Independent Party lines.
Mr. Spano's decision forced Mr. Amicone to wage a two-front campaign. Mr. Spano said in an interview after the primary that he had chosen to stay in the race because he felt that Mr. Amicone, a self-described social conservative, was too conservative for the city's heavily Democratic electorate. 
But Mr. Spano later reversed course, pulling out the race and throwing his support to Mr. Amicone. When he went to Yonkers on Wednesday to announce his endorsement of Mr. Amicone, Governor Pataki singled out Mr. Spano and his brother, Nick, who is a state senator from Yonkers, for applause. (The Spanos are not related to Andrew Spano, the Westchester County executive, a Democrat.)
Mr. Farmer worked in the school system as an administrator for three decades and had a tumultuous tenure as superintendent. He has staked his candidacy on his education experience, saying that only he can right the city's school system, which has been torn apart for decades over an ugly battle to end racial segregation. Mr. Farmer also worked in Mr. Spencer's administration, as an administrator in charge of developing more moderately priced housing.
Despite a numerical advantage in enrolled voters, Democrats have seen Republican mayors dominate city politics in recent years. Some saw the September primary as an opportunity to buck that trend, but Mr. Spano's withdrawal turned what had been an unpredictable three-way race into a more conventional campaign. Both Mr. Amicone and Mr. Farmer claimed Mr. Spano's withdrawal would help their campaigns.

Lovely Day To Watch (Maybe Not Race)

BYLINE:  By FRANK LITSKY

 BODY:
The weather forecast for today says temperatures should be in the 60's, an idyllic day for a Sunday stroll or an autumn picnic or watching the 34th annual New York City Marathon. Whether it will be a day of dreams for the 34,000 or so serious and recreational runners who will try to cover the 26 miles 385 yards through all five boroughs remains to be seen.
 The race organizers have taken extra steps to assure that 31,000 to 32,000 starters will finish. As usual, the race will start at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and end in Central Park, but everything will be an hour earlier. That should help many back-of-the-pack runners finish in daylight and avoid the evening chill. Disabled runners will start at 8 a.m., wheelchairs at 9:05, elite women at 9:35 and elite men and the rest of the men and women at 10:10. 
 Even with frequent water stations along the way, marathon runners tend to dehydrate during a race. The relatively warm weather is somewhat dangerous for recreational runners, who are not as finely trained as the professionals and are on the course longer. For the pros, warm weather is generally no more than an inconvenience.
"I'm not at all worried about it," said Catherine Ndereba, the women's favorite.
And Rodgers Rop, the men's defender, said, "It's my best weather because I've been training in hot weather."
Ndereba and Rop are Kenyans and accustomed to training in heat. One runner who doesn't like it is Marla Runyan of Eugene, Ore., who finished fourth among the women last year in her marathon debut and figures to do well again.
"I'd like colder weather," she said. "The temperature is more significant for me than the hills."
Any distractions, like too-warm weather, will not be welcomed by the American women who are seeking a qualifying time for the United States Olympic trials April 4 in St. Louis. Any who break 2 hours 40 minutes will get full expenses paid for the trials. Others who better 2:48 will qualify, but must pay their own way.
There are dollar rewards, too. ING, the Dutch financial services company, has become the race's first title sponsor. With its help, the prize money has been raised to $532,000 plus potential time bonuses. The leading man and woman will each collect at least $100,000 plus a European car, a Smart coupe.
As usual, Kenyan runners are expected to dominate. Last year, Kenyan men finished first, second and third and Kenyan women first, third, fifth and seventh.
Rop, 27, won the men's race last year and then won the Boston Marathon in April.
"My preparation for New York has been good," he said. "I think everything will be going smoothly."
Will he win again?
"I think so," he said. "Every time I run, I think I'm going to win, but I'm more sure now."
One interesting challenger is Laban Kipkemboi, only 25. Last year, in his marathon debut, he finished third here. Three weeks ago, Evans Rutto of Kenya won the Chicago Marathon in 2:05:50, the fastest marathon debut ever, and Dieter Hogen, who coaches Rutto and Kipkemboi in Boulder, Colo., has said Kipkemboi is better.
Kipkemboi understands the economics of the sport.
"If you win a marathon like New York," he said, "you will be very well known in the world and you will be invited to races. You can make a living."
Another potential winner is Julio Rey, a 31-year-old Spaniard who was the runner-up two months ago in the world championships. Before he began running at age 8, he watched his father run marathons for enjoyment and followed his father on a bike.
"I haven't seen the course here," Rey said. "But I was told 'piano, piano.' That's Italian for take it easy at the beginning. If I do, I think I can run 2:08."
A time of 2:08 would have won every marathon here except the one in 2001, when Tesfaye Jifar of Ethiopia set the course record of 2:07:43. The same year, Margaret Okayo of Kenya set the women's course record of 2:24:21.
Okayo, 27, is small (5 feet, 95 pounds), but she is a dangerous contender in the strong women's field. She started too fast in the Boston Marathon this year and faded to fourth in 2:27:39. She showed her speed three weeks ago when she ran a half-marathon in 1:07.
"I don't think New York is fast enough for a woman to run 2:20," she said. "But Idon't care. I don't think I have any competition."
She may face plenty of competition from other native Kenyans. Joyce Chepchemba, 32, the defending champion, has won marathons in New York, Chicago and London. Lornah Kiplagat, 29, who is a new Dutch citizen, won the New York Mini-Marathon in June, and if she wins today she will collect a $100,000 bonus. Two years ago, Ndereba, now 31, ran the Chicago Marathon in 2:18:47, a world record at the time.
Ndereba won the world championship two months ago, and as she recalled that day she sounded like a winner here as well as there.
"I wasn't tired, and I wasn't sore," she said, "not at all. I was extremely happy."

HEADLINE: Fishing and Bickering 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE NADEL

 BODY:
"YOU'VE heard of off the beaten track? Well, this is the beaten track," John Skinner said as his red Jeep Cherokee slid through a mile-long serpentine trough of sand called Burma Road. It spit the Jeep onto Great Gun Beach near Moriches Inlet, five miles east of the entrance to Smith Point County Park. Mr. Skinner, 42, of Wading River, stopped his vehicle to survey conditions on the beach one recent Saturday morning before sunrise. A southeast wind was whipping the gray sea into uninviting, churning waves.
 "That's good, nasty side chop," he said. An outgoing tide, overcast skies, cool weather and rough, clean surf presented good conditions for catching Atlantic striped bass. 
 Mr. Skinner, a recreational fisherman, was not the only one who was betting that the bass would bite. Six others were already surfcasting. One man, wrapped in a sleeping bag, sprawled next to a driftwood fire near his camper van. 
 "Anyone who will get up at 1 a.m. to try to outsmart a lower life form by waving a stick is crazy," Mr. Skinner said with a twinkle in his eye. He was attempting the same dubious feat, but had stayed in bed till 5. 
 As the first rays of sun poked through the clouds, he removed his old Lamiglass rod with its heavy-duty Penn spinning reel and 30-pound-test line from the vehicle's roof and tied on a Superstrike popper lure. Encased in a waterproof closed-cell neoprene suit and hip waders, Mr. Skinner walked into the wash and commenced whipping casts into the breakers. 
 Nearby, Bill Jentz, 48, of Bohemia, reeled in a 15-pound bluefish, a brute for its species but something of a consolation prize for the crowd that frequents Long Island beaches these days, looking for a striped bass that would double, triple -- they dared to hope for a trophy four times the weight of that bluefish.
 It was not to be. Chris Marino, 45, of Shirley, who had started fishing at 5:30 that morning, was calling it quits. "No runs, no hits, no errors," Mr. Marino said. "You might as well play Lotto." But like many lottery players, he said he intended to try again the next day. 
 Mr. Skinner cast different lures into the froth for three hours. It was hard work muscling casts into a cold wind while the surf tried to snatch his feet out from under him. But for his effort Mr. Skinner reeled in one undersized bass, which he released. 
 "Bass fishermen tend to be obsessive," he said by way of explanation.
 Forget golf or lacrosse -- striped bass fishing is the signifying sport on Long Island, like surfing is in Southern California. Hungry, night-feeding bass cruise the shoreline on their autumn migration from New England to warmer waters farther south, and the beaches from Cape Cod to New Jersey are the best spots to intercept them. The South Shore is in the middle of this zone. So every fall, thousands of Long Islanders forsake their warm beds to stand on the sand or a rocky jetty with a long rod and cast into the surf or the gnarly rips and inlets in pursuit of the striper. 
 The height of the season is right about now. In fact, as any fisherman will tell you, the biggest bite of the year was yesterday.
 "Bass bring out something in people," said George Scocca, publisher of Nor'east Saltwater, a magazine published in Commack. "The mystique has to do with its size, beauty, and grace. You can hold it and look at it. It has no teeth. When you release it, you nurse it back in the water. There's something sensual about it. It's the only fish that will make a man say, 'She was so beautiful, I had to let her go."'
 In addition to turning rugged outdoorsy types into misty-eyed poets, stripers taste great, and have long supported a commercial fishery. Last year New York commercial fishermen sold more than half a million pounds of striped bass, according to Ken Gall, seafood specialist with the New York Sea Grant Project, a public research group..
 But in the same year the state's recreational fishermen landed more than four million pounds of stripers, a disparity that is one of several issues in a long-running skirmish between commercial and sport anglers.
 The minimum length for a keeper striped bass in New York State is 28 inches, with recreational anglers, unlicensed and using a rod and reel, limited to one per day, two per day if landed on a charter boat. Commercial fishermen, who must be licensed and mostly use nets, have the same size limit and an allotment of 151 fish per fisherman per season, an increase of 42 percent over previous years.
 The increased commercial catch was approved in February by the 15-state Atlantic Marine Fisheries Commission. Lower commercial limits had been in effect since 1990, and for seven years before that it was illegal for any angler in New York to keep a striped bass.
 The increase in commercial limits reflects the judgment by the Marine Fisheries Commission that the bass population, which crashed in the 1980's because of overfishing, can withstand more pressure without being depleted. But the recreational limits were not changed, fanning sport anglers' resentments.
 "I'm disappointed in the commercial quota increase," Mr. Skinner said, summing up the general opinion at a recent seminar in Lynbrook attended by more than 300 recreational fishermen. 
 But the commercials say they're still being denied a fair slice of the pie. "I would have allowed the commercial fisheries to increase their landings," said Arnold Leo, 64, of East Hampton, who represents New York State's commercial fishery on the Atlantic Striped Bass Advisory Panel. "We were prevented from doing that by A.M.S.F.C. because of lobbying by the recreational fishery.
 "Whoever has the most political power gets most of the quota," Mr. Leo said. "Whoever tried to reduce the recreational quota would be shot at dawn."
 Brad Loewen has been a commercial trapper in Peconic Bay for the past 30 years. "I have to wait for them to come to me. That's like going out in your backyard and hoping you'll find gold," said Mr. Loewen, 54, of East Hampton. "The feds gave us more fish. If there's a good run in the fall, I'll be able to fill my tags this year." Even if he fills the quota, he estimated that if he caught 151 11-pounders, at $3.53 a pound, it would not be a significant part of his income. "We're still under such restrictions, you can't really make a living." 
 According to Mr. Leo, the disparity in sport and commercial anglers' bass catches is even greater than the statistics indicate because catch-and-release fishing, a common practice among sport anglers even when they catch a legal fish, kills more striped bass than this year's increase in the commercial limit.
 "He exhausts the fish by dragging them through surf and sand," Mr. Leo said of the recreational angler. "He cuts the gills and gullets with his hooks. He wounds them, then throws them back into the water."
 Sport fishermen contend that 1 out of every 9 or 10 fish die this way, but Mr. Leo estimates that the striped bass fatality rate from "catch and release" activity is closer to 1 out of every 4 or 5.
"Those guys are killing six million pounds of striped bass while the commercial guys now get around 800,000 pounds," he said. "There isn't any equity." 
 Sport anglers say the commercials have the same problem with undersized fish injured in their nets, not to mention the waste of bycatch, the unwanted species hauled aboard. The small bass and unwanted species -- "trash fish" to the commercials but just as much a part of the ecosystem -- often vastly outnumber the keeper bass in a net, and are thrown overboard, usually dead or dying.
 But according to Mr. Leo, commercial fishermen cause minimal damage to the environment. "It's the recreational fishermen who destroy wetlands with their marinas, pollute the water with their engines and destroy the dunes with their S.U.V.'s," he said.
 Recreational anglers put a different spin on the same facts, noting that the recreational fishery dwarfs the commercial one in terms of economic value. 
 Another point of contention is the protection of trophy-sized fish, all of which are females. A 50-pound cow is about 20 years old and could have another 10 years or more to live, and produces more eggs as she ages.
 "A 20-year-old female will produce several million more eggs than a younger fish," said Fred Schwab, 68, of Mattituck, who has represented New York State's recreational fishery on the Atlantic Striped Bass Advisory Panel since 1978. He argued that an increased commercial catch will take more large bass out of circulation, leading to less spawning for future generations.
 "In terms of numbers, the striped bass resource has recovered, but there are few large fish," he said. "We want to give the fish a chance to grow older."
 But the recreational anglers generally oppose any change in their catch limits, and few of them can bring themselves to give up their right to keep a trophy fish. On the other hand, many commercial fishermen favor a maximum length as well as a minimum, to protect large fish. 
 "We think you should be able to catch fish between 22 and 36 inches," Mr. Leo said. "That way you get small fillet fish and larger steak fish. Fish over 36 inches are clearly the strongest and the smartest. They should be protected for spawning."
 "Recreational fishermen are full of delusions about how things work," Mr. Leo said. "Their greed whoops their ability to think clearly. The recreational guys think that if you leave the small fish, eventually you will have more big fish to catch. Not exactly." 
 Mr. Skinner allowed that he "would have liked to see better protection of bigger fish in the recreational allotment." But that's as far as he would go in agreeing with Mr. Leo.
 So the standoff continues. Meanwhile, just off a beach somewhere along the South Shore, a five-foot torpedo with a mouth like a bucket cruises silently, waiting to make some angler's day.

 In the largest Long Island job layoff announced this year, J.P. Morgan Chase said Monday that it would cut about 1,000 back-office jobs in Hicksville by next May, moving most of the jobs to a new customer-service center in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
 The bank will move the remainder to other customer-service and collection centers in Houston; San Antonio, Tex.; Tampa, Fla.; and Tempe, Ariz., said Kirsten Batteria, a bank spokeswoman. About 500 jobs will remain in Hicksville. The shift will strengthen the bank's ability to provide customer service to the West Coast and will take advantage of lower operational costs, Ms. Batteria said. 
 Gary Huth, the Long Island labor market analyst for the State Department of Labor, said the layoffs were the largest by a single employer on the Island this year. "While the job losses will be individually very disruptive, I think a number of the people who are being laid off are well positioned to be reabsorbed into the local economy fairly quickly," Mr. Huth said.

Cablevision's New Venture
 Charles Dolan, the founder of the Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE: CVC) in Bethpage, said on Oct. 23 that he would step down as the company's chairman to run a satellite TV spinoff called Voom. James Dolan, his son and Cablevision's chief executive, will assume the chairman's post.
 Analysts generally reacted negatively to the venture, which several said exposed the company and its investors to a risky initiative. "The company is again straining credibility with investors," Ted Henderson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, told CBS MarketWatch.

Acclaim Settles Lawsuit
 Acclaim Entertainment (Nasdaq: AKLM) of Glen Cove, the video game company, said Monday that it had resolved its dispute with Dave Mirra, a professional dirt-bike racer. Mr. Mirra, who licensed his name and likeness to Acclaim for a series of video games, filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in New York in February seeking over $20 million in damages. The lawsuit contended that the game was pornographic and damaged Mr. Mirra's image.
 The lawsuit was settled without compensation, and Acclaim is moving forward with a new game based on Mr. Mirra's racing exploits, the company said. Compiled by Warren Strugatch

A Plan to Build the Best-Protected Bathroom Ever

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
TOURISM promoters believe they can overcome deeply rooted neighborhood objections and move forward with a plan to build what would be Long Island's first true visitors' center after at least three decades of trying.
 Each year, tourism accounts for about $1.6 billion on Long Island, according to a study completed last year by Global Insight, an economic consulting firm in Reston, Va. Pearl Kamer, the Long Island Association's economist, said that tourism accounted for 100,000 jobs last year, making it the No. 4 industry on the Island, after retailing, heath care and education. 
 But for all their spending, visitors don't exactly get red-carpet treatment. In fact, they don't even get a flush toilet. 
 Most tourism promotion agencies slap welcome centers on well-traveled roads, plying visitors with brochures, information and often complimentary snacks and beverages. And, of course, a bathroom. For many visitors, nothing may be as urgent.
 But that's not how things work on Long Island. The Long Island Convention & Visitors Bureau, which has a $2 million annual budget, mostly financed by hotel-room surcharges, operates four information centers. Two shut down every October: the chalet on Southern State Parkway in Valley Stream, and the converted and rather dilapidated Long Island Rail Road car on the eastbound Long Island Expressway near Exit 51. The bureau distributes information year round from an unstaffed kiosk at the Tanger Outlet Center in Riverhead and from a staffed booth at MacArthur Airport. 
 Only the rail car has a bathroom supplied by the tourist bureau: portable toilets that are available from April 1 through Columbus Day.
 Michael G. Hollander, the executive director of the tourism bureau, acknowledges that Long Island offers visitors a dubious welcome. "Hospitality means one of the things you provide visitors, along with information, is use of bathrooms," Mr. Hollander said. "Historically we haven't been able to do this very well."
 Mitchell Pally, the Long Island Association's government affairs specialist and Mr. Hollander's chief ally in the effort to provide modern visitors' centers, agreed. "Do we shoot ourselves in the foot?" he said. "Yes, we do." 
 The reason it has taken decades to let tourists use the bathroom is community opposition. Efforts by civic groups and vocal individuals have consistently derailed efforts to build full-service visitors' centers, out-muscling both the tourism board and the Long Island Association. Both organizations want to establish at least three year-round, full-service visitors' centers. The association, in fact, has made that one of its 2004 priorities.
 This quixotic campaign has been under way since the early 1970's. Last month, both organizations said they believed they had finally turned a corner. 
 Both of New York's senators have sent letters to the federal highway superintendent in Washington calling for a waiver on the ban that bars construction of office buildings on federal highways. If granted, the waiver would allow the tourism board to move forward with its newest plan, which is to move into a 19,000-square-foot state highway patrol building that would be built where the rail car now stands. The projected completion date is 2007.
 The state would pay the $35 million construction tab, and the bureau would maintain the building, which it would share with the state troopers. Visitors could pick up brochures promoting Long Island attractions and find someone to answer questions year round. And, at long last, visitors could use the bathroom, probably one of the safest roadside bathrooms anywhere.
 The effort to block the project has a long, boisterous pedigree. Over the years, civic groups have successfully opposed opening full-service centers by drawing lurid scenarios involving drug users, prostitutes, roving bands of teenagers and promiscuous gays.
 Daniel C. Brown, the chairman of a group called Citizens Against Rest Stops, said that his organization opposes the efforts to build the visitor center near Exit 51 because truck drivers allow their engines to idle at the existing rest area for hours, spewing exhaust. "There are facets to the new plan that are outscaled, in particular the size," he said. "They're now saying 19,000 square feet. Last May, they presented the plan to us as 9,000 square feet." 
 Mr. Pally of the Long Island Association contends that neighborhood advocates should take a broader view. "Local residents tend to look at regional issues from the perspective of how they affect their own immediate neighborhood," he said. "That's why it's often so difficult to succeed not only in tourism promotion, but also in moving forward with other projects. All kinds of worthwhile things have been delayed or defeated. Long Islanders need to understand that we are in this together."
 Neal Lewis, the executive director of the Neighborhood Network, an advocacy group claiming 30,000 members in Nassau and Suffolk, said that tourism promoters alienated residents with their heavy-handed style. "Community groups are told, in effect, you can support this plan or you can oppose it," he said. "So they oppose it."
 Michael Davidson, the executive director of the Glen Cove Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Hollander's immediate predecessor, said he made construction of a visitors' center a top priority during his tenure, from 1990 through 1997.
 Although the project went nowhere, Mr. Davidson denied that the effort was a failure. "I look at everything as a long-term process," he said. "You keep presenting ideas, and you keep trying."
 David J. Lee, a Sag Harbor retailer and the chairman of the convention and visitors bureau during the mid-70's, said that establishing a visitors' center had also been one of his priorities. 
 He said that the installation of the old rail car, which he helped to implement, was a step in the right direction. "The railroad car leaves a lot to be desired, but it's a heck of a lot better than nothing," he said. 
 Mr. Lee blamed bureaucratic turf-protecting and political inertia for the years of delay in establishing a modern visitors' center. "There is a D.O.T. building on the south service road by Route 110, and we wanted to get it turned over to us" for a visitors' center, Mr. Lee said, recalling an effort he led nearly 30 years ago. "It didn't happen. D.O.T. said they needed the building. They use it to store gravel and trucks. It was a real waste of valuable land."
 Mr. Lee expressed limited optimism for the current effort. "What happens is these things get bogged down in politics, in the unwillingness of bureaucrats to change and, especially, nimbyism," he said. 
 Speaking perhaps with tongue in cheek, Mr. Lee suggested that tourism promoters could make their case by arranging a nonstop tour for government officials from Manhattan to Montauk. "I say, fill 'em up with coffee, then don't let 'em out to use the bathroom until they get to Montauk," he said. "That ought to do it."

HEADLINE: The Battle Over Teterboro: From Romance to Hostility 

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: TETERBORO 

 BODY:
THE six-passenger plane was heading for Teterboro Airport when it crashed into an oak tree in Gil and Louise Bowman's backyard in Hasbrouck Heights and burst into flames.
 Mrs. Bowman later told her husband she heard the explosion and saw an orange glow against the drawn blinds and thought her house was on fire. She grabbed her two children, 8-year-old Nicholas and 3-year-old Jessica, and fled through the front door into the chill December evening without stopping to put on her children's shoes. 
 "If that was a big plane that came down," Mr. Bowman says now , "given the damage a little plane can do, it could have wiped out half a block." 
 As it was, the plane that crashed in the Bowman's backyard on Dec. 9, 1999, a six-passenger Beechcraft Baron 58TC, killed the pilot and three passengers and injured three other people who made a futile rescue attempt. The pilot had ignored an air traffic controller's instructions and approached Teterboro from the wrong direction.
 As fortunate as residents were -- they all escaped injury -- the memory still haunts residents of the towns surrounding Teterboro Airport, one of the busiest general aviation airports in the nation with more than 500 takeoffs and landings each day. Within about a four-mile radius of the bustling airport are about 23 of Bergen's 70 municipalities with an estimated combined population of about 300,000 people, more than a third of Bergen's 884,000 residents.
 Nor was the crash in the Bowmans' backyard an isolated incident. On March 9, 2002, a propeller-driven Cessna 210 crashed in flames on the edge of Teterboro Airport shortly after take-off, stopping about a hundred yards from congested Route 46. The pilot was killed immediately. And on a Sunday evening in September 2002, a small Piper Saratoga bound for Canada took off from Teterboro, developed engine trouble and crashed 50 miles away into a new housing development in Byram. No one on the ground was injured but, but the pilot and his wife were killed and their two small children critically injured.
 It is accidents like these that have neighbors of the 827-acre airport -- which straddles the southern Bergen County boroughs of Teterboro, with about 50 residents, and Moonachie, with 2,754 -- staunchly opposed to a proposal from the Federal Aviation Agency that would allow jets weighing more than 100,000 pounds to land at the suburban airport. Congress has passed a measure that may succeed in blocking such a maneuver, though the outcome is far from certain. 
 And in a meeting as recently as last Wednesday in Washington, Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, told the administrator of the aviation agency, Marion Blakey, that under no circumstances would his agency physically modify the airport to allow heavier planes to land. The F.A.A. proposal includes not only Teterboro, considered by the aviation industry as the No. 1 business airport on the East Coast, but about 3,000 airports nationwide, including about 16 others in New Jersey.
 The danger of another plane crash has over the years added to the concerns and intruded on the quality of life in this pocket of suburbia -- fears of pollution from jet fumes and the ear-splitting noise of planes landing and taking off at all hours.

Residents Are Fed Up
 "It's a constant, 24 hours a day, seven days a week," said Brian Curreri, a 40-year-old training specialist for New Jersey Transit, as he stood outside his two-family house in Carlstadt one recent evening. "Sometimes when the cloud level is low, you can actually smell the fuel. We can't watch TV; we can't sit in the backyard; we can't open windows in the house; we can't talk on the phone." As he spoke, he had to raise his voice to be heard over the high-pitched whine of jets taking off every three minutes just a mile and a half from his house.
 Complicating matters is the adversarial relationship that has developed between the Port Authority, the operator of the airport, and surrounding communities. In the past, residents say, the agency had largely turned a deaf ear to complaints about the noise and pollution. So in January 2001, when the Port Authority announced plans for a $92.4 million improvement of Teterboro, many residents viewed it as an expansion in disguise that would mean more planes, more noise, more pollution and more risk of jetliners falling from the sky. 
 The redevelopment effort -- which has been going on while efforts to stop it have ground on in federal court -- calls for construction of a new administration building, realignment of taxiways and the relocation of some office and hangar facilities to a 22-acre undeveloped site at the southern end.
 Fighting the plan is a bipartisan alliance of elected officials from a dozen neighboring towns, called the Coalition for Public Health and Safety, which sued the Port Authority in Federal District Court in May 2002 to try to delay the plan until a thorough pollution study could be undertaken. After several court hearings over the last year, the two parties have been meeting to discuss a possible settlement.
 For their part, Port Authority officials say they have tried to mend the frayed relations, and in recent months have come out strongly against allowing the heavier planes to land at Teterboro. In addition, the agency has also worked with Representative Steven R. Rothman, a Democrat from Bergen County, to shut down a regularly scheduled charter service that began last March.
 Mr. Coscia, who took over as chairman of the Port Authority in May, said he was committed to maintaining Teterboro as part of the region's transportation infrastructure, but without "undermining the quality of life of the people who live around it."
 "As a newcomer who not all that long ago observed things the way these individuals did and in some cases came to the same conclusion, I can't fault people who live near the airport over being concerned about it," Mr. Coscia, 43, lawyer, financial expert and former chairman of New Jersey Economic Development Authority, said in a telephone interview.
 "These are problems that can't be solved overnight," Mr. Coscia added. "But I do think there is a new attempt at the Port Authority, one that I support very strenuously and Governor McGreevey supports, that requires the Port Authority to make the facility as comfortable with its operations to the community as possible."
 Teterboro takes its name from Walter C. Teter, a New York investment banker, who bought hundreds of acres of swamp in the early 1900's with the notion of building a racetrack. The town of Teterboro was created by special legislation in 1917 by annexing sections of three towns. But when the state Racing Commission failed to approve the plan, Mr. Teter sold half of the property to an aircraft corporation, which built the facility. The Port Authority took control of the airport in 1949, and over the next six years acquired about 60 houses and farms in Moonachie and Hasbrouck Heights to expand it. 
 "This proved to be a hardship for some because with the money offered, they could not afford to buy housing in the surrounding area," Frank C. Derato wrote in "Down The Hill: Memories of a Lost Wood Ridge," (Cranbury Publication, 2002). 
 Over the years the suburban airport and its occasional prop-driven planes became a fixture in the shadow of Manhattan. But as it changed -- from the early days of aviation when Anthony Fokker, the Dutch aircraft designer, set up shop and luminaries like Floyd Bennet and Amelia Earhart tested planes overhead -- so, too, did feelings about the airport, from romantic curiosity to open hostility. 
 "As kids, we would bike from Rutherford to Teterboro, and we'd go into the old control tower and watch Art Linkletter land his plane," said Carol Skiba, a legal secretary and member of the coalition. "It was cool. But not now."
 To detractors, airport officials like to point out that Teterboro generates $500 million a year for the region and employs about 1,200 people, 94 percent of whom live within 15 miles. Five aviation service companies, called fixed-base operations, maintain offices and hangars at the airport and provide refueling, maintenance and charter services. 
 Each day, about 550 planes take off or land at Teterboro, which is known as a "reliever airport," to ease congestion at Newark Liberty, Kennedy and LaGuardia Airports -- from Piper Cubs to Gulfstream jets carrying transplant organs to Hackensack Medical Center to hard-charging executives, sports teams and celebrities.
 Longtime residents first insisted that the number of flights had increased sharply over the years, though a closer examination of records actually showed a fluctuation. In the late 1990's the number averaged about 180,000 a year but jumped to 200,599 in 2002, the highest number since 1986 when there were 218,922 flights. Faced with the figures, residents then said that while the overall number of flights might have decreased, the number of bigger planes with louder engines had increased.
 "They say, 'We've only increased by a small percentage the number of flights,' but that's not quite truthful," said Assemblywoman Rose Marie Heck, a Republican from Lodi. "The number is correct but the type of aircraft has changed dramatically over the last 10 years. Instead of Piper Cubs, the jets came in."
 For residents who have experienced planes skimming a rooftop, once is enough. 
 One such person is Nadine Thompson, a 43-year old resident of Wood Ridge who stepped outside to speak with her husband last Father's Day, only to have a plane that had aborted a landing pass over her house only about 200 feet from the ground. "It was pretty darn big," Ms. Thompson said. "It wasn't a little prop plane. They told me it was a 12- to 16-seater and when it's 200 feet above your head it's pretty darn big." 
 She called the airport and the Federal Aviation Administration, though she failed to reach anyone that day. Over the next few months she called a dozen more times, but she said she never got a full explanation of what happened or whether the pilot, who she was told had made an error, was ever disciplined.

'Convenience of the Few'
 To some extent, she and others in this densely packed slice of North Jersey feel they are engaged in class warfare.
 "I do not doubt they want bigger planes to land here because someone wants to be able to get on his big fancy plane and have an easy trip into New York City and not have to deal with security issues at airports like Newark," she said. "It's basically money talking, and it's the convenience of the few over the health and safety of the many." 
 William R. De Cota, director of aviation for the Port Authority, says the $92.4 million capital plan is necessary because the infrastructure of the airport had fallen into disrepair during the 30 years it was operated by the two private contractors, Pan Am Airways and then Johnson Controls. By the time the contract with Johnson Controls expired in December 2000, the Port Authority said it had to rehabilitate the airport. Nearly half the expenditure, $44.9 million, will go toward realigning taxiways, which officials say will speed planes in and out and as a result cut down on noise and pollution.
 The plan also calls for paving 22 acres of unused land at the southern end of the airport so First Aviation, an airport tenant, can relocate offices and hangars there. The Port Authority will then use First Aviation's current site to build the administration building and housing for emergency fire and rescue equipment. 
 Yet despite what officials say, opponents insist these measures are aimed at lengthening and strengthening the two intersecting runways, which are 7,000 feet and 6,015 feet in the shape of an X. And even if that is not the case, they insist, the intent is the same: to make way for more and larger planes.
 The authority has adamantly denied that. "Not at all, not lengthen, not strengthen," Mr. DeCota said. Rather, he said, "a lot of what we're actually doing is an investment that in effect reduces the impact of the airport on the community."
 To reach out to the community as well as oversee the improvements, Mr. DeCota said, the agency in February 2001 assigned Lanny Rider, a 25-year-Port Authority employee and former combat helicopter pilot in Vietnam, as on-site manager. "We asked Lanny to basically makesure the community's interest was well-represented," Mr. DeCota said.
 One of Mr. Rider's roles is to serve as co-chairman of the Teterboro Aircraft Noise Abatement Advisory Committee, which has brought together, among others, officials from the Port Authority, the F.A.A. and the aviation industry to recommend noise abatement measures and to discuss other issues. 
 In an effort to ingratiate himself with the community, Mr. Rider also serves as president of the Teterboro Business League. He has held meetings to explain the plan, and has tried to burnish the agency's image through such outreach efforts as contributing $50,000 to the $335,000 cost of a new fire truck for Moonachie, undertaking a $6 million drainage program that includes building a new pump house for the borough of Teterboro and improving ball fields just beyond the airport fence. 
 The agency says it has also taken steps to show residents that it hears their concerns. Last year, the Port Authority banned "Stage 1" aircraft, the oldest and loudest planes and biggest polluters, from using Teterboro, eliminating about 900 flights a year. And it supports legislation being sponsored by Representative Rothman for more stringent noise standards. 
 Another Port Authority policy now says that planes will be banned from using Teterboro ever again if they exceed F.A.A. noise limits at the airport three times within two years. 
 In addition, the agency -- barred by federal law from instituting a mandatory overnight curfew -- has urged pilots to avoid using the airport between midnight and 6 a.m. unless the flight is essential. "Stage 2" aircraft, those described as still noisy but less so than Stage 1, have been asked not to operate between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Still, there are about 50 flights every night. 
 Paul F. Busch, the municipal manager of Teterboro, and Mayor Fred Dressel of Moonachie say that since Mr. Rider arrived, relations with the Port Authority have improved. "We feel we now have an individual and organization that's trying to cope with the problems," Mr. Busch said. "I think they are taking steps to make the airport less intrusive."
 Neither Teterboro nor Moonachie joined the suit against the Port Authority. Mr. Dressel, who has been mayor of Moonachie for 19 years, said: "I have to be careful how I approach the Port Authority. They own 40 percent of our town, and I have to deal with them on a day-to-day basis, and the first thing that happens when there is a lawsuit is no one is allowed to talk to you but their legal department, and I can't operate that way." 
 The coalition filed its lawsuit in May 2002 because it questioned the thoroughness -- and independence -- of a pollution study that the Port Authority had commissioned the previous year. At the suggestion of Assemblywoman Heck, who had also been studying the pollution issue, the Port Authority hired the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute of Rutgers University to begin the first phase of a three-part study.
 As for the coalition, it commissioned the Environ International Corporation of Groton, Conn., to assess the environmental impact, and in October 2001 it issued a report noting that such harmful chemicals as benzene and butadiene, components of jet fuel, greatly exceeded federal standards. But there was one flaw: the two-day study could not determine how much of the pollution came from the airport and how much came from the traffic on nearby Routes 17 and 46.
 At that point, the coalition contended that it was up to the Port Authority to finance a more thorough study but insisted that it have a voice in choosing the company to conduct it.

Seeking an Accommodation
 Two things have occurred that make it seem as if the coalition will prevail. At a meeting in October, Stuart Lieberman, a Princeton lawyer representing the coalition in the suit, said that settlement discussions with Port Authority lawyers had begun and despite "an adversarial relationship" in court hearings, things had progressed in the talks where "we are trying to amicably work out something."
 And in September, Governor McGreevey flew into Teterboro and pledged that $450,000 -- half from the state and half from the Port Authority -- would be made available for the thorough study of pollution that the coalition wanted, with monitoring stations to be set up around the airport. 
 Even then, Mayor Steven Lonegan of Bogota, co-chairman of the coalition, was less optimistic at the meeting. "I'm not willing to declare victory until we have the settlement in our hands," he said. 
 For Mr. Lonegan and others, the pollution study is a foot in the door -- a way to keep planes heavier than 100,000 pounds from using Teterboro. Currently, said Mr. DeCota, 98 percent of planes using the airport weigh less than 80,000 pounds.
 Pushing in the other direction is the Boeing Company, which has been trying to get its 737 business jet into the airport since it was developed in late 1996. Last June the company filed a complaint with the F.A.A. saying the ban at Teterboro was unreasonable and discriminatory, and as a result the agency published a proposed policy change in the Federal Register last July.
 The proposal requires airports to provide evidence that allowing heavier planes to use the airport will damage runways and notes that allowing occasional planes that exceed the weight limit will not diminish the life of a runway. It also requires airports that develop new runways or rehabilitate existing pavement to design them to accommodate the heavier aircraft And it stipulates that a weight ban cannot be used to limit noise. 
 Mr. DeCota says that the company's lobbying efforts are behind the F.A.A.'s proposal to open Teterboro to the huge $40 million jet. At 110 feet in length and with a wingspan of 117 feet, it is larger than any planes now landing there.

F.A.A. Position Criticized
 David L. Bennett, director of aircraft safety and standards for the aviation agency who drafted the proposal, denied any such thing.
 "The F.A.A. has never taken a position that any particular plane would have to be admitted," he said. 
 For its part, the Port Authority has passed a resolution to continue the ban. "The F.A.A.'s position is, in our view, completely inconsistent, not only in what is in the community's best interest but in what we consider serving the aviation needs of the region," Mr. Coscia said.
 In the meantime, Representative Rothman recently succeeded in getting both the House and the Senate to continue the ban, and now the two versions are awaiting reconciliation and final passage. 
 "If we throw out weight limits and require local operators against their will to upgrade their runways to handle larger and larger planes," Mr. Rothman said, "what's to stop the F.A.A. from demanding that 747's be accommodated at Teterboro Airport?" 
 The efforts of the Port Authority and Mr. Rothman have left Steve Barlage, the New Jersey-based director of regional sales for Boeing, frustrated. 
 "The issue is not Boeing against Teterboro," Mr. Barlage said. "It's against a localized restriction. Once one community starts restricting access, it can spread to other places, and you don't have a homogenized government entity. It becomes balkanized all over the place, a situation in which our industry would be paralyzed."
 Asked what he would say to residents fearful of a 737 crashing into a heavily populated neighborhood much as the smaller plane did in Hasbrouck Heights four years ago, he responded, "I don't know how to assuage their fear." After a moment, he added, "The 737 has the best safety record of any airplane ever built."
 That is little comfort for the Bowmans, who say the crash in their backyard had some lasting effects. 
 "My daughter was young enough, she seemed to shake it off, but my son won't go on an airplane," Gil Bowman said. "We went to Florida and we had to take the train. Eventually, if he doesn't get over this, we'll have to seek professional help for him."

That Silence You Hear Is Chatter About an Arena

BYLINE:  By Ronald Smothers; Ronald Smothers reports from Newark for The New York Times.

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
Mayor Sharpe James,known for his enthusiastic even hyperbolic -- cheerleading when it comes to revitalization efforts in Newark, was at it again this past week. Sort of.
 At the groundbreaking for the Greater Newark Conservancy's outdoor learning center last Tuesday in the city's Central Ward, the 67-year-old mayor was effusive about the work of the nonprofit environmental group. 
 It was yet another indication of the city's rebirth, the mayor told listeners, similar to such accomplishments as the New Jersey Performing Arts Center; the improvements to Branch Brook Park; the widening of Route 21; and improvements in the subway system and the proposed light rail line that will link downtown with the airport and neighboring Elizabeth. 
 But not one word was mentioned about the long-proposed $355 million arena for the Devils and Nets, something that for the last two years had been the focus of his efforts and the centerpiece of his rhetorical flourishes about Newark's future.
 Later that day, Mayor James moved on to announce a $6 million grant bestowed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that would enable the city and Essex County to build a parking deck for the financially sagging Riverfront Stadium, where the Newark Bears play minor league baseball. Again the mayor touted the stadium, the nearby Performing Arts Center and the park under construction along the banks of the Passaic River as among the many indications of the rising fortunes of the state's largest city.
 But again, not one word about the proposed arena, whose significance in his vision of the city's future once led the Mr. James -- in his role as state senator -- to hold the entire state budget hostage until he got assurances of help.
 But for months now there has been little, if any, talk from City Hall or anywhere else about the proposed arena, which had managed to survive -- at least as an idea -- through the administration's of three governors and against the resistance of powerful suburban interests. It was an idea that James E. McGreevey, as a candidate for governor, enthusiastically embraced and one that he vowed to bring to reality a year and a half ago in a campaign appearance in support of the mayor's re-election.
 Some political observers see the deafening silence as a sign that the arena is dead. Others noted that the waning of the mayor's usual boosterism seemed to coincide with a recent revolt among members of the usually pliable Newark City Council. In that episode, the group rejected the mayor's plan to raise $90 million by selling development rights in the city's watershed scattered over Morris, Passaic and Sussex counties. 
 All of this silence came just after Mayor James and Governor McGreevey secured funds from the Port Authority earlier this year to help finance the planned arena without the need to trouble taxpayers. 
 Even when new doubts were cast on the proposal by disputes among the owners of the two teams, the mayor and the governor remained publicly optimistic.
 City and state negotiators winked as they noted privately that the delay in finalizing the deal was simply 11th-hour jockeying by the teams's owners to put a high sheen on a deal that they wanted anyway.
 But by September the disarray among the owners of the hockey and basketball franchise was palpable, and they were reportedly looking to sell their stakes and dissolve the nearly five-year-old partnership. While the YankeeNets partners were beating the bushes for a buyer for the Devils, according to insiders, published reports suggested a spirited bidding war for the Nets by investors who want to move the franchise to either Long Island or Brooklyn.
 Dismayed, many New Jerseyans took heart at later reports that Senator Jon Corzine and a developer, Charles Kushner -- who also happens to be one of the governor's leading contributors -- were coming together to buy the Nets to try to keep them in the state. But their proposal would keep the teams playing at their current home, the Continental Airlines Arena at the Meadowlands.
 In the meantime, there were persistent reports that Raymond Chambers, the YankeeNets partner who was the driving force behind the proposed move to a Newark arena, was hoping to emerge from the YankeeNets disarray as the head of a new investment group that would acquire the Nets and continue with the planned move to Newark.
 "Ray is still very interested in trying to make this work," said one member of the YankeeNets board who requested anonymity.
 As he continues to spar with an obstreperous City Council over the consequences and lost revenue from the defeated watershed plan, Mayor James looks as relaxed as ever. Indeed, some on the council and outside insist that like Jason Kidd of the Nets, Mayor James remains the playmaker despite the annoying defensive moves by some opponents.
 Cornered last week on the dizzying array of proposals for the sports teams -- and by extension the arena -- Mayor James insisted that the proposal was still alive. At the same time, he acknowledged his relative silence of late on the project.
 "There have been so many announcements in the past that have been false and with erroneous information," he said. "But I'm going to be making an announcement soon."
 Pressed on how an arena could still be possible amid the uncertainty about the ownership of the two teams, Mayor James said enigmatically: "You have to separate the idea of the teams from the idea of the arena."

Diagnosis: Frustration

BYLINE:  By MARK T. OLESNICKY, M.D.; Mark T. Olesnicky is president of the Medical Society of New Jersey.

 BODY:
SAY you're critically ill. Your doctor says: "I can write two prescriptions. One is not proven and may make your condition worse. The second has proven effective in every application. It's your choice." 
 Over the last few weeks, newspapers have run articles and editorials on New Jersey's medical liability crisis. Some papers oppose the proven methods to fix the situation. They suggest that we cross our fingers and hope for the best. As support for their position, some cite as an expert Howard Weiss, formally of MIXX Insurance, who was kicked out of the insurance industry 12 years ago, never handled a claim in his life, has no data and now works for plaintiffs' attorneys. He has also testified before committees in the New Jersey Assembly. 
In March, the New Jersey Senate passed (32-5) a comprehensive, bipartisan bill. The leading provision would allow plaintiffs to receive unlimited economic damages and up to $1 million in non-economic (pain and suffering) jury awards. Other worthy elements would strengthen expert witness criteria and statutes of limitations for birth injuries, create hospital Patient Safety Committees and increase insurance oversight.
 Physicians support this bill, but not because it would limit non-economic damages. We support it because one of the country's leading actuaries -- who sets insurance rates -- said that it would stabilize premiums and enable physicians to stay in practice.
 That is why what has happened since March has been so frustrating. The Assembly Democrats waited until the last day of the legislative session to gut the caps and substitute subsidies that will reach only a few physicians. But they did not stop there. They severely weakened every other provision, including those aimed at stopping many merit-less cases from proceeding. 
 In this form, the actuaries state, the bill will not subdue out-of-control insurance premiums and may push them even higher. Physicians prefer to work in fact-based evidence, not on half-truths and empty promises. If the Assembly could produce evidence that this bill would reduce premiums, we would consider it. But they can't produce this evidence because there is none.
 Like New Jersey, Texas was recently considered a medical liability crisis state. Over the last few months, the Texas Legislature passed a $250,000 limit on non-economic damages, followed by a public referendum that stopped legal challenges to the limit. Not surprisingly, Texas insurers have just announced minimum 12 percent decreases to 2004 policy renewals, contrasted with increases of more than 40 percent in New Jersey.
 Vast evidence proves that non-economic limits reduce insurance premiums and ensure patient access to care, while adequately compensating those who have been injured. New Jersey patients deserve the same.

Home for the Troubled At Odds With a School

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS

 BODY:
BOTH the tiny public school district in Garrison and the even tinier home for troubled children can agree on this much: their relationship used to be cordial, but now it can be described only as in a state worse than tatters. Both sides are trying to outmaneuver the other, and each side has sharp words for the other. Meanwhile, the education of 22 children from troubled backgrounds, who arrived with little warning at the beginning of this school year in a district that has a little more than 400 students, hangs in the balance. 
 While the discussion continues, with charges and countercharges and accusations of racism and financial hardship, it is hard to see how the disagreement between the home for children, St. Basil Academy, a former Greek Orthodox residential school in Garrison, and the Garrison school district will be resolved amicably to the satisfaction of both sides. 
 Ellen Bergman, superintendent of the Garrison schools, said that the issue has put her in the most complicated bind. "It's just very difficult to be an advocate for children," she said, and to make sure education of all the children is carried out well. "On the other hand, as a superintendent I have a responsibility to the community and taxpayers on the issue of expenses," and spending so much money on children who should not be the district's responsibility, she said, is just unfair. 
The seeds of the disagreement appear to have been sown in 1997, when St. Basil, run by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, stopped educating children on its campus in Garrison, in Putnam County, but continued to house and feed the children. 
St. Basil tried to get the children into the Garrison public school, but was repeatedly rebuffed. The public school contended that the children, whose parents lived elsewhere, were not technically Garrison residents -- a contention upheld in residency hearings that the Garrison school said were legitimate and St. Basil said were a farce. 
In the meantime, the children from St. Basil attended the neighboring Highland Falls-Fort Montgomery Schools, but that arrangement ended earlier this year over the issue of unpaid tuition. 
In a letter dated May 21, 2003, Ned Kopald, school board president for the Highland Falls-Fort Montgomery Central School district, wrote to the Rev. Constantine Sitaras, the executive director of St. Basil, telling him that St. Basil students could no longer attend school there if St. Basil did not pay or make a firm financial agreement guaranteeing the payment of $236,757.37 in tuition. Speaking by phone recently, Mr. Kopald said that after that time in May, the debt rose to almost $300,000 and was paid down some, putting it at the current level of roughly $200,000. 
Mr. Sitaras said that St. Basil intends to pay the rest of the money. He said St. Basil has had trouble raising money since Sept. 11, 2001. But, in a decision he said was independent of the debt owed to the neighboring school district, he said he still preferred that the children attend school closer to St. Basil, in Garrison. 
 The Garrison school district accepts no tuition-paying students. No out-of-district students can come -- not even, Dr. Bergman said, the children of teachers. The restrictions are a result of the district's limited size, she said. 
On Aug. 26, just days before school started, Richard P. Mills, the state commissioner of education, reached a temporary decision that the education of the children of St. Basil was the responsibility of the Garrison schools. Some people in the Garrison school district, a tiny one that does not even have its own high school, were livid. 
"It's just not fair for a religious organization to pass the costs of its purpose on to the taxpayers," said Stan Freilich, the president of the Garrison school board. "They are putting a burden on the local taxpayers which belongs on taxpayers in the children's home district." 
"It's put a terrible strain on the special education system," he said. "We're unable to hire because the children were sent to us so close to school starting that all the good special education staff was already hired."
Dr. Bergman said that including legal fees of about $25,000, the presence of the St. Basil students will cost the district up to $450,000, a significant sum considering that its entire budget was $6.8 million. Officials are concerned that if St. Basil begins to admit as many students as it had in the past, when numbers could reach 100, the financial effect on the district could be catastrophic. 
Since the Garrison schools do not have a public high school, included in the school budget is tuition money to be paid to one of two local schools. Since one is Highland Falls, the St. Basil children who had been going there remained there. The only difference is that now Garrison, and not St. Basil, is paying the tuition bill. 
But Mr. Sitaras said a hit to the budget was not the determining factor in the outrage against the St. Basil children. Rather, he said, elitism, racism and selfishness were at play. 
"They're saying it is money," Mr. Sitaras said, "but it's because these are children from different parts of the country. And these are not all Popodopolises and Demetriuses. There are black kids. There are interracial children." 
BETSY CALHOUN, a former Garrison school board member, agreed. "Garrison has treated St. Basil extremely badly," she said. "Garrison is acting like a gated community. But we live in a big world. And because we are well-to-do and privileged, we can share." 
But Mr. Freilich said the charges of racism and elitism were an absurdity. "I have an adopted daughter," he said, "and she's the light of my life. But I chose to do it. We feel terrible, but just don't see it as our job," to educate the St. Basil children who, he added, are not foster children, who the district would be fully responsible for. 
The matter of St. Basil's mission is a concern of Sandra R. Galef, a state assemblywoman. "What kind of charter do they have?" she asked. Since they used to educate children, "they appear to be a school, but are they then a school with school choice? It's a very strange set-up. Are we setting up a rooming house?" 
The New York Office of Children and Family Services has had similar concerns, writing St. Basil a letter on Sept. 23, 2003, saying that since St. Basil was no longer operating a school, it needed an operating certificate from the Office of Children and Family Services. Mr. Sitaras said St. Basil is applying for certification. Kent Kisselbrack, a spokesman for the state office , said that the state has yet to receive an application from St. Basil. 
Meanwhile, Jonathan Burman, a spokesman for the State Department of Education, said judgments in residency cases are made "on a case by case basis."
In the middle of the stridency, ambivalence is hard, but not impossible, to come by. "I hate to say anything good about this," said Clare Cosslett, a parent in the district who does not support the commissioner's temporary decision to declare St. Basil students residents. "But dealing with kids who are different than they are: from the city, different ethnically, economically and with different experiences, does call on the children to rise to the occasion."

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
ON a recent Thursday afternoon, a handful of diners lingered over elegant dishes of poached salmon and shaved fennel in an airy exposed-brick restaurant called Zuppa. Nearby, the Hudson River lapped serenely at the edge of a new apartment building with a 24-hour health club and a swimming pool.
 A few blocks away, in the heart of southwest Yonkers, shoppers picked through children's coats in C.H. Martin's, a discount department store. Sale signs papered the display windows of Easy Pickins and 99 Cent Dreams. Up the hill is Mulford Gardens, a housing project built in 1939, where a fifth of all families live below the poverty level, more than triple the rate in Westchester County. 
 In many ways, Yonkers, the fourth-largest city in New York State, is a city that time forgot. As development boomed across Westchester in the 1990's, Yonkers languished, stained by corrupt politics and stinging accusations of racism. Downtown storefronts remained boarded up. Dollar stores did the bulk of the business in the impoverished area. 
But gradually, over the last year, Yonkers, Westchester County's largest city, has begun to re-emerge on the development map. Two new luxury apartment buildings have been built on the waterfront, just two blocks from Getty Square, the poorest Yonkers neighborhood. Zuppa, the city's first new white linen table-cloth restaurant in a long while, opened nearby. The city's long-traveling library was given a permanent home in a new glass building. 
"We're doing it," said Mayor John D. Spencer of Yonkers. "We're trying to take an area that for 30 years stagnated. It has never been done before. This is not the politics of old."
But as the mayor's office, fresh with success, prepares for more downtown projects, including a minor league baseball stadium, some locals are eyeing the plans nervously. Residents say they fear rising rents. They do not want local discount stores to be replaced by pricier national chains. And they do not want traffic from a stadium clogging their streets. A local property owner is even trying to block plans for the stadium in court, with a suit filed in State Supreme Court that challenges how the city is handling the stadium development.
"I think they are trying to get rid of the poor people," said Margaret Jessamy, 80, a cashier at C.H. Martin's, the discount department store, who has lived in the area since 1941. "They're trying to tell us to just go away. They want us to disappear."
In the economic logic of development, more businesses in an area means an improvement in the life of people there. Mayor Spencer argues that increased business activity from the ballpark, and higher wage earners in the new apartments, will ultimately boost tax revenues and improve the school system. Southwest Yonkers, depressed for years, would benefit from an infusion of higher-wage earners, he argues, and the stadium, which will include 110,000 square feet of retail space, will draw crowds of new spenders to the neighborhood. Development is a big issue in the current mayoral race, with the Republican candidate, Deputy Mayor Phil Amicone, a Spencer protege, pressing to continue the projects in his race against Joe L. Farmer, the former Yonkers school superintendent and a Democrat.
"We're looking to elevate people who live there, not move them out," Mayor Spencer said. 
But as development collides with the economics of poverty, maintaining that balance can be tricky. Development has swept across American cities over the last 20 years with a very mixed record of integration of poor and rich. Rising prices and rents often leave many longtime residents behind. 
"I don't care whether you're in Harlem or Westchester, if your area has been targeted by a developer, you're going to have these same things happening," said Nellie Bailey, head of the Harlem Tenants' Council. "The whole intent is to generate money, and you can't do that off of poor people."
Yonkers had a grand and prosperous past. It was a shopping hub in the 1940's, when traffic flowed on railroads and rivers instead of highways. The Broadway musical "Hello Dolly" tells the story of a prominent Yonkers businessman. A 19th-century artists' colony is now a leafy enclave on the city's eastern edge.
But in the 1960's, the demographics began to change, in part because of urban renewal programs in nearby areas that drove the poor to housing projects in Yonkers. According to the 1980 census, the mile-square area around Mulford Gardens contained 97.7 percent of the city's public housing and 80.7 percent of the city's minority population. Those families would later clash with the city's predominantly white local government.
"Yonkers was stagnant, a political mess for 20 or 30 years, while other cities were developing," said Mayor Spencer. "It had such a failed, failed record."
In the mid-1980's, the city of Yonkers announced an ambitious plan to revitalize its Hudson River waterfront. Six luxury apartment high-rises were expected to bring life back to the depressed area. An abandoned power station would be transformed into condominiums. 
The plans quickly unraveled several years later, when an emotional and public battle over school desegregation turned Yonkers into a poster child for dysfunctional local government.
IT was not the city's first false start. The earliest plans for redevelopment date to 1953. One attempt at waterfront renewal was heralded by setting white Roman-style colonnades into the facade of a downtown building. The columns were later assailed as tacky and were ripped out. The development never began. The stately Carnegie Library was torn down to widen a road, and the books were stashed, for 18 years, in a building that was once a department store.
In those years of stagnation, the quality of life for residents steadily declined. Neighborhoods in the area became infested with drugs. In Nodine Hill, a hilly neighborhood of old two-family homes, frequent fires left empty, burned out lots, giving the area a look of a jaw with knocked-out teeth. Street violence in the area tormented parents, who feared for their children's lives. 
Random gunfire last year claimed the life of the daughter of Julio and Alba Guzman, immigrants from El Salvador. Late one afternoon, as the toddler lay on her parents' bed watching a Winnie the Pooh video, the crack of an explosion and shattered glass shook the room. A neighbor with a high-power rifle had been shooting target practice from his window and missed, hitting the toddler in the head. She died on the way to the hospital.
"It's dangerous here," said Mr. Guzman, who last month moved his family into a small, new home in a different neighborhood, built by Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit group. "It was an accident, but that kind of accident should never have happened. We can never feel safe here." 
Downtown development can help heal those social ills, argues Edward A. Sheeran, head of the city's Industrial Development Agency. The agency estimates that about $600 million in new investment has been added to the economy since the development began, along with a substantial number of new jobs. Graffiti has been scrubbed from the sides of buildings. Small banners fly from lamp posts and a colorful mural has been painted across the side of formerly forlorn downtown walls. 
"In 1997, we couldn't even get the developers to stop in Yonkers for a cup of coffee," he said. "It used to be you couldn't give away waterfront property. Now it's worth $1.1 million an acre."
For Mr. Sheeran, rising rents, at least in commercial spaces, mean progress. But for the area's residents, it is a frightening new fact of life. For decades, southwest Yonkers was a last-resort area in an otherwise pricey county. Housing prices in Westchester have more than doubled since 1997, with the median home price at $530,000 from about $175,000. 
Peter Smith, director of municipal housing in Yonkers, called the situation in the county a "housing crisis." A 1997 home ownership program for residents of public housing never got off the ground because of climbing prices, he said. In all the city has 2,609 apartments for low-income people and another 1,700 apartments are currently accepting Section 8 certificates, federal housing subsidies paid to landlords. The waiting list for public housing is between 1,000 and 1,200 families. Another 70 to 80 families a year receive rent and mortgage subsidies. The waiting list for those subsidies is about 1,500 families.
"In Westchester, there's a large population in need of affordable housing," said Mr. Smith. "Incomes here just have not gone up in any way, shape or form, commensurate with rents."
Valerie Perez, 39, and her mother and sister moved to Yonkers last year, after their landlord in Sleepy Hollow sold their $900-a-month two-bedroom apartment. Their search led them to several different towns. They even saw apartments without bathrooms. Many landlords would not consider their application because Ms. Perez, who formerly worked entering data in the county clerk's office, is unemployed. Her sister, Salome, cleans apartments and baby-sits. Their apartment is on the edge of the proposed baseball stadium site.
"We don't know where to go," said Ms. Perez, standing with a mug of instant coffee in her small kitchen. "Rents are changing so dramatically. We have found them astronomical. It's a very scary thing."
But it would be hard to argue that in southwest Yonkers, nothing should change. Jonathan Rose, chairman of board of the Greyston Foundation, which has financed the construction of about 150 low-rent apartments in Yonkers, argued that drawing bigger wage-earners to the area was the best hope for progress among longtime residents. Mr. Rose, who is also president of Jonathan Rose Companies, a developer based in Katonah, has bid for a large site on the Yonkers waterfront, just north of the new luxury apartments. 
"It's not the gentrification that's bad, it's the lack of income diversity," he said. "When rents are low, building values are low and taxes are low. Communities find it hard to dig out. Having only low rents is condemning people who live in those communities to having low services and underfunded schools. It doesn't help their kids move forward."
The stadium has raised a great deal of opposition from people who say it is a good idea in the wrong place, that it would be too hard to get to, and that the project too much a mix of goals. In all, the stadium would displace families in about 16 apartments, a relatively small number as development goes. The site spans four city blocks, and will stand on land that is now occupied by about 20 small businesses. Some want to sell out, Mr. Sheeran said. Others, including a women's clothing store, Suzy's Fashions, a photo developing service and C.H. Martin's, the discount department store that opened in 1979, have dug in to fight the development.
"Show me a plan," said Martin D. Goldman, owner of C.H. Martin Company, a New Jersey-based chain of discount stores. "They're not telling us anything."
He added: "I employ 35 people year round and 50 people during Christmas. I pay taxes."
Mr. Martin said the city has yet to tell the businesses their new location or the rent they will have to pay. Others criticized the city for offering economic incentives and tax breaks to the new developers. The waterfront apartments, for example, are owned by Collins Enterprises, based in Stamford, Conn., which bought the land at about a fifth of the market rate, and made a one-time payment that exempted the project from up to 12 years of property taxes, said Arthur Collins, president of the company.
Debra Cohen, a lawyer representing the small businesses opposed to the project, said: "People who live and work in southwest Yonkers feel like they're disposable, like they're yesterday's garbage. Do you really think the best philosophy of economic development is clearing the city out block by block or are you better trying to blend the old and the new?" 
The administration said it was working hard to accommodate current business owners. Mr. Sheeran acknowledged that no specific locations or rents had been discussed, but that is because the developer has not yet been chosen. 
"We're not coming in with bulldozers and disrespecting the life of the people," said Mayor Spencer. "We want all the businesses in the area." 
Many see the stadium as the city's last hope to draw big retail to downtown. In an emotional debate about the stadium at a recent City Council meeting, a council member, Gordon A. Burrows, compared Yonkers with White Plains, its neighbor and Westchester's capital. White Plains is experiencing a boom in its downtown in an aggressive development push led by the city's mayor. Downtown Yonkers, far from the highway, and bound on one side by the Hudson River, should instead fasten its hopes for economic progress on the stadium, he said.
YONKERS housing advocates, however, do not have fond memories of past development in White Plains. An urban renewal program there in the 1960's and 70's, drove many of the lower income residents out of the city into Yonkers, said Mr. Smith. It was the exodus from White Plains, many argue, that helped make the early problems for Yonkers.
"I'm afraid of a repeat of White Plains," said Lisa Best, a community advocate and resident of Mulford Gardens. "If you don't have the economics to keep up with the pace of the city, you'll be forced out."
Blending the old with the new will indeed be the biggest challenge for planners in Yonkers. Kennedy Smith, director of the National Main Street Center, a Washington-based nonprofit group that helps communities revitalize, said planning by city administrations is the key to success. While the vast majority of development in the last several decades has pushed out longtime residents, more recently, preserving the present has become part of the planning process.
"Ten years ago, no one recognized that it was a problem," said Ms. Smith. "It just seemed like, 'Great, new investment is coming in."'
Ms. Smith cited neighborhoods in Washington and Hollywood, where urban renewal has been inclusive, with loan and grant funds available to help existing businesses stay where they are.
"The most common mistake is dealing with these problems too late," Ms. Smith said, "after market forces have already transformed the district." 
Harlem, where urban renewal has been booming for several years, is a case in point. Ms. Bailey, of the Harlem Tenants' Council, said development in Harlem raced ahead so fast that it left the poorest -- those it had initially been intended to help -- worse off. Local leaders, she said, put little thought or preparation into how to help the poor.
"More landlords in newly gentrified neighborhoods are getting rid of people who can't afford to pay the rising rents," said Ms. Bailey. "It's almost politically incorrect to talk about them. The black leadership in Harlem simply takes the view that you are holding up progress."
It remains to be seen how development in Yonkers will proceed. As the neighborhood waits and watches, the process marches forward. On a recent Thursday at 5 p.m., a band of residents, property owners and journalists sat on wooden benches in the City Council viewing galley. Ms. Perez sat with her sister. Mr. Goldman, dressed in a gray suit and gold-colored tie, reclined slightly, his left arm slung over the bench's high back. Council members were meeting to vote on whether to allow the mayor to begin the eminent domain process for the stadium. Of the six members present, two voted "no" -- those from the districts that would be directly affected by the building of the stadium. 
"I live with the people who live and shop here," said Symra D. Brandon, one of the representatives who opposed the stadium, in a passionate address to fellow council members. "They don't frequent the Gap or high-end stores. There has to be some sort of a mix. Think about the people who live here."

Home Prices Jump and Housing Stock Dives
HOUSING is everything, and in Westchester County, where million-dollar homes and sparkling swimming pools abound, the lack of it can seem all the more galling.
In Yonkers, New York State's fourth-largest city, the waiting list for public housing is between 1,000 and 1,200 people long, according to the city's housing department. Another 1,500 people are waiting for rent subsidies set up by a late 1980's federal order. In recent years, the wait has become more pressing, as housing prices in Westchester exploded. The median cost of a home has ballooned to $530,000, from about $175,000 in 1997, according to the Yonkers-based Century 21 Fortunato Realtors, Inc. 
"It's a crazy market, it's never been like this," said Ruba Marji, who handles rentals for the company. "Southwest Yonkers is still the cheapest area," but "rents for working people are not easy."
With incomes rising at a much slower pace, buying a home has become all but impossible for most working-class families, said Peter Smith, head of the Municipal Housing Authority for the city of Yonkers. Residents with incomes below $50,000 can no longer cover down payments required for the purchase of a home. In 2002, just three low-income families were able to put down payments on houses.
"The rents here are getting to the level where many are getting priced out of the market," said Mr. Smith. "For a young couple just starting out or for families trying to move up, owning a house is becoming an impossible dream."
A 1986 federal housing order to desegregate Yonkers neighborhoods added about 1,000 housing units, apartments and stand-alone homes, to this city of about 200,000. Though the order did not solve the housing problem for the poor, it does help between 70 and 80 families a year with rent or down payment subsidies, said Rose Noonan, who heads the Housing Action Council, the agency set up by the federal order.
Four years in a row, Mr. Smith's office has applied and been rejected for a federal grant, to resettle families from the 550 apartments in Mulford Gardens, which, built in the late 1930's, is one of the oldest housing projects in the country and has become increasingly run down and costly to maintain.
A move to more modern, even slightly more expensive apartment, would be difficult for many single mothers. One Mulford Gardens resident, Shawn Parker, 34, a mother of two, who works in the cafeteria at a school, said she could not afford to pay the electric bill, which in public housing is covered, but in subsidized housing, often is not.
Some local housing experts argue that the real problem with housing is for the middle class, who do not qualify for housing aid. Charity organizations have helped increase the stock of affordable housing in Yonkers. The Greyston Foundation, a nonprofit group, recently opened an affordable building for artists. Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit group, recently finished several two-family houses, for low-income families. Sabrina Tavernise

HEADLINE: Another Chance For Bridgeport 

BYLINE:  By AVI SALZMAN

 BODY:
IF you asked Rick Torres, Bridgeport's downhill slide started with P.T. Barnum, the city's most notorious huckster. Mr. Torres, who is running for mayor in a town struggling to move past a massive municipal corruption scandal, said Barnum's legacy was still alive in City Hall.
 "That's when we lost respect for ourselves," Mr. Torres said recently as he drove by the statue of P.T. Barnum in Seaside Park. "That's our terribly noble beginnings. 'There's a sucker born every minute."' 
 Those are bold words in a city that treats Barnum as if he were indeed still alive, holding a citywide party in his honor every year that goes on for months. But it has come to this in Bridgeport, where even the revered Barnum, once a mayor of the city himself, has been dragged into a political scandal that residents hope to put behind them in this Tuesday's mayoral election. 
"The people of Bridgeport are obviously quite embarrassed by the prosecution of Mr. Ganim," Dr. Gary Rose, chairman of the political science department at Sacred Heart University, said, referring to former Mayor Joseph P. Ganim. "I think this is a turning point in the history of Bridgeport. In some respects the citizens will know where they stand after this election. Are they ready to move beyond this scandal?"
Mr. Torres, 44, is playing Tom Thumb in this particular political sideshow. As a Republican in a city with six times as many registered Democrats as Republicans, he faces an uphill battle to dislodge the current occupant of the mayor's office, John M. Fabrizi. Mr. Fabrizi, 46, was City Council president while Mr. Ganim was trading bribes for city contracts.
After he replaced Mr. Ganim, who is serving nine years in federal prison, Mr. Fabrizi took steps to make City Hall more transparent. In the past six months, he has restored the ethics commission, tightened the bidding process for city contracts and sold off the lavish oriental rugs and sports utility vehicle that were symbols of Mr. Ganim's excess. But to Mr. Torres and his supporters, Mr. Fabrizi is a product of the same corrupt Democratic machine that anointed his predecessor.
On Tuesday, Bridgeport voters will decide who will lead them into the future. Political observers agreed that it will probably be the tightest mayoral race in more than a decade. It has already begun to split Bridgeport's Democrats, with many longtime party faithful vowing to vote Republican. In some ways, the election is a referendum on city corruption. Mr. Ganim's shadow still hangs over this debate.
But there's a lot on the minds of Bridgeport voters these days, including failing schools, high property tax rates, and a struggling economy -- the city has the second-highest unemployment rate in the state. Those issues, as much as City Hall's dark past, will loom large on Election Day.
Take Jennifer Nunez. Mrs. Nunez is a 27-year-old waitress at the New Colony II Diner at the corner of Main and Charles streets, an intersection with the kind of flavor that typifies Bridgeport's ethnic middle class.
Ms. Nunez is terrified that she won't have the money to send her 2-year-old son to Catholic school. Bridgeport's public schools are struggling. On last year's Connecticut Academic Performance Test, only about 5 percent of the city's high school sophomores mastered reading, writing, math and science. More than 50 percent were deficient in reading and almost 75 percent were deficient in math.
"If I can't afford to send my kids to Catholic school, I'll move out of Bridgeport," she said.
And Mrs. Nunez said she had trouble believing that Mr. Fabrizi didn't know anything about the backroom deals made during Mr. Ganim's administration.
"Everyone knew. Come on," Ms. Nunez said with obvious disgust.Mrs. Nunez said she thought that Mr. Torres can galvanize the city's growing immigrant population and restore integrity to City Hall. The fast-talking waitress, who was constantly kidding with her elderly customers as she served them their whole wheat toast and jelly, said she heard a lot of people grumbling about Mr. Fabrizi.
But walk across the street to Howell's West Indian Grocery and you'll hear a different story.
The Jamaican-born owner, Harris H. Howell, said the city had become a better place to live since he arrived here 17 years ago.
"Believe me, in 17 years, it's the best I've ever seen it, especially with crime," he said.
Mr. Howell and his customers give some of that credit to Mr. Ganim, who helped the city restore its finances after it almost went bankrupt in the 1990's. Mr. Howell, who has appreciated Mr. Fabrizi's initial moves to lower property taxes, said he will vote to keep him in office.
"I don't know much about Torres," he said. "I know about Fabrizi. He's been in this position for six months. I think he carries his weight. Maybe Torres is a good guy, but I just go by what I know."
At the karate school across the street, called Martial Arts Against Drugs, familiarity also works in Mr. Fabrizi's favor. Martin Chisholm, the owner, is the kind of youth leader who hugs kids on the street and yells at them as they drive by. He worked in security at Central High School when Mr. Fabrizi was an administrator there.
"When you knew him in the school system, he really knew how to relate to the parents and the children," he said.
Mr. Chisholm said Mr. Fabrizi seemed to share his civic spirit.
"He's a Bridgeporter," he said. "It appears that he's community-conscious."
Both Mr. Fabrizi and Mr. Torres said internal polls showed the race was swinging their way, with Mr. Fabrizi slightly more optimistic than his competitor. Political observers gave Mr. Torres a fighting chance in this race. Though Bridgeport, the state's largest city, has 31,766 registered Democrats, as compared to 5,157 Republicans, there are also 14,804 unaffiliated voters in the mix. And many Democrats have professed their support for Mr. Torres as the race heated up. Less than 35 percent of Democrats voted for Mr. Fabrizi in the primary.
Dr. Rose, who is also an adviser to the students' Republican Party club at Sacred Heart, said he had seen Torres signs on lots of Democrats' lawns lately. Students working on Mr. Torres' campaign said the race had drawn interest from national Republican leaders. Mr. Torres, of Cuban descent, is the kind of Hispanic candidate, Mr. Rose said, that can tilt that ethnic group toward the Republicans.
"There's a lot more to this than just winning this race," he said. "This has symbolic importance nationally. Republicans are courting the Hispanic vote around the country."
Mr. Torres, who grew up in public housing here and was a "long-haired liberal" at Washington University in St. Louis in the early 1980's, has distanced himself from "George Bush" Republicans. He's worried he won't pick up votes from poorer residents because of his party affiliation. He switched to the Republican Party a few years ago, he said, because "good Democrats can't win in Bridgeport."
"Frankly, I don't think I'm going to get the poor's vote, because of the 'R' next to my name," he said while touring the site of his childhood home, the Evergreen Garden Apartments. The housing project has since been condemned and weeds have taken over the lot where he used to play baseball. Mr. Torres has been criticized by the opposition for basing his campaign on negativity, and he has indeed hammered home his case on municipal corruption.
But Mr. Torres, who lives in the Black Rock section of the city and owns a market there, has a vision for Bridgeport. In his campaign headquarters he has posted architectural drawings on the walls, illustrating his ideas for submerging the train tracks that split the city and for building a futuristic high school focused around botany and a college prep curriculum. When he drives around the city, he can point at the images that he said have brought Bridgeport down: the sewage treatment plants and garbage dumps on the waterfront, the decaying housing projects standing just a few hundred yards from the beach, the empty lots on the city's East End filled with discarded bottles and rusted car parts.In the weeks leading up to the campaign, the political debate has grown fierce. Mr. Torres and his supporters cried foul when they found out Mr. Fabrizi's brother obtained $1 million worth of landscaping work with the city through an expedited contracting process. Mr. Fabrizi said those contracts, doled out before he became mayor, were awarded in small increments over a number of years and had nothing to do with favoritism. Nonetheless, he has eliminated the program that allowed the city to award contracts without the traditional bidding process.
Mr. Torres, meanwhile, had to explain a bankruptcy and 12-year-old bad check arrest to voters, prompting criticism from the Fabrizi campaign.
Since he took office on April 7, Mr. Fabrizi has continually stressed his commitment to ridding municipal government of Mr. Ganim's legacy. Mr. Fabrizi said he never knew what Mr. Ganim was up to and that "if it wasn't for five years of F.B.I. wiretaps, no one would know."
Now, only two staffers from the Ganim administration remain in the mayor's office, a legislative aideand a secretary, said Caryn S. Kaufman, the community liaison for Mr. Fabrizi.
The house cleaning didn't stop there. Under pressure from Mr. Fabrizi and other local and state Democrats, Mario Testa, Bridgeport's Democratic Party chairman, stepped down late last month. Mr. Testa was repeatedly criticized for his close ties to Mr. Ganim and the party wanted to shift the focus of the campaign, Mr. Fabrizi said. The controversy over Mr. Testa's position was splitting the party, he said.
Jacqueline M. Cocco, a Democratic state representative from Bridgeport, said she was one of the people who wanted Mr. Testa to leave. Now, she said, she felt certain that the party had washed its hands of Mr. Ganim's misdeeds.
"I think Mario Testa stepping down is something that will bring us together," she said during a visit to Mr. Fabrizi's campaign headquarters.
Democrats, Mr. Fabrizi emphasized, had to stand together to thwart the Republican challenger.
"The race is between a Democrat and a Republican," he said. "The race is between a Democratic agenda and principles and a Republican agenda and principles."
But the Democratic Party has been showing some fault lines. Dr. Don Greenberg, a political science professor at Fairfield University who described himself as a staunch Democrat, has publicly derided Mr. Fabrizi. Dr. Greenberg had a novel approach to saving Bridgeport's Democratic Party.
"One of the ways we can get back is by electing, unfortunately, a Republican," Dr. Greenberg said.
That, he said, might force the Democratic Party to reform.
Chris Caruso, 44, a Democratic state representative from Bridgeport, was the mayor's most ardent detractor. Mr. Caruso ran a bitter campaign for the mayor's seat against Mr. Fabrizi and lost the Democratic primary by just a few hundred votes.
Since the primary ended, he has continued his verbal attacks on the mayor. Mr. Caruso hasn't endorsed Mr. Torres, but his vitriolic speeches are obviously upsetting the Democratic Party faithful. Mr. Fabrizi's supporters say Mr. Caruso is sore about the loss and is acting out his frustration by ranting. They also claim he is an opportunist, already looking ahead to the 2007 mayor's race.
Mr. Caruso holds court at a Friendly's restaurant in a strip mall on the north end of the city, sitting in a rear booth. The waitresses all know him, as do many of the customers. Over a cup of decaffeinated tea one day recently, Mr. Caruso said it was time to take the party leaders on.
"People should not be fooled by them," he said. "There's deep-rooted corruption. You don't clean the house by washing the drapes."
While he was talking, friends and supporters walked up.
A Republican who is friendly with Mr. Caruso's mother stopped by to chat. She said Mr. Torres had a good chance and thanked Mr. Caruso for keeping the heat on Mr. Fabrizi.
Then Edgardo Perez stopped by Mr. Caruso's table to tell him he liked what he said on the radio the day before. Mr. Perez, a Dominican father of three, is unaffiliated with a party, but usually votes Democrat. He said he planned to vote for Mr. Torres. He wanted City Hall completely dismantled.
"I was telling my wife, I want to see the janitors changed at City Hall," he said, laughing. "If the regime in there wins again, I might move out. You just don't see a bright future in this city."

HEADLINE: Energy to Burn 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WHEN the carmakers Nissan, Renault, Hyundai and BMW wanted to investigate the feasibility of using fuel cells to power automobiles, they came to Connecticut.
 When Verizon wanted to install fuel cells as a reliable source of power for its call routing hub on Long Island, it came to Connecticut. 
 A data processing center in Germany uses fuel cells from the state, as does a brewery in Montana, a hotel in New Jersey and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
"Obviously, Connecticut is the cradle of fuel cell development," said Michael T. Kirk, a spokesman for Representative John B. Larson, a Democrat from Connecticut, who sponsored a forum on the industry last spring. "The congressman's view is that it's critical we in Connecticut work to maintain our status as the leaders of an incredibly important technology." 
Fuel cells generate energy through an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. Because the fuel is not burned, there are none of the emissions associated with conventional power plants.
In the 1960's, a United Technologies Corporation plant in South Windsor began making fuel cells for the Apollo space missions. Today, the company has installed 255 large commercial fuel cells in 19 different countries and is producing 25 to 30 new ones every year.
Connecticut is now home to three of the largest fuel cell companies in the world. Besides United Technologies, there are Fuel Cell Energy Inc. in Danbury and Proton Energy Systems in Wallingford.
Smaller companies are starting to spring up as well, such as Nxegen in Middletown and GenCell Corporation in Southbury.
"It's a technology that has been struggling for years," said John Carbone, the chief operating officer at Nxegen. "But it's been developed to the point where it's right on the verge of being a commercial technology."
The state Department of Economic Development and Community Development estimated that $300 million worth of fuel cell products have been manufactured and shipped from Connecticut, more than any other state. While the industry is still small, with some 1,400 employees in the state so far, the figure still represents more than one-third of the people working on fuel cells in North America.
In addition, the largest fuel cell installation in the world is in Connecticut, a 1.2 megawatt generating complex -- enough energy to supply more than 1,000 typical homes -- at the Connecticut Juvenile Training Center in Middletown, constructed by United Technologies. 
The Connecticut Clean Energy Fund has backed $10 million of fuel cell installations in the state. Fuel cells are an energy source that is efficient, reliable and environmentally friendly, and also represent perhaps the next wave of technology, said Arthur H. Diedrick, executive director of the state agency.
"We have purposely tried to make Connecticut the fuel cell capital of the world," Mr. Diedrick said. "When you look at the whole picture, I don't think we're making any false claims."
In addition to the private companies already here and the investment in fuel cell installations as demonstration projects, the state has established the Connecticut Global Fuel Cell Center at the University of Connecticut to work with industry to develop the technology.
"A lot of investors are calling Connecticut the 'next Silicon Valley' because of its role in this emerging technology," said Bryan T. Garcia, program director at the Clean Energy Fund. "This small state has a real global role to play in this issue."
The federal government has pledged $1.7 billion in fuel cell research over the next five years, and some state officials say Connecticut is poised to capture a large share of the funds.
First Selectman Paul B. Eccard, of Waterford, has proposed taking advantage of some of the energy experience of Dominion Connecticut, which operates the Millstone nuclear power complex in his town, to develop a fuel cell research center in town, possibly at a now-defunct airport.
"A lot of other areas of the world are moving very fast on this to bring down the cost per kilowatt hour, and we've been a town that has been big on energy technology since the 1960's, so I think this is a perfect fit," Mr. Eccard said.
Mr. Eccard said he had been talking to Russian leaders he met through an exchange program, who are interested in doing collaborative research. He said they were interested in the potential to use fuel cells in remote sections of their country where there is an abundance of natural resources, but no electricity infrastructure.
"I'm really just trying to act as a go-between between the two sides," Mr. Eccard said. "There's a lot of potential for electric delivery capability right out of here, and we need to keep the communication open."
Mr. Garcia said that government studies were starting to take into account the impact of fuel cells on some of the gases associated with global warming, particularly the carbon dioxide associated with combustion.
"For the first time we're projecting a dip in greenhouse gas emissions, which is a significant development," he said. 
The industry is attracting a significant amount of attention. Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister, has asked Connecticut to participate in the United Kingdom Carbon Trust because of its expertise in fuel cells. Over the last couple of months, international missions from Finland and Germany have visited the state for consultations, said Subhash Chandra, a technology officer for the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund.
"It's not just the number of projects here, it's the quality of projects, and the quality of the data that we are able to collect, which is going to help advance the technology," Mr. Chandra said.
Fuel cells are efficient and also whisper quiet.
"Our electrical efficiencies are in the 45 to 47 percent range, then when you talk about the byproduct heat that's available in cogeneration plants, the combined heat and electrical efficiency is greater than 70 percent," said Steven P. Eschbach, director of investor relations for FuelCell Energy in Danbury, which has delivered 20 commercial fuel cells in the last year all over the world. "An old-fashioned combustion plant in the same size range might be 25 to 30 percent."
Another advantage of fuel cells is that they can be set up quickly to service areas that might not be serviced by utility lines. Peter F. Dalpe, a spokesman for United Technologies, said that when power requirements grew at the police station in Central Park in New York City, it was going to cost $1 million to put in a new electrical line, and it would have required ripping up a large portion of the park. A fuel cell, installed for about the same cost, required no construction off the police station grounds.
Mr. Dalpe said the cost of a fuel cell was prohibitive in locations that are served by utility wires, but as the technology gets better and more units are made, the cost will come down. And research is continuing into providing small fuel cells as a mobile power source, for everything from hand-held video games to automobiles.
A Hyundai spokesman, Alfred E. Gloddeck, said that United Technologies' experience with fuel cells dating to the early days of the Apollo program was what drew the Korean automaker to Connecticut. 
"I always say, 'if it's good enough for the space program, it's good enough for Hyundai,"' Mr. Gloddeck said.
Hyundai expects to have some small fleets of fuel cell-powered automobiles in use as early as next year.
"These will all be prototype vehicles," Mr. Gloddeck said. "For general transportation, just general passenger transportation, we think the fuel cell has enormous potential. That's our goal, but there is still the question of how long before we get there, because we want to do this right."

HEADLINE: WORTH NOTING; 
Franklin Home Is Revived To Reflect the Town's Past

BYLINE:  By GAIL BRACCIDIFERRO

 BODY:
A $1 million restoration project that will enable a home owned by a Civil War physician to be opened as a historical museum is expected to be completed next year in Franklin.
 "At first there wasn't a whole lot of faith this would get done," said Bruce Dougherty, chairman of the museum's board of directors. 
 Those feelings dissolved last fall after the town secured two $500,000 grants from the state Department of Economical Development, he said. The building should be open to the public by August, he added.
The museum project began about five years ago when the state Department of Environmental Protection, which previously owned the house as part of a wildlife study site, decided to sell the property. The town of Franklin bought the house in December 2000, Richard L. Matters, the first selectman, said.
Perched on a Route 32 hillside, the house was both home and office to Ashbel Woodward, a Bowdoin College graduate who was a physician in the region for many years. When he was nearly 60 years old, Dr. Woodward went to the Civil War's front lines as a surgeon with the 26th Connecticut Regiment.
Leonard Baum, the Cranston, R.I. architect working on the project, said crews should finish work on the 1824 Greek Revival Ashbel Woodward house by June 1.
The museum will be staffed by volunteers and will display artifacts from the town's history. One room will likely depict a 19th-century town clerk's office, Mr. Matters said. GAIL BRACCIDIFERRO

Helping the Economy, One Snip at a Time

BYLINE:  By Joseph P. Fried; This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
To loyal patrons of her hair salons, Santa Cruz offers what they desire in cutting, coloring, curling and combing. To New York City officials, Ms. Cruz offers what they desire in jobs and tax revenues.
 Ms. Cruz, 45, owns a salon business that she began two decades ago by borrowing $20,000 from people close to her to pay for three styling chairs, plumbing and small former gift shop on East 23rd Street in Manhattan. She was, for a time, the one-person staff. 
 She has since built up a business with three locations and 15 employees, an expansion that involved moving to larger space on Madison Avenue near 27th Street a dozen years ago, and later opening two smaller operations in office buildings. 
Ms. Cruz says she wants her business to grow still more, despite bouts of anxiety she has experienced over the years while increasing revenues from about $30,000 in her first full year, 1981, to $320,000 last year. 
"I was afraid of taking on more employees, of failing," she said recently at her main location, Salon Santa Cruz, at 66 Madison Avenue, where walls of mirrors on stainless steel cabinet doors provide a setting that Ms. Cruz calls modishly minimalist. "If you want to grow, that's where the stress is."
At a time when the local job scene is anything but bright -- the city's unemployment rate is 8.8 percent -- officials can only hope that Ms. Cruz and other small-business owners prosper or expand.
The State Labor Department said that 192,000 businesses in the city had fewer than 20 workers as of Dec. 31, 2002, the date of the agency's most recent statistics, and that they employed close to 700,000 people, nearly a quarter of the city's private-sector jobholders. So success for Ms. Cruz and the battalions of business owners like her is a prime ingredient for a healthy local economy.
Over the last several years, Ms. Cruz said recently, she has provided about $200,000 a year in wages to that economy through a payroll of $3,500 to $4,000 a week covering about a dozen employees, most of whom work four days a week or fewer. 
Both of her smaller salons are concessions. One is in an office building at Madison Avenue and 24th Street and serves employees there of the investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston. The other, which Ms. Cruz opened several weeks ago, is in a building in Long Island City, Queens, and caters to employees of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which occupies the site.
Ms. Cruz said her expansion dreams were much larger: to someday have salons throughout the country. 
Raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Ms. Cruz left Hunter College after two years when a summer receptionist job with Glemby International, a beauty salon chain, attracted her to the business. 
After cosmetology school, she spent two and a half years managing a Queens salon for Glemby, then struck out on her own.
Her brother, an electrician, and her brother-in-law, a carpenter, helped set up the shop on Madison Avenue.
The federal Small Business Administration and the Women's Venture Fund, a nonprofit group, have provided $90,000 in loans in recent years to replace old equipment, redecorate and fill other needs. The new decor was important, Ms. Cruz said, to appeal to the "sophisticated crowd" moving into her area, near Madison Square Park. 
Ms. Cruz has taken other steps to increase her clientele.
"A lot of hairdressers are not interested in curly hair because straight hair is easier," she said. 
Her shop deals extensively with curly hair, she said, adding, "If you're skilled with curly hair, you don't have to turn down a lot of black people and Latino people." Ms. Cruz estimates that a third of her patrons are black or Hispanic.
Over all, she said, "we're holding our own" in the weak economy.
"If I go home with $50,000 at the end of the year, I'm real happy," said Ms. Cruz, who lives in Queens with her two children, 11 and 13, and a husband who sells municipal bonds. 
But money is not her only motive.
"I think working for someone else," she said, "would be terribly boring."

Stocks Log Best Week in Almost a Month

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Stocks had their best week in nearly a month, helped by a merger, healthy earnings reports and the biggest quarterly increase in economic output since the mid-1980's. 
 Bank of America surprised analysts and delighted holders of FleetBoston Financial shares when it made an unexpected, $47 billion all-stock offer for Fleet, the leading bank in New England. 
 Earnings reports generally pleased investors. And the preliminary report on third-quarter growth, which showed that the gross domestic product grew at a 7.2 percent annual rate, was much higher than most economists had expected. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 218.66, or 2.3 percent, to 9,801.12. Hewlett-Packard and Alcoa both rose by more than 8 percent. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 21.80, or 2.1 percent, to a high of 1,050.71. FleetBoston had the best performance in the index, up more than 27 percent. Bank of America fell 7.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite index rose 66.62, or 3.6 percent, to 1,932.21. 
 The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose to 4.30 percent, up from 4.23 percent a week ago. KENNETH N. GILPIN

HEADLINE: Vote May Tilt San Francisco Rightward 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
As Willie Brown's era as mayor of this famously liberal city winds down, the candidate with the best chance to succeed him is a young politician who made his name with a tough-minded drive to crack down on the homeless.
 The politician, Gavin Newsom, a wealthy entrepreneur and member of the city's Board of Supervisors who has been praised and pilloried for trying to sweep panhandlers off the streets, leads by about 20 points in the polls going into Tuesday's election. 
 The 36-year-old Democrat sponsored a ballot measure last year to reduce the city's generous cash grants for the homeless and instead guarantee them shelter and food.
His "Care Not Cash" measure passed with nearly 60 percent of the vote, and while a judge eventually overturned most of it, Proposition N showed Mr. Newsom to be more in tune with the mood in post-dot-com San Francisco than his critics. 
"I think he has struck a chord that people have heard," said Jim Chappell, executive director of the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association. "We continue to be a very compassionate city, but people are getting sick and tired of the chaos on the streets."
Mr. Newsom has backing from powerful Democrats, including Mr. Brown, Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, but he has been a lightning rod for the city's hard-core liberals, who scoff at his privileged upbringing and his aristocratic bearing.
The son of a retired, politically connected state appeals court judge, Mr. Newsom got his start in business with financial backing from Gordon Getty, a billionaire who is a family friend. His ventures include a fancy wine store, a Lake Tahoe hotel, several restaurants and a Napa winery. Mr. Newsom and his wife, Kimberly Guilfoyle Newsom, a former model and prosecutor who provides legal commentary for CNN, live in a $3 million Pacific Heights home they bought with Mr. Getty's help.
"People react negatively to Gavin because he represents an economic class that is a minority class," said Ross Mirkarimi, a spokesman for the president of the Board of Supervisors, Matt Gonzalez, who is the Green Party candidate for mayor. "There is a Grey Poupon set that gets really excited about him."
None of the nine mayoral candidates, Mr. Newsom included, possesses the star power of Mr. Brown, who served two terms as mayor after a long career as the powerful speaker of the California Assembly, and used his influence to help get the city's baseball stadium and other big public works projects built.
Despite Mr. Newsom's wide lead in the polls and in fund-raising, odds are that no candidate will get the 50 percent of the vote needed on Tuesday to win the mayor's job outright. Instead, a runoff will probably have to be held five weeks later.
Mr. Newsom's strongest rivals are four current or former supervisors, all to his left politically. Besides Mr. Gonzalez, 38, they are three Democrats: Tom Ammiano, 61, a longtime activist; Angela Alioto, 54, a civil rights lawyer who is the blunt-spoken daughter of a beloved former mayor; and Susan Leal, 54, the city treasurer.
"There are so many running on the left, it has prevented any of them from gaining the momentum to focus the race on Newsom instead of themselves," said a pollster, David Binder.
Early on, most assumed the race would be between Mr. Newsom and Mr. Ammiano.
In 1999, Mr. Ammiano forced Mr. Brown into a runoff with a last-minute write-in campaign. But Mr. Ammiano's candidacy seems to have fallen flat this time.
"There is a lot to be said for timing in public life, and Tom was definitely the right voice at the right time in 1999," said Mark Leno, a Democratic state assemblyman who supports Ms. Leal.
Mr. Binder said he thinks that if Mr. Newsom becomes mayor, it will not mean that San Francisco has abandoned its liberal ideals so much as tempered them to be in tune with tough economic times brought on by the bursting of the Internet bubble.

HEADLINE: China's Factories Aim to Fill Garages Around the World 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
China, long a nation of pedestrians, cyclists and buses, is undergoing an automobile revolution. Sales of cars, vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles here overtook similar sales in Germany this year, and production surpassed South Korea's.
 For now, most of the cars and light trucks made here are sold here. But China -- already the world's dominant manufacturer of products from toys to facsimile machines to furniture -- is laying plans to become a big exporter of cars. Automakers are producing cars here to the same designs that they use in the United States, with Honda making Accords in Guangzhou that are identical to those it manufactures in Ohio. 
 China's auto industry, mainly local companies in joint ventures with multinationals, is not internationally competitive because of quality problems and startlingly inefficient parts factories. Workers at Dickensian foundries filled with acrid green fumes still ladle chemical additives into buckets of molten steel, then tip the buckets by hand to pour the steel into molds for auto parts. 
China's auto exports to the United States mostly consist now of replacement parts shipped to repair garages, because automakers have been reluctant to make their assembly plants reliant on Chinese suppliers. But with broad support from Beijing and foreign investors, manufacturers in China are quickly improving operations -- and staffing them with workers earning as little as 50 cents an hour. In a few years, they are likely to be building high-quality cars and parts for as little as, or less than, anyone else in the world. Analysts say that China could surpass Germany as the world's No. 3 carmaking country in four years.
Executives at each major automaker say the combination of low costs and strong demand gives them no choice but to invest heavily here or risk being left behind. "Our competitors have reached the same conclusion," said Frederick A. Henderson, the president of G.M.'s Asian and Pacific operations. 
The growth of auto manufacturing in China -- the number of cars and light trucks produced has jumped to 3.8 million from 1.8 million over the last three years, compared with 12 million now in the United States, 10 million in Japan and 4.8 million in Germany -- has enormous implications not only for this country but for economies around the world.
In China, where about four million families own cars and about one million more buy cars each year, this means that millions of citizens can travel more widely, somewhat eroding the political and social controls that the Communist Party has long imposed. Rising auto production, for sale to state-owned enterprises as well as families, has fostered the rapid expansion of a long list of other industries that mainly rely on sales to automakers, including steel producers. It is helping to create a consumer credit industry.
But putting China on wheels has also created terrible traffic jams, a rising death rate in a country with an atrocious traffic safety record, and severe air pollution in a country that already has 7 of the world's 10 most polluted cities.

Worldwide Worries
The automaking boom in China worries many businesses and workers in many nations. International companies that build factories in China as they expand do not need to hire as many workers in their home markets, and may lay off some. The Cooper Tire & Rubber Company, for example, said last month that it would ship tire making equipment from its factory in Albany, Ga., to a company in in Hangzhou and buy as many as 300,000 truck tires a year from the Chinese company. At the same time, Cooper said it would expand production in Georgia of higher-performance tires, but would not expand its labor force to do so.
China's success is also a threat to other countries, mostly close American allies, where auto parts are made, including Mexico, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines.
Union leaders in industrialized countries are making low-wage competition from China a political issue. Competing on wages "is a race to the bottom," said Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Auto Workers. "And no one wins a race to the bottom."
Auto sales in China have jumped in the last two years as two decades of some of the world's fastest economic growth have finally lifted millions of city dwellers to nearly Western standards of living.
The domestic market alone is giving automakers and auto parts makers the economies of scale they need to compete internationally.
Automakers here should be ready to export cars to other Asian markets in several years, and later to industrialized markets like the United States and the European Union. 
Bernd Leissner, the president of Volkswagen Asia-Pacific, the foreign automaker with the biggest share of the Chinese market, estimates that it still costs 18 percent more to produce a car in China than in an industrialized country like Germany. But with new steel mills and parts factories opening at a brisk pace, that gap will disappear by 2006, he said. "Our target is to become export ready as soon as possible," he said.

Problems With Production
Visits to auto assembly plants and auto factories across China show why it will be a few more years before this country poses a serious threat to Detroit or Stuttgart, Germany, even though a few parts are already exported and General Motors plans to start shipping Chinese-made engines to a Canadian assembly plant this year.
At Honda's plant in Guangzhou, in southeastern China, 90 percent of the steel for the new Accord sedans and Odyssey minivans must be imported from Japan despite steep shipping costs. Chinese mills cannot make corrosion-resistant steel that meets Honda's standards.
In Harbin, in northernmost China, Hafei, a Chinese manufacturer, has erected a factory with the latest Swedish and Japanese robots. But deliveries of steel are so irregular, because of shortages and the decrepit railroad system, that the factory must absorb the considerable cost of keeping steel for two months on hand -- enough for 50,000 cars.
In Chongqing, in western China, Ford has built a modern assembly plant. But Ford has found that many of the auto parts to build the cars must be imported by ship to Shanghai and then brought up the Yangtze River by barge.
And at an Asimco foundry in Langfang, in northeastern China, Fan Dong-bo, 37, still ladles chemical additives into a bucket of molten steel, then turns a wheel on the side of the bucket to tip the red-hot steel into molds for auto parts. Foundries like this one are beginning to ship castings to the United States, where foundries are closing because of environmental regulations.
Recent quality improvements have come with extra costs, too. Volkswagen has been able to reach international quality standards for cars made in China, Mr. Leissner said, but only because suppliers sometimes must discard large numbers of substandard parts, which drives up costs. Volkswagen also uses many imported parts.
But new equipment and new production processes in assembly plants are starting to address these problems. A factory complex built here by a General Motors joint venture with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation looks very much like G.M. factories in the United States.

Capitalism in Action
The rise of the Chinese auto industry is a remarkable story of capitalism, as China's dismantling of trade barriers as part of its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 has prompted a ruthless struggle by companies to become efficient enough to fend off any imports.
Automakers and parts makers in China appear to have been successful, as imports have risen only slowly while production costs have plunged. The sticker price of a Honda Accord, for example, has tumbled from $50,000 to $27,000 in four years.
For all its strengths, the Chinese auto industry, like the Chinese economy as a whole and perhaps like China's political system and even society, is a mountain created on a very narrow and possibly wobbly base. Aggressive lending by government-owned banks has been stimulating the economy for years -- even though many debts are never repaid, to the point that Chinese banks now have portfolios of bad loans rivaling those of Japanese banks, but in an economy that is one-seventh the size.
If economic growth ever falters significantly and banks stop collecting their current flood of deposits from China's ever more prosperous people, a financial crisis could ensue that would cripple China's auto industry and many other industries. If such a crisis were to happen soon, before China's auto industry brings its costs down to international levels, then automakers could be discouraged from making further investments. But if China can keep growing for a few more years and become competitive, a downturn in domestic sales could unleash a flood of Chinese cars onto world markets.
Another potential difficulty lies in China's rigid political system. It is hard for any outsider to judge how stable China really is, as ill-organized protests and riots appear to occur frequently in smaller cities, even as the Communist Party prevents these disturbances from becoming coordinated to an extent that might threaten its legal monopoly on political power. Large-scale social unrest could seriously disrupt China's auto industry and economy as a whole.
The biggest question these days in the Chinese auto industry is how much longer domestic sales will continue to grow at their recent, rapid pace. Some warning signs are already apparent that automobile ownership remains restricted to a very small but wealthy urban elite and not a broadening middle class.
Henry Ford won worldwide fame nine decades ago by doubling factory workers' wages, a step that allowed to buy cars if they saved enough. But workers like Bi Hong-jian, 20, who leads a team of employees installing seat tracks in Honda Odyssey minivans in Guangzhou, earn just $240 monthly, while autoworkers in cities farther west, like Chongqing, earn even less.
"Everyone wants a car, it's a dream, but to me it is difficult, it's too expensive," Mr. Bi said during a break from his work on the line.
Car dealerships have had few repeat customers. In the King Full Motor Sales dealership in Zhanjiang, in southernmost China, fully 70 percent of the buyers here had never owned a car, a figure in line with the national pattern. The sales staff spends more time explaining the cars than selling them.
Automakers are erecting factories on the assumption that repeat customers will become more common and that new buyers will continue entering the market. If anything, the biggest fear now among executives is not having enough capacity.
Like many automakers facing worried union leaders at home, G.M. insists it only plans to serve the domestic market here, and does not plan to ship cars to the United States.
The only automaker with explicit plans to export assembled cars to industrialized countries is Honda. Koji Kadowaki, the president of Honda's Guangzhou operations, said Honda would export cars to Europe from an assembly plant Honda has begun building in Guangzhou, although he declined to identify which countries would get the cars.
Honda is a special case, however, because it has a shortage of assembly plant capacity in Europe and faces European trade barriers to increased exports from Japan. Exports from China, even if costly, could avoid those barriers.
Yet China has a long way to go. Even seemingly simple parts like rubber sealings can prove hard to make. The experience of Steven Zhao, the general manager of an Asimco brake assembly factory in Guangzhou, shows the obstacles and potential of China's parts industry.
To make brakes for cars that are built and sold in China by General Motors, Ford, Peugeot, Renault and Nissan, his workers rely mostly on bolting together imported parts. Even a small spring is imported because Chinese suppliers are too likely to weaken the steel in bending it into shape, said Mr. Zhao, a former Alcoa manager. 
But such hurdles are not discouraging anyone. "The market has always outraced our ability to keep up with it," said Phil Murtaugh, the chairman of G.M. China.

Some American military officers in Iraq are pressing to reconstitute entire units of the former Iraqi Army, which the top United States administrator in Baghdad disbanded in May. They say the change would speed the creation of a new army and stabilize the nation. 
 Proposals under consideration would involve identifying former Iraqi officers and weeding out any still loyal to Saddam Hussein. Those who pass the vetting could then track down the troops who had served under them in order to re-assemble complete companies and battalions rapidly. 
 "We feel we could contact a midlevel officer -- say, the rank of captain or major -- who knows where all the members of his unit are today," said a senior military officer at the occupation's military headquarters in Baghdad. 
The talks are at an early stage and do not represent an actual plan. At a news conference in Baghdad on Saturday, the American administrator, L. Paul Bremer III, spoke merely of the need to welcome back former members of the Iraqi Army into the small replacement army now being formed.
But the talks tacitly acknowledge that some officers view Mr. Bremer's decision to dismantle the defeated 500,000-member Iraqi Army as a mistake, one that has contributed to the instability and increasing attacks against United States forces in Iraq. 
Mr. Bremer's decision, which his advisers say was made after deliberations with senior Pentagon, White House and other administration officials, was a defining moment in the American-led occupation. 
Pentagon policy makers continue to say the Iraqi military had to be dismantled before a democratic Iraq could be built, and they point out that the force had already melted away under intense attack.
But the decision reversed the approach of Mr. Bremer's predecessor, Jay Garner, a retired Army lieutenant general who advocated paying members of the former Iraqi Army as a way to keep their units intact for possible construction tasks and to prevent them from turning against the Americans.
Senior military officers in Iraq and Washington say they are now considering ways to make up for lost time and lost opportunities, in order to put an Iraqi face on the occupation forces' efforts to plug the security gaps in volatile areas of the country. 
"We don't see a solution without co-opting the former military to some degree," said a senior military officer in Baghdad who has reviewed what needs to be done to field a new Iraqi Army quickly. 
Former Iraqi officers chosen for service would be carefully screened to make sure there are "no hard-line Baathists tucked up in there" or others who had taken part in acts that might warrant war crimes prosecution or otherwise were unworthy to serve, one military officer said.
The talk of reformulating some full units of the Iraqi Army began "in the last couple of weeks," a senior officer said, and were under way during the visit to Iraq by Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, who returned to Washington on Monday. 
"There is no prejudice against hiring officers of the former army if they have clean records," Mr. Wolfowitz said when asked about the proposals. 
Military officers said their discussions preceded statements this week from the White House and Pentagon about revamping and accelerating plans for putting Iraqi security forces on the streets of Baghdad and other areas where American forces and Iraqi citizens have been attacked. 
Under one possibility described by a senior officer in Baghdad, former army transportation and engineering units might be reconstituted first. Known in the military as combat support and combat service support, such units perform important logistical missions, and the American effort in Iraq has required the mobilization of tens of thousands of reservists for those duties. 
Iraqi combat units, in particular Republican Guard and tank units, would not be among those reconstituted, officers said. But armored and infantry soldiers of the former Iraqi military would be allowed to apply for retraining and membership in the new army, an effort led by Maj. Gen. Paul D. Eaton, previously the United States Army's chief of infantry training.
The first 700-man battalion of the new Iraqi Army took the field in early October under the command of Maj. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno of the Fourth Infantry Division, based in Tikrit. 
Mr. Bremer said Saturday that about 60 percent of the enlisted soldiers and all of the sergeants in the new Iraqi Army had been members of the former army.
Mr. Bremer said that "we have always said they are welcome to join" the 27 battalions that eventually are to make up the new Iraqi Army. 
"We are also welcoming former army members into the civil defense corps," he said. "I don't know if we have figures on what percent are from the army, but I'm sure it's a majority. They've also been encouraged to join the police, the facilities protection service and the border police."
Mr. Bremer's decision to disband the army caused an early clash with General Garner, the man he replaced in May. 
"It was our view that we needed to pay the army and get them back to work as quickly as we could," said Jared Bates, a retired three-star Army general who was General Garner's operations deputy. "You didn't want them on the other side of the fight." 
But General Bates said the view of some civilian policy makers at the Pentagon was, "Why in the world would we pay an army we just spent blood and treasure to defeat?" 
Walter B. Slocombe, the civilian in charge of rebuilding Iraqi security institutions, defended Mr. Bremer's decision on grounds of principle and practicality. He said planting democratic roots in Iraq required disbanding an institution that was hated by the population as an instrument of Mr. Hussein's control.
He said the decision was also dictated by facts on the ground because the Iraqi Army no longer existed as a coherent force and bases were unusable.
"The Iraqi military under Saddam Hussein was a part of the system, and when the major fighting ended, say, in early April, major maneuver operations ended, the old army simply disintegrated," Mr. Slocombe said. "Everybody went home. And so the old army, which we formally dissolved as an institution, no longer existed when we did it." 
He said that even after Baghdad fell, the Iraqi military could not have been invited back to barracks because "the degree of the looting in military installations in Iraq is really hard to imagine." 
He continued: "They didn't just steal stuff that was not nailed down. They stole the toilet fixtures, and they stole the pipes and the tile in the latrines."
But Mr. Bremer's announcement contradicted the plan as described at an official Pentagon briefing on March 11, a week before General Garner's departure for Iraq. 
"One of our goals is to take a good portion of the Iraqi regular army -- I'm not talking about the Republican Guards, the special Republican Guards, but I'm talking about the regular army -- and the regular army has the skill sets to match the work that needs to be done in construction," a senior Pentagon official said at the briefing. 
"So our thought is to take them and they can help rebuild their own country," he said, adding that their tasks would not be combat but "things like engineering, road construction, work on bridges, remove rubble, de-mine, pick up unexploded ordnance, construction work." 
Using the Iraqi army in that way, the official said, "allows us not to demobilize it immediately and put a lot of unemployed people on the street." 
Mr. Bremer's decision also collided with recommendations from a group of former Iraqi military officers recruited last year by the State Department to advise the government on how to carry out the occupation. 
"It was a big mistake," Muhammad al-Faour, a former major in the Iraqi Special Forces who headed the State Department project's defense working group, said in a telephone interview. "You put half a million people with their families, with their experiences, on the streets, and if just half a percent of those people turn against you, you're in trouble."

 BODY:
On the streets of Baghdad today, Americans do not feel welcome. United States military personnel in the city are hunkered down behind acres of fencing and razor wire inside what was once Saddam Hussein's Republican Palace. When L. Paul Bremer III, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, leaves the compound, he is always surrounded by bodyguards, carbines at the ready, and G.I.'s on patrol in the city's streets never let their hands stray far from the triggers of their machine guns or M-16 rifles. The official line from the White House and the Pentagon is that things in Baghdad and throughout Iraq are improving. But an average of 35 attacks are mounted each day on American forces inside Iraq by armed resisters of one kind or another, whom American commanders concede are operating with greater and greater sophistication. In the back streets of Sadr City, the impoverished Baghdad suburb where almost two million Shiites live -- and where Bush administration officials and Iraqi exiles once imagined American troops would be welcomed with sweets and flowers -- the mood, when I visited in September, was angry and resentful. In October, the 24-member American-appointed Iraqi Governing Council warned of a deteriorating security situation.
 Historically, it is rare that a warm welcome is extended to an occupying military force for very long, unless, that is, the postwar goes very smoothly. And in Iraq, the postwar occupation has not gone smoothly. 
 I have made two trips to Iraq since the end of the war and interviewed dozens of sources in Iraq and in the United States who were involved in the planning and execution of the war and its aftermath. It is becoming painfully clear that the American plan (if it can even be dignified with the name) for dealing with postwar Iraq was flawed in its conception and ineptly carried out. At the very least, the bulk of the evidence suggests that what was probably bound to be a difficult aftermath to the war was made far more difficult by blinkered vision and overoptimistic assumptions on the part of the war's greatest partisans within the Bush administration. The lack of security and order on the ground in Iraq today is in large measure a result of decisions made and not made in Washington before the war started, and of the specific approaches toward coping with postwar Iraq undertaken by American civilian officials and military commanders in the immediate aftermath of the war. 
Despite administration claims, it is simply not true that no one could have predicted the chaos that ensued after the fall of Saddam Hussein. In fact, many officials in the United States, both military and civilian, as well as many Iraqi exiles, predicted quite accurately the perilous state of things that exists in Iraq today. There was ample warning, both on the basis of the specifics of Iraq and the precedent of other postwar deployments -- in Panama, Kosovo and elsewhere -- that the situation in postwar Iraq was going to be difficult and might become unmanageable. What went wrong was not that no one could know or that no one spoke out. What went wrong is that the voices of Iraq experts, of the State Department almost in its entirety and, indeed, of important segments of the uniformed military were ignored. As much as the invasion of Iraq and the rout of Saddam Hussein and his army was a triumph of planning and implementation, the mess that is postwar Iraq is a failure of planning and implementation.

1. Getting In Too Deep With Chalabi
In the minds of the top officials of the Department of Defense during the run-up to the war, Iraq by the end of this year would have enough oil flowing to help pay for the country's reconstruction, a constitution nearly written and set for ratification and, perhaps most important, a popular new leader who shared America's vision not only for Iraq's future but also for the Middle East's.
Ahmad Chalabi may on the face of it seem an odd figure to count on to unify and lead a fractious postwar nation that had endured decades of tyrannical rule. His background is in mathematics and banking, he is a secular Shiite Muslim and he had not been in Baghdad since the late 1950's. But in the early 90's he became close to Richard Perle, who was an assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration, and in 1992, in the wake of the first gulf war, he founded the Iraqi National Congress, an umbrella organization of Iraqi opposition groups in exile. 
In the mid-90's, Chalabi attended conferences on a post-Hussein Iraq organized by Perle and sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute. There he met a group of neoconservative and conservative intellectuals who had served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, including Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz, who later formed the core group that would persuade President George W. Bush to go to war with Iraq. As a number of Iraqi exiles have since related, Wolfowitz, then the dean of the Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, was particularly appalled and shamed by the first Bush administration's failure to help the Kurds and the southern Shiites in the aftermath of the first gulf war. Encouraged by President Bush to "take matters into their own hands," these groups had risen against Saddam Hussein, only to be crushed by his forces while America did nothing. Wolfowitz and his colleagues believed that removing Saddam Hussein would have been the right way to end the first gulf war, and during their years out of power they lobbied the Clinton administration both publicly and privately to make the overthrow of Saddam Hussein a priority.
In the mid-90's Chalabi fell out of favor with the C.I.A. and the State Department, which questioned his popular support in Iraq and accused him of misappropriating American government funds earmarked for armed resistance by Iraqi exile groups against Saddam Hussein. He remained close with Perle and Wolfowitz, however, as well as with other neoconservative figures in Washington, including Douglas Feith, a former aide to Perle, and regularly appeared with them on panels at conservative policy institutes like the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi lobbied senators and congressmen to support action against Saddam Hussein, and a coalition of neoconservatives, including Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Perle, sent a letter to President Clinton calling for a tougher Iraq policy. Together they succeeded in persuading the Republican-controlled Congress in 1998 to pass the Iraq Liberation Act, signed into law by President Clinton, a piece of legislation that made regime change in Iraq the official policy of the United States.
After George W. Bush assumed the presidency, Chalabi's Washington allies were appointed to senior positions in the defense establishment. Wolfowitz became deputy defense secretary, Feith under secretary of defense for policy and Perle head of the Defense Policy Board. Chalabi and the neoconservatives in the Pentagon were united by a shared vision of a radically reshaped Middle East and a belief that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was the essential first step in the realization of that vision. The Iraq Chalabi envisioned -- one that would make peace with Israel, have adversarial relations with Iran and become a democratic model for (or, seen another way, a threat to) Saudi Arabia -- coincided neatly with the plan of the administration neoconservatives, who saw post-Hussein Iraq as a launching pad for what they described as the democratization of the Middle East. (Wolfowitz, Perle and Chalabi all refused or did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article.)
Bush had come into office strenuously opposing "nation building," and in the early months of his presidency the neoconservatives' interventionist view was by no means dominant. But the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, gave the movement new energy. Within days of the attacks, Wolfowitz was spearheading efforts to put on the table a plan to overthrow Saddam Hussein. 
Initially these efforts seemed to go nowhere. There was the war in Afghanistan to fight first, and many senior officers within the military feared that a war in Iraq would stretch American military capabilities beyond their limit at a time when the threat of war loomed on the Korean Peninsula. But the war in Afghanistan was a quick success, and in early 2002 a vigorous lobbying effort by the neoconservatives, both in public and inside the White House, succeeded in moving the idea of Hussein's overthrow to the center of the administration's foreign policy agenda.
Planning began not only for the war itself but also for its aftermath, and various government departments and agencies initiated projects and study groups to consider the questions of postwar Iraq. As Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld would put it later, planning "began well before there was a decision to go to war. It was extensive."
Chief among these agencies was the so-called Office of Special Plans, set up after Sept. 11, 2001, reporting to Douglas Feith in the Pentagon. It was given such a vague name, by Feith's own admission, because the administration did not want to have it widely known that there was a special unit in the Pentagon doing its own assessments of intelligence on Iraq. "We didn't think it was wise to create a brand-new office and label it an office of Iraq policy," Feith told the BBC in July. 
The office's main purpose was to evaluate the threat of Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and biological warfare capabilities; its mission reflected the Department of Defense's dissatisfaction with the C.I.A.'s conservative estimates of Saddam Hussein's suspected weapons of mass destruction. Chalabi provided the Office of Special Plans with information from defectors ostensibly from Saddam Hussein's weapons programs -- defectors who claimed to be able to establish that the Iraqi dictator was actively developing weapons of mass destruction. 
Through such efforts, Chalabi grew even closer to those planning the war and what would follow. To the war planners, the Iraqi National Congress became not simply an Iraqi exile group of which Chalabi was a leader, but a kind of government-in-waiting with Chalabi at its head. The Pentagon's plan for postwar Iraq seems to have hinged, until the war itself, on the idea that Chalabi could be dropped into Baghdad and, once there, effect a smooth transition to a new administration. 
At the insistence of the civilian administrators in the Pentagon, Chalabi and 500 of his fighters in the Free Iraqi Forces were flown to Nasiriya in southern Iraq in April, in the first weeks of the war. At the time, American military officials were continuing to stress the importance of Chalabi and the Free Iraqi Forces. Gen. Peter Pace, then the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described them as the "core of the new Iraqi Army." But to the surprise and disappointment of American military leaders on the ground, Chalabi failed to make much of an impression on the people he tried to mobilize. 
Timothy Carney, a former American ambassador to Sudan and Haiti who served in the reconstruction team in Iraq just after the war, says that there was, in the Pentagon, "a complete lack of grasp of Chalabi's lack of appeal for ordinary Iraqis." In the end, Chalabi sat out the war in the Iraqi desert and was taken to Baghdad only after the city had fallen and the Americans had moved in.
Many Iraqis outside the Iraqi National Congress felt marginalized by the Pentagon's devotion to Chalabi. According to Isam Al Khafaji, a moderate Iraqi academic who worked with the State Department on prewar planning and later with the American reconstruction office in Baghdad, "What I had originally envisioned -- working with allies in a democratic fashion" -- soon turned into "collaborating with occupying forces," not what he and other Iraqi exiles had had in mind at all. 
Carney agrees. "There was so much reliance on Chalabi in those early days," he says.

2. Shutting Out State
In the spring of 2002, as support for a war to oust Saddam Hussein took root within the Bush administration, the State Department began to gather information and draw up its own set of plans for postwar Iraq under the leadership of Thomas Warrick, a longtime State Department official who was then special adviser to the department's Office of Northern Gulf Affairs. This effort involved a great number of Iraqi exiles from across the political spectrum, from monarchists to communists and including the Iraqi National Congress.
Warrick's Future of Iraq Project, as it was called, was an effort to consider almost every question likely to confront a post-Hussein Iraq: the rebuilding of infrastructure, the shape Iraqi democracy might take, the carrying out of transitional justice and the spurring of economic development. Warrick called on the talents of many of the best Middle Eastern specialists at State and at the C.I.A. He divided his team into working groups, each of which took on one aspect of the reconstruction. 
David L. Phillips, an American conflict-prevention specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and a former adviser to the State Department, served on the project's "democratic principles" group. In his view of the project, "Iraqis did a lot of important work together looking at the future." But however useful the work itself was, Phillips says, the very process of holding the discussions was even more valuable. "It involved Iraqis coming together, in many cases for the first time, to discuss and try to forge a common vision of Iraq's future," Phillips says.
There were a number of key policy disagreements between State and Defense. The first was over Chalabi. While the Pentagon said that a "government in exile" should be established, presumably led by Chalabi, to be quickly installed in Baghdad following the war, other Iraqis, including the elder statesman of the exile leaders, Adnan Pachaci, insisted that any government installed by United States fiat would be illegitimate in the eyes of the Iraqi people. And the State Department, still concerned that Chalabi had siphoned off money meant for the Iraqi resistance and that he lacked public support, opposed the idea of a shadow government. The State Department managed to win this particular battle, and no government in exile was set up. 
There was also a broader disagreement about whether and how quickly Iraq could become a full-fledged democracy. The State Department itself was of two minds on this question. One prewar State Department report, echoing the conventional wisdom among Arabists, asserted that "liberal democracy would be difficult to achieve" in Iraq and that "electoral democracy, were it to emerge, could well be subject to exploitation by anti-American elements." The C.I.A. agreed with this assessment; in March 2003, the agency issued a report that was widely reported to conclude that prospects for democracy in a post-Hussein Iraq were bleak. In contrast, the neoconservatives within the Bush administration, above all within the Department of Defense, consistently asserted that the C.I.A. and the State Department were wrong and that there was no reason to suppose that Iraq could not become a full-fledged democracy, and relatively quickly and smoothly.
But Thomas Warrick, who has refused to be interviewed since the end of the war, was, according to participants in the project, steadfastly committed to Iraqi democracy. Feisal Istrabadi, an Iraqi-American lawyer who also served on the project's democratic principles group, credits Warrick with making the Future of Iraq Project a genuinely democratic and inclusive venture. Warrick, he says, "was fanatically devoted to the idea that no one should be allowed to dominate the Future of Iraq Project and that all voices should be heard -- including moderate Islamist voices. It was a remarkable accomplishment." 
In fact, Istrabadi rejects the view that the State Department was a holdout against Iraqi democracy. "From Colin Powell on down," he says, "I've spent hundreds of hours with State Department people, and I've never heard one say democracy was not viable in Iraq. Not one."
Although Istrabadi is an admirer of Wolfowitz, he says that the rivalry between State and Defense was so intense that the Future of Iraq Project became anathema to the Pentagon simply because it was a State Department project. "At the Defense Department," he recalls, "we were seen as part of 'them."' Istrabadi was so disturbed by the fight between Defense and State that on June 1, 2002, he says, he took the matter up personally with Douglas Feith. "I sat with Feith," he recalls, "and said, 'You've got to decide what your policy is."'
The Future of Iraq Project did draw up detailed reports, which were eventually released to Congress last month and made available to reporters for The New York Times. The 13 volumes, according to The Times, warned that "the period immediately after regime change might offer . . . criminals the opportunity to engage in acts of killing, plunder and looting."
But the Defense Department, which came to oversee postwar planning, would pay little heed to the work of the Future of Iraq Project. Gen. Jay Garner, the retired Army officer who was later given the job of leading the reconstruction of Iraq, says he was instructed by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to ignore the Future of Iraq Project. 
Garner has said that he asked for Warrick to be added to his staff and that he was turned down by his superiors. Judith Yaphe, a former C.I.A. analyst and a leading expert on Iraqi history, says that Warrick was "blacklisted" by the Pentagon. "He did not support their vision," she told me. 
And what was this vision? 
Yaphe's answer is unhesitant: "Ahmad Chalabi." But it went further than that: "The Pentagon didn't want to touch anything connected to the Department of State."
None of the senior American officials involved in the Future of Iraq Project were taken on board by the Pentagon's planners. And this loss was considerable. "The Office of Special Plans discarded all of the Future of Iraq Project's planning," David Phillips says. "I don't know why." 
To say all this is not to claim that the Future of Iraq Project alone would have prevented the postwar situation from deteriorating as it did. Robert Perito, a former State Department official who is one of the world's leading experts on postconflict police work, says of the Future of Iraq Project: "It was a good idea. It brought the exiles together, a lot of smart people, and its reports were very impressive. But the project never got to the point where things were in place that could be implemented." 
Nonetheless, Istrabadi points out that "we in the Future of Iraq Project predicted widespread looting. You didn't have to have a degree from a Boston university to figure that one out. Look at what happened in L.A. after the police failed to act quickly after the Rodney King verdict. It was entirely predictable that in the absence of any authority in Baghdad that you'd have chaos and lawlessness."
According to one participant, Iraqi exiles on the project specifically warned of the dangers of policing postwar Iraq: "Adnan Pachaci's first question to U.S. officials was, How would they maintain law and order after the war was over? They told him not to worry, that things would get back to normal very soon."

3. Too Little Planning, Too Late
The Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) was established in the Defense Department, under General Garner's supervision, on Jan. 20, 2003, just eight weeks before the invasion of Iraq. Because the Pentagon had insisted on essentially throwing out the work and the personnel of the Future of Iraq Project, Garner and his planners had to start more or less from scratch. Timothy Carney, who served in ORHA under Garner, explains that ORHA lacked critical personnel once it arrived in Baghdad. "There were scarcely any Arabists in ORHA in the beginning" at a senior level, Carney says. "Some of us had served in the Arab world, but we were not experts, or fluent Arabic speakers." According to Carney, Defense officials "said that Arabists weren't welcome because they didn't think Iraq could be democratic."
Because of the battle between Defense and State, ORHA, which Douglas Feith called the "U.S. government nerve center" for postwar planning, lacked not only information and personnel but also time. ORHA had only two months to figure out what to plan for, plan for it and find the people to implement it. A senior Defense official later admitted that in late January "we only had three or four people"; in mid-February, the office conducted a two-day "rehearsal" of the postwar period at the National Defense University in Washington. Judith Yaphe says that "even the Messiah couldn't have organized a program in that short a time."
Although ORHA simply didn't have the time, resources or expertise in early 2003 to formulate a coherent postwar plan, Feith and others in the Defense Department were telling a different story to Congress. In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 11, shortly before the beginning of the war, Feith reassured the assembled senators that ORHA was "staffed by officials detailed from departments and agencies throughout the government." Given the freeze-out of the State Department officials from the Future of Iraq Project, this description hardly encompassed the reality of what was actually taking place bureaucratically.
Much of the postwar planning that did get done before the invasion focused on humanitarian efforts -- Garner's area of expertise. Through the U.S. Agency for International Development, Washington was planning for a possible humanitarian emergency akin to the one that occurred after the first gulf war, when hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled their homes in northern Iraq and needed both emergency relief and protection from Saddam Hussein. This operation, led by Garner, had succeeded brilliantly. American planners in 2003 imagined (and planned for) a similar emergency taking place. There were plans drawn up for housing and feeding Iraqi refugees. But there was little thought given to other contingencies -- like widespread looting. 
Garner told me that while he had expected Iraqis to loot the symbols of the old regime, like Hussein's palaces, he had been utterly unprepared for the systematic looting and destruction of practically every public building in Baghdad. In fairness to Garner, many of the Iraqis I spoke with during my trips were also caught by surprise. One mullah in Sadr City observed to me caustically that he had never seen such wickedness. "People can be weak," he said. "I knew this before, of course, but I did not know how weak. But while I do not say it is the Americans' fault, I simply cannot understand how your soldiers could have stood by and watched. Maybe they are weak, too. Or maybe they are wicked."
One reason for the looting in Baghdad was that there were so many intact buildings to loot. In contrast to their strategy in the first gulf war, American war planners had been careful not to attack Iraqi infrastructure. This was partly because of their understanding of the laws of war and partly because of their desire to get Iraq back up and running as quickly and smoothly as possible. They seem to have imagined that once Hussein fell, things would go back to normal fairly quickly. But on the ground, the looting and the violence went on and on, and for the most part American forces largely did nothing. 
Or rather, they did only one thing -- station troops to protect the Iraqi Oil Ministry. This decision to protect only the Oil Ministry -- not the National Museum, not the National Library, not the Health Ministry -- probably did more than anything else to convince Iraqis uneasy with the occupation that the United States was in Iraq only for the oil. "It is not that they could not protect everything, as they say," a leader in the Hawza, the Shiite religious authority, told me. "It's that they protected nothing else. The Oil Ministry is not off by itself. It's surrounded by other ministries, all of which the Americans allowed to be looted. So what else do you want us to think except that you want our oil?" 
As Istrabadi, the Iraqi-American lawyer from the Future of Iraq Project, says, "When the Oil Ministry is the only thing you protect, what do you expect people to think?" And, he adds: "It can't be that U.S. troops didn't know where the National Museum was. All you have to do is follow the signs -- they're in English! -- to Museum Square."
For its part, the Hawza could do little to protect the 17 out of 23 Iraqi ministries that were gutted by looters, or the National Library, or the National Museum (though sheiks repeatedly called on looters to return the stolen artifacts). But it was the Hawza, and not American forces, that protected many of Baghdad's hospitals from looters -- which Hawza leaders never fail to point out when asked whether they would concede that the United States is now doing a great deal of good in Iraq. The memory of this looting is like a bone in Iraq's collective throat and has given rise to conspiracy theories about American motives and actions. 
"The U.S. thinks of Iraq as a big cake," one young Iraqi journalist told me. "By letting people loot -- and don't tell me they couldn't have stopped the looters if they'd wanted to; look at the war! -- they were arranging to get more profits for Mr. Cheney, for Bechtel, for all American corporations." 

4. The Troops: Too Few, Too Constricted
On Feb. 25, the Army's chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki, warned Congress that postwar Iraq would require a commitment of "several hundred thousand" U.S. troops. Shinseki's estimate was dismissed out of hand by Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and other civilian officials at the Pentagon, where war plans called for a smaller, more agile force than had been used in the first gulf war. Wolfowitz, for example, told Congress on Feb. 27 that Shinseki's number was "wildly off the mark," adding, "It's hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq than it would take to conduct the war itself and secure the surrender of Saddam's security force and his army." Shinseki retired soon afterward.
But Shinseki wasn't the only official who thought there were going to be insufficient troops on the ground to police Iraq in the aftermath of the war. The lack of adequate personnel in the military's plan, especially the military police needed for postconflict work, was pointed out by both senior members of the uniformed military and by seasoned peacekeeping officials in the United Nations secretariat.
Former Ambassador Carney, recalling his first days in Iraq with ORHA, puts it this way, with surprising bitterness: The U.S. military "simply did not understand or give enough priority to the transition from their military mission to our political military mission."
The Department of Defense did not lack for military and civilian officials -- men and women who supported the war -- counseling in private that policing a country militarily would not be easy. As Robert Perito recalls: "The military was warned there would be looting. There has been major looting in every important postconflict situation of the past decade. The looting in Panama City in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion did more damage to the Panamanian economy than the war itself. And there was vast looting and disorder in Kosovo. We know this."
Securing Iraq militarily after victory on the battlefield was, in the Pentagon's parlance, Phase IV of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Phases I through III were the various stages of the invasion itself; Phase IV involved so-called stability and support operations -- in other words, the postwar. The military itself, six months into the occupation, is willing to acknowledge -- at least to itself -- that it did not plan sufficiently for Phase IV. In its secret report "Operation Iraqi Freedom: Strategic Lessons Learned," a draft of which was obtained by The Washington Times in August, the Department of Defense concedes that "late formation of Department of Defense Phase IV organizations limited time available for the development of detailed plans and pre-deployment coordination." 
The planning stages of the invasion itself were marked by detailed preparations and frequent rehearsals. Lt. Col. Scott Rutter is a highly decorated U.S. battalion commander whose unit, the Second Battalion, Seventh Infantry of the Third Infantry Division, helped take the Baghdad airport. He says that individual units rehearsed their own roles and the contingencies they might face over and over again. By contrast, the lack of postwar planning made the difficulties the United States faced almost inevitable. "We knew what the tactical end state was supposed to be at the end of the war, but we were never told what the end state, the goal was, for the postwar," Rutter said. (Rutter was on active duty when I spoke to him, but he is scheduled to retire this month.) 
Rutter's unit controlled a section of Baghdad in the immediate postwar period, and he was forced to make decisions on his own on everything from how to deal with looters to whether to distribute food. When I asked him in Baghdad in September whether he had rehearsed this or, indeed, whether he received any instructions from up the chain of command, he simply smiled and shook his head.
Rutter's view is confirmed by the "After Action" report of the Third Infantry Division, a document that is available on an Army Web site but that has received little attention. Running 293 pages and marked "official use only," it is a comprehensive evaluation of the division's performance during the war in Iraq, covering every aspect of operations, from the initial invasion to the postwar period. The tone of the report is mostly self-congratulatory. "Operating considerably beyond existing doctrine," it begins, "the Third Infantry Division (Mechanized) proved that a lethal, flexible and disciplined mechanized force could conduct continuous offensive operations over extended distances for 21 days." 
If the report contains one pre-eminent lesson, it is that extensive training is what made the division's success possible. "The roots of the division's successful attack to Baghdad," the authors of the report write, "are found on the training fields of Fort Stewart" -- the Third Infantry Division's Georgia base. "A direct correlation can be drawn between the division's training cycle prior to crossing the line of departure and the division's successful attack into Iraq."
But as the report makes clear, no such intensive training was undertaken for postwar operations. As the report's authors note: "Higher headquarters did not provide the Third Infantry Division (Mechanized) with a plan for Phase IV. As a result, Third Infantry Division transitioned into Phase IV in the absence of guidance." 
The report concludes that "division planners should have drafted detailed plans on Phase IV operations that would have allowed it" -- the Third Infantry Division -- "to operate independently outside of guidance from higher headquarters. Critical requirements should have been identified prior to" the beginning of the war, the report states. The division also should have had "a plan to execute" a stability-and-support operation "for at least 30 days." 
The report says that such an operation should have included "protecting infrastructure, historic sites, administrative buildings, cultural sites, financial institutions, judicial/legal sites and religious sites." It notes, with hindsight, that "protecting these sites must be planned for early in the planning process." But as the report makes clear, no such planning took place.
Without a plan, without meticulous rehearsal and without orders or, at the very least, guidance from higher up the chain of command, the military is all but paralyzed. And in those crucial first postwar days in Baghdad, American forces (and not only those in the Third Infantry Division) behaved that way, as all around them Baghdad was ransacked and most of the categories of infrastructure named in the report were destroyed or seriously damaged.
Some military analysts go beyond the lack of Phase IV planning and more generally blame the Bush administration's insistence, upon coming into office, that it would no longer commit American armed forces to nation-building missions -- a position symbolized by the decision, now being reconsidered, to close the Peacekeeping Institute at the Army War College in Carlisle, Penn. According to Maj. Gen. William Nash, now retired from the Army, who commanded U.S. forces in northern Bosnia after the signing of the Dayton peace accords: "This is a democratic army. If the national command authority tells it that it doesn't have to worry about something anymore" -- he was talking about peacekeeping -- "it stops worrying about it." 
It is hardly a secret that within the Army, peacekeeping duty is not the road to career advancement. Civil-affairs officers are not the Army's "high-fliers," Rutter notes.
Nash, understandably proud of his service as commander of U.S. forces in postconflict Bosnia, is chagrined by the way American forces behaved in the immediate aftermath of the fall of Baghdad. "I know they expected to be greeted with flowers and candy," he says, "or at least the civilians in the Pentagon had assured them they would be. But we know from experience that this kind of welcome lasts only a few days at most. You are welcomed with roses -- for one day. Then you have to prove yourself, and keep on proving yourself, every succeeding day of the mission. There are no excuses, and few second chances. That was why, when we went into Bosnia, we went in hard. The only way to keep control of the situation, even if people are initially glad to see you, is to take charge immediately and never let go of control. Instead, in postwar Iraq, we just stood around and responded to events, rather than shaping them."

5. Neglecting ORHA
In his Congressional testimony before the war, Douglas Feith described General Garner's mission as head of ORHA as "integrating the work of the three substantive operations" necessary in postwar Iraq. These were humanitarian relief, reconstruction and civil administration. Garner, Feith said, would ensure that the fledgling ORHA could "plug in smoothly" to the military's command structure on the ground in Iraq. But far from plugging in smoothly to Central Command, ORHA's people found themselves at odds with the military virtually from the start.
Timothy Carney has given the best and most damning account of this dialogue of the deaf between ORHA officials and the U.S. military on the ground in Iraq. "I should have had an inkling of the trouble ahead for our reconstruction team in Iraq," he wrote in a searing op-ed article in The Washington Post in late June, "from the hassle we had just trying to get there. About 20 of us from the Organization for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance showed up at a military airport in Kuwait on April 24 for a flight to Baghdad. But some general's plane had broken down, so he had taken ours." 
Carney stressed the low priority the military put on ORHA's efforts. "Few in the military understood the urgency of our mission," he wrote, "yet we relied on the military for support. For example, the military commander set rules for transportation: we initially needed a lead military car, followed by the car with civilians and a military vehicle bringing up the rear. But there weren't enough vehicles. One day we had 31 scheduled missions and only nine convoys, so 22 missions were scrubbed." 
More substantively, he added that "no lessons seem to have taken hold from the recent nation-building efforts in Bosnia or Kosovo, so we in ORHA felt as though we were reinventing the wheel." And doing so under virtually impossible constraints. Carney quoted an internal ORHA memorandum arguing that the organization "is not being treated seriously enough by the command given what we are supposed to do."
The lack of respect for the civilian officials in ORHA was a source of astonishment to Lieutenant Colonel Rutter. "I was amazed by what I saw," he says. "There would be a meeting called by Ambassador Bodine" -- the official on Garner's staff responsible for Baghdad -- "and none of the senior officers would show up. I remember thinking, This isn't right, and also thinking that if it had been a commander who had called the meeting, they would have shown up all right."
Carney attributes some of the blame for ORHA's impotence to the fact that it set up shop in Saddam Hussein's Republican Palace, where "nobody knew where anyone was, and, worse, almost no one really knew what was going on outside the palace. Some of us managed to talk to Iraqis, but not many, since the military didn't want you to go out for security reasons unless accompanied by M.P.'s." 
Kevin Henry of CARE, a humanitarian organization active in Iraq, says that he still has similar concerns. "One of my biggest worries," he says, "is the isolation of the palace." 
Garner disputes these complaints. He is adamant that he managed to talk with many Iraqis and strongly disagrees with claims that officials in the palace were out of touch.
Still, ORHA under Pentagon control was compelled to adhere rigidly to military force-protection rules that were anything but appropriate to the work the civilians at ORHA were trying to do. Larry Hollingworth, a former British colonel and relief specialist who has worked in Sarajevo and Chechnya and who briefly served with ORHA right after Baghdad fell, says that "at the U.S. military's insistence, we traveled out from our fortified headquarters in Saddam's old Republican Palace in armored vehicles, wearing helmets and flak jackets, trying to convince Iraqis that peace was at hand, and that they were safe. It was ridiculous."
And Judith Yaphe adds, "In some ways, we're even more isolated than the British were when they took over Iraq" after World War I. 
Kevin Henry has described the Bush administration as peculiarly susceptible to a kind of "liberation theology in which they couldn't get beyond their own rhetoric and see things in Iraq as they really were." 
As the spring wore on, administration officials continued to insist publicly that nothing was going seriously wrong in Iraq. But the pressure to do something became too strong to resist. Claiming that it had been a change that had been foreseen all along (though it had not been publicly announced and was news to Garner's staff), President Bush replaced Garner in May with L. Paul Bremer. Glossing over the fact that Bremer had no experience in postwar reconstruction or nation-building, the Pentagon presented Bremer as a good administrator -- something, or so Defense Department officials implied on background, Garner was not. 
Bremer's first major act was not auspicious. Garner had resisted the kind of complete de-Baathification of Iraqi society that Ahmad Chalabi and some of his allies in Washington had favored. In particular, he had resisted calls to completely disband the Iraqi Army. Instead, he had tried only to fire Baathists and senior military officers against whom real charges of complicity in the regime's crimes could be demonstrated and to use most members of the Iraqi Army as labor battalions for reconstruction projects. 
Bremer, however, took the opposite approach. On May 15, he announced the complete disbanding of the Iraqi Army, some 400,000 strong, and the lustration of 50,000 members of the Baath Party. As one U.S. official remarked to me privately, "That was the week we made 450,000 enemies on the ground in Iraq."
The decision -- which many sources say was made not by Bremer but in the White House -- was disastrous. In a country like Iraq, where the average family size is 6, firing 450,000 people amounts to leaving 2,700,000 people without incomes; in other words, more than 10 percent of Iraq's 23 million people. The order produced such bad feeling on the streets of Baghdad that salaries are being reinstated for all soldiers. It is a slow and complicated process, however, and there have been demonstrations by fired military officers in Iraq over the course of the summer and into the fall. 

6. Ignoring the Shiites
It should have been clear from the start that the success or failure of the American project in postwar Iraq depended not just on the temporary acquiescence of Iraq's Shiite majority but also on its support -- or at least its tacit acceptance of a prolonged American presence. Before the war, the Pentagon's planners apparently believed that this would not be a great problem. The Shiite tradition in Iraq, they argued, was nowhere near as radical as it was in neighboring Iran. The planners also seem to have assumed that the overwhelming majority of Iraqi Shiites would welcome American forces as liberators -- an assumption based on the fact of the Shiite uprisings in southern Iraq in 1991, in the aftermath of the first gulf war. American officials do not seem to have taken seriously enough the possibility that the Shiites might welcome their liberation from Saddam Hussein but still view the Americans as unwelcome occupiers who would need to be persuaded, and if necessary compelled, to leave Iraq as soon as possible.
Again, an overestimation of the role of Ahmad Chalabi may help account for this miscalculation. Chalabi is a Shiite, and based on that fact, the Pentagon's planners initially believed that he would enjoy considerable support from Iraq's Shiite majority. But it rapidly became clear to American commanders on the ground in postwar Iraq that the aristocratic, secular Chalabi enjoyed no huge natural constituency in the country, least of all among the observant Shiite poor. 
The Americans gravely underestimated the implications of the intense religious feelings that Iraqi Shiites were suddenly free to manifest after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Making religious freedom possible for the Shiites was one of the great accomplishments of the war, as administration officials rightly claim. But the Shiites soon demonstrated that they were interested in political as well as religious autonomy. And although the Americans provided the latter, theircontinued presence in Iraq was seen as an obstacle to the former -- especially as the occupation dragged on and Secretary Rumsfeld warned of a "long, hard slog ahead."
After the war, American planners thought they might be able to engage with one of the most moderate of the important Shiite ayatollahs, Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim. He was rhetorically anti-American and yet was willing (and urged his followers) to establish a detente with the occupiers. Had he lived, he might have helped the Americans assuage Shiite fears and resentments. But Hakim was assassinated during Friday prayers in the holy city of Najaf on Aug. 29, along with more than 80 of his followers. At this point, it is not clear who the current American candidate is, although there are reports that American planners now believe they can work with and through Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.
Meanwhile, in the streets the anger of ordinary Shiites grows hotter. Every reporter who has been in Iraq has encountered it, even if administration officials think they know better. As Robert Perito argues, "One of the things that has saved the U.S. effort is that the Shiites have decided to cooperate with us, however conditionally." But, he adds, "if the Shiites decide that they can't continue to support us, then our position will become untenable." 
Although they are, for the most part, not yet ready to rebel, the Shiites' willingness to tolerate the American occupation authorities is growing dangerously thin. "We're happy the Americans got rid of Saddam Hussein," a young member of the Hawza in Sadr City told me. "But we do not approve of replacing 'the tyrant of the age"' -- as he referred to Hussein -- "with the Americans. We will wait a little longer, but we will fight if things don't change soon." 
Or as his sheik told me later that afternoon at the nearby mosque, so far they "have no orders" from their religious superiors to fight the Americans. Still, he warned, "we have been very nice to them. But the U.S. is not reciprocating." Last month, in the Shiite holy city of Karbala, the first firefights between American forces and Shiite militants took place, suggesting that time may be running out even more quickly than anyone imagined.

The Next Steps
In Iraq today, there is a steadily increasing disconnect between what the architects of the occupation think they are accomplishing and how Iraqis on the street evaluate postwar progress. And as the security situation fails to improve, these perceptions continue to darken.
The Bush administration fiercely denies that this "alarmist" view accurately reflects Iraqi reality. It insists that the positive account it has been putting forward is the real truth and that the largely downbeat account in much of the press is both inaccurate and unduly despairing. The corner has been turned, administration officials repeat.
Whether the United States is eventually successful in Iraq (and saying the mission "has to succeed," as so many people do in Washington, is not a policy but an expression of faith), even supporters of the current approach of the Coalition Provisional Authority concede that the United States is playing catch-up in Iraq. This is largely, though obviously not entirely, because of the lack of postwar planning during the run-up to the war and the mistakes of the first 60 days after the fall of Saddam Hussein. And the more time passes, the clearer it becomes that what happened in the immediate aftermath of what the administration calls Operation Iraqi Freedom was a self-inflicted wound, a morass of our own making. 
Call it liberation or occupation, a dominating American presence in Iraq was probably destined to be more difficult, and more costly in money and in blood, than administration officials claimed in the months leading up to the war. But it need not have been this difficult. Had the military been as meticulous in planning its strategy and tactics for the postwar as it was in planning its actions on the battlefield, the looting of Baghdad, with all its disastrous material and institutional and psychological consequences, might have been stopped before it got out of control. Had the collective knowledge embedded in the Future of Iraq Project been seized upon, rather than repudiated by, the Pentagon after it gained effective control of the war and postwar planning a few months before the war began, a genuine collaboration between the American authorities and Iraqis, both within the country and from the exiles, might have evolved. And had the lessons of nation-building -- its practice but also its inevitability in the wars of the 21st century -- been embraced by the Bush administration, rather than dismissed out of hand, then the opportunities that did exist in postwar Iraq would not have been squandered as, in fact, they were.
The real lesson of the postwar mess is that while occupying and reconstructing Iraq was bound to be difficult, the fact that it may be turning into a quagmire is not a result of fate, but rather (as quagmires usually are) a result of poor planning and wishful thinking. Both have been in evidence to a troubling degree in American policy almost from the moment the decision was made to overthrow Saddam Hussein's bestial dictatorship.

HEADLINE: FOR DEMOCRATS, ECONOMY'S SURGE POSES CHALLENGE 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
For more than two years now, the Democrats seeking the presidency have planned on running a 2004 campaign built around the weak economy and patterned after Bill Clinton's 1992 defeat of President Bush's father.
 But with the economy having surged this past quarter they are suddenly confronting the possibility of a far less encouraging historical comparison: that the election year economy could be more like the one Ronald Reagan ran on in 1984, when the country was coming out of a long slump. 
 The rapid change in the outlook -- underscored by figures released on Thursday showing the fastest quarterly economic growth since 1984 -- is already forcing the Democratic presidential candidates to calibrate their attack on Mr. Bush's economic record in ways they did not have to just a week ago. It has also left them in danger of looking as though they were clinging to economic gloom. 
Rather than simply lamenting the the economy, the Democrats now say that one good quarter does not erase three sluggish years. The growth has not caused a rebound in the job market, they note, and large budget deficits loom for years.
"For there to be a genuine recovery, it's got to happen in more than economic statistics," Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and a presidential candidate, said on Thursday on the campaign trail in Buffalo. "It's got to happen in the lives of America's middle class and those working hard to get into it."
Many Democrats say they still consider the economy an issue that will benefit them next year. President George Bush lost in 1992 even though employment began growing eight months before Election Day, they point out.
"I just think the likelihood -- I can't prove this in any way -- is that people are going to have uncertainty, not reassurance, about where the economy is headed," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, another presidential contender.
But even many Democratic campaign aides concede that their task has just become more difficult. A sustained recovery could reduce projected budget deficits that are at the core of their attacks on the administration's tax cuts. A turnaround might also cause the job market to improve early enough before Election Day to influence voters.
Adding to the Democrats' challenge is a fundamental economic reality that existed well before household and business spending soared this summer. As much as the economy weakened in the last three years, it was coming off such a high that it remains stronger by most measures than in the early 1990's. That high was reached on Mr. Clinton's watch, but it could help Mr. Bush next year.
The median weekly pay of American workers has risen faster than inflation over the last three years, a statement that could not have been made when Jimmy Carter, Mr. Reagan, the first President Bush or Mr. Clinton was gearing up for a re-election campaign. The price of houses nationwide has risen 22 percent since 2000. Stocks have fallen sharply over the same span but most investors made money in the last decade. 
In 1992, "there was a degree of economic pessimism that had gone on for years," said Gene Sperling, an economic aide to Mr. Clinton who has advised five of the nine Democratic candidates this year. 
Now, Mr. Sperling added, "there are still a substantial number of Americans who have had good economic times for a number of years."
The percentage of people who call the economy good has plummeted to 43 percent, from 84 percent when Mr. Bush took office, according to the most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll, which was taken before the latest economic news. But in an echo of other surveys, people remain more satisfied than they were in 1992, when about 20 percent of respondents gave the same answer.
In fact, while Mr. Bush's management of the economy receives lower approval ratings than Mr. Clinton's or Mr. Reagan's in their re-election campaigns, he does much better than his father or Mr. Carter.
"The economy doesn't dominate the scene as it did in '92," said Mark J. Penn, a pollster who advised Mr. Clinton and now works with Senator Lieberman. "But Bush is clearly vulnerable."
The Democratic case against the president revolves around the rising national debt and a severe hiring slump. Despite three tax cuts that Mr. Bush advertised as economic stimulus and that helped turn a $236 billion surplus in 2000 into a projected $374 billion deficit this year, the economy has lost almost three million jobs since he took office.
If the economy continues to improve, Democratic strategists say their party's nominee will need to emphasize the projected cuts in popular programs like education, Medicare and Social Security that the deficit could eventually require. Democrats say they will also remind voters that whatever job gains come in the next year, they are likely to be too small to prevent Mr. Bush from being the first president since Herbert Hoover to oversee a decline in employment.
"They had one great quarter," said Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist advising the campaign of Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont. "That's terrific. Let's see if they string four or five together and replace those three million jobs." 
For the last three years, companies have increased their output by becoming more efficient instead of adding workers. But forecasters expect the Labor Department to report the second straight gain in jobs when it releases its monthly employment report on Friday.
If the gains eventually become large enough to match the natural growth of the labor force -- 150,000 to 200,000 jobs a month -- the Democrats' argument could seem backward-looking to some voters.
White House officials have remained cautious, if quietly ebullient, since last week's economic report. They have credited the tax cuts for the growth revival but reiterated that they were not satisfied.
"The last piece of the recovery we need is jobs," said N. Gregory Mankiw, the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. "But we certainly have the fundamentals in place to expect that. And in the coming months, I think you'll see jobs coming back."
The challenges, and opportunities, facing the Democrats might be most evident in New Hampshire, site of the first presidential primary and one of the same nine states won by Mr. Clinton in the general elections in 1992 and 1996 and Mr. Bush in 2000.
In the early 1990's, the state was snared in a downturn people regularly called the worst since the Depression. House prices were falling, and a nationwide slowdown in productivity had caused wages to trail inflation for years.
In the 1992 New Hampshire Republican primary, Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, won 40 percent of the vote, offering a hint of voters' unhappiness with the White House. Today, the state is hardly prospering. Thousands of manufacturing jobs, particularly in technology, have disappeared. 
But New Hampshire residents still say the present bears little resemblance to 1991. The median price of a single-family homes has jumped 13 percent in just the last year, to $220,000, according to the Northern New England Real Estate Network. Wentworth by the Sea, a grand, century-old hotel that had sat empty since 1980, reopened this spring, in a sign of the tourism's strength. 
In the Republican primary, the president is not expected to face serious opposition. The Democratic candidates are spending hours talking about Iraq, a subject that Mr. Clinton and his 1992 rivals tended to avoid in favor of the economy.
"The state has real economic issues, but they're not in the front of people's minds," said Russ Thibeault, president of Applied Economic Research, a consulting firm in Laconia. Those issues "were like a thunderstorm when George Bush the first was running for re-election. Now it's like a drizzle."
The story looks similar in many other swing states. In economic terms, they offer hope to the Democrats, because many of them fall along an industrial spine running roughly from Michigan to Arkansas, which has suffered the full force of the recent downturn.
Compared with the rest of the country, jobs have disappeared more quickly, and incomes and house prices have grown more slowly in the nine states won by the winner in the last three presidential elections, according to Economy.com, a research company. Besides New Hampshire, the states are Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia.
"They're just getting pummeled by global competition and off-shore outsourcing," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com.
But polls still show people throughout these states to be more optimistic than they were 12 years ago. Midwesterners actually gave the economy a better rating than did people in any other region, according to the most recent ABC News/Money Magazine Consumer Index.

To the Editor:
Re "Rosier Picture, but for Those Who Saw Pink, Pain Lingers" (Working section, Oct. 28):
 I, like John Petergal, who was featured in your article, am on the north side of 50. 
I have devoted more than 30 years to a career in data processing. And I, like Mr. Petergal, greeted the new year by applying for unemployment. 
 If I were 30 years old, I would bite the bullet and retrain for a profession that might not move to India, but at my age (56), retraining will take time and money. 
Even with that, I will face a tough job search for a low-paying, entry-level position. Then, I will probably have to work till the day I die -- if I'm lucky enough to find continuous employment.

HEADLINE: Tiniest of Loans Bring Big Payoff, Aid Group Says 

BYLINE:  By KIRK SEMPLE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
An organization that promotes small loans for self-employment projects among the world's poorest people plans to announce here on Monday that it is on track to meet its nine-year goal of helping 100 million of the world's poorest families by 2005.
 The organization, Results Educational Fund, will report that as of the end of 2002, more than 2,500 institutions offering small-scale financial assistance, known as microcredit, have reached 41.6 million poor families worldwide. They were made to finance a vast array of businesses. including a Pakistani baker of papadum bread, a bicycle rickshaw agency in Bangladesh, a tortilla maker in El Salvador and a lawn-care business in South Florida. 
 "Some of the most important work in the world gets pushed aside by the loud emergencies: the wars, the fires, the earthquakes," said Sam Daley-Harris, the fund's president. "This report highlights how the very poor can -- and are -- being reached."
The fund's Microcredit Summit Campaign, involving donor agencies, banks, nongovernmental organizations and educational institutions, emerged from an international microcredit conference in 1997. Focusing on empowering women, it works to help people in the bottom half of those below the poverty line in developing countries, and all those below the poverty line in industrialized countries.
Microcredit programs make loans of as little as $20 to help poor people to turn income-generating activities into small businesses. Though microcredit programs focus mostly on the developing world, they also provide financial assistance to homespun enterprises in the industrialized world, including urban areas of the United States. 
Micro-lending agencies and larger financial institutions have been criticized for bypassing the world's poorest people in favor of clients who already have business experience. 
But Mr. Daley-Harris, in an interview on Sunday, said that lending institutions were working to redress that problem. What began as an investment option seen by traditional lenders with considerable doubt has proved increasingly attractive, even for commercial banks, who have started to get involved, he said.

HEADLINE: Casino Proposal Splinters A State Used to Consensus 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: SANFORD, Me., Oct. 29 

 BODY:
Bonnie Bea's Cafe and Gifts is a quiet little shop that sells buttery desserts and ceramic knickknacks, but these days it resounds with impassioned talk about one of the most divisive political battles to hit Maine in years.
 At issue is whether the state should allow a casino to be built in Sanford, a down-on-its-luck factory town of 20,000 people near the state's southern edge. And everywhere in Maine, but especially in Sanford, opposite sides are colliding at every turn. 
 "No!" shouted Jane and Don Meader, finishing up lunch at Bonnie Bea's, when asked if they supported the proposed casino.
"It's going to ruin Sanford, Maine," Ms. Meader said. 
But Bonnie Boisvert, the owner of the cafe and Mr. Meader's sister, begged to differ.
"Sanford needs something," Ms. Boisvert said. "There's a lot of people out of work."
On Tuesday, Maine will vote on whether to authorize a $650 million casino resort proposed by two Indian tribes and a Las Vegas casino developer.
The opposing sides have spent $9.5 million so far in what has been the most expensive campaign in state history.
And rarely has there been such an unlikely assemblage of political allies. 
Opposing the casino are the Democratic governor, John E. Baldacci, and several liberal groups, but also conservative Christians and many big businesses. In favor of the casino are some conservative, pro-business interests, but also labor unions and some liberals who see it as a way to help the Indian tribes.
"Maine is a pretty consensual, agreeable state and doesn't usually have really seriously divisive issues," said Oliver Woshinsky, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Southern Maine. "This is more divisive than most, and it cuts across so many different lines in so many odd ways." 
The vote could reverberate across New England, which, except for Connecticut, has remained casino-free. Proposals in Massachusetts and Rhode Island met enough resistance to quash them. A casino in Maine might put pressure on lawmakers in those states.
Sanford opened the door for a casino last year in a narrow vote.
The casino would be one of the largest construction projects in the state, a six-story complex with slot machines and gambling tables as well as a convention center, an 18-hole golf course, a theater and an 875-bed hotel. It would be owned by the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot tribes, though far from their reservations, and tribal profits would be an estimated $50 million to $100 million a year.
"Money makes things happen," said Barry Dana, the Penobscot chief. "You look across Indian country and there's no other project that has produced revenues overnight like casinos."
Casino advocates, whose group is Think About It, have spent less time promoting the benefits to Indians than pitching what they consider advantages for the state.
Maine would get 25 percent of the slot machine revenue, or about $100 million a year, which would exceed the total corporate income tax collected by Maine last year.
Proponents say the project would create about 2,000 construction jobs, about 4,700 casino jobs and 5,000 jobs in surrounding communities.
"This is really about a jobs issue for the state of Maine," said Erin Lehane, the spokeswoman for Think About It.
Anti-casino forces, organized under the name Casinos No!, have many objections. They say a casino would play havoc with traffic and housing, foster crime and addiction and exacerbate poverty. Some oppose gambling on moral grounds, while others say that if there has to be a casino, the state could have gotten a better deal: more money or a more flexible contract.
And many say a gambling hall is simply antithetical to the state's rugged, wholesome image.
Dennis Bailey, a spokesman for Casinos No!, cited Tom's of Maine, a company that makes natural toothpaste, shampoo and deodorant.
"When people pick up a tube of Tom's of Maine toothpaste in California, it calls up a certain image," Mr. Bailey said. "If it was Tom's of Atlantic City, I'm not sure it will have the same cachet. Given enough time, everything Maine stands for will change."
The pro-casino campaign, which has spent $6.8 million, has been financed primarily by Marnell Corrao Associates, the developer of gambling palaces like the Bellagio and the Mirage in Las Vegas.
Casinos No! has spent $2.7 million from a mix of small donations and large contributions from L.L. Bean; the credit card company MBNA; and wealthy businessmen with second homes in Maine, including S. Donald Sussman, a financier, and John C. Malone, a cable television magnate.
Accusations have been flying on both sides.
A Casinos No! commercial showed children pulling slot machine levers, suggesting the complex would have a "kiddie casino." Casino advocates at first replied that minors would stay in a separate arcade but later said they would participate only in occasional charitable carnivals.
Think About It suggested that some opponents were prejudiced against Indians. At a Chamber of Commerce forum, Ms. Lehane, the group's spokeswoman, played a voice-mail message with the phrase "the only good Indian is a dead Indian." It was left by a woman who called campaign headquarters. Ms. Lehane also showed a sign saying, "We took your land -- Get over it!," which she said had been placed in the yard of a Sanford casino supporter who is part Indian.
Casinos No! said those incidents did not represent the views of most opponents and accused Ms. Lehane of injecting race into the debate.
Recent polls show opponents gaining a little ground, but the battle is still too close to call.
In general, people in southern Maine, a more prosperous and populous region that is closer to the casino, are more likely to oppose it. Residents of rural and fading industrial towns elsewhere in the state are more likely to support it.
In Sanford, things are especially contentious. A Casinos No! sign on Carol Cabana's lawn was burned, and Mark Stuart says somebody pulled his "Yes" signs down. Ms. Boisvert, the owner of Bonnie Bea's, said casino opponents had boycotted a charity toy drive she had held.
Supporters and opponents alike here are seizing on shreds of information and supposition.
Joseph M. Trumble Jr., 57, a retired General Electric worker, said casino jobs would help him and others who "can't make a living on just getting retirement pay."
But Chris Hull, 29, an opponent originally from Westchester County, N.Y., said that many jobs would be filled by out-of-staters and that "the promise of jobs is an empty promise."
Maxine Kit, 65, said she would leave her hometown of 16 years if the casino came, in part because of traffic and sewer overload.
But Barbara Ward, 60, said there would be "less crime because you'd have fewer people out of work."
In the cafe, Ms. Meader said the casino would bring prostitution and poverty because "people who can't afford to gamble are going to gamble."
If Sanford residents agree on anything, it is that it will be better to have the casino vote behind them.
"I hate it, I hate it, I hate it," Ms. Boisvert said. "I can't wait for it to be over, whether it goes through or not."

MostTV Spots Sold 3 Months Before Super Bowl

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
Three months before kickoff, CBS has already sold 80 percent of the available commercial time during Super Bowl XXXVIII to advertisers that include newcomers like Procter & Gamble along with mainstays like Anheuser-Busch, General Motors and PepsiCo. 
 The robust demand for commercials in the broadcast, on Feb. 1, comes despite average prices of $2.3 million to $2.4 million for a 30-second spot, about 8 percent higher than in the 2003 Super Bowl. Big events, it turns out, are still drawing large numbers of viewers even as the rest of the television audience continues to fragment. 
 The disappointing results so far for most new series introduced by the broadcast networks at the start of the prime-time season, along with a fall-off in male viewers in the prized 18-to-34-year-old range, underline why many advertisers are clamoring to sponsor coverage of big events. Among those top shows: the Super Bowl, the World Series, the Grammys, the National Collegiate Athletic Association playoffs and the Academy Awards. 
 "It's a flight to safety," said Tom McGovern, director for sports marketing at OMD in New York, a unit of the Omnicom Group. "You pretty much know what you are going to get." His group is buying commercial time in the Super Bowl for clients like FedEx, Visa and the Frito-Lay and Pepsi-Cola divisions of PepsiCo as well as spots in the Oscar telecast for PepsiCo and Visa. 
 "The beauty of the Super Bowl is that it hasn't been impacted by the erosion of viewership and ratings that has affected the rest of television," Mr. McGovern added. "The ability to reach half the population at one time is still there."
 As for the high price tag, he said, "the rate of inflation for the Super Bowl hasn't been on par with prime time this season. I hate to use the word 'bargain,' but it's a price relative to the goals and needs."
 The last time CBS broadcast the Super Bowl, in January 2001, advertising spots were sold for about $2.3 million for each 30 seconds. (CBS rotates coverage with ABC and Fox Broadcasting.) Three months before Super Bowl XXXV, CBS records indicate, commercial time was about 65 percent sold.
 The fervor for Super Bowl spots complements what has been "a pretty healthy marketplace" for commercial time in the regular-season games of the National Football League, said Jo Ann Ross, president for sales at CBS in New York, and there are signs of strong demand for spots in the playoff rounds before Super Sunday, too.
 In addition to selling 80 percent of the 60 spots planned to appear during the Super Bowl broadcast, CBS has already sold the major sponsorships in the pre-and postgame shows as well as the sponsorship of the halftime show, which was bought by the America Online unit of Time Warner. AOL will also advertise during the game, as will other marketers like Gillette, the Monster job-search Web site, Universal Pictures and Warner Brothers.
 "For sure, there's risk to it," said Peter Gardiner, partner and chief media officer at the new agency for Monster, Deutsch in New York, part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. "But there's the size of the audience you're talking to, and that rare thing -- consumers interested enough in your advertising that they look forward to it."
 He referred to the phenomenon of Super Bowl viewers' staying put during the breaks to watch the commercials, passing up the trips to the refrigerator that are all too common during advertising spots in commonplace programs.
 "Super Bowl advertising has taken on a life of its own," said David Blum, executive vice president at Eisner Communications in Baltimore, which conducts an annual survey to gauge consumer interest in the game and the sponsors. Indeed, in the 2003 survey, 14 percent of those responding said they "would tune in to the game to watch the commercials," he said, compared with 3 percent who said that in the first survey, in 1992.
 One reason viewers pay close attention to Super Bowl spots is that they have been conditioned to expect new, head-turning creative work -- replete with special effects, humor, celebrities, anthropomorphic animals and surprise endings. That is why many advertisers like FedEx now buy commercial time during the game only when they want to run showy, high-energy spots that have not appeared before.
 "You need new creative, and it needs to be higher in entertainment value than the stuff you run every day," said Brian Philips, vice president for United States marketing at FedEx in Memphis, which has advertised in the Super Bowl for many years.
 "Doing that brings a lot of value to us and helps move the needle for our business," Mr. Philips said, even taking into account the price of airtime, "which is actually pretty reasonable" if calculated on the cost for each 1,000 viewers.
 The commercial FedEx plans to run on Feb. 1 is scheduled as the second spot during the game, Mr. Philips said, after one for an Anheuser-Busch beer. It is being developed by the FedEx creative agency, BBDO Worldwide in New York, which also produced the spot FedEx ran during Super Bowl XXXVII on Jan. 26. That spot, called "Desert Island," Mr. Philips said, "did very well for us" among viewers and ad critics; it spoofed the plot of the film "Cast Away," in which Tom Hanks played an intrepid FedEx employee. 
 The next big event on the TV calendar is the Grammy Awards, also on CBS, on Feb. 8, followed by the Academy Awards, to be broadcast by ABC. In a schedule change by the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Oscars will be presented only four weeks after the Super Bowl, on Feb. 29, about half the usual interval between the two.
 That has not diminished demand for commercial time during the Academy Awards show, said Mike Shaw, president for sales and marketing at ABC Television. In fact, that broadcast has been completely sold for more than a month, he added, to advertisers that in addition to PepsiCo and Visa include Allstate, American Express, Eastman Kodak, General Motors and J.C. Penney. The average price for each 30-second spot there is about $1.5 million, compared with an average of $1.4 million in 2003.
 Unlike Super Bowl viewership, which rarely fluctuates based on the teams playing, Oscar ratings have lately risen and fallen based on the popularity of the films up for honors. Even so, "we don't end up spending a lot of time having that discussion" about the nominees with advertisers, Mr. Shaw said, because the show is typically the second most watched of the year behind the Super Bowl.
 And those viewers used to getting up from their chairs or couches when the Oscar commercials come on may want to put on their Super Bowl game faces, he added, because many of the Academy Awards advertisers "will be launching new creative, like the Super Bowl."

HEADLINE: Foreign Demand Increases Chip Sales 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE J. FLYNN 

 BODY:
Semiconductor makers have been down so long that they cannot quite believe that things are looking up again.
 Because of strong overseas sales and rising demand for wireless phones and mobile personal computers, the chip industry finally appears to be on the mend. This week, when the industry group representing the United States semiconductor business releases its annual forecast of chip sales for the next three years, it is expected to predict that in 2004 the worldwide chip industry will grow far more than the 16.5 percent to 17 percent that it forecast earlier this year. 
 While that will be a far cry from the 37 percent growth the chip industry enjoyed in 2000, it is a critical milestone for an industry that is seen as the bellwether of the electronics and personal computer industries. In the two decades before the slump, the industry grew an average of about 15 percent a year. But in recent years its strong growth, once almost as reliable as the sun rising in the morning, often vanished entirely. At best, the industry achieved single-digit gains. 
 "The momentum in the industry is building up rapidly," George M. Scalise, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said in an interview, pointing out that October was the seventh consecutive month that the chip industry had shown growth. "When you have numbers that significant, you have to conclude we're in the middle of an uptick."
 In month-to-month sales figures released Friday by the S.I.A., worldwide sales of semiconductors increased 6.5 percent to $14.4 billion in September over August, the largest monthly increase by percentage since 1990. Given the strength of September, quarterly revenues rose 17.5 percent over the third quarter of 2002.
 As good as it sounds, the biggest growth is not coming from the United States; instead the chip industry has discovered that its fortunes increasingly lie in Asia and Europe, analysts and industry executives say.
 Andy D. Bryant, chief financial officer at Intel, told analysts recently that the company's sales had been particularly strong in emerging markets like China, India and Russia. The entire Asia Pacific region, which includes China, set records for Intel last quarter, breaking the $3 billion mark for the first time and accounting for a stunning 42 percent of total sales.
 "One of the biggest drivers is China," said Mark Edelstone, a semiconductor analyst at Morgan Stanley. China has quickly become the industry's No.1 market for wireless phone handsets and the No.2 market for personal computers, he said.
 Mr. Scalise, the industry association's leader, said that at least part of the strong demand from China could be attributed to purchases delayed from earlier in the year, when the outbreak of the SARS virus briefly devastated the Hong Kong economy and wreaked havoc in several major cities in China. That strain subsided in March. But he expected demand from China to remain healthy. 
 By nearly all accounts, the fiscal third quarter gave semiconductor makers reason to be optimistic that sales over all were beginning to improve. In October, Intel and Texas Instruments reported better than expected sales in the last quarter. And Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's most direct competitor in the PC chip market, reported a far-smaller loss than expected. 
 At Texas Instruments, sales of semiconductors, the company's largest revenue generator, rose 16 percent over last year, because of improved sales in digital consumer electronics, the company said. Sales of chips for wireless products rose 30 percent over last year.
 Similarly, Intel reported that revenue for the third quarter grew 20 percent over last year, the fastest year-over-year growth in seven years. And if Intel achieves just the midpoint of its revenue forecast for the fourth quarter, that would amount to a 17 percent increase over the fourth quarter of last year, the highest the company has seen since 1998, Mr. Bryant, Intel's finance chief, said. 
 The good news comes as corporate information technology spending in the United States, while still soft, is beginning to show signs of improvement. Mr. Bryant, with characteristic caution, said it was still too early to call it a recovery. And despite the rebound in technology investment that the Commerce Department reported in its third-quarter figures for economic activity, many experts are waiting for the beginning of 2004 before they expect to see sustained improvement.
 Mr. Scalise said the industry was slowly beginning to see some improvement in demand for "infrastructure" semiconductors, for use in devices like communications hubs and network routers. He pointed to the passage earlier this year of the new tax measure that changes the depreciation schedule for corporate technology purchases, giving companies added incentive to make new computer purchases before the end of 2004.
 "There are substantial cost advantages," Mr. Scalise said, "to buying replacement I.T. products over the next 12 months."

HEADLINE: Spitzer to Question Fund Fees in Testimony 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
The New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, will say that mutual fund directors should be paying closer attention to the fees charged to shareholders, according to a draft of testimony he plans to make today before a United States Senate panel.
 Mr. Spitzer estimates that last year mutual funds paid advisory fees of more than $50 billion, along with other management fees of nearly $20 billion. 
 "Fund directors do not -- and cannot -- negotiate hard on the fees" under the current system, he says, according to the transcript, which was obtained yesterday. "What else would you expect when the chairman of the mutual fund is also the chairman of the advisory company" that manages the fund, the transcript says. 
 Mr. Spitzer, who is conducting a broad investigation into improper trading of mutual funds, will be testifying today before the subcommittee on financial management of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
 Mr. Spitzer cites data indicating that mutual fund fees over all have not declined over the last two decades, even as a soaring stock market has drawn American households to invest large sums in the funds. Assets grew by 60 times between 1980 and 2000, Mr. Spitzer says, citing Vanguard funds' founder, John C. Bogle. But the funds' fees and expenses grew by 90 times during that period, he says.
 Matthew Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute, the trade association for the mutual fund industry, questioned those numbers. "Every study we've seen by independent parties shows fees going down over time," he said.
 In the transcript, Mr. Spitzer argues that investors in pension funds are charged far lower fees for the management of their funds than individual investors, even though the same company is managing the money. Individuals are charged .25 percent more a year in fees than pension fund investors, Mr. Spitzer says.
 That difference, while seemingly small on an annual basis, adds up, Mr. Spitzer says. A couple who invested $100,000 in mutual funds over 10 years and had an annual return of 8 percent would save almost $6,000 if fees were lowered by that much, he says. 
 Mr. Fink said that the comparison between pension fund and individual fund account fees was faulty. "What is charged to a pension fund is simply an advisory fee," he said, while individuals are paying for all sorts of other account management services provided by the fund. 
 In the transcript, Mr. Spitzer quotes from testimony to the Senate more than 35 years ago by the economics professor and Nobel laureate Paul A. Samuelson. "I decided that there was only one place to make money in the mutual fund business -- as there is only one place for a temperate man to be in a saloon, behind the bar and not in front of the bar," Mr. Samuelson said. "So I invested in a management company."
 Mr. Spitzer says that mutual fund directors should negotiate harder to obtain lower fees for investors. "The managers must know that if they do not lower their fees and improve their performance, they will be replaced," he says. 
 Mr. Spitzer adds that if fund directors had paid more attention to the flows of money in and out of the portfolios they oversaw, some improper trading could have been prevented.
 He says that several funds managed by Fred Alger Management had total redemptions by shareholders that were far greater than the funds' assets under management, indicating that investors were trading in and out of the funds at a very rapid clip.
 For one Alger fund, Mr. Spitzer claims, redemptions by shareholders last year were more than 17 times greater than the fund's average assets under management. "And yet the directors didn't ask any questions," he says.
 Last month, Mr. Spitzer announced a settlement of criminal charges against a former Alger executive, James P. Connelly Jr., over allegations of tampering with evidence sought by Mr. Spitzer's office. Mr. Connelly also reached a civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over trading by certain investors in and out of Alger's funds.
 A representative for Alger said yesterday that there was a lot of trading into and out of its funds after the terrorists attacks in 2001. Alger had headquarters in the World Trade Center and lost many of its employees in the attacks. The firm said it did not believe that the trading was related to market timing.

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON MONDAY/Design; 
Now on Display, Engines Dressed Up to Tell a Story

BYLINE:  By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
UNDER the hood is the last frontier of automobile design," said David Laituri, who was a pioneer in the engine-compartment territory when he was a designer at General Motors.
 Mr. Laituri, now an industrial designer at the Design Continuum, a Boston-area consulting firm, began his career in the late 1980's as a member of the first G.M. design team devoted to engine compartments. He was responsible for the cover atop the original Cadillac Northstar V-8 engine, one of the first of a new crop of engines that automakers stamped with a distinct brand identity. 
 Today, named and covered engines are everywhere, their mechanical bits concealed by plastic shields that dominate engine compartments. The shrouds also provide a billboard on which automakers can display logos and deliver subtle messages hinting at what lies beneath. 
Photographs of suggestively shaped engine covers have even begun to supplement shots of cars on curvy roads in the marketing materials of automakers. Infiniti's promotional materials, for instance, feature the styled cover of the 4.5-liter V-8 engine from its flagship Q45 sedan. In a photograph, the sculptured black engine cover is softly lighted to make it look as if it is carved from basalt. Light plays over the stone's surface, suggesting the gravitas of the Black Stone of Mecca or the monolith in "2001: A Space Odyssey."
 "Under-hood appearance has been an issue for Nissan for about 10 years, although we've really gotten serious within the last four to five," said Sheldon Payne, a product design manager at Nissan Design America, the company's California studio. "Engine covers have been an easy way to address part of our concern, especially since so little routine maintenance is now required. We can create a nice impression with relatively low cost by designing a cover to hide the 'mess.' Our intention is to reassure customers that things have been seen to."
In the days when there was enough room around the engine to see the ground below, the engineer alone ruled the space under the hood. When Mr. Laituri was hired by G.M., he was fresh out of industrial design school. "It was just me, a couple of kids and two old guys left over from the Frigidaire division," he recalled. 
But the concept of applying a styling theme to areas not always in the customer's view was beginning to catch on.
"Design had recently cleaned up trunks and glove compartments." Mr. Laituri said. "We rethought the motor and came up with a theme: a diamond on a black velvet pillow. That meant blacking out everything possible around the engine -- all the wires and pipes -- and covering the engine with a faceted shape bearing the Cadillac crest and shield. The idea was to emphasize high technology. It was not going to be just an engine. It was a power plant." 
When the group began, Mr. Laituri recalled, the dipstick for the oil and the dipstick for the transmission fluid looked different and had different typefaces. "At a meeting, I led the oil dipstick engineer over to the transmission fluid dipstick engineer and introduced them. A few years later, I looked under the hood of a G.M. show car and saw the dipsticks with the same typeface. It was a great moment."
Designers like Gary Braddock, a design manager in Ford's product studio, regularly cite 1920's Duesenbergs and especially Bugattis as having the most beautiful engine compartments. And exotic sports cars, including some from Ferrari and Lamborghini, proudly display their engines under a transparent hood, the better to show off finely wrought pieces and neatly detailed wires and hoses. 
Tom Matano has been watching under-hood design since he was called on to improve engine compartment appearances in one of his first jobs, at Holden, G.M.'s Australian subsidiary. Mr. Matano, who was also a designer at Mazda and BMW, is now director of industrial design at the Academy of Art College in San Francisco. "It all started with pony cars and muscle cars -- those big air cleaners pushing out through the hood," Mr. Matano said. 
Years later, Japanese automakers began to clean up wiring harnesses and the plumbing needed to circulate coolant as a way to suggest economical efficiency, while high-end German automakers were early adopters of full covers on V-8's and V-12's to imply technological precision.
Engine covers have also been called on to help establish brand identity. The covers began to display company logos and, increasingly, new engine designations. What were once informal, garage-gossip nicknames, like the Ford "flathead" or Chrysler "slant six," became formal appellations like the Cadillac Northstar, the Ford Triton or the G.M. Quad 4. Some of the attention that went into chrome engine logos on the car's body -- such as Ford's wonderful nesting of the number 8 in the valley of the V in the 1930's -- was now directed to locations seen far less regularly by motorists.
The Northstar example of elevating the engine's brand identity seems to have inspired later efforts. "It was like the 'Intel inside' campaign," Mr. Laituri said. 
According to Mr. Braddock of Ford, the intake system of the first Taurus SHO engine of 1989 was reshaped by designers in a high-tech, nylon-based thermoplastic for both better air flow and better appearance. The SHO's "bucket of guts" look is still admired by other designers. 
Chrysler has recently revived the Hemi name for its engines. The designation was originally applied to powerful engines that dominated stock-car racing in the 1960's thanks to their hemispherical combustion chambers, which were advanced at the time. But the evolution of engine technology has relegated the layout of the original Hemi engine to history's dustbin; it is left for the engine cover in the Chrysler 300C and Dodge Magnum models to reflect the tradition in a decorative, curved-roof shape. 
These days, the dominant typologies of engine covers seem to run in three main streams. The first is exemplified by the bulging contours of bodybuilders -- the "six-pack abs" look, worthy of an advertisement for an exercise machine. 
At the other extreme is the ribbed box, as seen on BMW's "M Power" engines, which resembles the sort of huge amplifiers that young owners install to give a car audio system window-rattling bass. This is the "engine as power supply" and it even seems to wear the cooling fins of an electronic component. In a world where digital is light-years cooler than mechanical, why should an engine cover not suggest high-tech electronic components?
A third type is the framing of a sculptured air intake system of thermoplastic, molded into a "nest of vipers" shape. That look, made famous by the Taurus SHO, is seen today in Audi's high-performance S models.
Those who recall older engines, with each part readily identifiable, find the covers have taken away something vital.
"Things are certainly neater," Mr. Matano said wistfully. "But the engine no longer looks like the beating mechanical heart of the car. It looks more and more like an appliance."

HEADLINE: City Comptroller's Fiscal Report Shows More Reasons for Smiles 

BYLINE:  By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Higher property and sales taxes, along with increased real estate values, combined with tightfisted budgeting to help New York City end its fiscal year in June in the black, according to a report issued by the city comptroller yesterday.
 The annual report on the state of the city's finances has few revelations, but it confirms recent indications that the economic clouds are lifting and that the city, if not at risk of a sunburn, can at least put away the umbrella. 
 The comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., said that in addition to closing a $6 billion gap in last year's $44 billion budget, the city has available more than $1.4 billion to help balance thebudget for the year that ends next June. City officials, however, are already projecting a $2 billion shortfall for the fiscal year that starts next July 1. 
Much of the extra money last fiscal year came from the 18.5 percent increase in the property tax that took effect at the end of 2002 and helped generate an additional $1.3 billion. Real estate taxes, in general, were up because of higher market values for property in the city, as were taxes on real estate transactions, the report said.
In addition, a rebound in tourism was credited with increasing sales tax revenues. Also, city officials have said recently that increased profits from the securities industry are expected to bring larger tax revenues from businesses in the year ahead.
On the downside, the increased revenue from real estate, sales and cigarette taxes was partly offset by a decline in income tax receipts, a weak spot that the comptroller said reflected lower employment, a continuing threat to the city's otherwise brighter fiscal outlook.
"Even more than the nation," the report said, "the city's labor market has been weak, and household employment data suggest that a significant number of city residents have either left or have given up looking for employment."
The Bloomberg administration, seeking to keep a tight lid on spending, has asked its department heads to find an additional $300 million in savings in the current year's budget, to put the city in a better position for the following year.
The comptroller's report shows that, despite the success in cutting costs, some expenses are hard to control.
Overtime for all city agencies, for instance, cost $288 million more than expected. Also, professional services contracts for the Department of Education cost $200 million more than what was originally budgeted, and contracts for computer services citywide nearly doubled, to $141 million.

HEADLINE: Frank McCloskey, 64, Former Congressman 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Ind., Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Frank McCloskey, a six-term congressman from Indiana who spoke out for human rights in the Balkans, died here on Sunday. He was 64. 
 The cause was bladder cancer. 
 Mr. McCloskey, a Democrat who represented the Eighth District, in southwestern Indiana, from 1983 to 1995, made several trips to Bosnia during his years in Congress, and in 1992 called for selective air strikes against Serbian forces if they continued their siege of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
He later criticized the Clinton administration's handling of the Bosnian conflict, warning that Serbs were committing genocide in Bosnia. 
Mr. McCloskey entered politics in 1972, when, as a third-year law student at Indiana University, he ran for mayor of Bloomington. He outpolled a former mayor in the Democratic primary and defeated the Republican incumbent in the fall. He served as mayor for 10 years and was credited with obtaining federal money to help improve city services and revitalize downtown.
Mr. McCloskey was born in Philadelphia on June 12, 1939. He went to high school in Norristown, Pa., and entered the Navy immediately after graduation. After his discharge in 1961, he joined The City News Bureau, a news service in Chicago, and later The Bloomington Herald Tribune, where he covered politics and City Hall, putting himself through college and law school.
In 2002, Mr. McCloskey was named director of Kosovo programs for the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, where he was teaching leaders how to govern democratically.
He is survived by his wife of more than 30 years, Roberta, and their two children, Helen and Mark.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Survey Says Hospitals Are Weakest In New York 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Hospitals in New York State are by far the nation's weakest financially -- so weak that nearly half of them have a hard time raising the money needed to invest in renovated wards, new ambulances and improved computer systems, according to a national analysis released last week.
 Dividing all hospitals into three categories by their ability to raise cash, the report says that in 2001, 43 percent of New York's hospitals fell into the bottom group, with "limited access to capital," compared with 19 percent nationally. The report, by the Healthcare Financial Management Association, a national health industry group, and GE Healthcare Financial Services, with research from PricewaterhouseCoopers, says that the top group, with "broad access" to money for capital projects, included 36 percent of hospitals nationwide, but just 8 percent of those in New York. In both groups, New York ranked last among the states. 
 Hospitals' ability to raise money outside of day-to-day operations -- through philanthropy, for example, or selling bonds or real estate -- has suffered lately. The report says the amount they raised fell from $51.4 billion nationally in 2001 to $36.5 billion in 2002, and the true drop was even greater, because a large part of last year's figure represents refinancing of old debt.
But the decline, and the financial troubles underlying it, have not been evenly spread. The report says that over the last several years, hospitals in the top category slipped only slightly by most financial measures, while those in the bottom group -- and, by extension, many New York hospitals -- lost ground much faster.
The report cites "a widening gap between the haves and the have-nots," with New York accounting for a disproportionate share of the have-nots. New Jersey's hospitals fared a bit below the nation's as a whole in 2001, the report says, and Connecticut's did substantially better.
"The industry is strangulated if it's denied access to capital," and that "has been a real worry of mine for some time," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, the metropolitan area's main trade group.
When hospitals have trouble borrowing or raising money, he said, it means they are slower to make the improvements that they finance over several years rather than paying cash: building new buildings or refurbishing old ones, buying or leasing expensive machinery like CAT scans, or upgrading the computers that handle everything from pharmacy orders to patient billing. Patient care suffers, he said, and so does the hospitals' financial performance.
The number of hospitals nationwide in the "limited access" category rose sharply, from 11 percent in 1997 to 19 percent in 2001. While the report did not name specific hospitals, the troubles of New York hospitals are plain to see in just this year's events. Several hospitals around the state, including the Caledonian campus of Brooklyn Hospital Center and St. Agnes Hospital in White Plains, have closed or their closings have been announced. And the closing of St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan was averted by takeovers by larger hospitals. And some hospitals, like St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, have struggled to cut tens of millions of dollars from their budgets, while others have closed outpatient clinics.
Hospitals around the country have been squeezed by insurance companies' and governments' efforts to cut costs, and a sharp decline in charitable fund-raising since the recession two years ago. New York City's hospitals have been especially hard hit by the drop in philanthropy, as well as shrinking federal support for teaching hospitals, a large uninsured population and the aftereffects of 9/11. The report shows a sharp rise in hospitals' selling their real estate holdings.
Critics, including Wall Street analysts, politicans and scholarly researchers, have argued over the years that the city has more hospitals than it can support and that they are inefficient, and that a little winnowing might be a healthy thing.
The report shows that hospitals that were in the worst condition in 1997 have also suffered most since then -- their patient volumes have shrunk most, their debt payments have grown most and their operating profit and loss picture has soured most. The figures show "a widening gap between the haves and the have-nots," the report says.
From 1997 to 2001, operating margins at hospitals with good access to capital slipped only slightly, to an average of 4.7 percent from 5.2 percent over expenses. But those in the fast-growing "limited access" group had sharper losses, to 7.3 percent from 1.5 percent. 
The hardest-hit geographic areas are also those whose economies depend most heavily on the health care industry, like New York City, Boston and Philadelphia, the report says.

HEADLINE: At Sniper Trial, an Introductory Phase Ends With Arrest Details and a Clinical Phase Begins 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: VIRGINIA BEACH, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
For several weeks last fall, people watched Whitney Donahue, a supermarket refrigerator repairman, with nervousness bordering on terror. It was his truck, he says: a white Ford Econoline van, similar to the vehicle the police thought the Washington-area sniper was driving.
 So when Mr. Donahue learned on Oct. 23, 2002, that the police had identified the sniper's car as a blue 1990 Chevrolet Caprice, he was more than a little relieved. He jotted down that car's New Jersey license plate as it was read on the radio -- NDA-21Z -- then headed home to Greencastle, Pa., from a job in Virginia. 
 Less than two hours later, at a rest stop near Myersville, Md., Mr. Donahue's headlights illuminated a battered Caprice. It was dark blue with New Jersey plates, NDA-21Z.
"As I read the tag off, I said, 'Oh man,' " Mr. Donahue told jurors on Monday in the trial of John A. Muhammad, the man accused of masterminding the sniper shootings.
Mr. Donahue called the police, and two hours later, an elite F.B.I. team dressed in black flight suits and body armor stormed the Caprice, arresting Mr. Muhammad and Lee B. Malvo, who is accused of being his accomplice. 
"We felt the safest way was to take them by surprise," testified Charles Pierce, the leader of the team from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
With the testimony on Monday, prosecutors closed the first phase of their case, one filled with emotional appearances by victims' relatives, wrenching 911 tapes and graphic descriptions of wounds. Over two weeks, prosecutors have presented evidence from 16 shootings, 10 of them fatal, that they say the defendants carried out in four states and the District of Columbia last fall.
Next, the prosecution plans to move into a less dramatic but potentially more significant phase of its case. They plan to introduce the dry forensic evidence -- fingerprints, ballistics tests and property seized from the Caprice -- that they say will conclusively show that Mr. Muhammad instigated, organized and helped carry out the killings. 
Mr. Muhammad is charged in only one killing, that of Dean H. Meyers, a 53-year-old engineer, who was shot while pumping gas at a Sunoco station in Manassas, Va., on Oct. 9, 2002. 
Similarly, Mr. Malvo has been charged in only the killing of Linda Franklin, an F.B.I. analyst who was shot outside a Home Depot in Falls Church, Va., on Oct. 14, 2002.
But both men face the death penalty if found guilty under Virginia laws that authorize capital punishment for committing multiple murders over a three-year period and for killing as an act of terrorism. Prosecutors contend the pair wanted to spread fear to extort $10 million from local governments. 
For more than three hours on Monday afternoon, prosecutors began introducing jurors to the crucial pieces of evidence they collected from Mr. Muhammad's Caprice last October. 
Most important of these was the Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle that investigators say they found hidden behind the rear seat. Ballistics tests show the rifle was used to kill at least eight people, prosecutors say. 
As Timothy Curtis, a supervisor at the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, testified, Richard Conway, an assistant commonwealth attorney, paraded the rifle in front of jurors twice as he showed it to a Maryland detective on the witness stand. As he walked about the court carrying the weapon, Mr. Muhammad watched intently. 
Investigators also found in the car a rifle scope hidden inside a pair of filthy white socks; a right-hand glove that matched a left-handed one near a shooting scene; a Sony laptop computer stolen from a Maryland restaurant owner; an electronic organizer; a pair of walkie-talkies; and books about the I Ching, Taoism and the Black Power movement. 
In the coming days, prosecutors are expected to argue that the computer and electronic organizer contained information showing the efforts of Mr. Muhammad and Mr. Malvo to plot the shootings. 
Investigators also found a slip of paper with the names and addresses of schools in the Baltimore area. Prosecutors contend that the pair were planning to single out children to spread panic.

HEADLINE: This Can't Go On 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Academic economists often cite Stein's Law, a principle enunciated by the late Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Nixon administration. The law comes with various wordings; my favorite is: "Things that can't go on forever, don't." Believe it or not, that's a useful reminder.
 For we're now led by men who think that macho posturing makes Stein's Law go away. On issues ranging from budgets to foreign policy, they insist that we can sustain the unsustainable. And when challenged to explain how, they engage in magical thinking. 
 The prime example I have hammered on in this column is, of course, the federal budget. Realistic budget projections say that current policies aren't remotely sustainable. For example, a month ago a joint report of the Committee for Economic Development (a business group), the bipartisan Concord Coalition and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities concluded that under current policies, federal debt would rise by $5 trillion over the next decade. And then baby boomers will start collecting benefits, and our debt will really explode. 
Such explosive growth in debt can't go on forever, and it won't. Yet our current leaders and their apologists insist that the problem will magically solve itself. Last year's deficit came in slightly below forecasts, and we've had one quarter of good economic growth -- see, we'll grow out of the deficit!
But we won't, and there will eventually be a day of reckoning. As Bill Gross of Pimco, the giant bond manager, says, "Sooner, perhaps later, our Asian creditors will wake up and smell the coffee." (Yes, the federal budget and the value of the dollar now depend on huge purchases of Treasury bills by the governments of Japan and China.) When they do, he predicts "higher import costs, a cutback in spending on cheap foreign goods, rising inflation, perhaps chaotic financial markets, a lower standard of living." Something to look forward to.
But the day of reckoning seems closer on a different front. 
Some Americans may share the views of the Republican congressman who said that progress in Iraq was "a better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day." (Support the troops!)
But whether or not you think troop losses are important, there's growing evidence that our Iraq strategy is unsustainable. The immediate issue is manpower. Some politicians are calling for a bigger force in Iraq -- but even our current force levels can't be maintained.
In September the Congressional Budget Office analyzed how many U.S. soldiers could be kept in Iraq without extending tours beyond one year. The conclusion was that force levels would have to start dropping rapidly about five months from now, and that the forces in Iraq and Kuwait would eventually have to shrink by almost two-thirds. As the report explains, the Pentagon can use various expedients to maintain a larger force in Iraq, but all of these expedients would threaten to undermine our military readiness. 
At a broader level, the accelerating pace at which Americans are being killed and wounded and the strains of occupation duties clearly pose difficulties for recruitment in a volunteer military. And at a still broader level, public support for this war -- whose original rationale has turned out to be a mirage, if not a deliberate deception -- will wilt if losses go on at this rate, no matter how tough the president talks.
For sure, good things are happening in Iraq. But are we making the kind of progress that would allow us to withdraw large numbers of soldiers, and greatly reduce casualties, in the fairly near future? That's a hard case to make.
Yet we keep expecting a magic solution. We'll get European, Indian and Pakistani forces to help us! But since we went to war without international support, they're not interested. We'll bring in the Turks! But the Iraqi Governing Council itself is bitterly opposed. We'll engage in "Iraqification," creating local forces that take the place of American troops! Let's hope that works -- but hope is not a plan.
Just as the federal government is in no immediate danger of running out of money, our forces in Iraq are in no danger of outright defeat. But in both cases, current policies appear to be unsustainable: we can't go on like this indefinitely. And things that can't go on forever, don't.

HEADLINE: Foul Water and Air Part of Cost Of the Boom in China's Exports 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: TAIZHOU, China 

 BODY:
The first thing that struck Shen Yunxiang when he descended into the bowels of Hisun Pharmaceutical was the smell, or rather the lack of it. It was as if the sewage system had been scrubbed with ammonia, he said, leaving only a sickly sweet aroma strong enough to overpower the stench of human waste.
 In less than a minute, though, he realized that the company had exposed him to something far more noxious than feces. He had been sent, unwittingly, to release chemical runoff that Hisun had collected haphazardly beneath the factory, possibly to avoid paying fees to dispose of toxic waste. 
 Mr. Shen's chest constricted. His breathing grew labored, his head faint. Then Feng Huaping, his brother-in-law and fellow migrant worker, who had climbed down first, gasped, "Grab my hand, get me out," before collapsing in a puddle of muck. 
Mr. Shen was the lucky one. He emerged with migraines and lung congestion, and doctors are still trying to diagnose the illness that is causing them. Mr. Feng died that night. A third migrant worker, Tang Dejun, also died in Hisun's fetid plumbing after he was sent down to finish the job the next day. 
Hisun is one of China's leading exporters of pharmaceutical products, certified by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European drug commission to sell lifesaving antitumor and cardiovascular medications for prices Western manufacturers cannot match.
But the company may pay more attention to fighting cancer in America than to protecting the health of its own workers and neighbors in Taizhou, a seaside industrial city where the air and water bear Hisun's inky signature.
Hisun declined to answer detailed written questions about the incident, as did the police in Taizhou. But a local government official confirmed the deaths, which occurred in August, and said they were the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation. The official said he did not know the cause of the deaths. 
Hisun has sprouted quickly, growing from a tiny state-owned drug maker to a pharmaceutical and chemical conglomerate, with shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and some powerful foreign partners. But company employees and local residents say that it has never stopped dumping untreated chemical waste around Taizhou, and that it has minimized or ignored the harmful effects of poisonous substances on its own workers.
"They were reckless to send us down there without protection," said Mr. Shen, now recuperating in a nearby hospital. "To send another guy down the next day is beyond belief. They have no regard for human life."
Such disregard appears all too common as China booms. The country's economy is growing faster than any other. But the air and water in many of its leading cities rank as the dirtiest in the world, and the number of people who die at work, 11,500 through the first nine months of this year, is far disproportionate to workplace fatalities in other countries.
Much of China's economic boom has stemmed from foreign investment and international partnership. Hisun itself has become partners with the Drug Source Company, a distributor of generic drugs based in Westchester, Ill.
The American company helped Hisun gain regulatory approval to make ingredients for a range of drugs, including the top-selling antitumor medication doxorubicin, used to treat cancer patients. The drugs sold in the United States are Hisun's most profitable product lines and are its fastest growing source of revenue, according to reports it has filed as a publicly listed company.
Drug Source did not answer phone and e-mail messages seeking comment about its relations with the company.
Hisun has undergone seven inspections by the Food and Drug Administration in recent years. They were intended to ensure that the company meets American standards for product safety. Hisun passed the inspections, and it is now certified to sell ingredients for at least eight medicines to the United States, all distributed by Drug Source.
Eli Lilly & Company has also joined with Hisun to produce Lilly's drug capreomycin, used to fight resistant strains of tuberculosis. Similar alliances have helped Hisun crack the European market for pravastatin sodium, which lowers cholesterol levels in heart patients.
A spokesman for Eli Lilly said the company had no knowledge of environmental or safety problems at Hisun. The F.D.A. declined to answer questions about its inspections of Hisun or its certification process.
Hisun's case suggests that the enormous human and environmental toll of China's rapid development is not just an unintended side effect but also an explicit choice of business executives and officials who tolerate deaths and degradation as the inevitable price of progress.
Taizhou's main industrial area, Yantou, where the Jiaojiang River meets the East China Sea, was historically popular among fishermen, who used the river as a sheltered harbor.
In the mid-1980's, the local government renamed the area the Yantou Pharmaceutical Chemical Industry Zone, with state-owned Hisun as the anchor tenant. Authorities built concrete barricades along the beach to protect factories from the tides, rendering parts of the seashore inaccessible.
Hisun initially focused on the Chinese market and produced antiparasite medicines used by veterinarians to treat farm animals. But during the past several years, it has ventured into foreign markets with the help of its North American allies.
Powered by exports, Hisun's sales are on track to hit $150 million this year, and its campus of white-and-blue tiled factories and offices has expanded to cover dozens of acres along the waterfront.
Yet one of Hisun's comparative advantages seems to be that it does not spend much money to treat toxic chemicals that are byproducts of producing these drugs.
Internal reports by local and national environmental investigators have found that each year, Hisun and other nearby companies release 3.6 million tons of water laden with organic and inorganic compounds that receive little or no processing.
Yantou's shoreline is edged with sludge. Inland, the air is sulfureous. Fishermen say river water and seawater causes their hands and legs to become ulcerated, in some extreme cases requiring amputation.
Some 1,700 villagers have left the area around Yantou in recent years, according to one national environmental report, which also showed elevated rates of cancer and respiratory disease among residents.
The effect on some of Hisun's own employees has also been severe.
Until recently Cao Hongshai was a Hisun assembly-line worker who made a deworming medicine that the F.D.A. approved for sale in the United States.
Ms. Cao said she used toluene, a toxic solvent, to produce the active ingredient in the drug. But she wore only a blue cotton uniform and worked in a room that had no special ventilation.
Ms. Cao says she has not suffered health problems except for irregular periods. But two years ago she gave birth to a girl who had stubs where eight of her fingers should have been.
Ms. Cao and her husband, Lin Jianyong, sued Hisun for damages. A report submitted to the court by the government-run Medical Information Institute in Zhejiang Province found a "clear correlation" between the child's defects and the chemicals used at Hisun. 
But local courts have consistently supported Hisun, and Mr. Lin and Ms. Cao have nearly exhausted the family's savings fighting the company.
Ms. Cao and Mr. Lin included "Hisun" in their daughter's name, so their daughter would always know that her deformity was the company's fault.
Local government officials have recently taken steps to clean up Yantou. Authorities opened a waste-water treatment facility just a short walk from Hisun's campus, and local companies are now required to channel their runoff there and pay for it to be processed.
Beijing has also expressed alarm. After two reporters for the New China News Agency wrote anunpublished internal report revealing Yantou's environment woes, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao ordered environmental and safety agencies to investigate, according to people who say they were told of the prime minister's intervention.
But by the accounts of Hisun employees and some local officials, the company became adept at fending off such inquiries.
On Aug. 14, word spread at Hisun that a central government inspection team was to arrive from Beijing. Employees said their managers became unusually active in seeking to clean up the facility.
Mr. Shen, the migrant worker who handled construction jobs for Hisun, noticed people bustling about the factory that day. But it was not until night that he and Mr. Feng were recruited to help the company prepare for inspections.
A boss came looking for Mr. Feng at the temporary shacks where he and Mr. Shen lived, together with their wives and young children, all of them migrants from southwestern Sichuan Province. Hisun's plant is nearby, across a foul-smelling canal that provides shipping passage to the sea.
The boss explained that Hisun had a problem that needed immediate attention. Mr. Feng, who led his own construction brigade, was told to pick a colleague and bring flashlights, a sledgehammer and a drill. Mr. Feng roused Mr. Shen, his brother-in-law.
Mr. Shen said the boss told them what to do. They were to knock down barricades that had been built inside Hisun's sewage system to redirect the flow of liquid waste. He did not explain why. 
It seems quite likely, some other employees and local residents said, that the company had diverted waste water to avoid paying fees to have it processed, and that pending inspections prompted the company to restore the flow.
Mr. Feng stripped off his shirt and climbed down a manhole. Mr. Shen followed a few steps behind. He said he expected to smell human waste, but instead encountered the light chemical odor. He felt dizzy.
Mr. Feng had just begun working below when he cried out and reached for help. Mr. Shen grabbed his bare arm, wet and slippery, and pulled with all his strength. He tugged so hard that he bit off the tip of his tongue. The shot of pain in his mouth is his last memory that night.
When Mr. Shen regained consciousness two days later, blurry and disoriented in the hospital, he asked for Mr. Feng. He was told his brother-in-law was dead.
So were Mr. Tang, the other migrant construction worker who followed them into the drainage pipes the second night, and a security guard involved in a rescue attempt.
A local government official, Mr. Wang, who declined to provide his full name or have his title used, said a deputy general manager of Hisun and a lower level official in charge of the drainage system were under investigation.
Hisun itself was fined the equivalent of $5,400 for the incident, this official said. Relatives of Mr. Feng said Hisun paid them $20,500 compensation.
The local official said Bai Hua, Hisun's chief executive, was also assessed a personal fine. But neither Mr. Bai nor his company have said anything publicly about the incident.
In October Mr. Bai headed his company's delegation to a major pharmaceutical convention in Frankfurt, where it promoted its line of drugs to fight heart disease, certified safe by the European Union.

HEADLINE: As Population Grows Older, Upstate Towns Face a Crisis 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: MAYVILLE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
In 1998, when Mark Thomas took office as county executive of Chautauqua County, the southwesternmost county in New York State, the county spent $13 million on health care for its poorest residents. Next year the bill is expected to reach $29 million, and the vast majority of that sum, which represents more than half the property taxes the county collects, will pay for medical care for Chautauqua's growing elderly population.
 Like much of rural America, upstate New York is aging rapidly, and that aging comes with its own economic and social problems. But the consequences have been particularly tough for upstate New York, because of the state's extensive programs under Medicaid and its unusual requirement that local governments pay a quarter of the cost of most of them. Medicaid, a federal and state program, helps pay for health care for poor, elderly, blind and disabled patients and for poor families with children. 
 People 65 and older make up an ever-larger portion of the population of upstate New York, according to an analysis of 2000 census data completed this fall by the Brookings Institution, a Washington research organization. It found that on average, 14 percent of people living in upstate counties were 65 or older, two percentage points higher than the national average. In western New York, in places like Chautauqua County, the figure rises to 16 percent, and in some counties, like Hamilton, with about 5,000 people in the Adirondack Forest Preserve, 20 percent of residents are 65 or older.
The bill for caring for the poorest of the state's elderly is strangling upstate communities, according to county officials statewide. County governments, the primary conduit for social services, must meet this expense despite an ever-shrinking tax base.
A report on the fiscal health of New York counties issued in September by Moody's Investors Service painted a grim portrait of counties across the state struggling with the ballooning cost of Medicaid, much of which goes for nursing home care and prescription drugs for the elderly. In 2000, the latest year for which specific data are available, New York spent nearly $3 billion on Medicaid for people 65 and older living outside New York City. More than two-thirds of that went for nursing home care. Counties pay 10 percent of the cost of institutional long-term care and 25 percent of the cost of other Medicaid services. Most states do not force local governments to pay anything, but of the 20 states that do, New York's local share is the highest.
Compounding this problem is New York State's extensive Medicaid package, including many optional programs like prescription drugs, home heath care aides and dental care. New York State spends $9,365 a year, on average, on its 3 million Medicaid beneficiaries. California, with twice as many recipients, spends $2,862 on average. Some of New York's spending goes toward covering poor children and families, but upstate, where the tax base is often smaller, the population older and the economy shriveled, the greatest burden is the elderly. In 2000, elderly Medicaid users cost $22,138 on average, more than anyone else in the program, including people with disabilities, according to a report issued in September by the Center for Government Research, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution in Rochester. Children covered under Medicaid cost only $2,142 a year, and healthy adults cost just $4,059, according to the report.
The problem will only worsen as the baby boom generation begins retiring, setting up a crisis that could bankrupt local governments statewide, according to officials at the New York State Association of Counties. Nowhere is this clearer than in places like Chautauqua County, 1,062 square miles of rolling farmland. The county's population in the 2000 census was about 140,000, including more than 22,000 people 65 or older.
"We are dealing with seniors burning through their financial resources and having to go on Medicaid," County Executive Thomas, a Democrat, said in an interview at his office in Mayville, the county seat. "And because of the way the system is financed in New York, their overwhelming health care needs become a burden to the rest of us. These expenses dwarf everything else and make it very difficult for us to provide the minimum of other services county governments perform."
Last year, facing a $12 million budget gap created in part by a $7.4 million increase in Medicaid costs, Chautauqua shed 80 jobsfrom the county payroll, consolidated departments and increased property taxes by more than 22 percent. This year Mr. Thomas has requested a 9 percent increase in taxes and more job cuts, which, along with last year's cuts, will pare about 20 percent of the county's work force.
"We try to make the cuts in places where residents won't feel them so much," Mr. Thomas said. "But you can only cut so much on the margin until there is no margin left anymore."
And so Katie Smith, the director of the county's Office for the Aging, said she tried to do more with less. Meeting with a group of lay ministers at the First Presbyterian Church in Jamestown, the county's only city, she explained why spending local tax dollars to help older people stay in their homes was important.
"We get state money to help people with housekeeping," Ms. Smith said. "At budget time the County Legislature gets tempted to cut the $95,000 it costs us to keep the program. But if having someone help a 90-year-old with her chores means that 90-year-old can stay in her house and keep paying property taxes rather than us spending $60,000 a year in taxpayers' money on long-term residential care, it is money well spent."
Helen Grover, 89, gets help with housekeeping and from Meals on Wheels, and hence is able to stay in her two-story blue wood-shingle house.
"They help me, and it is a blessing," she said as Barrie Yochim, the director of the local Meals on Wheels program, dropped off a shrink-wrapped luncheon tray of chicken cordon bleu, peas and whipped potatoes. She said county programs helped her stay independent.
But for local officials who approved a 22 percent tax increase last year, asking taxpayers to cough up an additional 9 percent in an election year is a tough sell, and the urge to cut programs is strong.
"We are a rural economy that depends heavily on a lot of farming, especially dairy and grapes," said Jim Caflisch, leader of the Republican minority in the County Legislature. "Those industries have been hit hard with price downturns, and weather this year has been so wet, so a lot of grape crop was lost. We can't place any more of a burden on those people who are paying."
He said that raising property taxes just added to the county's financial problems because high taxes made it harder to attract new businesses that could provide jobs and increase the tax base, and made it less likely that elderly people would be able to keep their houses. 
Still, cutting programs for the elderly can have unintended consequences that will simply cost the county more in the future, county officials said. Thousands of elderly people live in Chautauqua County, often left behind by younger relatives who have left the area in pursuit of better jobs. Their needs are often overwhelming: the county helps many people pay their heating bills, build wheelchair ramps outside houses, clean up after themselves, get to doctors' appointments and get food.
The county has a budget of about $3 million to pay for these things, the majority of which comes from the state and federal governments, but $600,000 of which comes from local taxes. And because the federal and state money is often contingent on local governments chipping in, reducing local spending can mean losing a program.
But pulling together the $600,000 that the local government must raise from property and sales taxes has been a yearly struggle for officials.
"Every year we fight for every penny, but it is always a fight," Ms. Smith said. The money her department receives has remained flat over the past few years, and she said she had managed to keep up with increasing demand by cutting administrative costs and had tried to avoid limiting services but had had to begin waiting lists for some services, like housekeeping.
Dorothy Akin, a 92-year-old widow, moved into a small subsidized apartment 12 years ago, after she realized that she could no longer maintain her mobile home. She gets about $600 a month in Social Security and depends on the county and state's help to survive, she said.
"I have a lady who comes to help me twice a week, which is a blessing," she said, leaning heavily on her cane. "And these folks come check on me every day, make sure I am breathing," she added, gesturing to Mr. Yochim, who dropped off her Meals on Wheels lunch and dinner.
"I can't pay for my prescriptions, so I get help with that too," she said. "They help me live. Without them, I don't know what I would do."

HEADLINE: Sales Fell in October for G.M. and Ford 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Reporting one of the domestic automobile industry's toughest months yet this year, the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company said on Monday that sales fell in October from the month last year.
 G.M. said its sales dropped 7 percent in October, while Ford said sales fell 2 percent. Among the Big Three, only the Chrysler Corporation, a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, reported a gain over last year, rising 11 percent to let it remain in third place ahead of the Toyota Motor Company of Japan, which said sales rose 11.7 percent in October. 
 The industry sold vehicles at an annual rate of 15.6 million last month, the slowest pace since February, according to Ward's Automotive Reports of Southfield, Mich. That is well behind the 16.1 million rate that analysts had expected for the month, and a steep drop from the 18.9 million pace in August, the year's best. In August, auto companies offered substantial incentives, including interest-free loans and rebates, to clear out 2003 model year cars and trucks before new models began arriving in September. 
 Total industry sales for the month were flat with last year, Ward's said. 
 Based on the October performance, Paul Ballew, chief sales analyst at G.M., said the industry would probably sell fewer than 17 million vehicles in 2003 for the first time in five years, although he said he expected the industry to achieve that figure next year.
 Carmakers are hoping that renewed consumer confidence and an improving business climate will lead to higher car sales through the end of this year and into 2004. "It is fair to say that the economy is starting to fire on all cylinders," said Jarlath Costello, an economist for Ford.
 But October remained a month to forget at G.M. and Ford, where officials said their sales were trampled somewhat by the wildfires in California, the nation's largest car market. Toyota, whose operations are based in California, said sales at its Lexus division climbed 40 percent last month and it did not cite any effect from the fires.
 Neither did Nissan Motor, whose sales climbed 18 percent in October from last year's level. It joined a flock of foreign-based companies in posting higher October sales, including BMW and Mercedes-Benz of Germany, and Hyundai of South Korea. Honda Motor surprised analysts by recording a 2.9 percent drop in October sales.
 In a conference call with analysts and journalists Monday, Mr. Ballew tried to damp expectations that G.M., which has posted small market share gains in each of the last two years, would be able to gain share for a third consecutive year.
 "We realize three-peating will be tough," Mr. Ballew said. "The important thing is that we'll end the year somewhere in the 28 percent range."
 So far this year, G.M. has 27.7 percent of the United States market, down 0.6 percentage point from last year, according to Autodata.
 Even as sales of Cadillac CTS sedans, Hummer S.U.V.'s and other previously popular G.M. models fell in October, G.M. raised its fourth-quarter production forecast by 10,000 vehicles over its previous estimates.
 Stephen Girsky, the auto analyst with Morgan Stanley, noted in a conference call that G.M. ended October with a 90-day inventory of unsold vehicles, well above the 65-day level that is normal for this time of year. Chrysler wound up the month with an 87-day supply; Ford did not disclose its inventory.
Mr. Girsky wondered why the company would increase production, given the industry's slower pace. Mr. Ballew said it was too soon to write off November and December. "I wouldn't accept our sales as weakening or the industry as weakening," Mr. Ballew said.
 Jesse Toprak, senior analyst with Edmunds.com in Santa Monica, Calif., said he believed that G.M. was building inventories to fuel a year-end sales push, like the one it introduced last year. "What are you going to do? " he said. "You can't have all those cars sitting on the lots."
 George Pipas, chief sales analyst at Ford, said he also expected incentives to climb in November and December, and signaled that Ford's F-150 pickup could be in store for more generous discounts. 
 Ford sold 18,000 of the new trucks in October, out of a total of about 68,000 F-series, but Ford eventually will have to sell more than 45,000 a month to meet its goal of selling 500,000 a year of the new model. The only discounts available thus far are to previous F-series owners.
 "If you had asked me, I would have said I didn't think we could do this well" with minimal incentives, Mr. Pipas said. "I can assure you this is one of the low months" for the new version of the F-series, he added.
 But October was just the opposite for the Dodge Ram pickup, whose 46 percent increase in sales startled some analysts, since the current version has been on the market for well over a year. Like each of the Big Three companies, Chrysler has blanketed the Detroit area with commercials promoting special deals for employees and family members, in hopes of spurring sales.
 Gary Dilts, a Chrysler vice president, acknowledged that Chrysler raised incentives slightly on the Ram in October, but maintained there were no out-of-the-ordinary discounts on the Ram last month. "The truck spoke for itself in the marketplace," Mr. Dilts said.
 But figures from Edmunds showed Chrysler had been the most aggressive among Big Three pickup makers in offering discounts, including rebates, lease deals and low-rate financing, off the sticker prices of its new trucks. 
 In September, the latest month for which statistics were available, Chrysler's average discount on the 2004 version of the Dodge Ram was $5,543. That compared with $4,803 on the Chevrolet Silverado, and just $2,771 on the Ford F-150. 
 "They're pushing out the Rams, and that paid off very well," Mr. Toprak said.

HEADLINE: October Manufacturing Activity At Highest in Nearly 4 Years 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Manufacturing registered its highest level of activity in nearly four years in October, an industry report said yesterday, suggesting that the economic growth of the third quarter might be continuing this quarter.
 In another positive sign, construction spending in September posted its best month on record, with spending by private builders also reaching a new high, the Commerce Department said. 
 The industry group, the Institute for Supply Management, reported that its manufacturing index rose to 57 last month from 53.7 in September. It was the fourth consecutive monthly gain and pushed the index to its highest level since January 2000. The reading was well above the 55.5 that analysts had expected. 
 An index level above 50 indicates expansion; one below 50 indicates that manufacturing activity is contracting. From March through June, the index was below 50.
 "The U.S. economy has solid momentum," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns.
 Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C., said the advance suggested that the economy would show sound growth this quarter after expanding at a 7.2 percent annual pace in the third quarter.
"This is the first hard evidence we have on the fourth quarter, " Mr. Vitner said, "and it suggests that a lot of the strength of the third quarter is carrying over." He predicted fourth-quarter growth in the range of 3.5 percent to 4 percent annually.
 The Commerce Department said the total value of building projects reached a seasonally adjusted annual pace of $910.6 billion in September, a 1.3 percent rise from August and a record monthly high. And the 1.3 percent increase exceeded analysts' expectations of an advance around 0.4 percent. Spending by private builders on housing projects rose 1.4 percent in September to a pace of $471.4 billion, also a monthly record.
 The housing market has been an important source of strength for the economy and is expected to remain so if interest rates remain low.
 Manufacturing employment continued to be weak, with an index below the point that would signify growth.

HEADLINE: South African Companies Fill a Void 

BYLINE:  By NICOLE ITANO

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Africa largely missed out on the investment boom of the 1990's and still receives only a tiny portion of the world's foreign direct investment. But while the continent is receiving a shrinking share of global investment from traditional donors like the United States, Britain and France, investment from South Africa, the region's biggest economy, in the rest of the continent has surged. 
 "If you look over the last 10 years, South African businesses have discovered Africa," said Neuma Grobbelaar, head of the Business in Africa program at the South African Institute of International Affairs, a nongovernmental organization doing research on South African investment in the continent. "There's a realization that South Africa has a competitive edge on the African continent that it doesn't have in the more developed markets of Europe or the United States or Asia or Latin America." 
 In fact, experts say, in the last few years, South Africa has become one of the continent's biggest sources of foreign direct investment, and it has been greeted with mostly welcoming arms by businesses elsewhere on the continent. 
 Though South African companies initially invested in the country's small but stable neighbors, like Mozambique and Botswana, they increasingly are tackling some of the continent's most difficult markets, like Congo, Nigeria and Angola. And while some are still investing in traditional African sectors like oil and gas and minerals -- building diamond mines in Angola and copper mines in Congo, for instance -- others are now injecting capital into industries like telecommunications, banking and retailing, which development experts say contribute more to local economies.
 As these South African businesses, once pariahs, move rapidly north, they are bringing the rest of the world's least developed continent everything from fast food to cellphones, electricity to new roads. And some are making big profits in difficult markets that most other investors have shunned.
 Measuring foreign direct investment, particularly in Africa, is difficult, and the numbers can fluctuate widely year to year. But according to figures from the South African research foundation BusinessMap, during 2001 and 2002 South Africa was the largest single-nation source of such investment in the 14-country Southern African Development Community, which stretches as far north as Congo and Tanzania. In West and East Africa, which are new but expanding markets for South African businesses, South Africa is now the largest source of foreign direct investment outside the oil and gas industry, Ms. Grobbelaar said.
 In all, South African companies have invested an average of more than $1 billion a year in Africa since 1994, and last year they planned projects totaling an additional $6 billion.
 The boom in South African investment in Africa is largely a result of two developments. The end of sanctions against South Africa in the early 1990's, as apartheid was dismantled, radically changed the country's relationship to the rest of the continent, opening new markets but also increasing competition back home. And African countries began to overhaul their economies to meet conditions set down by international monetary organizations, making them better investment opportunities.
 Keith Campbell, managing director of Executive Research Associates, a risk management firm in Centurion, South Africa, for companies investing on the continent, said that 10 years ago, the rest of Africa was a place where the big mining companies struck raw materials. Now, said Mr. Campbell, who is also vice chairman of the six-month-old, 120-member South Africa-Angola Chamber of Commerce, "It's safer to go in, it's easier to get materials in and out, easier to repatriate your profits."
 "You're finding more and more success stories among the smaller guys," he said.
 Though many African countries have privatized state-owned enterprises, liberalized industries and rewritten laws to attract more foreign investment, investment on the continent is still difficult. And the South African companies often have to start from nothing, even building their own power sources and access roads, as they flood into other African countries.
 Still, though poor by global standards, these countries offer undeveloped markets the South Africans can enter and quickly dominate. Countries like Mozambique and Botswana are attractive because they are nearby and have many cultural similarities with South Africa, while places like Nigeria and Angola have oil wealth, and hence a moneyed class. Of least interest to South African companies are francophone West African nations like Senegal and Gabon, where French and Belgian companies already have a strong foothold. 
 And though African investments are risky in traditional terms, they have brought South African companies returns that are generally higher than those of their other foreign or domestic investments. Some industries, like cellular communications, have even brought returns as high as 40 percent.
 South African telecommunications companies have been among the most aggressive investors in the African market. Vodacom, one of South Africa's main providers of cellular service, recently spent $119 million on a cellular network in Congo, a country struggling to emerge from a five-year civil war. It also agreed to buy a controlling stake in Nigeria's second-largest network, Econet Wireless Nigeria, for an estimated $230 million, a deal that is being challenged in court by a stakeholder.
 Executives at the company, which is 50 percent owned by South Africa's fixed-line monopoly Telkom S.A. and 35 percent by the Vodafone Group of Britain, have said they are not commenting on the deal for now.
 If the purchase goes through, it will pit Vodacom against its main competitor in South Africa, the MTN Group, which spent nearly $900 million to build Nigeria's largest cellular network. "The Nigerian network was two and a half times more expensive than South Africa's," said Yvonne Muthien, MTN Group executive for corporate affairs. "There were no fixed lines, power was not stable. We had to build back up generators and a whole new transmission backbone that now connects 120 cities and towns."
 But, Dr. Muthien said, by 2005, the company expects revenue from the Nigerian operation, which signed up 1.2 million subscribers in its first 18 months, to surpass its revenue from South Africa, where it has more than 4 million subscribers. 
 Over all, she added MTN has invested 12 billion rand, or about $1.75 billion at current rates, in its five African operations outside South Africa and is looking for other opportunities on the continent. Those operations have a 40 percent profit margin, compared with MTN's 30 percent margin at home, and account for more than a third of the company's total revenue.
 Other South African companies expanding aggressively northward include Shoprite Holdings, a grocery chain, and the fast-food chain Steers Holdings. Eskom, South Africa's quasi-state electric utility, provides electricity around the continent and has ambitious expansion plans. JHI Real Estate Ltd. has built many of the continent's shopping malls. SABMiller, now based in England but born and bred in South Africa, is the continent's biggest beer maker and drink bottler, with 44 African breweries and 10 bottling plants, including one it just purchased in Angola.
 Some smaller companies that rely more on human than financial capital are also making inroads in businesses like advertising, information technology and consulting.
 Not every South African company has found gold north of the border, however. Inadequate financing and poor infrastructure continue to be major barriers. Political instability is also a big problem. The outbreak of civil war in Ivory Coast last year, for example, caused several new South African investors to withdraw.
 Even in stable countries, some companies have found the business climate too difficult. Pepkor Ltd., parent of the discount clothing retailer Pep Stores, decided this year to shut its Ghana operations, citing, in part, competition from smuggled and secondhand clothes.
 In some countries, too, South African companies have been met with apprehension by local businesses that fear dominance by more highly capitalized competitors. African business groups, however, generally herald the South African expansion as the beginning of a new era of intra-African trade.
 "We do believe that South African companies have an advantage over Nigerians in a number of ways, but being an African country, we can learn from them," said Olumide Adekunle, director general of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, as he shouted over a crackling landline and joked that his cellphone was clearer. "Nigeria is a very large market and there are many opportunities. Development from the African continent is good."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Houston; 
Oil, Yes, but Also Culture and Fine Dining

BYLINE:  By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
FLAT on its back during the oil bust of the early 1980's, Houston diversified its economy as it rebounded in the 1990's. It is still the energy capital of the world, and the headquarters of ConocoPhillips, the El Paso Corporation, the Halliburton Company and other oil patch giants, but it is also emerging as a center for trade, transport and other industries. 
 In 1981, oil and gas production accounted for two-thirds of Houston's "base economic jobs," defined as those that export goods and service outside the metropolitan region. Today, that proportion has been halved as the city has benefited from the growth of nonenergy businesses like Sysco, the nation's biggest food services company; Waste Management, the nation's biggest trash hauler; and Continental Airlines.

AIRPORT
 Both of Houston's commercial airports, George Bush Intercontinental and Hobby, are being remodeled and expanded. Ernest DeSoto, a spokesman for the Houston Airport System, which runs both airports, said contractors were working at night and otherwise trying not to disrupt traffic. "It's like trying to change your underwear without taking your pants off," he said. 
 Intercontinental, which is 20 miles north of downtown, recently opened a consolidated rental car facility and is adding a fifth terminal and a fifth runway, to ease delays.
Seven of 20 gates in the new terminal, Terminal E, are open. Mr. DeSoto said the city wanted all of them operating by the time Houston plays host to the Super Bowl in January. Trains link all terminals.
 Hobby, seven miles south of downtown, has a new concourse to consolidate the operations of Southwest Airlines, which accounts for 80 percent of all flights. About one-third of the 24 gates are open; contractors are scheduled to finish construction next year.

HOTELS
 "Houston does not have an abundance of great hotels," said Randy Kabrich, a programming consultant to radio stations. "The only one that comes to mind is the Four Seasons downtown -- and right now downtown is an absolute nightmare with all the road work they are doing this year."
 The FOUR SEASONS (713-650-1300, $295 to $365) has multiple-line phones and high-speed Internet access in each room. Many business services are available 24 hours a day. Wireless Internet access is available in meeting rooms.
 Also downtown is the MAGNOLIA (713-221-0011, $149 to $329), a 300-room boutique hotel in what was originally the headquarters of the Post-Dispatch newspaper. Each room has two-line cordless phones and high-speed Internet access. There is a health club and a pool.
 North of downtown, near the Woodlands neighborhood, is the HOUSTONIAN HOTEL, CLUB AND SPA (713-680-2626, $295 to $365). Each of the 280 rooms comes with high-speed Internet access and cordless phone. The spa has 200 exercise machines, an indoor track, tennis and squash courts and a pool.

RESTAURANTS
 What Houston lacks in hotels it makes up in restaurants," Mr. Kabrich said. People in Houston spend more per capita on restaurants than residents of any other city.
 VIC AND ANTHONY'S STEAKHOUSE (713-228-1111, $110 for dinner for two, including wine and tip) is a downtown restaurant with a boardroom-style private dining room for meetings and a piano bar just off the main dining room. 
 In the River Oaks section, Tony Vallone, one of Houston's top chefs, runs LA GRIGLIA (713-526-4700, $75), a neighborhood restaurant in a shopping mall. "The place is a little loud, but it's my favorite place to dine when I'm in Houston," said Doris M. Koch, executive director of the Texas Association of Appraisal Districts, an industry group based in Austin. "Good wine list, consistently good contemporary Italian food."
 Near the Galleria, in an unimposing strip mall, SIMPOSIO (713-532-0550, $100) serves game, lamb, veal and pasta. "The food is good, consistent, and fresh," and the "service is wonderful," said Nancy Dellhommer, an engineer for Haverly Systems, a software company.

ENTERTAINMENT
 The SAMBUCA JAZZ CAFE (713-224-5299) in the Rice Hotel downtown has a full schedule of traditional, Latin and swing jazz. The animal prints on the wall may not be for everyone, but food is served and it has a cigar bar.
 The ALLEY THEATER (713-228-8421), a Tony Award-winning regional company, is currently presenting "Fully Committed," Becky Mode's 2000 comedy about an actor who takes reservations for a hot new Manhattan restaurant.

ON YOUR OWN
 The Level 9 Tour at SPACE CENTER HOUSTON (281-244-2100), the visitor center at the Johnson Space Center of NASA, is a behind-the-scenes look at Mission Control for manned space flights. Only 12 people a day can be accommodated. Tours begin promptly at noon. Reservations must be made at least one day in advance.
 A short drive east of downtown, in La Porte, is the SAN JACINTO BATTLEGROUND (281-479-2421), site of the battle in 1836 that won Texas its independence from Mexico.

BUSINESS LORE
 Two former top executives of Waste Management, Rodney Proto and Earl DeFrates, agreed last month to pay a total of $4.2 million to settle federal allegations of insider trading and making false or misleading public statements about the company. Mr. Proto will pay $3.7 million; Mr. DeFrates, $482,779. 
 The two men neither admitted to nor denied the allegations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which nonetheless banned them from acting as officers or directors of any publicly traded company for five years.

This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

 CORRECTION:
The On the Ground column in the Business Travel pages on Tuesday, about Houston, misstated the neighborhood for the Houstonian Hotel, Club and Spa. It is in the Galleria area, not the Woodlands.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Factory and Chip Reports Send Shares Broadly Higher

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks rose yesterday, closing at their highest level in 17 months, after a surprisingly strong reading on manufacturing in October.
 Technology stocks, bolstered by sharply higher sales in September and expectations of a strong 2004, did still better, closing at a 21-month high. In all, 15 percent of the issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market reached 52-week highs. 
 Stocks rose after an economic report showed that American manufacturers increased output in October to the best level in nearly four years. Separate data showed that construction spending surged in September to a record high. 
 "This is consistent with the idea that the economy is moving along quite nicely," said Steve Ricchiuto, chief economist at ABN Amro.
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 57.34 points, or 0.59 percent, at 9,858.46, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.31 points, or 0.79 percent, to 1,059.02 -- both closing levels not seen since May 31, 2002.
 The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index gained 35.49 points, or 1.84 percent, rising to 1,967.70, its highest close since Jan. 17, 2002.
 Yesterday's advance was the sixth consecutive one for the Dow industrials. The stock market, since touching 2003 lows in March, has risen over the last few months as data pointed to an improvement in the economy and companies were expected to post better quarterly earnings. When many of them did, investors funneled still more money into equities.
 "The economic news continues to be pretty good," said John Davidson, president of Partner Re Asset Management. But he warned that based on earnings now forecast, stocks appeared to be "pretty fully valued," suggesting more limited gains in the near future.
 Volume was moderate, with 1.36 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, down from 1.51 billion on Friday. Advancing issues outpaced decliners on the Big Board by about 7 to 3 and by about 2 to 1 on Nasdaq. Of the roughly 3,400 stocks traded on the New York exchange on Monday, 490 closed at 52-week highs.
 Computer-chip-related stocks were buoyed by a report from the Semiconductor Industry Association showing that worldwide chip sales in the third quarter rose 13.7 percent from the quarter before, driven by strong demand for PC's. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose to a 52-week high.
 Shares of Intel, the largest chip maker, led both the Dow and the Nasdaq composite indexes higher, rising $1.09, or 3.3 percent, to $34.04.
 Sun Microsystems, the most heavily traded Nasdaq stock, with volume of more than 122 million shares, rose 44 cents, or 11 percent, to $4.39. Its executive vice president for global sales said there were signs of a recovery in technology spending by financial services and telecommunications companies.
 Marsh & McLennan advanced $2.13, or nearly 5 percent, to $44.88, after an announcement that Lawrence J. Lasser would leave as chief executive of its Putnam Investments unit, less than a week after civil charges of securities fraud against Putnam by regulators.
 Shares of Kellogg, the large cereal producer, rose $1.77, or 5.3 percent, to $34.90. Its quarterly earnings rose sharply, surpassing Wall Street expectations.
 The stock of the energy company Dynegy rose 16 cents, or 4 percent, to $4.17, after it said it would sell Illinois Power to the Exelon Corporation.
 In bond trading, Treasury prices slid in reaction to the strong manufacturing report. By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note declined 13/32, to 99 8/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, climbed to 4.34 percent from 4.29 percent on Friday. The 30-year Treasury bond dropped 16/32 to 103 3/32; its yield rose to 5.16 percent from 5.14 percent.
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.762	99.482	High Rate	0.940	1.025	Investment Rate	0.960	1.047	Low Rate	0.910	1.000	Median Rate	0.930	1.025	Total applied for	$40,641,760	$44,422,553	Accepted	$22,766,210	$22,887,188	Noncompetitive	$1,451,021	$1,028,615	

Both issues are dated Nov. 6. The three-month bills mature on Feb. 5, 2004, and the six-month bills mature on May 6, 2004.

HEADLINE: Palestinians And Israelis Still Speaking, In a Whisper 

BYLINE:  By GREG MYRE 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
More than two months after Israel broke off contacts with the Palestinians, senior leaders from the two sides have quietly resumed behind-the-scenes discussions in an effort to revive the stalled Middle East peace plan.
 But violence persists. Acting on a tip, Israeli troops raided Azun, in the West Bank, and a 16-year-old Palestinian bomber, Sabih Abu Saud, blew himself up as soldiers were closing in, the military said. One soldier was slightly wounded. 
 Palestinians traditionally praise family members who carry out attacks against Israel. But the bomber's father, Kamal Abu Saud, was critical of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, which recruited the youth. "He was just a little boy, and those who sent him should have left him alone," Mr. Saud was quoted as saying in a report by The Associated Press.
In another case, a Palestinian, Tariq Hussein, 25, who was wanted in the shooting death of an Israeli girl, turned himself in at a checkpoint in Qalqilya, on the West Bank, the military said. It was not immediately clear why the suspect turned himself in -- an extremely rare occurrence. But the military had recently searched his home, and family members may have pressured him.
Regarding peace talks, Shaul Mofaz, the defense minister, acknowledged that he had been meeting Palestinians. He declined to identify them, but Palestinian and Israeli officials identified Mr. Mofaz's negotiating partner as Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian finance minister.
In another development on Monday, the National Labor Court temporarily barred a nationwide strike called by the country's large labor federation, the Histadrut. The court permitted a four-hour labor protest, which was staged by some workers. But it also directed the Finance Ministry and the federation to resume talks and report back on Thursday.
The Histadrut, which represents hundreds of thousands of government and private-sector workers, called the strike to protest government plans to overhaul the pension system, which would raise the retirement age and reduce benefits.
Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been trying to reduce substantially the government's role in the economy, which has been in turmoil for the past three years. 
But Israeli labor groups have resisted the cutbacks, saying they fall disproportionately on poor and working-class Israelis.

Israeli Aid Adjustment Proposed
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 (Reuters) -- The Bush administration will ask Congress to give Israel $2.22 billion in military assistance in fiscal year 2005, $60 million more than in 2004, the State Department announced Monday. The increase is in line with a 1990's agreement that reduces economic assistance to Israel by $120 million a year while adding $60 million a year to the military component of the package, the largest Washington gives to any country.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Buyer Beware" (editorial, Oct. 27) doesn't mention an important point about credit information sharing among business affiliates. 
Restricting information flow would obscure lenders' knowledge about customers and increase lending rates. This would reduce overall credit access, particularly for traditionally underserved populations. 
 You suggest that a patchwork of state laws, not uniform national standards, would better serve consumers. This balkanization of our credit reporting system, however, would slow economic growth and fail to help consumers needing assistance. Under this scenario, the only people to be extended credit would be those who have little problem obtaining it. 
You say that affiliate sharing can invite identity theft. In fact, these crimes are best fought when law enforcement and financial institutions can easily monitor accounts, detecting illegal activities. The Senate should pass the bipartisan National Consumer Credit Reporting System Improvement Act on behalf of consumers.

HEADLINE: Make Baghdad Pay 

BYLINE:  By Mark Medish; Mark Medish, a lawyer, was deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury from 1997 to 2000.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The economic consequences of regime change in Iraq could get worse if the United States, Great Britain and their coalition partners act on radical impulses to make grand gestures. A case in point is Iraq's sovereign debt.
 Iraq's debt includes $40 billion owed to Paris Club official creditors, most notably Japan, France, Germany and Russia; at least $30 billion to other official creditors; at least $3 billion to London Club commercial banks; and perhaps $10 billion owed to corporate creditors. 
 What is to be done? Already we hear calls from the right and the left to impose what might be called a "zero option"; that is, cancellation of Iraq's debt. From the right, Richard Perle and William F. Buckley Jr. have called for freeing Iraq of its "odious debt" on moral grounds. From the other end of the political spectrum, Oxfam and Jubilee Iraq have taken much the same position, while Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobelist, is advocating relief on more prudent grounds, citing the lessons of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, which required Germany to pay heavy war reparations. 
These recommendations, though doubtless well intentioned, are misguided. A country like Iraq, with the world's second-largest proven oil reserves, should be expected to be able to pay its obligations. Furthermore, the moral charge that the debts are odious is simply too sweeping. Acting on it would be bad for Iraq and would set a damaging precedent for the international financial system.
For Iraq to normalize its external financial relations, it must respect one of the first principles of the rule of law: contracts should be honored. Without this presumption, markets cannot work. The threshold for overturning the presumption must be kept high to prevent chaos. In the case of Iraq, the threshold has not been met. 
Several myths have gained currency in the debt debate. The first is that Iraq's debts are invalid because they were accumulated under Saddam Hussein's regime. This is overbroad and misleading. First, much of the debt, including the bulk of what Iraq owes to banks and corporations, went to finance civilian construction -- roads, hospitals, apartments and utilities. By contrast, military-related debt can and should be separated out and perhaps even forgiven. 
It's worth remembering, too, that much of Iraq's debt was incurred in the 1970's and 1980's, before sanctions were imposed, when the United States was willingly doing business with the Hussein regime.
Another myth is that historical precedents dictate that zeroing out the debt would be prudent. Post-Versailles Germany is a frequently cited case. But there is an important difference between punitive reparations and commercial debt incurred by a country for civilian projects. Moreover, in the last decade countries like Poland, Egypt and Yugoslavia have escaped their heavy debts not because their debts were forgiven but because the financial community created reasonable long-term repayment plans.
Third is the myth that companies have already written off the Iraqi debts and no longer care about them. This is ridiculous. How companies account for bad debts on their books is irrelevant to the legal status of their claims. It would be a perverse result to extinguish debt simply because a debtor has not paid.
Iraq is entitled to have its special case heard. So far it has been granted an official moratorium through 2004. When the international community decides to begin tackling the wider debt problem, it should follow several simple maxims: avoid radicalism and bad precedents; promote an orderly, market-friendly debt repayment schedule based on financial analysis; and encourage creative solutions, including debt swaps.
Finally, for solutions to be meaningful, Iraq must negotiate with creditors on its own behalf. This, after all, is a major aspect of sovereignty. 
The Iraqis should also favor an orderly debt repayment process. The country has been a financial rogue state for the past 12 years. What the new Iraq needs is a reputation for honoring its word.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: BUSINESS AND FINANCE; 
Iraq's Economy Is Mostly Stagnant, Propped Up by U.S. Cash and by Hopes of Safer Days

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
The state-owned shoe factory here was once sophisticated enough to make shoes for Bally, the Swiss luxury goods company.
 But that was 20 years ago, before wars and sanctions, before Saddam Hussein's army became the factory's biggest customer. Now, with Mr. Hussein and most of his army gone, production has plunged to 1,800 pairs of shoes a day from 5,000 at the start of the year, according to Riadh Hassan Ali, the company's design manager. There are scarcely any customers. 
 Six months after President Bush declared major military operations in Iraq over, the economy here is largely in stasis, propped up by American cash but showing little progress. The privatization of Iraq's decrepit state-owned industries like the shoe factory, is on hold; foreign investors have stayed home. 
Many small and mid-size businesses have laid off workers, according to a new survey of 400 companies nationwide. Iraq's oil fields, a treasure trove second only to Saudi Arabia's, are finding that recovery from years of neglect and more recent looting is slow.
The reason for the stagnation is as plain as the concrete walls in front of the Oil Ministry or the thump of the mortar rounds here at night. Until the streets are safe, the economy here will grow weakly at best, senior Iraqi officials say.
"Without security, you can't make any growth, any progress," said Sami Matti, director general of Iraq's Planning Ministry. "No one will be encouraged to come."
The success of Iraq's economy is crucial to the American project here. It is meant to serve as a regional example, demonstrating that a free market works and provides opportunities -- especially to the young -- that curb the frustrations on which terrorist recruiters thrive.
In the long run, the United States hopes that Iraq will become an economic model for the Middle East, said George Wolfe, director of economic policy for the American-led occupation authority. 
If all goes well, Mr. Wolfe said, low tariffs and a strong financial system will attract foreign investment. Bloated state-owned industries will be privatized and made efficient. Iraq's oil wealth will provide a base, but the country will diversify its economy and avoid the "resource curse" that has plagued countries like Nigeria, where oil wealth has been squandered by corruption.
"I view our mission as working in support of Iraqis to help them build a platform from which their economy could grow," Mr. Wolfe said.
There are some signs of life. Iraq is short on capital, short on electricity and short on management expertise, but it does not lack economic enthusiasm. At the shoe plant and on the streets of its Karada neighborhood, Iraqis seem surprisingly, perhaps irrationally, hopeful about their prospects.
The same survey of small and mid-size companies that found widespread layoffs also found that 57 percent of the companies expected their prospects to improve over the next six months. Only 11 percent thought business would get worse. Almost 60 percent of the companies said they would hire new employees in the next six months.
"Despite everything, it's better than before," said Haidar Ghazy, who owns a clothing store in Karada. "Of course we're optimistic. We have a saying: 'If you are optimistic, you'll find good things.' "
Given the importance that confidence plays in the investment and spending that drive economic growth, that positive attitude is one of the biggest strengths Iraq's economy now has.
Another, of course, is oil, at least in theory. Iraq's state-owned oil fields are slowly increasing output. On good days, they produce as much as two million barrels, mostly from the south, said Shamkhi al-Faraj, chief of economic development for the Oil Ministry. That is nearly as much as Iraq averaged last year, according to a recent speech by Thamir Ghadhban, the industry's chief executive. 
But bigger decisions about oil, like who Iraq will hire to develop its fields, will wait until it has a stable government. Because that is not expected until at least next year, no development deals will by signed until late 2004 at the earliest, Mr. Faraj said.
If the Iraqi economy is to lift off, oil is the key, and the current confused politics and insecurity suggest that it will be a long time before the country's potential is fulfilled.
Other problems also loom. Even if the transition to democracy is swift, with early free elections, economic growth happens slowly under the best of circumstances, and Iraq is starting in a very deep hole.
After a generation of misrule under Mr. Hussein, who built a huge military infrastructure while neglecting civilian investment, and a dozen years of United Nations sanctions, Iraq's unemployment rate tops 50 percent. Its per-capita production of $2,400 ranked 162nd worldwide in 2002, trailing India, Indonesia and Syria, according to the Central Intelligence Agency's world fact book.
In the six months since Mr. Hussein's government fell, the economy has stagnated, and may have shrunk, though the Planning Ministry has been unable to assemble reliable data for this period.
Output at state-owned companies like the shoe factory has plunged. Electricity fails sporadically, a problem that may take years to overcome, and many major roads damaged in the war need repairs.
Such problems will not be solved quickly. But the occupying forces are trying to plant seeds for growth, especially in the financial system. The October introduction of the new Iraqi dinar, which replaced two older versions, has been largely successful, and the currency has strengthened in value against the dollar. The occupying authorities have also eliminated most tariffs, leading to a retail boomlet in Baghdad for luxury products like imported air conditioners. Some small companies have started up. 
Still, the road ahead looks arduous. For a developing country, average long-run growth of 5 percent a year per capita is excellent, and 7 percent is stellar. Even if Iraq managed to achieve the latter figure, an all-but-impossible task given its high birth rate, Iraq would need 15 years until it produced as much per capita as Thailand does today.
The shoe factory illustrates just how much ground the country must make up. The state-owned company that runs the factory employs 3,000 people around Iraq to make shoes, as well as a few other leather goods.
Plant No. 7, where the company makes men's dress shoes, is clean and cheery. Under high ceilings, men stamp out pieces from shiny leather hides, while women stitch together shoe tops at sewing machines. With the scattering of the army and the police, a search for new clients has begun.
With the collapse of Mr. Hussein's rule, Iraq no longer subsidizes imports of leather hides, a subsidy that the company passed along to its customers. "Because we bought it very cheap from the government, we sell it very cheap to the citizens," said Mr. Ali, the design manager. "The profit was controlled."
Now, however, the company must buy its hides on the open market, and pass those increased costs along to customers. So prices have risen, and sales have dropped, Mr. Ali said.
But the company has not had to fire anyone, because the United States does not want to put more unemployed Iraqis on the streets and risk worsening the security crisis. So the occupying authorities are paying the salaries of all 3,000 workers, even if they have nothing to do.
In this, the shoe company is no different from any of Iraq's 53 state-owned companies, whose workers are all still being paid by the occupation, at a cost of several million dollars each month. The cost is small compared with the others the occupation is incurring, but the payments show that for now, security considerations have topped the United States' hope of making the state-owned companies more efficient.
With wages subsidized but the shoe company forbidden to fire anyone, estimating profit or loss is impossible, much less planning long-term investments in new equipment, said Ali Hadi, a manager. "We can't calculate these things now," he said. "When next year comes, we will calculate next year."
Mr. Hadi is optimistic and believes that Iraq will be prosperous in three or four years. But as long as terrorist attacks continue, this manager is not counting on foreign investment.
"Capital is a coward," he said.

Dog on a Hot Tenement Roof
Before the opening of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" at the Music Box Theater on Sunday night, MAYOR MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG was talking about the importance of the theater to the New York City economy and joking that down at City Hall they sometimes called him BIG DADDY. 
 "We depend on tourists," the mayor said. "As they say in another TENNESSEE WILLIAMS play, we depend on the courtesy of strangers." 
 "It's kindness," several people in the audience shouted back.
Veteran politician that the mayor is, he ignored the hecklers. 
At intermission we saw PATRICK ("Star Trek") STEWART talking with KYLE ("Sex and the City") MacLACHLAN. Mr. Stewart's sentences were long dramatic affairs with acts and intermissions. He would say something, then pause theatrically while the reporter's pen hovered above the notebook -- then come down with the last few words like the denouement of a Greek tragedy. "I haven't seen any Williams . . ." he began. Then the pause. Men were born, aged and died. Redwoods grew. Mr. MacLachlan looked into his drink. 
". . . for decades," Mr. Stewart concluded. 
"Cat" stars NED BEATTY in the role of Big Daddy, JASON PATRIC as his apathetic and morose son, BRICK, and ASHLEY JUDD as MAGGIE, Brick's wife. 
At curtain, Mr. Patric might as well have still been in character: as members of the cast were taking their bows, he rolled his eyes. 
At the after-party at Tavern on the Green, Ms. Judd was in the press room talking with everyone, but Mr. Patric had come and gone. We caught up with him in another room, where he was sitting at a table with a plateful of food. His publicist was telling him that someone wanted a picture of the three stars.
"Do we have to do this now?" Mr. Patric asked, angrily. Told yes, he picked up his plate and walked into the press room, where he handed it to his publicist. She whispered something in his ear. Mr. Patric bared his teeth and the publicist did the spinach check. 
"You're fine," she said.
"Don't worry," Mr. Patric said, "I won't be smiling."
We were the last of Ms. Judd's 238 interviews about Tennessee Williams and the South, and when she reached us, she was weary. But when we turned the conversation to basketball at her alma mater, the University of Kentucky, and asked about TUBBY SMITH and RICK PITINO, she perked right up. 
"Tubby Smith is one of the finest human beings walking the face of this planet," Ms. Judd said. 
Asked if her family was there, she said no -- they had been to rehearsals and would come to the show again later. 
"Opening night is a little bit like a birthday party where you never get to eat the cake," Ms. Judd said. "You have this tremendous sense of anticipation and then you talk to the niece of the lawyer for the theater the whole night. She's a nice girl."
We're sure she's lovely.
"She's adorable," Ms. Judd said. "But family comes and thinks you're going to talk about this tremendously liminal rite of passage and extraordinary moment of fulmination on the stage and you just don't. You trade cold cream at the end of the night to take the makeup off."
She departed and Mr. Beatty came over. He was wearing his clan tartan -- from the MACBETH clan -- and he was a great talker. Sitting with him, one might have been sittin' on the porch glider with a couple of bourbons. Asked if he had based his interpretation of Big Daddy on someone specific, he recalled a man he had met in a restaurant bar during the filming of "Deliverance" in Georgia, years ago.
"A big, red-haired fella," he remembered. "Tall and big. Very red. And he grabs my hand and says, 'How ya doing there, boy?' He was frightening. There was a steak knife on the bar and I actually reached over and got my hand on the steak knife. He had ahold of my hand, you see." Later, after the red-haired man had gone off "to intimidate somebody else," Mr. Beatty was approached by a man whose job it was to watch over the big red-headed man because he got into so much trouble. 
"He said, 'Aw, don't worry about him. He's very wealthy and he drinks a lot,' " Mr. Beatty remembered. "But there was something about his roughness that I think about sometimes when I play the part. It's not who I think Big Daddy is, but I think he's capable of the same thing."

HEADLINE: In Resigning Oil Post, Jailed Russian Hints at Political Fight 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS and SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky resigned as chief executive of Russia's richest company, Yukos Oil, on Monday even as he defiantly vowed to continue a public -- and possibly a political -- campaign "to build an open and truly democratic society in Russia."
 Mr. Khodorkovsky, imprisoned since Oct. 25 on charges of embezzlement, fraud and tax evasion, said in a statement that he was stepping aside to shield the company from what he and others have called a politically motivated prosecution. 
 But two people in a position to explain Mr. Khodorkovsky's thinking said his resignation cleared the way not only for his legal defense but also for a campaign for political office, possibly even a challenge to Vladimir V. Putin in presidential elections scheduled for next March. 
Jailhouse campaigns have a precedent in Russia's new and chaotic democracy, but a challenge to Mr. Putin, whose re-election next year has been considered a given, could send politics in Russia's new and chaotic democracy in unpredictable directions. It could also present Russians with a stark choice between two of the country's most influential men, one representing power, the other money.
"He is a man with vision who would not be excluding any options if circumstances were to force him into one corner or another," said one of the people close to Mr. Khodorkovsky. "He would respond to that."
Asked if that could include a presidential challenge, he added, "That is an option that he could not exclude."
The other person said, "I think the events are pushing him to getting involved in politics." 
Mr. Khodorkovsky's announcement severs his managerial role with Yukos, which is in the last stages of a merger with its smaller rival, Sibneft, to create the world's fifth largest private oil company. Mr. Khodorkovsky still has an enormous financial stake in the company, though prosecutors last week froze 40 percent of the company's shares, controlled by him and his partner, Platon Lebedev, who is also in jail.
A spokesman for Group Menatep, the financial company controlled by Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev, said Mr. Khodorkovsky had transferred control of his stocks to another Yukos shareholder, Leonid B. Nevzlin, who is now in Israel. That leaves Mr. Nevzlin with the authority to vote on behalf of Mr. Khodorkovsky while he remains in prison.
Even before his arrest, Mr. Khodorkovsky distanced himself from the day-to-day operations, appointing an American, Steven M. Theede, as chief operating officer this summer. Mr. Theede took over as acting chief executive after his arrest.
An American citizen at the company's helm could significantly raise the stakes should prosecutors pursue further action -- trying, for example, to confiscate the frozen shares and turn them over to the state.
In his statement, Mr. Khodorkovsky defended the company's successes since its founding in 1996, saying Yukos had erased $3 billion in debt and, apparently in a response to prosecutors' charges of tax evasion, paid "in excess of $5 billion" in taxes this year. "I have to do all I can to pull our work force safely out from under the blows that are being directed at me and my partners," Mr. Khodorkovsky said of his resignation.
Although Yukos has its roots in the shady privatization of state assets in the 1990's, he said the company had become a model of efforts to adapt international standards of accounting and corporate government. 
Yukos stock soared in late trading on news of Mr. Khodorkovsky's resignation, rising 13 percent to $12.65 by the end of the day, though it has still fallen by 20 percent since his arrest.
"Mr. Khodorkovsky's resignation definitely makes the company harder to attack and puts distance between him and Yukos," said Alasdair P. M. Breach, chief economist at Brunswick UBS in Moscow. "Going forward, however, it's unclear to what extent is Putin prepared to let the company go."
There have been new signs of division -- and confusion -- within Mr. Putin's government over the matter.
In an interview published on Monday, Russia's finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin, dismissed the idea that the Yukos case would hurt the economy. His remarks came only a day after Mr. Putin's new chief of staff, Dmitri A. Medvedev, had said the opposite, warning prosecutors that their actions were potentially counterproductive. On Friday, Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov also raised concerns about the investigation's impact.
In an interview published in Kommersant, Mr. Kudrin said the investigation would have no impact on the economy, while the resignation of Mr. Medvedev's predecessor, Aleksandr S. Voloshin, would have a positive one.
He said the departure of Mr. Voloshin, who worked under President Boris N. Yeltsin and strongly defended the interests of business under Mr. Putin, represented a break from the "Yeltsin epoch."
"This marks the end of the Byzantine Empire!" the newspaper quoted him saying. "Will it change the situation for the better or for the worse? Everything will be different now. It is always this way when epochs change. I know that this will benefit the Russian economy."
Mr. Putin has sought to defuse concerns about the investigation, but faces questions at home and abroad. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, at a Kremlin meeting on Monday, deviated from a lengthy discussion on the Middle East to question the Russian president on the matter, one official familiar with the discussion said. "He expressed worry about the arrest," the official said, declining to characterize Mr. Putin's response.
European Union leaders are expected to raise the case when Mr. Putin meets them in Rome this week.
Many in Russia view the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky, 40, as a result of his clear political ambitions. In an interview in his office three weeks before his arrest, Mr. Khodorkovsky said he planned to end his business career when he turned 45 -- in 2008. "Afterward, in one form or another, I'm going to delve into public affairs," he said then.
In his statement on Monday, he said he would remain chairman of Open Russia, the philanthropic and political organization he created beginning in 2001. As improbable as a campaign from prison might seem, at least two other men awaiting trial, in St. Petersburg and the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk, have won election to regional assemblies from jail.
Irina Y. Yasina, a spokeswoman with Open Russia, refused to discuss the possibility of a political campaign by Mr. Khodorkovsky.
"I cannot comment on this in any case because the person is in prison, and in our country, where the aggression of the authorities is not regulated, I can't put him under such risk," she said. "It's frightening. If we say something about politics, he will not get out of there."

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN TACTICS BEING REVERSED AS EVENTS SHIFT 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
In Iowa on Monday, Howard Dean was talking not about the economy, but about the deadly turmoil in Iraq, and what it would mean for the presidential race.
 "It weakens the position of the president and my Democratic opponents," said Dr. Dean, a Democratic contender who, as one of the most vocal critics of the war, cited the attack on a Chinook helicopter that took the lives of 16 American soldiers on Sunday. "There are now almost 400 people dead who wouldn't be dead if that resolution hadn't been passed and we hadn't gone to war." 
 In Birmingham, Ala., in a speech to workers at a warehouse, President Bush talked less about the latest death toll and more about the report late last week of surging third quarter economic growth. 
"Our economy is gaining some momentum," he said, dismissing Democrats who had warned that his tax cuts would devastate the nation's economy. "We've got a consistent and effective strategy, and we're making progress."
The day was a snapshot of the presidential contest, as realities on the ground -- the upbeat economic growth figures and the deadly helicopter attack -- intruded on the best-laid plans of the candidates and this White House.
The Democrats want to blame Mr. Bush for a weak economy that may be finding its step just in time for next year's election, while Mr. Bush is confronting the possibility of campaigning against a backdrop of American casualties and chaos in the war he began.
So in the topsy-turvy world of presidential politics, Mr. Bush was talking up the economy -- the very issue that Democrats have long argued would make him a one-term president. And Democrats were hammering Mr. Bush on the very subject that many Republicans argued would guarantee his re-election: foreign policy.
This could very well prove to be a passing moment in the larger struggle of whether the course of this campaign will be determined more by foreign policy or by the economy. Still, over the last few days there has clearly been an across-the-board recalibration by Democrats and Mr. Bush as they try to keep up -- and capitalize on -- the changing landscape.
So in Alabama on Monday, Mr. Bush combined a somber declaration of perseverance in Iraq with a jaunty assessment of the economy. "Remember this last week, the surprising announcement -- at least, it confounded some of the experts -- that our third-quarter economic growth was vibrant, and that's good," he said. "Inflation is down, and that's good. After-tax incomes are up. People are keeping more of their own money, and that's really important for economic growth."
Several Democrats, meanwhile, moved to retool their message on the economy to account for the new economic figures. Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who campaigned in Iowa on Monday, said in a telephone interview that the growth figures would mean little to Americans who remain worried about high unemployment.
"Out across the country, people are very worried about jobs, worried about their families, worried about the potential for a plant or facility closing," Mr. Edwards said. "There's no such thing as a jobless recovery."
Wesley K. Clark, a retired general, issued a written statement saying: "On May 1, the president declared 'Mission Accomplished' on Iraq. Yet we still have no plan to bring peace to Iraq and protect our soldiers. President Bush seems ready to declare 'Mission Accomplished' on our economy. I say: 'Not yet Mr. President -- we've lost too many jobs.' "
In Clinton, Iowa, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts had just finished addressing a lunch when Highland Nichols, a retired construction worker and former chairman of the local county Democratic committee, expressed unvarnished concern to Mr. Kerry about what the economic figures would mean for Democratic hopes of retaking the White House.
"The administration had spokesmen out touting the rebound in the economy," he said, adding: "They were saying this is going to take away the Democratic platform."
Mr. Kerry responded: "I hope we have a good economy. It doesn't change anything that I'm saying or fighting about if we have a good economy. We still have a problem with health care for Americans, right?"
While the economic news may complicate the Democratic case against Mr. Bush, some Democrats are still struggling to define their positions on Iraq. Dr. Dean, for one, argues that his opponents who favored the war resolution were now in an even weaker political position given the events in Iraq.
"I think it was going to be a big issue anyway," Dr. Dean said in a telephone interview from Iowa. "But it certainly is going to be a more divisive issue among the Democrats, because things are clearly not going well. I think it works in favor of the Democrats -- if I become the nominee."
The candidates who voted for the resolution include Mr. Kerry, Mr. Edwards, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. General Clark, a retired general, has fiercely criticized Mr. Bush's Iraq policy, but last month in an interview described his position as the same as those members of Congress. He said he, too, probably would have voted for the resolution, but later retracted his statement.
Three other Democratic presidential candidates -- Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York and former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois -- have also been strong opponents of the war.
Those Democrats who voted for the resolution have been challenged on the votes almost wherever they go, from farms in Iowa to town hall meetings in New Hampshire to nearly every one of their televised debates. They are now struggling to defend the original votes, and move quickly to condemn Mr. Bush in an area where all the Democrats now view him as vulnerable.
"But what is truly infuriating is the fact that this administration, the Bush administration, conducted a foreign policy that so pushed our allies away," Mr. Lieberman told a women's missionary group at the Williams Chapel A.M.E. Church in Orangeburg, S.C., adding: "And then had no plans for what to do the day after Saddam fell that we're now in a situation which we ought not to be in, which is that American soldiers are almost totally alone in keeping the peace there. We saw the loss of 16 more yesterday."
Mr. Gephardt, who was one of the original sponsors of the Iraq resolution, said in Concord, N.H., that the nation could not step back now.
"We have to prevail," Mr. Gephardt told reporters. "We have to bring democracy to Iraq. We cannot fail. If you think Afghanistan was a terrorist training camp, you wait. If you leave Iraq, it will be a terrorist training camp the likes of which would make Afghanistan look simple. In our own deep self-interest, to prevent future acts of terrorism, we have to succeed."
He, too, proceeded to criticize Mr. Bush. "We need a president who can get the world to work together with us to solve this problem," Mr. Gephardt said.
Mr. Kerry struck a similar note in Iowa. "What the president is doing is in fact exposing the troops to greater danger than if he did the diplomacy correctly at bringing other countries into this effort," he said.

A22) Chart: "Following the Candidates"What the Democratic presidential candidates have said since Friday. CAROL MOSELEY BRAUN ABOUT THE ECONOMY"Everyone should applaud and must applaud the recent uptick in the economy. However, it still leaves us with huge budget deficits which will be a huge drag on the economy." ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ"It was a misadventure to be there in the first place. But now we are there, we have to find ways to bring our men and women home with honor." WESLEY K. CLARK ABOUT THE ECONOMY"President Bush seems ready to declare 'Mission Accomplished' on our economy. I say: 'Not yet, Mr. President; we've lost too many jobs.' " ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ"The first thing we need to do is get the U.N. or another international organization in charge of the political development in the country and take the U.S. out of that position." HOWARD DEAN ABOUT THE ECONOMY"I don't think the average person is feeling confidence in the economy. Ordinary people look for an increase in jobs, and there aren't any." ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ"There are now almost 400 people dead who wouldn't be dead if that resolution hadn't been passed and we hadn't gone to war." JOHN EDWARDS ABOUT THE ECONOMY"Out across the country, people are very worried about jobs, worried about their families, worried about the potential for a plant or facility closing. There's no such thing as a jobless recovery." ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ"As long as the Iraqi people view the reconstruction effort as run solely by the United States, our troops will be at ever-increasing risk and we will not achieve our goal of securing a stable, self-governing Iraq." RICHARD A. GEPHARDT ABOUT THE ECONOMY"I've been talking every day about issues that will get the economy to move, to create jobs. We have an economy which is in some kind of recovery from the recession, but it's not creating jobs." ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ"We need a president who can get the world to work together with us to solve this problem. That's why I said to him Bush on a number of occasions, 'You need help.' That was a major mistake on the part of this president." JOHN KERRY ABOUT THE ECONOMY"I hope we have a good economy. It doesn't change anything that I'm saying or fighting about if we have a good economy." ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ"What the president is doing is in fact exposing the troops to greater danger than if he did the diplomacy correctly at bringing other countries into this effort. We should have Muslim, Arab-speaking troops on the ground in Iraq today." DENNIS J. KUCINICH ABOUT THE ECONOMY"The reality is that it's a jobless economy, that wages are depressed, that more Americans are without health care." ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ"It is urgent for the United States to go to the U.N. with a new resolution which contains the basis of an exit strategy. It is time to bring our troops home. It is time to get the U.N. in and the U.S. out of Iraq." JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN ABOUT THE ECONOMY"But until those economic numbers reach the lives of real people, it is just not a recovery no matter how much George Bush tries to convince us it is." ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQThe Bush administration "had no plans for what to do the day after Saddam fell." "We now are in a situation which we ought not to be in, which is that American soldiers are almost totally alone in keeping the peace there." AL SHARPTON ABOUT THE ECONOMY"It's recovering only for the top income bracket and major corporations. We need a jobs-creation public-works program, not tax cuts and unfair trade agreements." ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ"We should immediately withdraw the troops and go to the United Nations and say that we were wrong to initiate a unilateral attack and we will submit to a multilateral redevelopment plan for submission by the U.N. and Kofi Annan."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: OLD WOUNDS; 
Iraqis Seek Justice, or Vengeance, For Victims of the Killing Fields

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Until justice is done and Saddam Hussein is dead, Sadri Adab Diwan will carry with him the handwritten accusation that condemned his little sister to death.
 The sister, Hanaa, a high school student, "is conducting backward religious activity inside the school," a security agent wrote in black ink in October 1980, a time of widespread persecution of Shiite Muslims. "Please open a secret investigation." 
 Soon afterward, Hanaa, a devout girl of 17, was arrested. She never returned home. 
It was only six months ago, after locating her yellowing case file in a government office, that her family finally learned why she had been taken. Hanaa, an informer reported, gave a Koran to a classmate.
"The case of this girl, this pure-hearted girl, has been living with me for 20 years," said Mr. Diwan, who was the eldest of 10 children of whom Hanaa was the youngest. "If I catch Saddam, I won't kill him. That won't be enough. I'll suck his blood. And if he escapes, I'll follow him to the ends of the earth."
Rage of such intensity courses through Iraq, where the dead, the maimed and the missing consume the thoughts of the living.
Six months after President Bush declared that major combat was over, countless problems crowd in on Iraqis, not least unemployment and the absence of security. But nothing seems to preoccupy them quite as much as the urge to settle accounts with the old government.
Suspected mass graves continue to come to light, replenishing the stores of grief and anger. Aided by forensic specialists and satellite imagery, American legal experts in Baghdad say they have found 262 sites that may contain multiple human remains.
Some people have already extracted their vengeance for the killing fields in blood. Most recently there has been a wave of apparent revenge killings in Basra. 
While there is no official tally of vigilante actions, accounts from the police and monitoring groups suggest that perhaps several hundred former Baath Party officials have been killed since the fall of President Hussein's government.
Yet there has been no orgy of bloodshed as was feared, given the scale of state-sponsored killings and expulsions that Iraqis say they have suffered in the last 25 years.
The concept of compensatory justice was born here nearly 4,000 years ago. An eye for an eye, decreed the rulers of ancient Mesopotamia, and a tooth for a tooth. But Iraqis have mostly shown a willingness to set aside immediate vengeance for the relentless pursuit of justice.
Counseled by leading Muslim clerics and most political figures to seek justice through the courts, many people appear to have focused their energies on assembling, case by case, a damning indictment of the ousted government. The existing legal system is already groaning under the weight of demands.
The bar association in Baghdad alone has received 50,000 claims against the old government for property confiscated and lives broken.
Civil and criminal courts are trying to process individual lawsuits filed against Mr. Hussein and his coterie, while thousands more cases of political repression are being amassed by groups of survivors and political parties.
In fact, the desire for some sort of retribution has also fueled much of Iraq's exuberant new brand of social activism.
Among the dozens of citizens' groups registered with the American-led occupation administration, a vast majority say they are human rights organizations seeking compensation or recognition for victims of the old order.
Some of the survivors are already pressing their cases, lobbying local governments to give preferential treatment in housing and jobs to former political prisoners.
"We have to let every single Iraqi file his case," said Qais Abbas Ridha, a district court judge in Baghdad. "We should broadcast these trials to the whole world. Who knew before about the mass graves? Who knew that these criminals had taken half of Baghdad as their private property?"
A few months ago, a merchant went to Judge Ridha's office asking for help. He said he had been robbed and tortured in the mid-1990's on orders from Izzat Ibrahim, a top aide to the former Iraqi leader who is still at large.
The judge examined the man's documents. He ordered a forensic doctor to examine the marks on the man's body. He interviewed witnesses. Then he issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Ibrahim and sent it to all of the police stations in Iraq.
Of course, the difficulty in all this is finding the appropriate balance between claims for justice arising from the past and Iraq's future needs. "All the oil revenues of generations of Iraqis won't be sufficient," said Malik Dohan al-Hassan, a director of the bar association, if Iraq's new leaders bankrupt the state to redress past wrongs. Then, he suggested, "the new government becomes another victim of Saddam Hussein."
Mr. Diwan soothes his own demons by making the rounds of human rights groups and lawyers' offices, showing them a tattered pink folder containing the record of his sister's persecution and death. The folder contained a list of people executed in one prison on a certain date. Her name was there.
He lost two of his brothers to the prisons of the old government. They, too, were arrested and executed in the roundup of suspected religious activists in the 1980's. But he has concentrated his anger on a single objective.
"If it had been one, I could forgive," he said. "If it had been two, I could forgive. But three -- three including this young, innocent girl -- no, I cannot forgive. Someone has to pay for the slaughter."
When Mr. Hussein's government collapsed in April, many Iraqis like Mr. Diwan ran to the ministries and intelligence service offices to grab up secret files containing the names of informers and the names of the dead. Before long, alarmed Shiite clerics and political leaders quietly intervened to take control of incriminating documents.
"People want to take their revenge, but these acts are not allowed," said Sheik Ali al-Waid, a Baghdad representative of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the country's most influential Shiite religious leader. "They will lead to chaos, to houses being burned, to whole families being killed. We don't want chaos."
Sheik Waid says he has tried to counsel by example.
"I was imprisoned for three years with my family -- even my old mother was detained with us -- even though none of use had anything to do with politics," he said. "It was because I refused to go to a rally for the Baath Party."
He knows who denounced him. "He knows that I know what he did," the cleric added. "Now he lives like a leper, exiled from the whole community, and he will get his judgment from God on judgment day."
The clerics' action to shield the names of informers and intelligence officers probably averted a bloodbath in some parts of the country. But neither Iraqi political leaders nor the occupation administrators believe that the public's demand for punishment can be delayed for long.
Members of the transitional Iraqi Governing Council have said repeatedly that the 40 senior officials now in American custody should be turned over to Iraqis for trial. Several thousand lower-level officials are also believed to be in the hands of American forces.
The Iraqis have already written a draft proposal for a special tribunal that would judge senior members of the Baath Party. It envisions an all-Iraqi panel of judges with power to sentence the guilty to death, a provision that troubles European nations and international human rights groups.
But few, if any, Iraqis express any ambivalence toward use of the death penalty in cases involving Mr. Hussein and his aides.
It may be the only issue on which all political and religious groups in postwar Iraq agree.
"They should die, several times over," said Hashem Abdulrahman al-Shebli, the interim justice minister.
Such feelings are not unusual in wounded nations emerging from the trauma of dictatorship or civil war, according to human rights experts. But in advising the Iraqis, the experts have also prodded them to look beyond punishment to national healing, perhaps through a process similar to the Truth and Reconciliation commissions set up by post-apartheid South Africa.
"It's important that there be a public acknowledgment of what happened," said Sandra L. Hodgkinson, a State Department official overseeing a transitional justice program here. "And they need to learn that there were others like Saddam Hussein in the world, that they were brought to justice and that reconciliation is possible."

A10) Chart/Map: "Rebuilding Iraq: An Assessment at Six Months"A look at some progress and some setbacks. Water and sewageThe water and sewage infrastructure were neglected for decades. THE SITUATION IN BAGHDADDamage to the city's power system during the war affected the water treatment system, which was dilapidated from years of neglect. Now, about 60 percent of Baghdad residents receive adequate water. The water authority is restoring the worst parts of the system. The U.S. Agency for International Develop-ment is overseeing a contract for equipment for water treatment. The sewage system was designed to support only half the current population of 5.6 million. In addition, the three major sewage treatment plants are not working because of looting and sabotage; untreated sewage is flowing into the Tigris. The occupying powers have allocated more than $100 million for fixing the sewer system, for long, short-term and emergency projects. HealthAn assessment of hospital equipment after the war by the Ministry of Health found that 65 percent of equipment across the country was not working. SOME IMPROVEMENTSUnder Saddam Hussein in 2002, $16 million was spent on health care. In 2003 the occupying powers will spend $422 million. Doctors are now paid $160 to $260 a month, up from $20 a month before the war. All 240 hospitals and more than 1,200 primary health clinics are open. EducationSchool buildings have not had maintenance programs since 1991 and the higher education system has been isolated from the international academic world. SOME IMPROVEMENTSData gathered from 10 primary and secondary schools showed an overall increase in student registration. Teachers' salaries are $60 to $300 a month, up from $5 to $13 before the war. Three grants worth a total of about $12 million were awarded to universities in tandem with American colleges for the study of archaeology and environmental research, agriculture and legal education. PowerBaghdad had power almost 24 hours a day before the war, but it was less available in the north and south of the country. DISTRIBUTION IN SOME CITIESInformation on prewar levels of electricity output are unavailable. Assess-ment of infrastructure by the occupying powers found dilapidated and outdated equipment.

HEADLINE: As Earth Warms, The Hottest Issue Is Energy 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
Suppose that over the next decade or two the forecasts of global warming start to come true. Color has drained from New England's autumns as maple trees die, and the Baltimore oriole can no longer be found south of Buffalo. The Dust Bowl has returned to the Great Plains, and Arctic ice is melting into open water. Upheavals in weather, the environment and life are accelerating around the world.
 Then what? 
 If global warming occurs as predicted, there will be no easy way to turn the Earth's thermostat back down. The best that most scientists would hope for would be to slow and then halt the warming, and that would require a top-to-bottom revamping of the world's energy systems, shifting from fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas to alternatives that in large part do not yet exist. 
"We have to face the fact this is an enormous challenge," said Dr. Martin I. Hoffert, a professor of physics at New York University.
But interviews with scientists, environment advocates and industry representatives show that there is no consensus in how to meet that challenge. Some look to the traditional renewable energy sources: solar and wind. Others believe use of fossil fuels will continue, but that the carbon dioxide can be captured and then stored underground. The nuclear power industry hopes concern over global warming may help spur a revival.
In an article in the journal Science last November, Dr. Hoffert and 17 other experts looked at alternatives to fossil fuels and found all to have "severe deficiencies in their ability to stabilize global climate."
The scientists believe that technological fixes are possible. Dr. Hoffert said the country needed to embark on an energy research program on the scale of the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb during World War II or the Apollo program that put men on the moon.
"Maybe six or seven of them operating simultaneously," he said. "We should be prepared to invest several hundred billion dollars in the next 10 to 15 years."
But to even have a hope of finding a solution, the effort must begin now, the scientists said. A new technology usually takes several decades to develop the underlying science, build pilot projects and then begin commercial deployment.
The authors of the Science paper expect that a smorgasbord of energy sources will be needed, and they call for intensive research on radical ideas like vast solar arrays orbiting Earth that can collect sunlight and beam the energy down. "Many concepts will fail, and staying the course will require leadership," they wrote. "Stabilizing climate is not easy."
The heart of the problem is carbon dioxide, the main byproduct from the burning of fossil fuels. When the atmosphere is rich in carbon dioxide, heat is trapped, producing a greenhouse effect. Most scientists believe the billions of tons of carbon dioxide released since the start of the Industrial Revolution are in part to blame for the one-degree rise in global temperatures over the past century. Carbon dioxide concentrations are now 30 percent higher than preindustrial levels. 
With rising living standards in developing nations, emissions of carbon dioxide are increasing, and the pace of warming is expected to speed up, too. Unchecked, carbon dioxide would reach twice preindustrial levels by midcentury and perhaps double again by the end of the century. That could force temperatures up by 3 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, according to computer models.
Because carbon dioxide is colorless, odorless and disperses immediately into the air, few realize how much spills out of tailpipes and smokestacks. An automobile, for example, generates perhaps 50 to 100 tons of carbon dioxide in its lifetime.
The United States produces more carbon dioxide than any other country by far. Each American, on average, generates about 45,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. That is about twice as much as the average person living in Japan or Europe and many times more than someone living in a developing country like Zimbabwe, China or Panama. (Even if the United States achieves President Bush's goal of an 18 percent reduction in the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions by 2012, the output of an average American would still far exceed that of almost anyone else in the world.)
Even if all emissions stop, levels of carbon dioxide in the air will remain high for centuries as the Earth gradually absorbs the excess.
Currently, the world's energy use per second is about 12 trillion watts -- which would light up 120 billion 100-watt bulbs -- and 85 percent of that comes from fossil fuels. 
Of the remaining 15 percent, nuclear and hydroelectric power each supply about 6.5 percent. The renewable energy sources often touted as the hope for the future -- wind and solar -- provide less than 2 percent.
In March, Dr. Hoffert and two colleagues reported in Science that to limit the temperature increase to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, non-carbon-dioxide-emitting sources would have to generate 7 trillion to 25 trillion watts by midcentury, 4 to 14 times as much as current levels. That is roughly equivalent to adding a large emissions-free power plant every day for the next 50 years.
And by the end of the century, they wrote, at least three-quarters and maybe all of the world's energy would have to be emission-free.
No existing technology appears capable of filling that void. The futuristic techology might be impractically expensive. Developing a solar power satellite, for example, has been estimated at more than $200 billion.
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham cited the Science paper from last November in a speech at the American Academy in Berlin two months ago. Mr. Abraham said that merely setting limits and timetables on carbon dioxide like those in the Kyoto Protocol could not by themselves solve global warming.
"We will also need to develop the revolutionary technologies that make these reductions happen," Mr. Abraham said. "That means creating the kinds of technologies that do not simply refine current energy systems, but actually transform the way we produce and consume energy."

Too Far Away
Some long-hoped-for options will almost certainly not be ready. Fusion -- producing energy by combining hydrogen atoms into helium, the process that lights up the sun -- has been heralded for decades as a potentially limitless energy source, but scientists still have not shown it can be harnessed practically. Experimental fusion reactors do not yet produce more power than they take to run.
Increased energy efficiency -- like better-insulated buildings, more efficient air-conditioners, higher mileage cars -- is not a solution by itself, but it could buy more time to develop cleaner energy.
The much-talked-about hydrogen economy, in which gasoline-powered engines are replaced by fuel cells, is also not a solution. It merely shifts the question to what power source is used to produce the hydrogen. 
Today, most hydrogen is made from natural gas, a process that produces carbon dioxide that is then released into the air. Hydrogen can also be produced by splitting apart water atoms, but that takes more energy than the hydrogen will produce in the fuel cell. If the electricity to split the water comes from the coal-fired power plant, then a hydrogen car would not cut carbon dioxide emissions.

Exploiting What's Here
A fundamental problem remains: how to produce electricity without carbon dioxide.
Hydroelectric power has reached its limits in most parts of the world; there are no more rivers to dam. 
Nuclear power is a proven technology to generate large amounts of electricity, but before it could be expanded, the energy industry would have to overcome longstanding public fears that another accident, like those at Three Mile Island or Chernobyl, will occur. Solutions also need to be found for disposing of radioactive spent fuel and safeguarding it from terrorists.
Marvin Fertel, senior vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group, said warming had become such a worrythat some environmental groups were becoming amenable to new nuclear plants. "In private, that's what we get from them," he said.
Researchers at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif., espouse a major expansion of nuclear power, coupled with a switch from gasoline to hydrogen to power cars and trucks. Electricity from the nuclear plants would split water to produce hydrogen, and then cables made of superconductors would distribute both electricty and hydrogen, which would double as coolant for the cables, across the country.
"I think in 30 to 50 years there will be systems like this," said Dr. Chauncey Starr, the institute's founder and emeritus president. "I think the advantages of this are sufficient to justify it."
In the short run, fossil fuels will still be widely used, but it is still possible to control carbon dioxide.
In his Berlin speech, Mr. Abraham highlighted two projects the Energy Department was working on: carbon sequestration -- the capturing of carbon dioxide before it is emitted and storing it underground -- and FutureGen, a $1 billion prototype coal power plant that will produce few emissions. The plant will seek to demonstrate by 2020 how to convert coal to hydrogen on a commercial scale that will then be used to generate electricity in fuel cells or turbines. The waste carbon dioxide would be captured and stored. 
The technology for injecting carbon dioxide is straightforward, but scientists need better knowledge on suitable locations and leak prevention.
Sequestration, however, will probably not be cost-effective for current power plants. The filters for capturing carbon dioxide from the exhaust gas will by themselves consume 20 percent to 30 percent of the power plant's electricity.

Renewing Renewables
Solar is still a future promise. The cost of energy from solar cells has dropped sharply in the past few decades. One kilowatt-hour of electricity -- the energy to light a 100-watt bulb for 10 hours -- used to cost several dollars when produced by solar cells. Now it is only about 35 cents. With fossil fuels, a kilowatt-hour costs just a few cents.
But solar still has much room for improvement. Commercial cells are only 10 to 15 percent efficient. With much more research, new strategies to absorb sunlight more efficiently could lead to cells that reached 50 to 60 percent efficiency. If the cells could be made cheaply enough, they could produce electricity for only 1 or 2 cents a kilowatt-hour.
Dr. Arthur Nozik, a senior research fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., said the advanced solar concepts were scientifically feasible. But, echoing Dr. Hoffert, Dr. Nozik said: "We need like a Manhattan Project or an Apollo program to put a lot more resources into solving the problem. It's going to require a revolution, not an evolution. I wouldn't expect to get there in 2050 if we're going at the same pace." 
But if scientists succeed with a cheap, efficient solar cell, "you'd be on Easy Street," Dr. Nozik said.
Wind power is already practical in many places like Denmark, where 17 percent of the electricity comes from wind turbines. The newest turbines, with propellers as wide in diameter as a football field, produce energy at a cost of 4 or 5 cents a kilowatt-hour. Further refinements like lighter rotors could drop the price by another cent or two, making it directly competitive with natural gas.
Dr. Robert W. Thresher, director of the National Wind Technology Center at the energy laboratory, envisions large farms of wind turbines being built offshore. "They would be out of sight," he said. "There's no shortage of space and wind."
Solar and wind power will be hampered because the sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow. The current power grid is not well suited for intermittent power sources because the amount of power produced at any moment must match the amount being consumed. To exploit the sun and wind, utilities would have to develop devices that could act as giant batteries.
One concept is to pump compressed air into an underground cavern. When electricity was needed, the air would be released, and the air pressure would turn a turbine to generate electricity.

The Big Ideas
Then there are the big ideas that could change everything. To get around the problem of the intermittency in solar power, solar arrays could be placed where the sun shines 24 hours a day -- in space. The power could be beamed to the ground via microwaves.
Another big idea comes from Dr. Klaus S. Lackner, a professor of geophysics at Columbia University: what if carbon dioxide could be scrubbed out of the air? His back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate it may be feasible, although he is far from being ready to demonstrate how.
But if that were possible, that would eliminate the need to shift from gasoline to hydrogen for cars. That would save the time and cost of building pipelines for shipping hydrogen, and gasoline is in many ways a superior fuel than hydrogen. (Hydrogen needs to be stored under very high pressure or at very cold temperatures.) Owners of gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s could assuage their guilt by paying for the scrubbing of carbon dioxide produced by their vehicles.
Eventually, the captured carbon dioxide could be processed to create an artificial gasoline, Dr. Lackner said. Then the world would discover, much to its surprise, that everything old would be new and clean again.
"Carbon may actually be just as clean, just as renewable," Dr. Lackner said.

HEADLINE: One Recipe for a (Mostly) Emissions-Free Economy 

BYLINE:  By BILL MARSH

 BODY:
Fueling civilization a half-century from now and stemming global warming is a titanic challenge. It is inspiring big ideas, but not nearly enough research to pull them off.
 This page illustrates just one possible portfolio of future United States energy sources and the potential share of each, as envisioned by several experts. Each fuel has its partisans and skeptics experts do disagree. 
 That's why, in the second chart below, the portion of future needs carried by each technology is loosely defined, based on estimates and models. None of these schemes is certain to work. Some may be thwarted by science and engineering hurdles, as noted below, or by government policy; others could assume a far greater share of the burden than depicted here.
 Theoretically, solar or wind power or nuclear fusion could each meet the entire global energy demand. But their development could also fall short, so other methods may need to be ready to go an argument for research on many daunting fronts.
 Space-based solar power faces especially tall odds, given costs for launching and assembly. But there are precedents for sophisticated new technologies becoming widespread and affordable: the still young computer chip industry has seen its costs plunge by a factor of thousands.
 Hydrogen doesnt make the list because it is a carrier of energy, not a source; large amounts of other fuels are needed to manufacture it. Hydrogen burns clean, with only water as a byproduct. But if it is created with fossil fuels, hydrogen is ultimately as polluting as they are, offering little help in reducing greenhouse gases, unless the carbon is somehow separated and stored. (One novel possibility: advances in genetic science might yield biological production of hydrogen from microbes.)
 What would it take to get to an economy largely free of carbon emissions?
 Dr. Martin I. Hoffert of New York University estimates a total cost up to $400 billion, perhaps more. Roughly $10 billion a year through 2050 is, to paraphrase a politicians famous quip, real money. But not an unimaginable sum: it is about one one-thousandth of the annual gross domestic product of $10 trillion.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "U.S. Energy Needs"In quadrillion B.T.U.'s 2002 -- 97.62050 -- 132.7 Charts shows 2003 U.S. Energy Mix and Potential Energy Mix After 2050. Chart/Diagram:SMALL-SCALE OPERATION -- Technologies with the potential to make buildings energy independent. EARTH-BASED SOLAR 2003 SHARE OF U.S. ENERGY 0.7%EQUIVALENT TO POWER USED BY: NEW MEXICOPOTENTIAL AFTER 2050: LARGE Most comercially available photovoltaic systems convert only about 15 percent of sunlight energy to electricity; research cells reach 30 percent. Larger obstacles to widespread use include cost and a national electric grid that is unsuited for intermittent sources. Thermal systems that concentrate sunlight to produce heat for power generation are promising. NEEDED: BETTER SILICON -- A dedicated source would replace costly secondhand silicon from chip industry. ECONOMIES OF SCALE -- Better fabrication methods could reduce prices. WIND 2003 SHARE 1%EQUIVALENT TO POWER USED BY: DELAWARE AND UTAHPOTENTIAL: LARGE The world's fastest-growing energy source, increasing 30 percent annually. (Denmark gets 17 percent of its electricity from wind.) There is enough wind energy in North Dakota, Texas and Kansas to meet the nations present power needs. Larger turbines, like the Enercon E-112 from Germany, can produce enough power for 2,000 to 4,000 homes the same as 450 windmills from 1980. EFFICIENCIES POTENTIAL: LARGE In 2001, California reduced its energy use by more than 6 percent, largely by voluntary behavior change. The economy normally improves efficiency at about 1 percent a year, but much more could be done, particularly in buildings, which use about one-third of all energy, and transportation. NEEDED: BETTER BUILDING CONSTRUCTION -- Mass customization: move most work from field to more efficient factory setting. ZERO-ENERGY BUILDINGS -- High-efficiency design with solar power could be a net energy producer. COMBINED HEAT AND POWER -- About half the energy waste in power generation could be eliminated by producing electricity and useful heat in the same process. HYDRO/GEOTHERMAL 2003 SHARE 3%EQUIVALENT TO POWER USED BY: MICHIGANPOTENTIAL: SMALL/MODERATE Hydroelectric power has largely realized its potential, so its share of increased energy demand will shrink. Geothermal methods hold promise for some locations, but they probably won't become leading sources. WOOD AND PLANTS 2003 SHARE 2%EQUIVALENT TO POWER USED BY: MASSACHUSETTSPOTENTIAL: SMALL/MODERATE Burning plant material is a closed loop: it releases the same carbon the plants absorbed while growing. Land-use concerns limit its potential unless major advances in bioengineering are made. GAS SUBSTITUTION POTENTIAL: MODERATE Lower-emission fossil fuels, especially natural gas and some cleanerburning alcohols, are seen as a bridge to an ultimately carbon-free economy. SPACE-BASED SOLAR POTENTIAL: MODERATE/LARGE Satellites can collect eight times as much solar energy on the same surface area as earthbound collectors. Stations on the Moon could return about 200 times as much energy per pound of material from earth as satellites; they could be built largely from lunar materials. Capturing just 1 percent of the solar energy that hits the Moon could meet all global energy needs in 2050. NEEDED: LIGHTWEIGHT ARRAY -- Thin, durable collectors easy to put in orbit. ECONOMIES OF SCALE -- Launch and fabrication costs must be lowered by a factor of 10,000. RESEARCH into advanced optics, electonics, materials. NEXT GENERATION NUCLEAR POTENTIAL: LARGE Today's fission reactors produce deadly waste lasting thousands of years. Supplies of uranium fuel are limited and plant accidents could be catastrophic; the process also can provide weapons material. Fission improvements are possible, but aggressive research could perfect fusion, which is more promising longterm: its fuel is abundant, and its minimal waste is unsuitable for weapons. NEEDED: CONTROLLED REACTION DEMONSTRATION -- Preparations are under way for the first plant, which will require a decade of work. WASTE THAT RECYCLES -- Neutrons eventually make the containment structure radioactive. Cooling-off time for the best containment material could be reduced to less than 30 years. It would be reused, eliminating the need for disposal. EFFICIENCIES, INCLUDING IMPROVED ELECTRICAL GRIDS POTENTIAL: LARGE About 10 percent of electricity is lost in transmission. Better systems would have much higher efficiencies, in effect providing a substantial portion of future energy needs and allowing distant generation of wind and other energy sources for major population centers. NEEDED: NANOTECHNOLOGY -- New micro-engineered materials for storage and transport of hydrogen. SUPERCONDUCTING PIPELINE -- Underground power conduits (left) using supercooled hydrogen must be stable and flawlessly insulated or they will lose their superconductivity. CARBON STORAGE POTENTIAL: LARGE Large-scale underground storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuels may be difficult. A safer but even more challenging solution is to sequester it as a solid, abundant and suitable for construction material. NEEDED: CHEMISTRY ADVANCE -- Speed up centuries-long weathering process (left) that turns CO2 into rock. SECURE UNDERGROUND STORAGE -- Accidental leaks of CO2 gas could be catastrophic, displacing the breathable atmosphere around storage areas. Long-term leakage could release enough gas to erase the benefits of storage. (Sources by Dr. Martin I.

HEADLINE: U.S. Persuades Allies to Halt North Korean Atom Project 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
The Bush administration persuaded its Asian and European allies on Tuesday to suspend a multibillion-dollar project to build two nuclear power reactors in North Korea, in what appeared to be the last step in the dissolution of the 1994 accord that temporarily froze North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
 After a meeting in New York on Tuesday, representatives from the international energy consortium set up under the agreement said that by Nov. 21, Japan, South Korea, the United States and the European Union would announce the fate of the project. "The executive board decided to refer this to the capitals," the Korean Energy Development Organization said. 
 But officials who attended the meeting said that the announcement was a formality, and that the decision to suspend the project had been reached. That will probably kill it because, according to senior officials in Washington, Mr. Bush has no intention of ever reviving a nuclear energy program in North Korea, even if an agreement is reached on controlling its nuclear weapons program. The United States has raised the possibility of helping with non-nuclear energy efforts as part of a North Korean accord to disarm. 
The State Department made clear on Tuesday that whatever the diplomatic wording about suspension, the project is dead. "Our view is that we want an end to the program," said Adam Early, the department's deputy spokesman.
The announcement would effectively be the death knell for the 1994 accord, the so-called Agreed Framework, which was reached after the Clinton administration and North Korea appeared headed toward a confrontation over the North's nuclear weapons program.
The accord has long been a target of hawks inside the Bush administration, who insist that North Korea began cheating on the agreement almost as soon as the ink was dry. They also were critical of provisions that had American taxpayers financing the supply of fuel oil for North Korea in return for its agreement to freeze, but not dismantle, the program. Still, about 550 workers -- about 100 North Koreans and several hundred workers from Uzbekistan and engineers from South Korea -- have been busy preparing the ground for the first nuclear reactor. 
The South Korean government had argued in favor of keeping the construction going -- even at a slower pace -- to keep the North talking about dismantling its nuclear programs. Mr. Bush refused, saying that the North abrogated its rights to the reactors when it secretly started a second weapons program, based on uranium-enrichment technology it obtained from Pakistan. 
 The South Korean foreign minister, Yoon Young Kwan, said at a press briefing on Wednesday: "The position was based on the premise that the project could resume a year later. It is no more or no less than that. It was not an official decision, which is expected before Nov. 21.
 "With no response from North Korea so far, it would be inappropriate to make predictions," he said. "It would be inappropriate to predict what impact this would have on future six-way talks." 
Mr. Bush began the squeeze on North Korea by cutting off the American-supplied fuel oil. North Korea responded by restarting the plant that fabricates weapons fuel. Nevertheless, construction workers kept digging and building at the huge nuclear site in Kumho, on the North Korean coast, because that project, worth $4.6 billion, was largely financed by South Korea and Japan. It is the largest, most expensive construction project in North Korea, a desperately poor country, and it is unclear how the North Korean government will react to its suspension.
While Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has frequently said the Agreed Framework may have prevented North Korea from building scores of nuclear weapons over the past decade, others have criticized it harshly. President Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, has often argued that Mr. Clinton erred by not insisting that all nuclear material be shipped out of North Korea, and by offering energy aid before the North had fully disarmed.
The man who negotiated the treaty, Robert L. Gallucci, now dean of the Georgetown School of Foreign Service, said in an interview on Tuesday that the program probably should have been suspended a year ago, when North Korea admitted to violating the nuclear freeze. But he argued that announcing its complete demise was a mistake.
"There is no reason to bury it, and to project a posture of no interest in regenerating the deal," Mr. Gallucci said. "We need every carrot we have with the North Koreans -- and saying that it is dead is gratuitous, an appeal to a domestic audience."
A senior Asian official said tonight that while the final announcement later this month will refer to the suspension of the agreement, the United States and it allies understand that if no substitute agreement is reached in six-nation negotiations with the North, "there is no chance this program will be revived."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Network TV officials ponder their own financial whodunit: Where have all the young men gone?

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
AS the case of the missing younger male viewers grows curiouser, as Sherlock Holmes might have put it, the presidents of the entertainment divisions of broadcast network television are weighing in with their worries.
 The issue the executives debated at an annual industry breakfast yesterday is one that has been perplexing and befuddling them, as well as advertisers and agencies, since the summer: Why have the data from Nielsen Media Research, which reports television ratings, been showing declines in viewership among men aged 18 to 34 watching prime-time programs on the six broadcast networks? 
 The question is vexing the executives because tens of millions of dollars in advertising revenue could be at stake. Male consumers are harder to reach for marketers than women because they watch less television, and younger men are hardest to reach of all. 
That makes them highly prized, hence the concern over the recent dislocations in the ratings results, which showed the viewership by men aged 18 to 34 of prime-time shows on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN and WB falling unexpectedly -- and inexplicably -- compared with 2002.
From July through September, according to Nielsen, the decline in broadcast prime time was averaging 9 percent, and as the 2003-4 broadcast TV season got under way, it was running about 7 percent. Last Thursday, the first night of the November sweeps -- one of four periods a year when ratings are used to help determine ad rates -- the decline had dwindled to 1 percent, raising hopes that it had been some kind of "Dallas"-style bad dream.
But in the evenings since, the decline has worsened significantly, Nielsen said yesterday: down 21 percent on Friday, 13 percent on Saturday, 9 percent on Sunday and 19 percent on Monday. The five-night average for the sweeps to date: down 12.6 percent.
Making the matter even more mysterious is that while the younger male viewers have apparently been deserting the broadcast prime-time offerings, there have been virtually no declines in viewership of cable TV by these younger men. Nor are the data showing the decline occurring during other parts of the day like late at night.
At the breakfast, sponsored by the International Radio and Television Society Foundation in New York, the entertainment division presidents spoke to a widespread belief that some type of problem involving faulty measurement at Nielsen, owned by VNU, is skewing the numbers.
Jeff Zucker, president at NBC Entertainment, part of the NBC division of the General Electric Company, questioned why the data were showing steep declines in viewership among males aged 18 to 34 for long-running hit series like "Friends" and "Will & Grace" on his network as well as "C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation" and "Everybody Loves Raymond" on CBS, owned by Viacom, and "Malcolm in the Middle" and "24" on Fox, part of the News Corporation. 
Jordan Levin, president at WB Entertainment, part of the WB division of Time Warner and Tribune Company, also wondered why the ratings for younger men watching popular series with large audiences were all falling at the same time.
Nielsen needs to be more explicit in explaining the discrepancies, he added, rather than only offering suggestions as to what may be taking place. One response from Nielsen executives is that the younger men have been defecting from broadcast network television to play videogames, surf the Internet and watch DVD's. 
Susan Lyne, president at ABC Entertainment, part of the ABC Television division of ABC, owned by the Walt Disney Company, asked whether younger male viewers in Nielsen households might be less eager to record their viewership habits and patterns than their older counterparts.
Needless to say, Nielsen, which has built its ratings service through the decades into a lucrative business line, is worried that the executives are worried.
"We are seeing a downward trend and we're not sure what's causing it," Karen Gyimesi, a spokeswoman for Nielsen, said yesterday.
"We've been working with our network clients very closely on this for several months," she added, "analyzing our sample as much as we can in all different directions."
Another theory as to why the younger men have seemingly vanished is that the prime-time schedules of the six broadcast networks for the fall season include more new series that appeal to women, and older viewers, than to men from 18 to 34.
"Name three series that appeal to young men -- you can't," said Steven Sternberg, senior vice president and director for audience analysis at a big media services agency in New York, Magna Global USA, part of the Magna Global division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. 
"If you're not programming to them," he added, "they ain't going to be there."
"If there is something going on with Nielsen's research, it's not the major factor," Mr. Sternberg said. "It's clear at this point it's a programming issue."
Mr. Zucker, during the breakfast, said he agreed in part with that theory, adding that he was willing to take some responsibility for the prime-time plight because fewer new NBC series for 2003-4 had been aimed at the younger male viewers than at other audiences.
One such show is "Las Vegas," which has been doing well for the network on Monday nights. Other new NBC series, perhaps not Must See TV for men ages 18 to 34, include "Miss Match" and "Whoopi."
Hmmmmmmmmmm. Perhaps one solution could be a midseason replacement called "Young Sherlock Holmes, or Dude, Where's My Meerschaum?"

HEADLINE: Workers Go on Strike at 2 of Manhattan's Most Prestigious Restaurants 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The "21" Club and La Caravelle, two of Manhattan's most venerable restaurants, pride themselves on their sedate atmosphere, but yesterday the scene outside those establishments was anything but sedate as their workers went on strike, and shouted vehemently at anyone heading inside.
 Nearly 100 cooks, waiters, dishwashers and busboys gathered in front of the "21" Club on West 52nd Street in the late morning, forcing the restaurant to close its main dining room for lunch. The strikers bellowed chants that could be heard at the one private function being held there at lunchtime. 
 The main issue in the walkout, as with many other strikes across the nation, is the restaurants' push to get their workers to pay more toward their health coverage. The restaurants want the workers to begin paying at least part of their health insurance premiums, but the workers, knowing they are employed by institutions that cater largely to the rich, insist that the restaurants owners can easily afford any increase in health insurance costs. 
"The union never had to pay a premium for health coverage, and it never will," said John Papaliberios, a waiter at the "21" Club. "A lot of the dishwashers and cooks earn just $9, $10, $11 an hour, and they can't afford to pay more for their health coverage."
Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, the city's largest union of restaurant workers, chose the two Midtown restaurants as its pressure points in a contract fight involving 800 workers at 25 New York City restaurants, including the Four Seasons, Cafe des Artistes and the Oyster Bar. The contracts at all 25 restaurants expired on Saturday.
Talks broke off Friday evening, but the two sides resumed intense negotiations at 11:30 a.m. yesterday with the help of a federal mediator. Brooks Bitterman, research director of Local 100, warned that the walkout might be expanded to other restaurants within the next week if an agreement was not reached soon.
Last night, Richard Wilsker, the chief negotiator for many of the restaurants, said there was a "reasonable breakthrough in the negotiations" for three restaurants that are seen as leaders in the talks for management -- the "21" Club, La Caravelle and the Four Seasons.
In the months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, restaurant owners noted that their business was down sharply, and insisted that they needed to hold down labor and other costs, especially soaring health care costs. The strike came as the restaurant business was starting to show marked improvement, due in part to an improving economy.
The restaurants have proposed having the workers pay $5 a week for health premiums in the first year of a three-year contract, whether workers have individual or family coverage. That would rise to $520 a year in the contract's second year and $780 in the third year.
The restaurant owners argue that it is only fair for the workers to begin contributing toward their health premiums, because employers nationwide face health costs that are rising by more than 10 percent a year. 
But Adalberto Alonso, the bartender at La Caravelle, who is known for inventing a Champagne and vodka drink, the Adalberto No. 1, said, "We're on strike for health benefits. It's not fair that they want to reduce it."
Diana Biederman, the spokeswoman for the "21" Club, said the restaurant kept its main dining room closed for dinner last night, but served a large private party at dinnertime. She said that the six top chefs were working -- they are not in the union -- and that more than 40 replacement workers had crossed the picket line.
Union officials said the dishwashers and busboys earn an average of $8 to $11 an hour, while assistant cooks average $10 to $13 an hour, although more senior assistant cooks earn up to $20 an hour. At the "21" Club, the waiters' wages and tips often exceed $25 an hour on busy days.
Union officials said management had offered the cooks a total raise of $45 a week over three years and the dishwashers a raise of $36. Management is not offering a raise to the waiters. The union is asking for raises of $60 over three years for the cooks and dishwashers.

HEADLINE: Former HealthSouth Chief Indicted by U.S. 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM and ERIC LICHTBLAU 

 BODY:
The Justice Department yesterday unveiled an 85-count indictment portraying Richard M. Scrushy as the mastermind of a multibillion-dollar scheme to defraud investors by inflating the profits of HealthSouth, the hospital company he founded and led as chief executive until his ouster earlierthis year.
 Mr. Scrushy, 51, entered a not guilty plea in Federal District Court in Birmingham, Ala., where the company is based and where he rose to prominence as an entrepreneur and philanthropist. On his personal Web site, he posted a defiant statement proclaiming, "I now embrace the opportunity to clear my name." 
 Experts on white-collar crime said the case gave federal prosecutors their best chance yet in the corporate scandals to secure the conviction of a former chief executive. Fourteen former HealthSouth executives and accounting managers who have already pleaded guilty to various fraud charges -- including all five of the company's former chief financial officers -- are expected to testify against Mr. Scrushy. So are numerous employees not implicated in the government's investigation.
"The government will use those witnesses to testify that Mr. Scrushy was a hands-on C.E.O., that he knew everything that was going on in every corner of the company, and that it was inconceivable that he was unaware of the gross inflation of corporate assets and income," said Eric Havien, a former federal prosecutor who is now with Phillips & Cohen, a San Francisco law firm. "They won't need to rely on criminally culpable people to put on that sort of testimony."
Mr. Scrushy and his lawyers say that HealthSouth executives conceived and carried out the fraud without his knowledge and then blamed him in an attempt to obtain lighter punishment for themselves. 
"I expect the case to boil down to the credibility of the C.F.O.'s versus Scrushy's credibility," said Donald K. Watkins, Mr. Scrushy's lead lawyer. "By their own admission, we know that the C.F.O.'s have engaged in a pattern and practice of deception, where they had a duty to tell the truth."
The indictment charges that Mr. Scrushy used threats, bribes, surveillance and eavesdropping to intimidate his lieutenants into participating in an effort to inflate the company's profits by $2.74 billion from 1996 to 2002. HealthSouth executives talked of "filling the hole" or "filling the gap" when they made false entries in the company's books, the indictment says. 
As recently as March, when an investment bank proposed a leveraged buyout of HealthSouth using about $250 million in cash shown on the company's books, the indictment says, Mr. Scrushy ordered the bank steered away from the cash.
And as early as the summer of 1999, the indictment says, a HealthSouth officer asked Mr. Scrushy to review financial data showing that the company was exaggerating its earnings. He "confronted" this person, the indictment says, ordering the executive not to try to tell him "how to run the company." 
After accounting employees balked at continuing the fraud last year, according to the indictment, Mr. Scrushy helped devise a plan to stop making false income reports and to publicly blame the resulting lower income on a change in government Medicare payment policies. 
When Mr. Scrushy made that announcement in August 2002, HealthSouth stock plummeted. The shares traded as high as $12.19 a few days before the disclosure; yesterday, in over-the-counter trading, they closed at $2.78, down 3 cents.
Magistrate Judge T. Michael Putnam set a trial date of Jan. 5 in Birmingham. Mr. Scrushy was released on a $10 million bond secured by a mortgage on his properties in Alabama. He was ordered to surrender his passport, the keys to his airplane and his pilot's license and to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. He must remain in northern and central Alabama, away from his waterfront properties in Palm Beach, Fla., and the Alabama Gulf Coast.
Mr. Scrushy was permitted to surrender yesterday morning to F.B.I. agents, away from news cameras. "I didn't want a perp walk," said Alice Martin, the United States attorney in Birmingham. "That's not my job."
A grand jury in Birmingham handed down the indictment under seal last Wednesday, but it was announced yesterday in Washington by Ms. Martin and Christopher Wray, an assistant attorney general. Mr. Scrushy "and his accomplices lied -- they cooked HealthSouth's books and Scrushy personally vouched for false financial statements with the S.E.C. to cover up their scheme," Mr. Wray said.
The trial will be a first test of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed by Congress last year after Enron, Worldcom and other big companies fell to fraud. The law seeks to hold top executives personally responsible for the financial reports of their companies.
"This will test whether the government can ever succeed in a securities fraud prosecution, because they'll never have more witnesses than they have in this case," said John Coffee, an authority on securities law at Columbia University law school.
The indictment charges Mr. Scrushy with conspiracy; mail, wire and securities fraud; false statements; false certifications; and money laundering -- the latter by using fraudulently obtained money to buy and support his four homes, expensive boats and cars, wine cellars, extensive real estate holdings, and an art collection that includes paintings by Picasso, Chagall, Renoir and Miro.
Prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of those assets and others worth more than $278 million to pay fines and compensate shareholders, Justice Department officials said.

	 	 		--------------------	 	

Congressional Hearing
(By Bloomberg News) -- A former UBS analyst, Howard Capek, who touted the HealthSouth Corporation's stock after he called the company a "pig," is scheduled to appear at a Congressional hearing investigating $2.75 billion in fraud at the hospital owner.
A UBS investment banker, Benjamin Lorello, and William McGahan, formerly a banker at the firm, also are among witnesses for a hearing today in Washington. Mr. Lorello and Mr. McGahan took HealthSouth public in 1986 when they were with Salomon Smith Barney.
A subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee is expected to ask the bankers and Mr. Capek if they were aware of any fraud at HealthSouth. 
HealthSouth's acting chairman, Joel C. Gordon, and its acting chief executive, Robert May, also are scheduled to testify.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET --New Jersey; 
Livingston's Old Plaza to Make Way for Retail Hub

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE

DATELINE: LIVINGSTON, N.J., Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Livingston Manor Shopping Plaza has long been considered a white elephant in the heart of this sprawling suburb. But soon the dowdy 1920's plaza will be bulldozed to make way for a mixed-use development intended to give Livingston a commercial hub it is now missing.
 The development, to be called Livingston Town Center, is to have 50,000 square feet of stores -- from boutiques to restaurants and upscale food shops -- and 20,000 square feet of offices, with apartments above some of the stores, as well as a 233-car garage. These components are to take shape over the next 15 months on the 3.8 acres occupied by the existing center. 
 The rest of the planned 114 residences, as well as four small parks, are to rise on 9.5 wooded acres next to the old, mostly vacant, retail strip. Silverman's, a card and newspaper emporium and a local fixture, will be the only tenant to relocate. 
The nearly 14-acre, $60 million project, to be completed by 2006, will be built under a redevelopment plan township officials adopted in 2002 after years of planning, debate and legal wrangling over the future of the strategic site. 
The project is planned for one of the busiest intersections in this 14-square-mile community, with a patchwork of small retail strips, scattered stores and, in the southwestern section of the town, an enclosed two-level mall with more than 100 shops, the Livingston Mall.
The developer, designated by township officials last year, is a partnership among three New Jersey companies: the Eastman Management Corporation of Livingston, Jacobs Enterprises of Clifton and the Roseland Property Company of Short Hills. This month the partners, with financing from Wachovia Bank, will acquire the entire site from Livingston Manor, a family-owned company. Demolition of the old plaza is to begin next month.
Peter E. Schofel, president of Eastman Management, said creating a new town center made sense not only from an aesthetic perspective but a retail and economic one. Some 206,841 people with an average household income of $141,430 live within a five-mile radius of the site. 
Jerry Rockoff, who handles the New Jersey market at the Manhattan retail brokerage firm of Robert K. Futterman, added that the project was in an area where demand for retail space had remained strong and rents had held steady. He said it also reflected "the resurgence of downtowns," a trend in the last five years during which occupancy of retail space has been evolving from local merchants to more regional and even national tenants as consumers prefer to walk to shops in their own towns rather than drive to enclosed malls.
Livingston Town Center will have up to 14 stores, each with 700 to 6,000 square feet of space. George Jacobs of Jacobs Enterprises said the space would be marketed to retailers not now in Livingston. 
Livingston merchants support the project, said Beth Lippman, executive director of the Livingston Community Partnership Management Corporation, which runs the township's business improvement district. "More businesses bring in more people and more opportunities," she said. 
Mr. Schofel said asking annual rents at Livingston Town Center would be in the high-$30-a-square-foot range, excluding taxes, utilities and maintenance, which Mr. Rockoff and Ms. Lippman said were competitive. Mr. Jacobs said four leases were out to be signed by tenants, two of them national retailers. 
Getting to this point has not been easy. After years of seeing the old plaza steadily deteriorate and worrying over its impact on the town's aesthetics, local officials in 2000 declared the plaza site an area in need of redevelopment. The owners filed a lawsuit against the township that resulted in an out-of-court settlement two years later.
The plaza's owner and town officials agreed on the current redevelopment plan and area, which grew to its present size from 3.8 acres, as well as on the developer group. Increasing the project's size, said Stephen A. Stanola, Livingston's mayor, elevates it from just another retail strip to a town center that would inject "life and vitality to Livingston's entire commercial zone" and be a catalyst for more investment. 
To meet concerns from nearby residents about increased traffic, the developers will widen roads bounding the project, among other road improvements. Mr. Schofel added the project, designed by RTKL Architects of Chicago, also calls for 17 single-family homes to ring the property and buffer the residential neighborhood beyond. 
There will also be 24 condominium apartments and 73 town houses. Residences are expected to range in price from $300,000 to $1 million, said Marshall B. Tycher of Roseland Property.
The four retail buildings of one or two stories will be clad in red brick and designed to reflect the township's Federal-style municipal building and high school, a mile away. Crowning the main retail structure will be that standard feature of town centers past, a clock tower.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Private REIT's Move Into Market

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Investment sales in commercial real estate have been anything but sluggish during the recent economic slowdown, and four companies -- all using similar investment models and ways of raising capital from individual investors -- have been playing leading roles in the transactions, each within its own niche.
 According to Real Capital Analytics, a New York research company that tracks transactions of $5 million or more, Wells Capital of Norcross, Ga., is the biggest buyer of office property in the nation, accounting for 4.5 percent of the market so far this year; W.P. Carey of New York has bought 6 percent of the large properties leased to single tenants, more than any other company; and the Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation of Oak Brook, Ill., is buying large strip shopping centers at twice the rate of its nearest competitor, and has made 12.2 percent of this year's acquisitions. 
 In hotels, the most active buyer is CNL Hospitality Properties of Orlando, Fla., a unit of the CNL Investment Company, according to Sean Hennessey, the director of the hotel consulting practice for PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Because of their aggressive buying, these companies are helping to drive up prices, some real estate specialists say. "It's pretty clear," said Arthur Milston, a partner and managing director of Granite Partners, a real estate investment banking company based in New York, "that these groups are having a pretty significant impact on the market." 
CNL, in partnership with KSL Recreation of La Quinta, Calif., is acquiring the 692-room Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, paying about $385 million for the recently restored property, a landmark dating to 1888. CNL, Mr. Hennessey said, has "bolstered the market during a period when many traditional equity investors were hesitant to allocate capital to the hotel business."
Although they pursue different strategies, the four companies have something significant in common. All refer to themselves as nontraded public real estate investment trusts, but many real estate specialists describe them as "private REIT's".
Unlike publicly traded REIT's, whose shares trade on exchanges like stocks and which are typically self-managed, the private REIT's have separate affiliates that charge fees for managing the REIT. Like limited partnerships, private REIT's offer little liquidity since they are not traded on any public market. Or as David Steinwedell, the chief investment officer for Wells, put it in a recent interview: "Instead of raising money on Wall Street, we raise money on Main Street." 
And raise they do. In 2000, the industry sold $583 million worth of shares, according to Keith D. Allaire, a managing director of Robert A. Stanger, a real estate investment banking firm in Shrewsbury, N.J., that tracks untraded REIT's. This year, these REIT's are expected to raise $7 billion to $8 billion, he said. Wells alone has raised $3.8 billion since 1998. (The 171 public REIT's tracked by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Funds, a trade group, have raised about $18.5 billion this year.)
Not surprisingly, given their success at amassing capital, the so-called Big Four are beginning to attract competitors. In September, Hines Interests of Houston, a privately held company that has ownership interests in 48.4 million square feet of property worth more than $13 billion, and operates another 31.3 million square feet of real estate, filed a registration statement with the S.E.C. for a new private REIT.
While the registration is pending, neither Hines officials nor Mr. Allaire, who is advising the company, would discuss the proposed REIT, citing the mandatory quiet period. But Mr. Allaire said that untraded REIT's offer an advantage to companies by giving them a third source of capital -- aside from institutional investors like pension funds and the public market. "If I can access different types of capital pools," he said, "I can have continuous access to capital. Ideally, you'd like to have all three sources of capital."
Of the big four private REIT's, Wells has drawn the most attention, not all of it welcome. Last month, the National Association of Securities Dealers announced that it had censured Wells Investment Securities, the sponsor of the Wells REIT, and Leo F. Wells, the company president and founder, for violating securities rules by lavishly entertaining financial advisers at conferences in Scottsdale, Ariz., and Amelia Island, Fla., with a "beach bash," and a dinner at a Civil War fort complete with skydivers and actors posing as Civil War heroes. Mr. Wells was fined $150,000 and suspended for a year from acting in a principal capacity at Wells Investment Securities.
Michael Dobbs, the chief marketing officer of Wells, acknowledged that a violation occurred but said: "This is not about the integrity of Leo Wells, Wells employees, our business strategy or our stewardship of our portfolio." The company is holding another conference next Wednesday at the Ritz-Carlton in Key Biscayne, Fla. NASD officials said they permitted Wells to hold the meeting, provided that other rules are followed.
Barry Goldsmith, the NASD executive vice president for enforcement, said companies were allowed to hold educational conferences, but not make them so costly that financial advisers will sell the company's securities "for the wrong reasons." He added: "We have no reason to think this is a widespread problem in the REIT area."
To critics of private REIT's, the NASD sanction against Wells demonstrates that these companies owe their success in raising money to aggressive salesmanship by financial advisers, who receive commissions ranging from 6.5 percent to 7 percent. Added to the commissions are other fees for advising and acquiring property that can result in loads of 10 to 17 percent. 
Samuel Zell, the chairman of Equity Office Properties Trust, the nation's largest public REIT, which sold the 929,000-square-foot U.S. Bancorp Center to Wells for $174 million in May, questioned, in a telephone interview, how these investments can make adequate yields when such a high portion of the share price "doesn't go into the real estate."
Managers of the private REIT's counter these arguments by saying that they appeal to investors who are skittish about the stock market and want a safe investment that gives them regular dividends. "Some people prefer the stability of a non-traded REIT," said Robert D. Parks, the chairman and chief executive of Inland. "We all know that the market sometimes moves for no reason." The private REIT's pay dividends of 6 percent to 8 percent, said Mr. Allaire of Robert A. Stanger. William P. Carey, the chairman of the company that bears his name, said his REIT's showed an average return of 12 percent a year.
By contrast, publicly traded REIT's have shown a 16.42 percent compounded return over the last three years, said Jay Hyde, a spokesman for the trade group, NAREIT.
Barry Vinocur, the editor of Realty Stock Review, a newsletter that focuses on REIT stocks, said that as private REIT's continue to raise more money, they are likely to be tempted to buy lesser-quality real estate so they can keep paying dividends. Mr. Vinocur said that strategy could lead to "a subpar return on their investment."
Mr. Miller of Wells acknowledged that his company no longer focuses largely on properties leased to single creditworthy tenants but is now buying multi-tenanted office buildings, which carry more risk. But he said the company's objectives remained the same.
"We are not dropping our standards at all at this point," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Investors Cash In on Gains; Shares Close Slightly Lower

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street edged lower yesterday as investors sought profits from Monday's session, taking a pause between economic reports while the earnings season winds down.
 After sending the markets higher on Monday on an encouraging report from the manufacturing sector, investors were sifting through some of the last third-quarter financial results and awaiting employment numbers, to come out later this week. 
 The gap between economic reports made it a good day to take money off the table, said Brian Williamson, an equity trader at the Boston Company Asset Management.
"What you're seeing here is kind of a void between economic data," Mr. Williamson said. "Stocks are up and money managers have to take profits. With two months to go in the year, they'll want to lock in whatever gains they can." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 19.63 points, or 0.2 percent, at 9,838.83.
The broader gauges also closed lower. 
The Nasdaq composite index declined 9.74 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,957.96. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 5.77 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 1,053.25.
Generally strong economic data, merger news and solid financial results helped the markets move higher over the last month. But analysts said there could be pullbacks amid a lack of earnings news.
"Our sense here is that the easy money has already been made," said Enrique Figueroa, chief investment officer at the asset management firm of Sand Hill Advisers in Palo Alto, Calif. 
Among companies reporting results yesterday, Clear Channel Communications said that its third-quarter earnings tripled, largely on gains from its sale of shares in Univision. Shares of Clear Channel dipped 30 cents, to close at $41.10.
Gillette easily beat analysts' estimates with an 18 percent increase in third-quarter earnings, in part because of strong sales of its blades and razors. Gillette shares closed up $1.65, or 5.1 percent, at $34.15.
Advancers also included Tyco International, which closed up $1.48, or 7 percent, at $22.50, after the company said its quarterly losses had narrowed significantly. 
Excluding charges, Tyco earned 34 cents a share, beating Wall Street estimates by a penny. The company plans to cut about 7,200 jobs under a restructuring plan that will consolidate more than 200 sites.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index, which closed at its highest level in nearly 22 months on Monday, pulled back as investors sought profits from some semiconductor issues. Intel ended the day down 36 cents, to $33.68.
Financial services companies also had declines. 
Prudential Financial lost 98 cents, closing at $38.05, after several former employees of its securities unit were charged in a state and federal investigation of mutual fund trades.
Prudential reported after the close of regular trading that its third-quarter profits fell 41 percent, largely because of costs associated with the merger of its retail brokerage unit with Wachovia and other one-time items. Excluding the charges, Prudential beat Wall Street expectations by a wide margin, but its shares declined 5 cents in after-hours trading.

Bond Prices Climb
(By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury securities rose yesterday as a private survey found that employers announced plans in October to cut more jobs than in September, a sign the labor market may not be as strong as some economists forecast.
By late in the day, the 10-year note gained 9/32 to a price of 99 19/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.30 percent from 4.34 percent on Monday.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: The Attraction That Is Southern China 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
A state governor in the United States could only dream of attracting a corporate advisory board to match the 21-member roster assembled by a Chinese provincial governor at a three-day annual conference here.
 Maurice R. Greenberg, the chairman and chief executive of the American International Group, spoke of the need for better corporate governance and stronger financial markets. Daniel Vasella, the chairman and chief executive of Novartis, the pharmaceutical giant that is Switzerland's largest company, discussed the importance of research, as did Daniel A. Carp, the chairman and chief executive of the Eastman Kodak Company. Dinesh C. Paliwal, the executive vice president of the ABB Group, and Byron Grote, the chief financial officer of the BP Group, held forth on the attractiveness of the local energy market. 
 The gathering underlined the extent to which Guangdong Province, which lies along the southeastern coast of China, has rebounded fully from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome that started here last winter and spread to other continents before fading out in June.
Attendance dropped by close to 90 percent at the semiannual trade fair held here in the spring, at the height of the outbreak, but rebounded fully for the next fair, which just ended. With demand surging at home and exports rising even faster, factories here are working overtime, spewing clouds of smoke that cover the city in a gray pall and have spread 80 miles down the Pearl River to Hong Kong, which had its worst smog on Monday since record-keeping began four years ago.
Executives at the conference that ended here on Tuesday expressed no worries about a possible recurrence this winter of SARS, which seems to have disappeared like a dimly recalled nightmare of face masks and televised news conferences by doctors. Pekka Ala-Pietila, the president of Nokia, said that his company's huge cellphone factory near here had not lost a day of production during the epidemic.
Instead, the main concern here was the same one political leaders in Beijing have been citing: the need to improve education and training for the work force so that China can move beyond being the world's main supplier of cheap labor and become a serious challenger to industrialized countries in sectors requiring more skills, from auto manufacturing to computer chips.
"They have to educate people, they have to invest" in training, said Hans-Jorg Bullinger, the president of Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, the big German contract research company.
Mr. Carp of Kodak agreed. "The most far-sighted and practical step the government can do is strengthen educational institutions," he said.
While improving education is a national goal, it is particularly a problem for Guangdong Province and for Guangzhou, the provincial capital, which used to be called Canton.
The Pearl River delta has become China's richest region, with incomes in big cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen almost four times the national average. Less prosperous regions with even lower wages and land prices, most notably the Yangtze River delta around Shanghai, are starting to attract manufacturers that once headed straight for Guangdong.
Guangdong is still China's biggest exporter because Deng Xiaoping's great experiment in capitalism began here in the late 1970's, while free-market changes were only really encouraged by the central government in Shanghai, beginning in 1992. But China's best universities remain in Beijing and Shanghai, while Guangzhou has yet to create the equivalent of a Stanford University, a world-class institution of higher learning far from traditional centers of academic excellence.
Carl-Henric Svanberg, the chief executive and president of Ericsson, spoke of his company's 3,500 employees in manufacturing, research and development in China, and of the economic potential of Guangdong Province, but conspicuously did not mention that Ericsson's research and development centers were in Beijing and Shanghai.
Guangdong has focused more on luring assembly lines for higher-technology businesses like consumer electronics companies and automakers, drawing top executives from the Honda Motor Company and the Sanyo Electric Company to the conference here. These industries have emerged as successors to the toy makers and furniture companies that used to be the province's economic mainstays.
Governor Huang Huahua of Guangdong Province, the leader of the conference here, said that Toyota agreed to build car engines here and then an assembly plant with an annual capacity of 300,000 cars, and predicted that Beijing would approve the plan soon. A Toyota spokesman said that the company was still in discussions and that nothing had been decided yet; Beijing officials have expressed some nervousness lately about possible overbuilding of auto factories.
The province's cities have struggled to pursue high-technology and heavy industry at the same time, producing dissonant slogans like that in nearby Huizhou, which promotes itself as "a digital and petrochemicals city."
Guangdong had been planning to turn Shenzhen, where many electronics companies have factories, into a center for research and services. But that is also the commercial strategy of Hong Kong, next door to Shenzhen, and Beijing is now trying to build up Hong Kong's economy after concluding that unemployment and deflation there contributed to the upwelling of pro-democracy sentiment that produced huge marches and rallies in July.
Governor Huang showed a new caution here on Tuesday in predicting what Shenzhen would do next. "At this stage, we still do not have a plan on the development for that area."

HEADLINE: In Scorched Hills, Tribes Feel Bereft and Forgotten 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: SAN PASQUAL INDIAN RESERVATION, Calif., Nov. 4 

 BODY:
The indigenous people who live in the hills of San Diego County hold to an old philosophy: Fire takes what it wants, floods take what is left and nothing lives long except the mountains.
 "We've been living with fire forever," said Juana Majel-Dixon, a Pauma Indian. "The rain will come soon and there will be more suffering, but we'll get through it. Indian people always do." 
 While the nation's eyes were fixed on images of endangered resort towns and wealthy suburbs, it has nearly gone by the boards that Indian territory was hit inordinately hard by the recent wildfires. 
With the last of the flames all but extinguished, the statistics of San Diego's major fires, the Paradise and the Cedar, are staggering: nearly 340,000 acres burned, 16 dead, more than 2,337 homes destroyed. While Indians are few in number, there are 18 reservations throughout the county with an estimated 6,200 people, located in what was once inaccessible scrub unsuited for farming.
The reservations are now the outer edges of the suburban sprawl and fire officials estimate that 10 percent of the total land burned was Indian country, with three reservations completely scorched and a handful of others severely damaged.
Hardest hit was the San Pasqual reservation, about 35 miles north of San Diego. Its entire 1,400 acres were burned, as were more than a third of its homes, mostly uninsured trailers and prefabricated units. Two local people died trying to escape the inferno; two others died on the Barona reservation to the south.
"Fire doesn't know city limits or reservation boundaries," said Allen E. Lawson, the San Pasqual tribal chairman. "It doesn't discriminate on the basis of skin color or wealth." 
Indeed, much of the territory has been reduced to little more than cigarette tailings, bedsprings and auto carcasses.
Acres of manzanita resemble stickmen, the water canal is parched and the leaves on the oak trees are as hard as playing cards. 
The reservation's casino, the sole engine of economic life here, escaped major damage. Just a wall and four slot machines were destroyed, and signs dot the reservation thanking firefighters for their efforts.
A few miles to the north, the Rincon reservation was 75 percent burned, with more than 20 homes lost. On the Barona reservation, home of one of the state's most successful casinos, two people died and 47 homes were lost, but the casino was spared.
In all, 14 reservations were affected. 
Rumors run rampant here. While fire officials believe that a lost hunter started the Cedar fire to the south, there is no explanation for the Paradise fire, which started behind the Rincon Casino and destroyed more than 56,000 acres and 117 homes.
A report is circulating among Indians that a white may have started the blaze, someone who harbored bad feelings against Indians after the recent election that led to the recall of Gov. Gray Davis. 
During the campaign, Indian tribes donated millions of dollars to Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante and a lesser amount to Governor Davis. Meanwhile, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who went on to be elected governor, criticized Indians as the type of special interests that had hamstrung state government.
"No one wants to say this was set to take out Indian country," said Michele Nelson, a council member of the Rincon Indian Nation. "But you've got to wonder with all the bad feelings around here about the recall. We got calls during the fire saying, 'That's what you Indians deserve.' "
President Bush surveyed the devastation by helicopter on Tuesday with Governor Davis and Mr. Schwarzenegger, who is scheduled to become governor on Nov. 17. They met with local officials, including some Indian leaders, allaying fears among Indians that their needs would be ignored.
"We feel like we were on our own," said Ms. Nelson of the Rincon Indian Nation. "There are some hard feelings that linger around here." 
While Governor Davis and Mr. Schwarzenegger have toured some of the devastation across the state, neither has set foot on Indian lands since the fires broke out. 
Mr. Lawson, the San Pasqual chairman, was among the Indian leaders invited to speak with the president on Tuesday. He said he planned to present a wish list to Mr. Bush and explain that most people from his reservation who were burned out were not insured and lived on trust land.
Frances Jones is one such person. At 94, she is the oldest member of the San Pasqual tribe. When she saw the fires racing up the hill toward her trailer, she grabbed her keys, purse and a sweater and drove away. In 15 minutes her home was gone.
"I never thought there would be a fire like this in all my life," Mrs. Jones said. "Then again, I never thought I'd live this long."
Dressed in borrowed clothes, Mrs. Jones said she felt fortunate. She is alive and is staying nearby with a friend. "My daughter wants me to come to Los Angeles with her," she said. "But that's the last place I'd ever want to live." 
The inevitable complaining about how much could have been done or done differently has begun. To a person, private citizens thank the firefighters for their efforts, but have accused Governor Davis of being too slow in responding to the fires. They also complain about nearby military equipment and personnel sitting idle, and the decision to ground a sheriff's pilot because of darkness just minutes before he was to dump water on the fledgling Cedar fire.
Indian leaders also contend that too little attention is being paid to the situation of their people.
"All the attention is being paid to Scripps Ranch and those million-dollar homes," said Bobby Barrett, vice president of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians. Whether they lost a mansion or a trailer, he said, people are equal when they are homeless. 
Audrey Toler, 76, a Pasqual Indian who stood shoeless in a burning field while the reservation burned around her, said it was better to concentrate on the positive.
"I'm happy to be alive," she said. "People should think about that."
Steven Lovett, a member of the Pasqual tribe, remains in a San Diego hospital, struggling with an infection and the likely loss of his ears. Mr. Lovett, a Navy corpsman who returned from Iraq in August, was severely burned after he managed to get a young woman safely to a hilltop before he was enveloped in flames. The woman's sister died in her car just down the road.
"He's awake and talking," said Mr. Lovett's aunt, Marilyn Lycett. "He says he feels bad because he couldn't save the other girl. He is a good, young man."

 BODY:
 Southeast Asia's latest trade gauges offer a mixed picture on demand for exports from the United States. 
A closely watched barometer of manufacturing activity in Singapore rose in October to its highest level in more three years, as faster demand from the United States brightened Singapore's economic prospects. The jump in the purchasing managers' index, compiled by the Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management in Singapore, was the biggest in 18 months. A similar trend is appearing in the Philippines, where the government reported that exports in September rose 2.3 percent, to $3.26 billion, led by a rise in electronics shipments. But exports in Malaysia and Indonesia shrank in September. Wayne Arnold (NYT)

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
A Teenager With a Voice Has a Vision for the Future

BYLINE:  By LILY KOPPEL

 BODY:
When Imani Peterson's grandmother isn't feeling well, Imani gives her something no one else can.
 "I sing to her," says Imani, 13. 
 She sings gospel and jazz, opera, show tunes and punk rock. It is "something I like to make people happy with," she says. 
For Imani, singing is not just a way to brighten her home; it is also a talent that has led her to places that are a far leap from her family's economic reality.
Proud of her granddaughter, Maizie Peterson cherishes a photograph of Imani singing a solo at Carnegie Hall.
Singing and dancing have lifted Imani's self-confidence and have helped her visualize a future different from the one she might have had, had she never hit a high note or memorized West African footwork.
But her exposure to the arts has never been guaranteed.
Without the help of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Imani would not have access to programs like the Children's Aid Society Chorus, which she has been singing with for two years. The society is one of seven charities supported by the fund.
"Imani has raw talent," says Elizabeth Parker, the chorus director. "She just needs to be shaped. She has an incredible gift, a voice that keeps getting bigger and bigger."
But the obstacles have been nearly as big.
One of those is money. Imani lives in a close-knit extended family in Brooklyn. Mrs. Peterson, 81, a retired nurse who receives $834 a month from Social Security, runs the household.
Imani's mother, Elaine Peterson, 42, was laid off in June from her job as a clerical assistant for the New York City Administration for Children's Services. She receives $400 in unemployment benefits before taxes and says she wants to go back to school to earn a degree in nursing.
When Imani was 3 months old, she moved from her mother's care in Brooklyn to her grandparents' house in Kissimmee, Fla.
Imani says her mother didn't have enough money to take care of her.
"It was fun and green," she recalls of the house in Florida, where her mother visited when she could.
Her grandmother recognized her talent at an early age and felt that the educational system in Florida could not do enough to nurture her.
So when Imani was 3, they moved to New York and reunited with her mother. They moved into a large turn-of-the-century house in Prospect Lefferts Gardens.
The family still lives in the house along with Imani's aunt and uncle and her 15-month-old cousin. The aunt and uncle have jobs and pay the mortgage; Imani's grandmother buys the food. 
Two years ago, a friend Imani knew through dancing told her and her grandmother about the Children's Aid chorus. Imani applied and got in.
For the last two years, Mrs. Peterson has paid the $35 registration fee for the chorus, but she hasn't been able to afford the basic program cost, which was $600 in 2002 and is $700 this year now that Imani sings in two separate choruses.
Through the Children's Aid Society, the Neediest Cases Fund covered the tuition and provided $200 so that Mrs. Peterson could buy clothes for Imani.
At the referral of Mrs. Parker, the chorus director, Imani has been granted scholarships to attend Interlochen Arts Camp in Michigan for the last two summers.
And she was encouraged to audition for the Brooklyn Performing Arts High School, where she is in the ninth grade.
Although Imani's mother is her legal guardian, her grandmother is her major support. She pays for Imani's clothes and school-related expenses and stays current on her academic and musical progress.
She is a member of the Chorus Advisory Board of Children's Aid, attends all of Imani's recitals and served as a chaperone on a chorus trip last year to Lancaster, Pa.
Imani says she wants to get the best education she can and is not concerned about whether or not she becomes a professional singer.
She plans to attend Harvard. And she thinks she might like to study pediatrics, which she says is like her singing, because "you are still taking care of humans and curing them."

HEADLINE: THE 2003 ELECTION: THE STATEHOUSE; 
Democrats Seize Senate And Widen Assembly Gap

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Democrats tightened their grip on New Jersey government in Tuesday's elections, seizing undisputed control of the State Senate, toppling the state's top Republican elected official, and padding their majority in the General Assembly.
 The sweeping victories, fueled by record-setting campaign spending, give Democrats control of the governor's office and both houses of the Legislature. For the first time in half a century, the party in power picked up seats during midterm legislative elections. 
 The night's results also offered personal vindication for Gov. James E. McGreevey. Republicans had tried to make the races a referendum on the governor, whose approval ratings have dropped below 40 percent in some recent polls, but Democrats used their financial advantage to focus the races on a host of local issues in Bergen, Gloucester and Monmouth Counties. 
In the Fourth District in South Jersey, Democratic power brokers shattered the spending record by plowing more than $3 million into the campaign of Fred Madden, a political novice and a former superintendent of the state police, , who claimed victory late Tuesday night. The sheer magnitude of the spending -- for a part-time job that pays $49,000 a year -- shocked some political observers and prompted complaints from Philadelphia-area television viewers who became weary of Mr. Madden's ads.
Although Mr. Madden's Republican opponent, George F. Geist, said the race was so close he might request a recall, Democrats were believed to have gained at least one other seat in the State Senate, which had been split 20-20. 
The majority the Democrats held in the Assembly was 41 to 38 (with one Green Party member) when the evening began, and they appeared headed to capturing at least 47 seats.
Mr. McGreevey, who kept a low profile during most of the campaign, viewed the results as an endorsement of his leadership during difficult economic times, his aides said.
"Governor McGreevey is gratified that voters understand and respect the tough decisions he's made," said Kathy Ellis, his communications director.
Republicans were also hampered by the ethics questions that overshadowed the re-election bid of Senator John O. Bennett, the party's highest-ranking elected official in the state. A series of newspaper stories raised questions about billing irregularities in Mr. Bennett's law practice, which are being investigated by the F.B.I., and the issue allowed Ellen Karcher, the Democratic candidate, to win the 12th District in Monmouth County.
When the evening began, Republicans hoped they could erase the Democrats majority in the Assembly and pick up a seat in the Senate. Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., State Republican chairman, said Mr. McGreevey was to blame for higher property taxes and reductions in school aid, and he urged voters to send a message to the governor by throwing his colleagues out of power in the Legislature.
But Democrats, who held a three-to-one spending advantage across the state, reminded votersthat Mr. McGreevey inherited a budget mess created during eight years of Republican rule in Trenton.
Candidates in the 120 races raised nearly $35 million in campaign donations as of the Oct. 23 deadline, according to state records, and election officials said spending was all but certain to top the record $41.7 billion spent on the legislative contests two years ago.
During the final week of the campaign, one of the most heated contests was in Bergen County, where Senator Joseph Coniglio, a Democrat, was being challenged by Rose Marie Heck, a Republican assemblywoman.
One Democratic television advertisement featured an actor impersonating Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor-elect of California, chastising her vote for an expensive rail project in Camden County, by asking, "Rose, what the Heck were you thinking?" Democrats also criticized Ms. Heck for failing to publicly repudiate one of the Republican Assembly candidates in the district, who was recently the subject of a domestic violence complaint.
As Election Day neared, Republicans mounted an aggressive last-minute charge for the seat, running advertisements warning that Mr. Coniglio would be Mr. McGreevey's 21st vote in the Senate.In the end, Mr. Coniglio won easily. 
Political analysts say that the negative tone of much of the campaigning ultimately made many voters skip the election altogether. On Monday, state election officials predicted that turnout could be as low as 30 percent, and most party officials and political analysts said on Tuesday that there appeared to be little enthusiasm in the races.

 CORRECTION:
An article in some copies on Wednesday about the results of legislative races in New Jersey misstated the total spent on legislative campaigns in 2001, a record that was likely to be exceeded this year. It was $41.7 million, not billion.

HEADLINE: 2-Party Elections a Foreign Concept in Rural Japan 

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: NAKANOJO, Japan 

 BODY:
"Manifesto" is the buzzword of Japan's political season. Each party must have one. Newspaper headlines squeeze it in.
 Policies and ideas, the lofty sounding foreign word implies, will now determine the outcome of elections, instead of pork-barrel politics. 
 But in this corner of rural Japan, where public works and the heavily protected konnyaku yam are the main motors of the economy, the manifesto is as alien a concept as its promise of political transformation. 
"The word manifesto has already been used around here for a long time," said Toru Ikehara, 70, the president of a construction company bearing his name and that of a construction association. He took a form out of a drawer. "Here," he said, "this is the manifesto for construction scrap disposal. You pull down a house, state in detail what waste went where, so as to take responsibility for the disposal."
As Japan prepares to hold a general election on Nov. 9, there is breathless talk here of moving toward an American-style two-party system. The main opposition Democratic Party, strengthened by its recent merger with another party, is expected to continue making gains in the cities, where voters are younger and work in the private sector.
But the Liberal Democratic Party of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, which has governed almost uninterrupted since 1955, still dominates rural Japan. Its grip on the area around Nakanojo, as well as on other aging rural areas dependent on the government, suggests that there may not be a change in government this time around, and perhaps not for a few more years.
Postwar Japan has been essentially a one-party state, in part because the Liberal Democratic Party, which is actually conservative, has always enjoyed rock-solid rural support. 
To ensure that, the party funneled money from the cities into the countryside, which it pampered with lavish public works projects and agricultural subsidies. Moreover, electoral laws gave more weight to rural votes. The cities remained uninterested in politics as long as Japan's economy kept growing.
For rural areas like Nakanojo, the spigot from Tokyo has tightened in recent years, because of Japan's long economic slump and Mr. Koizumi's drive to slash public spending. 
But backing the opposition, which promises even steeper cuts, would be committing suicide. So places like Nakanojo continue to back the Liberal Democratic Party, if only because there is no alternative.
Here in this town in Fifth Election District of Gumma Province, some 75 miles north of Tokyo, the main opposition is not even bothering to field a candidate for the lower house of Parliament. The Liberal Democratic Party incumbent, Yuko Obuchi, 29, won the seat after its previous occupant -- Keizo Obuchi, a former prime minister who also happened to be her father -- died in 2000.
Ms. Obuchi's campaign manager, Kentaro Iwai, felt comfortable enough to say that her re-election on Nov.9 was assured, though there are candidates from minor parties.
"The point is how many votes she can get," said Mr. Iwai, 61, who is also vice chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's provincial chapter.
That money is no longer flowing down here as it used to is easily visible in Nakanojo, a town of 18,000 inhabitants. There are few young people to be seen; most have left for the cities. 
The main street is referred to as Shuttered Street because of the number of closed shops. On weekdays the train pulls up at the small station packed almost exclusively with elderly tourists on their way to nearby hot springs.
Public works spending, which provides jobs and money to local construction companies, has been slashed. In five years the spending for the county that includes Nakanojo has been cut by half, from $96 million in 1998 to $47 million in 2002.
Mr. Ikehara said that because of the fall in public works spending, construction companies around here had gone bankrupt or had imposed pay cuts. 
Nevertheless, public works still account for half of his company's projects. He could not imagine backing the Democratic Party, led by Naoto Kan, which has pledged in its manifesto to reduce public works by 30 percent over three years.
"The state collects taxes and distributes it," he said. "If it stops coming here, what are the people around here to do? There still aren't political parties that could replace the ruling L.D.P."
Gumma Province's other main industry is growing the konnyaku, or devil's tongue, yam, accounting for more than 80 percent of the national market. The industry survives because of the 990 percent tariff imposed on imports of the vegetable.
The Liberal Democratic Party also remains entrenched in rural areas because of the strength of the support groups like town associations and the construction industry, which line up behind one candidate.
So when Ms. Obuchi's father died suddenly in 2000, his supporters quickly rallied around his then 26-year-old daughter. Her grandfather was also a legislator from the area. Such is the strength of the system that 36 percent of Liberal Democratic Party legislators are second- or third-generation members of Parliament.
The head of an agricultural association in Shibukawa, Katsuo Kamei, 54, said he has personally backed the Obuchis since he was a child.
"Our family has been supporting them since the late prime minister's father became a politician," he said. "It is hereditary support."
Isamu Hagiwara, vice president of the Social Democratic Party's provincial chapter, said his party had fielded a candidate, if only to provide an alternative voice.
"We don't think we can win, yet we decided to have our own candidate," he said, adding, "Unfortunately, democracy hasn't grown in Japan."
Even in this one-party redoubt, though, there is a growing sense that the country is moving inevitably toward a two-party system.
"There are many young people in urban areas, and they feel like changing political parties," said Mr. Iwai, Ms. Obuchi's campaign manager. "They think they can make a real comparison for the first time by a change in power. They want to try it, and if it doesn't work they can take it back."
Mr. Kamei of the agricultural association said that a two-party system would be good for Japan by making politicians more accountable, but that personally he feared such a change.
"We've never experienced the two-party system," he said. "Apart from whether it is good or bad, I feel anxious."

HEADLINE: Group Says Guinea Sold Arms Used on U.S. Embassy in Liberia 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
The cost of befriending the enemy of one's enemy has once again become painfully clear for the United States government: Washington's staunch ally in West Africa, Guinea, supplied mortars to Liberian rebels, who used the gift to shell an American-owned compound in Liberia where thousands had taken refuge during fighting earlier this year, a report to be released Wednesday by Human Rights Watch says. 
 The arms shipment to Liberian rebels violated a United Nations arms embargo on Liberia, where fighting between the government of Charles G. Taylor, then the president, and two rebel factions pummeled the capital, Monrovia, from June to August. 
 The warring parties signed a peace agreement in August, shortly after Mr. Taylor left for exile in Nigeria, and a transitional government, composed of their representatives, took over in October. All sides in the conflict have flouted the embargo, generally falsifying the contents of containers stuffed with weapons. Some Guinean weapons, for example, were in containers labeled "detergent," according to a report prepared by a United Nations panel appointed to monitor the embargo. 
The panel's report, presented to Security Council members but not yet made public, recommends that the penalties against the trade of arms, diamonds and timber remain in place. The Security Council, of which Guinea is currently a member, is to review that issue this week. 
The report by Human Rights Watch, which is based in New York, called on the Security Council to hold Guinea accountable for breaching the embargo during the last attacks on Monrovia. "The government of Guinea, which facilitated the illicit supply of mortar rounds, bears an important measure of responsibility for the atrocities," the report said. 
The report took note of what people in Monrovia commonly refer to as "World War III," the third and most intense attack on the capital in late July. Human Rights Watch found that the mortar rounds fired on central Monrovia by the rebel Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy were Iranian munitions procured by the Guinean Ministry of Defense this year and sent to the rebels. 
The report said that some of the mortars, traced to Guinea, a recipient of American military aid, landed in a compound owned by the United States Embassy, where about 20,000 people displaced by the fighting had sought refuge. On July 21, during an intense bout of shelling, two mortar rounds fell on the compound, killing 20 and wounding more than 50. 
Embassy officials said the weapons fired on the compound had not been provided to Guinea by Washington. Guinea denied supporting the Liberian rebels. 
Human Rights Watch called for a suspension of American military aid to Guinea.

SMYTHE, SHEILA MARY

 BODY:
 SMYTHE--Sheila Mary. The Manhattanville College community mourns the loss of Sheila Mary Smythe, one of its most dedicated and beloved alumni and volunteer leaders, who died on November 4, 2003. Few individuals have so modestly and selflessly served Manhattanville, helping to lead the college through two decades of growth and change while serving as mentor and guide to countless former students of all ages and faiths. Few individuals have so consistently lived the college's mission, to educate ethically and socially responsible leaders for the global community. Miss Smythe, a graduate of Manhattanville College, served on the college's board of trustees for more then 20 years, beginning in 1981. Twice, she oversaw the college's search for a new president, including in 1994, when president Richard A. Berman, who serves today, was chosen. She twice served as chair of the board, most recently serving as vice-chair, member of the executive committee and academic affairs committees and chair of the trustee affairs committee. In 1981, she received the college's Distinguished Alumni Award and in 1974, the college presented her with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in recognition of her professional and personal achievements. In 1997, Manhattanville established the Sheila Mary Smythe Award, given periodically to an esteemed alumnus who has successfully worked to improve society. Over her impressive career Miss Smythe was widely respected for her vision and commitment to education and to health care, and for the strong friendships she made throughout her years of business and community leadership. 
After serving as president and CEO of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, she became the chief health policy advisor to the Comptroller General of the United States (U.S. General Accounting Office). In 1990, she joined New York Medical College as professor of health policy and economics, and the first dean of the Graduate School of Health Sciences. Since 1995, she also served as executive vice president of the college and president of its Partnership for a Healthy Population. In addition to serving Manhattanville College, Miss Smythe served on the boards of many business and community organizations, including the March of Dimes, Catholic Charities USA and Mutual of America Life Insurance Company. Miss Smythe earned Bachelor of Arts degrees from Manhattanville College and Creighton University, and a Master of Science degree from the Graduate School of Public Health and Administrative Medicine at Columbia University, where she also undertook doctoral studies. Miss Smythe is survived by her niece, Sheila P. Gonley, who graduated from Manhattanville College in 1992 and now lives in England. Manhattanville College has established a Shelia Mary Smythe Memorial Fund. Contributions may be sent in Miss Smythe's name to: Manhattanville College, 2900 Purchase Street, Purchase, New York 10504.
 SMYTHE -- Sheila. Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA) mourns the passing of Sheila Smythe, executive vice president of New York Medical College, dean of its School of Public Health, and former president and chief operating officer of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. During her long, distinguished career, Ms. Smythe was committed to improving the delivery of health care, and was an expert in public health and health care management, finance, policy, and education. We extend our deepest condolences to her friends and loved ones. Stanley Brezenoff, Chairman Kenneth E. Raske, President GNYHA

HEADLINE: As Tycoons Slip Overseas, Putin Appears To Lay Siege 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
A lawyer for the embattled Russian oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky said Tuesday that a court in Moscow would decide Nov. 11 whether to release him on bail. Pressure on his company and others continued, with some top executives leaving the country and President Vladimir V. Putin publicly criticizing one businessman.
 In an interview with Italian journalists on the eve of a visit to Italy, Mr. Putin expressed blunt displeasure about what he called tax evasion that had been practiced by an unidentified executive connected with Mr. Khodorkovsky's company, Yukos Oil. 
 "Now, one person in the case came and said, 'Well, I didn't pay before, let me pay now, and we'll forget this whole thing,' " Mr. Putin said. "It doesn't work this way. Everyone must understand once and for all -- the law must be followed always, not just when you're grabbed in that place," he said, referring sardonically to the crotch. 
The scandal over Yukos, which Mr. Khodorkovsky founded, has not only left its founder in jail, but has also put three Americans at the helm of the company: Simon G. Kukes, a Russian-born American who was confirmed Tuesday as chief executive, replacing Mr. Khodorkovsky; Steven M. Theede, the new chief operating officer; and Bruce K. Misamore, the chief financial officer. 
As many as five of Russia's dozen or so tycoons -- including Vladimir O. Potanin, Oleg V. Deripaska and Mikhail M. Fridman -- are out of the country in what aides say are coincidental, and temporary, absences.
While a vast majority of Russians barely noticed the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky on Oct. 25 on tax-evasion and fraud charges, the political scandal has sent chills through Moscow's elite. But instead of protesting, business executives remained silent.
Big business "wants there to be an opposition, but they don't want to take part in it themselves," said Boris Y. Nemtsov, leader of a pro-business party, Union of Right Forces, in the lower house of Parliament. "They're afraid they will be put in jail."
Sergei Perevedentsev, the spokesman for big companies' main lobbying group, R.S.P.P., said: "The main thing is not to shout loudly, but to get an effective result. Let's wait. Do you see a result now? I don't see one. It's too early."
Others in Moscow argued that the standoff was neither a crisis nor a broader trend. Boris G. Fyodorov, a former finance minister, saw it as nothing more than having zealous Russian authorities wrangle with some not-so-innocent tycoons. 
"To call it the end of democracy -- this is rubbish," he said. "Oligarchs used the law and the corrupt judges to their benefit for many years. They are now getting some of it back in their faces."
The charges against Mr. Khodorkovsky arise from the mid 1990's, when laws were badly written and poorly enforced. The state was selling valuable companies cheaply, and executives acquired vast interests. More recently, those large companies have expanded their reach, in part through the sort of transparent transactions Mr. Khodorkovsky says he favors, and in part by staging hostile takeovers.
Executives are therefore nervous that the investigation of Yukos Oil will spread, despite Mr. Putin's assurances to the contrary.
Other major stakeholders in Mr. Khodorkovsky's empire have apparently abandoned ship. Leonid Nevzlin, a close colleague of the tycoon, is in Tel Aviv, seeking Israeli citizenship. Mikhail Broudno and Vladimir Doubov, two other senior stakeholders, are in London.
The member of Parliament who began the original inquiry into Yukos said Tuesday that he had also asked the prosecutor general to look into the finances of Sibneft, another oil company that is in the final stages of a merger with Yukos. 
Government officials, publicly critical of Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest immediately after it happened, have since stopped talking. 
The resignation by Mr. Putin's chief of staff, Aleksandr S. Voloshin, a supporter of business from the Yeltsin era, exposed rifts in the Kremlin. One official who attended a farewell party for Mr. Voloshin last week lamented a failure by some officials to recognize that the case was about more than Mr. Khodorkovsky.
"It's about all that we have worked for, all that we were trying to do," the official said. "The law was not supposed to be this way or that way. It was supposed to be straight.
"It's about Russia and what kind of government we are going to have."

HEADLINE: Autumn of the Oligarchs? 

BYLINE:  By Andrew Meier; Andrew Meier, former Moscow correspondent for Time magazine, is author of "Black Earth: A Journey Through Russia After the Fall."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The two fateful questions of Russian history are, "What is to be done?" and "Who is to blame?" Now, almost four years into the presidency of Vladimir Putin, who came into office asserting that Russia needs a "dictatorship of law," Russians are asking a new question: "What is to be done with those who are to blame?"
 Black humor has long been part of the Russian character, of course. But events of recent weeks have caused this question to be considered with a new seriousness. With the arrest last month of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former chief executive of Russia's largest oil company and Russia's richest man, Mr. Putin has at last given his own answer. 
 The arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky is not about money -- though the state would enjoy controlling the oil company, Yukos. Instead, with parliamentary elections on Dec. 7 and the presidential election next March, this is a battle for the right to set Russia's course. 
Mr. Putin is expected to carry the Duma and to win re-election. But in Moscow, unlike in Washington, the fight for the spoils starts before an election, not after. The siloviki -- the men who, like their boss, ascended to the Kremlin from the security services -- have won this round. They have taken Mr. Khodorkovsky captive. In their eagerness to please their leader, however, they have undermined Mr. Putin.
In the days since the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky, Mr. Putin has watched the stock market tumble, his chief of staff quit and his loyal prime minister break ranks. For the first time since he was appointed acting president by Boris Yeltsin, Mr. Putin has heard his compatriots, whether critics or champions, debate his chances for survival.
None of this needed to happen. The stock market was among the world's hottest, the central bank's reserves were up and Moscow brokers basked in a sense of tranquillity that almost rivaled Geneva's. The current offensive has put the lie to the notion, popular in Washington and Moscow, that Mr. Putin's rule, whatever its faults, guarantees political stability.
Only the siloviki, in their heavy-handed prosecution, could have turned Mr. Khodorkovsky into a prisoner of conscience. Once the bad boy of Russian business, in recent years he had morphed into its poster boy. The birth of Yukos, after all, was a rather untidy affair. In 1995 Mr. Yeltsin handed over to the oligarchs Russia's most valuable assets -- the state monopolies in oil, metals and other sectors -- in exchange for bankrolling his re-election. In an auction run by his own bank, Mr. Khodorkovsky paid only $309 million for the controlling stake in Yukos. Earlier this year, after Yukos merged with Sibneft, it boasted a market value of $45 billion and was the world's seventh-largest oil company.
Mr. Khodorkovsky, who is the son of factory workers and grew up in a communal apartment, had come a long way. He had weathered the crash of 1998, when Russia overnight devalued the ruble and defaulted on its debt. He had survived the scandals a year later, when American investigators alleged that as much as $10 billion had been laundered from Russia -- in particular, from his bank, Menatep -- through the Bank of New York. He had hired a corps of publicists and lawyers, lobbyists and accountants. He had shed his denim suits, clunky Soviet-style glasses and even his reclusive nature to become Russia's brightest star on the global finance circuit. He learned to speak with ardor of corporate governance, transparency and shareholder rights.
Mr. Khodorkovsky also had an insurance plan: a krysha -- a term from the Soviet era that literally means "roof" and gives one protection, in his case from the government. Mr. Khodorkovsky's mistake, however, was that he dared to imagine he could build a stronger krysha than anyone in Russia -- a Western krysha.
His quest led him from Moscow to Houston and New York and, eventually, to the White House. In 2001, Yukos set up a foundation. (Mr. Khodorkovsky called it the Open Russia Foundation, an echo of George Soros's Open Society Institute.) For the board Mr. Khodorkovsky enlisted Henry Kissinger, Lord Rothschild and a former United States ambassador to the Soviet Union.
Then, last summer, Mr. Khodorkovsky courted Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco, hoping to sell a large chunk of Yukos. The deal, for as much as $20 billion, would have ensured the company's future. It would have also made Russia one of the West's primary sources of non-Arab oil.
Washington took the bait. In September, George H. W. Bush came to Moscow to give a speech at a dinner held by the Carlyle Group, one of the world's richest private equity funds. Rumors still swirl as to the real reason behind the dinner, but this much is known: Mr. Khodorkovsky, who now sits in Moscow's Matrosskaya Tishina prison, also sits on a Carlyle advisory board with the secretary of state under Mr. Bush, James A. Baker III.
At the same time, Mr. Khodorkovsky went on a charitable spree in Washington. Some recipients now prefer anonymity, but a partial list of his beneficiaries ranges from foundations to think tanks to the Library of Congress. In 2002, the National Book Festival, beloved project of Laura Bush, received a $100,000 donation from the foundation. Along the way Mr. Khodorkovsky met Condoleezza Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney and even had his photograph taken with the president and first lady.
For the men in the Kremlin who came of age coveting East German suits and Bulgarian holidays, this was too much to bear. It was time, the siloviki calculated, to act. Although the siloviki are usually portrayed as men of the K.G.B., in truth they represent a greater range of the old order. They come from the armed forces -- the generals responsible for the blood bath in Chechnya -- from law enforcement, from the tax police. Under Mr. Yeltsin, the oligarchs and organized crime "authorities" had privatized entire units of these state servants. Under Mr. Putin, with loyalty and duty the new coins of the realm, for the siloviki, no matter the uniform, there is one ultimate krysha: the Kremlin.
Mr. Khodorkovsky's current residence is seen by many as proof that the siloviki are in control. Nothing could be further from the truth. Just as Mr. Yeltsin's reliance on the oligarchs to bankroll his re-election in 1996 laid bare the bankruptcy of the state and the impotency of the president, so Mr. Putin's turn to the siloviki reveals his weakness.
The Khodorkovsky case is only the latest round of the state campaign against the oligarchs. There may well be more, as oligarchs like Vladimir Potanin, owner of the Norilsk Nickel metals conglomerate, know well. But the assault has reached a precipice.
Mr. Putin is above all a believer in the state over the individual. He may well see the Khodorkovsky case not as another arbitrary abuse of the law, but a leveling of the playing field. He may genuinely wish to rid Russia of its oligarchy.
But the current offensive may come back to haunt him. In 1996, at the economic conclave in the Swiss resort of Davos, the oligarchs called a truce. In the face of a Communist revanche, they united around Mr. Yeltsin to ensure his second term. Now the surviving oligarchs, numbed and fearful, are already talking of another meeting -- not to field a candidate for next spring's presidential election, but to search for Vladimir Putin's heir.

HEADLINE: ON EDUCATION; 
A Test for Schwarzenegger: Add Muscle to Bare Bones

BYLINE:  By Michael Winerip; E-mail: edmike@nytimes.com.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
IT made a wonderfully pithy sound bite for the recall election. "I guarantee I will not raise your taxes," Arnold Schwarzenegger said. "And I guarantee I will not cut education."
 Given a record state deficit this past year, with more of the same forecast, educators here are asking, Is this really possible? 
 "It will be a miracle if we don't have a new round of budget cuts," said Sylvia Rousseau, a Los Angeles school superintendent in charge of District I, which includes 54,000 of the city's poorest children. "The scary part is waiting to see what's really going to happen."
For two years Dr. Rousseau's job has been to turn around schools like Locke High in Watts, and while there are signs this is beginning, it will be a long, hard slog that will not be over anytime soon. After Proposition 13 was passed in 1978, capping taxes, California's spending on public education plummeted and never recovered. A new study by the Public Policy Institute of California says that even with relatively high teacher salaries, California spends "9 percent less per student than schools in the rest of the U.S."
How bad did things get? In 2000, the American Civil Liberties Union sued over conditions at dozens of the state's most neglected schools (Williams v. California) and began taking testimony from poor children. Alfredo Vargas testified that as a Locke ninth grader last year, he had no algebra book two months into the term, a different math substitute practically every week and a folding chair, but no desk. "If I would've had a book in class for the first couple of months of school," he said. "I think I might have learned more algebra." 
"We don't have homework in English," he said, "and I think part of the reason is because we don't have books to take home."
Sandy Gonzales testified that her class had to read the novel "Always Running," but there were no books, so the English teacher copied a chapter a week for students to take home. Sandy, a tenth grader when she testified in May, explained that she wanted to go to college and had passed Algebra I but could not take Algebra II because classes were filled, with nearly 40 to a room.
In his testimony two years ago, Zeus Cubias, a Locke math teacher, described a school that had not been fully staffed for years, that relied on poorly trained substitutes and that assigned him an upper-level class after the school year had begun, with no curriculum or materials. "I spent much of my time during the first few weeks of school searching through closets and different parts of the school to find books," he testified.
To remake Locke, the first thing Dr. Rousseau did was hire a new principal, Gail Garrett, who had taught algebra there for 18 years before leaving to become an administrator. This one act provided a major morale boost, winning over even skeptics like Mr. Cubias. 
"Gail's there at 5:30 a.m.," Mr. Cubias said. "Many nights her car's still there at 11. I live in the neighborhood and when I go by Saturday, Gail's car's there."
Dr. Garrett's first priority was hiring teachers: "We worked every job fair. We got special approval from the district to sign teachers to contracts as early as April." 
Locke didn't have great working conditions, but in a bad economy it was guaranteeing jobs months ahead of other schools. Dr. Rousseau set up a program with U.C.L.A. to attract new graduates, first as interns, then as certified teachers. Nearly 50 new teachers were hired, and for the first time in memory, Locke had a full staff of 120 -- by early July.
Dr. Garrett reorganized the school. Dropouts are a big problem, with a freshman class of 1,200 dwindling to 250 by senior year. The largest number of students are lost between ninth and tenth grades, so a ninth-grade school within Locke was created, with four teams of teachers, each responsible for 300 ninth graders, giving adults and children a better chance to know one another. The rest of the school was broken into smaller academies, with focuses like performing arts and science.
The principal stretched the staff, asking her cafeteria manager, Angel Fisher, to sponsor the cheerleaders, and her custodian, Lonnie Graham, to be an adviser to students.
"It was nice to be thought of," Ms. Fisher said. "I never had this opportunity in no school before."
The school added the AVID program, intended to encourage middle-level students to attend college. Students learn study skills, get tutoring and make field trips to colleges.
This fall, for the basic algebra course required by the state, there were two new sets of textbooks, one for school and one for home, along with workbooks and a CD with drills.
Hope can be catching. Chad Soleo, an English teacher, and several colleagues who were sick of sending novels home a chapter at a time raised $11,000 on their own to buy 17 sets of novels for tenth graders.
Dr. Rousseau believes that these changes have contributed to recent improvements in test scores, but she also knows how fragile those gains are, how far behind her 54 District I schools remain and how thinly stretched Locke is.
While there are now plenty of books for state-mandated algebra, two months into the year there are no books for the A.P. statistics course. Dr. Garrett's mantra, which she repeats daily over the loudspeaker, is "Welcome to Locke High School, home of the successful Saints, where each and every one of our students is expected to go to college." Yet, there is only enough staff to offer the AVID program to 200 of 3,000 students.
Thinly stretched? Over half the teachers have less than two years' experience, and Dr. Garrett does not have enough senior staff members to observe and mentor them. Last year, while the state was auditing Locke, the school had five assistant principals; this year it has three. Worst of all, Dr. Garrett says, is class size -- 37 in most cases. She has mobilized the cafeteria manager and head custodian and still has far too few adults.
And so even if the governor-elect lives up to the sound bite and manages to maintain the status quo, the people of Locke still might wonder, where does that leave them?

HEADLINE: Issue for Bush: How to Speak Of Casualties? 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
When the Chinook helicopter was shot down on Sunday in Iraq, killing 15 Americans, President Bush let his defense secretary do the talking and stayed out of sight at his ranch. The president has not attended the funeral of any American soldiers killed in action, White House officials say. And with violence in Baghdad dominating the headlines this week, he has used his public appearances to focus on the health of the economy and the wildfires in California.
 But after some of the deadliest attacks yet on American forces, the White House is struggling with the political consequences for a president who has said little publicly about the mounting casualties of the occupation. 
 The quandary for Mr. Bush, administration officials say, is in finding a balance: expressing sympathy for fallen soldiers without drawing more attention to the casualties by commenting daily on every new death.
White House officials say their strategy, for now, is to avoid having the president mention some deaths but not others, and so avoid inequity. (Mr. Bush does send a personal letter to the family of every soldier killed in action and has met privately with relatives at military bases.) 
"He never wants to elevate or diminishone sacrifice made over another," said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director.
Or, as another White House official put it: "If you're the brother or mother of a soldier who was killed on Saturday, and nothing was said, and then the president says something on Sunday? Unless the president starts saying it for all of them, he can't do it."
Republicans also acknowledge that White House officials, mindful of history, do not want Mr. Bush to become hostage to daily body counts, much as President Lyndon B. Johnson was during the Vietnam War. Concern about being consumed by the headlines, administration officials say, is another reason the president did not specifically address the downed Chinook on Sunday.
"If a helicopter were hit an hour later, after he came out and spoke, should he come out again?" Mr. Bartlett said. The public "wants the commander in chief to have proper perspective and keep his eye on the big picture and the ball. At the same time, they want their president to understand the hardship and sacrifice that many Americans are enduring at a time of war. And we believe he's striking that balance."
So Mr. Bush is continuing to refer as broadly as possible to the sacrifice of all, as when reporters asked him in California on Tuesday to comment directly on the attack against the helicopter.
"I am saddened any time that there's a loss of life," replied Mr. Bush, who added that the soldiers killed had died "for a cause greater than themselves," the campaign against terrorism.
Some Republicans say they are concerned that the White House strategy leaves the president open to accusations from Democrats that he is isolated from the real pain of war. 
"I have to say, I think we have to note tragedies of this magnitude," the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, told reporters on Tuesday, referring to Sunday's attack. "I think it needs to be expressed over and over by the president, and I think all deference ought to be given those dead and wounded who return home."
David R. Gergen, who worked in the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton White Houses, called the subject a "tender" one. He said he understood the White House concern about allowing Mr. Bush to be drawn into every death in Iraq, and recalled past presidents who were advised by their staffs not to meet with the families of American hostages.
"Even so," Mr. Gergen said, "we're now encountering deaths at rates we haven't seen since Vietnam, and I think it's important for the country to hear from the president at times like these, and for families to know. I think the weight is on the side of clear expression."
Others say the White House strategy can add to the anguish of families who have lost loved ones in Iraq. Thomas Wilson, an uncle of Staff Sgt. Joe N. Wilson, 30, of Crystal Springs, Miss., who was killed in the helicopter attack, went so far as to tell a reporter on Monday that Mr. Bush and members of his family needed to experience Iraq for themselves. "Then he'll realize what's going on," Mr. Wilson said. "As long as they ain't over there, he don't care."
Mr. Bartlett would not discuss how much concern comments like Mr. Wilson's had created at the White House.
"The president writes a letter to every family of a fallen soldier and meets privately with families of soldiers at military bases," Mr. Bartlett said. "He grieves with them, he understands. I'm not going to judge anybody's comments made in such a difficult period. People say a lot of things."
Some close to the president say another reason he has not expressed more public sympathy for individual soldiers killed in Iraq is his determination to let families have their privacy. He was offended, his friends say, by what he saw at times as President Bill Clinton's exploitation of private grief for political gain.
Like other presidents, Mr. Clinton appeared at some military funerals. In October 2000, he attended a memorial service in Norfolk, Va., for the 17 sailors killed in the bombing of the guided-missile destroyer Cole. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan attended a memorial service at Camp Lejeune, N.C., for 241 marines killed in Beirut. President Jimmy Carter attended ceremonies for troops killed in the failed hostage-rescue mission in Iran.
Marlin Fitzwater, who was White House press secretary to President Bush's father, recalled that the elder Mr. Bush "went to a number of memorial ceremonies" where he met with families of troops killed in action in the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
At the time of that war, the Pentagon barred media coverage of coffins arriving at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. The ban was relaxed during the Clinton administration, but then reinforced by the second Bush administration in the run-up to the current hostilities in Iraq.

HEADLINE: Europe Warns U.S. Is Facing Consequences Over Trade 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Europe's top trade official said here on Tuesday that the United States could look forward to up to $6 billion of trade sanctions if President Bush failed to lift steel tariffs and Congress did not eliminate overseas tax shelters for American exporters.
 Two months after global trade talks fell apart in Cancun, Mexico, and with Democrats attacking free trade agreements in the presidential campaign, Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner, said Europe had shown enough patience with the United States over these issues. 
 "There is a simple way to get rid of the sanctions and that is to do what is required under international trade rules," Mr. Lamy said in an interview. 
Three years ago Europe won its case against the United States regarding the tax issues and has waited for Congress to change the law. The House and the Senate are considering two competing bills that neither chamber has voted on.
Next Monday, the World Trade Organization will decide whether to uphold its earlier ruling against the United States on the year-old steel tariffs.
In two days of talks here, senior lawmakers and administration officials indicated free trade was taking a battering in Congress. Even so, Mr. Lamy did not blink concerning Europe's intentions. 
"This is not a trade war," he said. "This is upholding the disciplines of an international trading system that has worked for everyone's benefit."
With an eye toward the 2004 election, President Bush is expected to try to appease both the steel industry, which asked for the tariffs, and the steel-consuming industries that oppose them. He could do this perhaps by continuing the tariffs but expanding the number of exceptions to them, thereby holding down steel prices. 
If the steel tariffs are not lifted, Mr. Lamy said, Europe will begin imposing $2.2 billion in trade sanctions in mid-December, sanctions that could affect textiles, citrus fruits and motorcycles.
The far larger $4 billion worth of sanctions on American exports will begin in March and be phased in gradually if Congress fails to repeal the overseas tax shelter by the end of this year. 
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, told the European Parliament two years ago that the possible use of $4 billion in European sanctions against the United States was akin to the threat of a nuclear bomb.
"There's no doubt that if it starts to go into affecting that much trade, it's like using a nuclear weapon on the trading system," Mr. Zoellick said.
Trade experts fear that Europe and the United States are headed toward a trans-Atlantic trade war, especially because they are also arguing over Europe's moratorium on genetically modified food and the request by the United States that foreign airlines provide full information on their passengers before they board airplanes as part of measures against terrorism.
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the risk of a trans-Atlantic war was rising. He said the steel tariffs should be lifted.
"The immediate issue is steel, but we have to prevent steel from igniting broader trade issues," Mr. Bergsten said.
Especially worrisome is how the United States can forge ahead on other trade negotiations when it has failed to solve disputes with Europe. Citing the failure of global trade talks, of the growing rift between the United States and Brazil as well as "China bashing" in Congress, Mr. Bergsten said there was a "dire need for some creative U.S. leadership in trade."
Mr. Lamy said talk of trade wars was wrong and only 1 or 2 percent of the $1 billion in daily trade between Europe and the United States was in dispute. "We have a huge forest that is doing fine, but only one or two trees that are not," he said. "It should not be overdramatized as trade wars or nuclear bombs."
Mr. Lamy met arguments that this is the wrong time to impose sanctions, given the fragility of the American economic recovery and the shape of Europe's economy, with the same unblinking determination.
Congress began serious discussions about repealing the tax law the day after the World Trade Organization decided on the $4 billion sanctions, he said. 
Moreover, he said, when the United States won its trade cases against Europe over bananas and beef raised with hormones, Washington immediately imposed its sanctions. The United States continues to impose $125 million of tariffs against Europe to counter its ban on beef with hormones.
"We had better nurture this trade system, including using sanctions," Mr. Lamy said. "To do otherwise is to revert to the law of the jungle."

HEADLINE: Republicans Win Top Posts In Mississippi and Kentucky 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., Wednesday, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
The political landscape of the South took yet another Republican turn on Tuesday night as voters in Mississippi unseated a Democratic governor and Kentucky elected its first Republican governor in decades.
 Haley Barbour, a Washington lobbyist and former chairman of the Republican National Committee, defeated Gov. Ronnie Musgrove in Mississippi. 
 With 84 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Barbour had 53 percent to Mr. Musgrove's 45 percent, The Associated Press reported. 
Representative Ernie Fletcher, a three-term House Republican and strong supporter of Bush administration economic policies, was elected governor of Kentucky, easily defeating his Democratic challenger, Ben Chandler, the state attorney general.
With 55 percent of the vote to 45 percent for Mr. Chandler, grandson of a former Kentucky governor and baseball commissioner, Happy Chandler, Mr. Fletcher succeeds Gov. Paul E. Patton, a two-term Democrat who is barred by law from seeking another term.
The victory made Mr. Fletcher, 50, a physician and former Air Force pilot, the first Republican to win an election for governor of Kentucky since Louie B. Nunn won in 1967. He also became the latest to win a Southern state for the Republicans, following Republican victories last year in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. 
And, combined with Arnold Schwarzenegger's victory last month to become governor of California, it gives Republicans at least a degree of momentum heading into a presidential election next November.
Counting Mr. Schwarzenegger, Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Barbour become the 28th and 29th Republican governors. Mr. Barbour will be just the second Republican governor of Mississippi since Reconstruction.
In Maine, voters rejected a referendum to authorize a $650 million casino resort proposed by two Indian tribes and a Las Vegas developer for Sanford, a down-on-its-luck factory town. The ballot measure resulted in the most expensive campaign in state history, and the money was matched by the passion shown on each side.
"I'm very proud of the citizens of this state," Gov. John Baldacci, a casino foe, told The Associated Press. "It didn't matter how much money was being spent on the airwaves. They were able to read the legislation and make the determination themselves. And it was a bad deal for Maine."
Despite the bitterly partisan nature of the Kentucky race, Mr. Fletcher set out immediately to unite Kentucky's divided electorate.
"This campaign was about reaching out to everyone Republicans, Democrats and independents," Mr. Fletcher said in his victory remarks, adding: "I think we're in an era that we're going to put people above politics and people even above party in this state because that's what Kentucky deserves. That's what we're looking for in the future."
But in congratulating Mr. Fletcher, Ed Gillespie, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, made a point of recognizing Republican superiority, saying the victory "brought together the winning combination of a great candidate, an excellent ground game and a positive message."
He added, "The Democratic strategy was negative attacks and tying Ernie Fletcher to President Bush and making this race a referendum on the president's economic policies. The Democrats had their referendum and got their answer."
Conceding the race less than 90 minutes after the polls closed, Mr. Chandler, 44, said he called Mr. Fletcher to congratulate him and said, "I told the governor-elect that he can count on me, Charlie Owen and all Kentuckians to help him with the difficult task of leading this great state." Mr. Owen was Mr. Chandler's running mate as a candidate for lieutenant governor.
The third election for governor this year is scheduled for Nov. 15 in Louisiana, where Bobby Jindal, a Republican who won last month's primary, is running against Lt. Gov. Kathleen Blano, a Democrat who finished second with the highest number of votes among several Democrats in the race. 
Because Mr. Jindal, a former state and federal health department official, did not reach a majority, a runoff was required.
The Kentucky race was viewed largely as a referendum on the leadership of Mr. Patton, whose eight years in office became major campaign fodder for the number of investigations into corruption, the indictment of several administration officials and Mr. Patton's extramarital affair with a state contractor.
Both candidates made change the central theme of their campaigns. Mr. Fletcher argued that it was time to clean house altogether in state government, while Mr. Chandler countered that as the Democratic attorney general, he had the strength and independence to prosecute wrong-doing in the Patton administration as he saw it.
But there were unmistakable overtones of national policy as well. Mr. Fletcher spoke proudly of his consistent support of Bush administration tax cuts and other policies. Mr. Bush showed his appreciation by campaigning three times in Kentucky late in the campaign, including two appearances with Mr. Fletcher on Saturday.
Mr. Chandler denounced Mr. Fletcher's rubber-stamp tendencies as a contrast to his streak of independence.
While the campaign grew nasty as the months passed, it ended on a particularly sour note and a reminder that racial politics are never too far below the surface in a Southern state.
Complaining of ballot irregularities in past elections, Republican state party officials posted observers at majority-black precincts in Louisville as a means, they said, to insure the integrity of the voter. Democrats said the effort was nothing more than an intimidation tactic designed to suppress the black turnout.
Four years ago in Mississippi, Mr. Musgrove, 47, won in the closest race for governor in state history, defeating a former Republican congressman, Mike Parker, and several third-party candidates with just under 50 percent of the vote. Without a majority, the result was sent, as state law requires, to the Mississippi House, where the Democratic majority voted to make Mr. Musgrove the winner.
If the election this year was not so close, it was far more expensive. Together, the candidates raised more than $18 million, a record for Mississippi, and both parties poured in millions more for television advertising, reflecting a near-frenzied effort by both parties to achieve momentum heading into next year. In Mississippi alone, the Republican Governors Association pumped in more than $5 million for Mr. Barbour and other Republican candidates.
Mr. Bush campaigned three times in Mississippi for Mr. Barbour, 56, the most recent appearances coming last Saturday as part of the party's extended efforts to excite independents and conservative Democrats.

Quick To Buy, Hoping To Sell

BYLINE:  By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
WHEN Eliot and Jann Zuckerman put their Upper East Side apartment on the market in January, it attracted a seemingly endless stream of lookers.
 Nights, Mrs. Zuckerman and her 12-year-old son, Cody, would wait in the laundry room downstairs or huddle in the car in the garage as brokers showed prospective buyers the place. Sometimes they walked around the block, Cody already in his pajamas. One Sunday afternoon during an open house, the family killed time at a mall in Secaucus, N.J. "It cost us a bloody fortune," Mrs. Zuckerman said, recalling their nervous shopping that day. 
 Still, no nibbles on the apartment, which had two bedrooms and was in a doorman building -- even after they reduced the price from $695,000 to $659,000. "It was nonstop anxiety every day and every night," Mr. Zuckerman said, sitting on a black leather couch in his new living room on Monday evening. Mrs. Zuckerman interjected: "And nobody ever put in a bid. At one point, I was giving up." 
Their distress may be familiar to anyone who has ever sold a house or apartment. But for the Zuckermans there was an added layer of worry: they had already signed a contract and put down a deposit on a larger two-bedroom apartment just two floors below. The last thing they wanted was two places and two mortgages.
The suspense lasted only 10 weeks. The Zuckermans sold their apartment for $622,500 in March and moved in June. Showing off their new kitchen appliances and custom-built closets, Mr. Zuckerman, a real estate lawyer, said, "This apartment was worth taking the risk."
With prices continuing to rise in Manhattan and the number of available apartments falling, more people are hedging their bets by signing a contract on a new place before selling their old. Many want to lock in mortgage rates, which are still hovering at record lows. And given the rapid turnover, they figure they won't have much trouble shedding their current residences.
Of course, there is always a risk that an apartment will sit on the market a little too long, creating financial havoc for households without large savings. Even after a seller secures a buyer, the sale could fall through if, for example, a co-op board turns down the buyer, forcing the seller to start over while juggling two mortgage payments. But unlike the situation a year ago, when sellers worried that economic woes would bleed into the real estate market, many sellers now know that "they are coming out of good situations, and they are not so concerned that their apartments will languish," said Corinne Pulitzer, senior vice president of Heron Residential, the Manhattan firm that helped the Zuckermans sell their apartment. 
Reba Miller, president of R. P. Miller & Associates in Manhattan, said that in half her deals in the last six months, the homeowner has bought before selling, a marked increase over previous years. "Owners who become purchasers have more of a concern about where they're going than what they're selling," she said.
Rather than worrying if they are paying too much, buyers now worry that if they dawdle they will lose their dream apartment. In the largest contraction since early 2002, the number of apartments available for sale in Manhattan is shrinking: from 6,058 units at the end of the second quarter of 2003 to 5,224 units on the last day of the third, according to a market analysis by Miller Samuel, a New York real estate appraisal firm. (After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, inventories initially spiked as buyers retreated from the market, but when they came flooding back in early 2002, the number of apartments available dipped sharply.) In the most recent quarter, not surprisingly, prices climbed too, to an average of $916,959 from $864,860.
As inventory shrinks, apartments move more quickly. Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, says it took an average of 137 days to sell an apartment in the third quarter of this year -- five fewer than during the second.
"If somebody wants something, they just act very quickly and decisively," said Marcy Pedas Sigler, a broker at Stribling & Associates in Manhattan. She said she is working on four deals in which the buyers have signed contracts before selling their current residences.
Earlier this year, Susan Ascher, a college marketing instructor, decided she wanted to move from the Fifth Avenue apartment she shared with her husband, Richard, to a place with enough room to entertain their whole family, which includes six grandchildren.
"There was not much to look at," Ms. Ascher said of her desired neighborhood, the East 70's and 80's. So when she found a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with a large dining room just three blocks down Fifth Avenue in a building with a garage, she persuaded her husband that they should jump, even though they were still negotiating with a prospective buyer for their own apartment.
"When I told my friends about it, they thought I was just crazy," said Ms. Ascher, who admitted to spending several sleepless nights. In the end, as a result of delays with their new co-op board, the couple closed on the sale of their apartment before they closed on the purchase of their new one. They are living in a hotel while contractors install new kitchen and bathroom fixtures.
Most sellers don't have the buy-now, sell-later option, because they need money from the sale to finance a down payment. Co-op boards rarely approve a sale that is contingent on the buyers' selling their own place. But for those with access to savings or short-term personal loans, a delay in the sale can mean a smoother move.
"A lot of people are afraid that if they sell first, they will then be homeless because they won't find what they're looking for," said Naomi Davis, an agent who specializes in the Upper West Side for Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy.
One couple who came to her, Steven and Linda Bloom, carried two mortgages for two months so they would not have to move twice or accept a place that was less than ideal. The Blooms had been looking casually for about two years while hoping the market would cool off. But when they realized they were expecting a child, their third, they shifted into high gear. In April, Ms. Davis showed them a classic six-room apartment big enough to convert part of the dining room into a third bedroom. They made an offer, gambling that they could sell their old apartment in time to move into the new one.
"It's very nerve-racking, knowing that every month longer it takes, the meter is ticking in terms of carrying two places and two mortgages," Mr. Bloom said. The couple considered reducing their asking price, but passed up a few low-ball offers, figuring that the way the market was going they would find a buyer willing to bid higher and close on the deal before the end of the year. The wait paid off, and the family will move in early December.
For some, buying a new apartment ahead of a sale reflects confidence in the strength of the market. "We felt that real estate was a very good investment," said Barbara Zackman, who, with her husband, Michael, recently bought a $1.1 million apartment with a view of the East River in the same Sutton Place building where they have lived for three years.
But that same confidence led them to be overly optimistic about the value of the apartment they were selling. A renovated one-bedroom, it went on the market in May at $795,000. After two months, the couple reduced the price and finally, after five months of carrying both apartments, signed a contract to sell it for $699,000. The buyer is still awaiting co-op board approval.
Some homeowners are lucky enough to have paid off their mortgages before shopping for a new place. One such couple, Harriet Fraad and Richard Wolff, who plan to close on a West Village triplex today, say they are certain that they can sell their longtime home in New Haven soon enough. As Ms. Fraad, a psychotherapist, put it: "My husband has been wanting to live in Manhattan for about 10 years, and I've been ready to move for about 5 years. So when we finally found what we wanted, we were ready to take the risk."
Marie Sansone Taylor, the couple's broker at Brown Harris Stevens, pointed out that the new apartment offers the office space Ms. Fraad has been searching for since first dreaming of the move in the late 90's.
Indeed, "if they didn't take it," Ms. Sansone Taylor said, "it could be another six years before they found something that worked as perfectly for them again."

HEADLINE: Heart Laser Treatment Used Mostly on Patients Who Don't Meet the Federal Criteria 

BYLINE:  By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
About three-quarters of the patients who receive an expensive, invasive and risky laser treatment for the chest pains of heart disease do not meet the medical criteria for which it was approved, researchers reported yesterday.
 The Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment -- TMR, for transmyocardial revascularization -- only for patients with severe chest pains who could not have bypass surgery or angioplasty. But the researchers found that large numbers of surgeons are performing it while patients are having bypasses. 
 Moreover, they reported, the procedure carries greater risks than bypass surgery. More than one in 16 who had TMR died, and one in six suffered serious consequences, including strokes, prolonged time on a ventilator and kidney failure. These rates are one and half to two times those seen in patients with traditional bypass surgery. 
TMR alone costs $24,340 per treatment, but additional payments to hospitals can nearly double that amount. It involves opening the chest and using a laser to drill holes in the beating heart with the hope of relieving chest pain. 
The Food and Drug Administration commissioned the study, published yesterday in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology, to find out how many patients were getting the procedure and what its risks were. Medical experts say the findings offer a rare glimpse of what happens in the real world of medical practice, when doctors prescribe drugs or treatments "off label" -- for patients who do not meet the criteria for which the drug agency approved the treatments.
Off-label use is common with many drugs and devices, said Dr. Eric Peterson, a cardiologist at Duke University and the lead author of the study, but there is little information on the consequences. "No one really knows what happens," he said.
The study found that 3,136 patients had TMR from 1998 to 2001. But just 661, or 21 percent, met the drug agency criteria -- severe chest pain and no other surgical options. The others had TMR along with bypass surgery. 
"I was surprised by the volume and rapidity of off-label use," said Dr. Larry Kessler, the director of the drug agency's office of science and technology in its Center for Devices and Radiological Health. "Within two years, anywhere from 67 to 83 percent of the use was off-label. That's really remarkable for a high-risk procedure."
Dr. Kessler said the patients were largely unaware that they were essentially subjects in a large, uncontrolled experiment. He called the off-label use of TMR "doing an experiment without informed consent."
The new study used the Society of Thoracic Surgeons' National Cardiac Database, which collects information from two-thirds of all hospitals in this country that do heart surgery. 
The most dismal results were with patients who had worsening or changing angina -- half of the patients in the database -- and with those who had a heart attack within the previous three weeks, which was he case for one-quarter. 
Those were conditions that the drug agency had warned about, saying TMR was particularly risky then. The study found that mortality rates were at least double those of patients without those conditions. If doctors waited until the patients were more stable, that death rate might have been cut in half, Dr. Peterson said.
Some doctors defend combining TMR with bypass surgery.
"I agree that off-label use can become murky," said Dr. Keith Horvath, a surgeon at Northwestern University. But "from a surgeon's point of view, we're combining two known therapies to give a more complete operation to maximize the blood flow to a patient's heart." 
TMR was developed to help the most difficult of patients. "The patients literally feel like the walls are closing in on them," Dr. Horvath said. "One patient said he had a choice in the morning when he woke up between shaving, then sitting and resting, or not shaving and going to fix breakfast. Some said they wish they had their nitroglycerin in a Pez dispenser. That's how often they're taking it -- 10, 15 times a day." 
Dr. Horvath and others developed the procedure as a way to help such patients. They reasoned that holes drilled with lasers might relieve pain by allowing more blood to be delivered to the heart. He and his colleagues obtained evidence, randomly assigning 192 patients with severe chest pain from heart disease and no other treatment options to have TMR or not. Their paper, published in 1999 in The New England Journal of Medicine, indicated that those who had TMR reported less chest pain.
Even then, some doctors were skeptical. The Journal paper was accompanied by an editorial by Dr. Richard A. Lange and Dr. L. David Hillis, cardiologists at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. They said there was no convincing explanation for why the method might work, since the laser holes soon closed. There is no objective indication that hearts function any better, they said -- no signs of improved blood flow to the heart, no improvement on treadmill tests. The perceived benefit, they suggested, might well be a placebo effect. 
But once the food and drug agency approved TMR, the stage was set for its widespread use. The next question was whether Medicare would pay, and if so, for which patients. The program's administrators decided to cover not just the agency's approved use, but other uses as well. They were persuaded by a small study showing that TMR seemed to produce fewer complications in hospitalized patients.
Dr. Sean Tunis, director of the Office of Clinical Standards at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, says the program tries to leave doctors with some flexibility. "There's a certain delicate tension between a clinician taking a technology that's proven for a certain indication and learning by experience that it is useful for patients that exceed those limits," Dr. Tunis said. 
Dr. Tunis noted that the TMR decision "happened before I got here," and added, "We probably would have handled it differently today." 
The drug agency, in the meantime, wanted to get a handle on what was happening to TMR patients. The postmarketing studies it had requested of the device's makers, CardioGeneis, and PLC Medical Systems, never really got under way.
That is not surprising, said Dr. Donna B. Tillman, deputy director at the drug agency's office for device evaluation. "The clinical community believes that once a device is approved it has been shown to be safe and effective, so why do we need to collect data?" Dr. Tillman explained. "Sometimes companies just don't want to be bothered once the device is out there making money."
So the F.D.A. commissioned the study with the thoracic society's database. Some were amazed that the study was done and published.
"It takes a lot of courage to publish a paper like this," said Dr. Scott Ramsey, an internist and health economist at the University of Washington. "It shows that TMR has gone from where the evidence is to where the money is."
Dr. T. Bruce Ferguson, a cardiac surgeon at Louisiana State University and an author of the paper, took a very different view.
"I don't think you can draw the conclusion that it was unreasonable," he said of doctors' decision to use TMR. "You can say that we don't have all the information we need to say that this is a good thing to do." He added that doctors could not overlook those patients who were suffering and desperate for relief. 
Dr. Horvath said he understood the concern about TMR's use but added that many of the strongest critics were not surgeons and therefore did not perform TMR. He sees the patients who have no other options.
"There are patients I see every day and I tell them it may be risky," Dr. Horvath said. "They say: 'I can't live like this any longer. I will accept the risk.' " 
Dr. Paul Armstrong, a professor of medicine at the University of Alberta and an author of the study, has a different perspective. "I'm bothered even in the indication for which it is approved," he said. "Now we're going into a circumstance where it is not approved in a group of patients where the risk is even greater."

HEADLINE: Spain Is Told Its Help in Iraq Will Pay Off 

BYLINE:  By DALE FUCHS 

DATELINE: MADRID, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Spain's political support of the United States in the war in Iraq will have an economic payoff, the president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, Thomas J. Donohue, told Spanish business leaders here on Wednesday.
 American multinationals are interested in "partnerships and collaborations" with Spanish companies in Latin America, where Spain is a leading investor, and the chamber "has the intention of helping Spanish firms increase investment" in the United States, Mr. Donohue said at a news conference. He also reassured Spanish engineering, infrastructure and construction companies that they "will be part of the rebuilding process" in Iraq. 
 Mr. Donohue met privately Wednesday with Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar; the Popular Party candidate for the March national elections, Mariano Rajoy; and King Juan Carlos. Mr. Donohue then spoke with representatives of Spain's largest corporations, like Telefonica, Gas Natural, Repsol and El Corte Ingles, as well American multinationals based in Spain, including I.B.M., J.P. Morgan and Ford. Another high-level bilateral meeting is planned in January, Mr. Donohue said, when Mr. Aznar will travel to the United States to meet with business leaders.
 "Spain is becoming a major player in the global investment scene," he told the assembled business leaders, praising the country's economic growth, which stands in contrast to its neighbors' sluggish performances. "That's why more than 500 U.S. firms have come to Spain, and I predict more are on the way," he said. "And with Spain becoming a major player in the global investment scene especially in Latin America, Spanish and American companies will find even more opportunities to partner and to grow together. " 
 Spanish businessmen received his words with enthusiasm.
 "We always considered the United States to be a closed market, but the political climate is right to look for American partners," said Manuel Contreras, chief executive of the AZVI construction company, which operates in Chile.
 Manuel Egea Llaneza, chief executive of the Spanish Consortium of Technical and Industrial Suppliers, a trade group, said he was "studying opportunities" to do business in Argentina with North American companies that have "shared interests." "We're not looking at mergers, but possible joint ventures or technological cooperation agreements," he said.
 Spanish leaders are concerned that, with the European Union expanding in the Continent, manufacturers will flee to Eastern Europe where labor is cheaper. They are also aware that their midsize companies need to grow to compete with German, French and other European multinationals.
 So the Spanish Institute for Foreign Trade is trying to seize the moment of political cooperation between the United States and Spain to promote economic cooperation as well. Project USA is the code name. The goal is to attract high skills and high-paying companies from the United States, like research and development complexes, and then use the United States as a base for expansion.
 Mr. Aznar's trip to Florida, California and Texas in September was part of the larger strategy, and it has already shown some results. The Spanish company Indra Sistemas won a 2.8 billion euro ($3.2 billion) contract from the United States government to make aviation simulators; a Spanish biotechnology company has set up shop in California; and Spanish infrastructure companies will receive special consideration for a $15 billion highway and telecommunications project in Texas, said Jaime Malet, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce in Spain.
 The United States has promised to back Spain's candidacy for a 4.5 billion euro nuclear fusion project, known as the International Tokamak Experimental Reactor, which would create 1,300 jobs for scientists alone, Mr. Malet said. Spain will be competing with France for the European Union's endorsement to get the project. But if the European Union chooses France, Mr. Malet said, then the United States would throw its support to Japan, leaving Europe out of the project.

HEADLINE: G.M. Puts Off Its Hybrids, Letting Ford Go First 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
General Motors has delayed plans to sell a hybrid vehicle similar to the Toyota Prius by two years, until 2007, according to people close to the company's product development strategy. 
 That means that Ford, which plans to sell a hybrid version of its Escape sport utility vehicle next year, will put a light-duty, Prius-style hybrid on the road about three years before its American rival. 
 G.M. has previously laid out plans to offer fuel-saving electric technologies as options on as many as a dozen models this decade, if the demand for such vehicles materializes. Most of the vehicles would reduce gasoline consumption 10 percent to 15 percent. The Prius saves 50 percent or more on fuel, though its performance can vary widely depending on how and where it is driven. 
 G.M. has shifted away from a plan to offer a hybrid system similar to that in the Prius as an option on its Saturn Vue sport utility vehicle by 2005. Instead, it will offer such a system in 2007, as an option in two 2008 model full-size sport utilities -- the GMC Yukon and the Chevrolet Tahoe. A less ambitious green version of the Saturn Vue will be introduced in 2006. 
 G.M.'s new strategy was reported on Wednesday in The Detroit News. 
 Hybrid vehicles save gasoline by supplementing internal combustion with electrical power. The Prius has an electric motor that takes over from the gasoline engine at low speeds, and technology that recycles energy used in braking and shuts the engine off at stops. 
 G.M. declined to comment on its plans. Executives said privately that the company saw a better business case for hybrids on large S.U.V.'s and more potential for fuel savings by putting hybrids in the biggest gas guzzlers. The system on the Yukon and the Tahoe would probably reduce fuel consumption by about 30 percent while retaining the vehicles' towing ability. 
 The shift is spurred by the company's most tangible hybrid program, which is building systems for buses. Last month, King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, said it would buy 235 buses outfitted with a G.M. hybrid system. 
 Thomas G. Stephens, group vice president at GM Powertrain, said then that the buses would save as much gasoline as replacing 8,000 conventional cars with hybrids. "What we need to do at General Motors is go after the highest fuel-consuming vehicle first," he said. 
 The company thinks that the hybrid bus system can be a base for a system in big sport utility vehicles and be potentially profitable instead of a money loser. A big hurdle with hybrids is that they cost a few thousand dollars more than ordinary vehicles, though that can be offset in part by federal, and sometimes local tax deductions for such technology.
 Toyota and Honda introduced hybrids in the late 1990's. Automakers in Europe and Detroit, and Asian automakers like Nissan and Hyundai, have yet to sell them. 
 "We're happy to see them putting hybrids in big trucks, but we're very disappointed seeing the Vue dropping from a full hybrid to a halfhearted hybrid," said David Friedman, a energy expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group. "It shouldn't be an either-or situation. It should be both."
 And Daniel Becker, an expert on global warming for the Sierra Club, said, "Why is a company that's supposed to be the industry leader so far behind?" 
 The new plan for the Saturn Vue is to equip it with a small electric starter system that allows the engine to shut off at stops, as well as advanced transmission technology for overall fuel savings of 12 percent to 15 percent. 
 G.M. will offer a somewhat similar feature on the GMC Sierra and the Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks this year for the commercial market and next year for retail customers. It also has plans to offer such technology in the Chevrolet Malibu. 
 Hybrids are hardly the only environmentally friendly technology. Automakers are exploring various approaches as they brace for increases in global fuel economy and emissions requirements. 
 European producers, including DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen, favor advanced diesels. Though diesels are still dirtier than gasoline cars, the gap is narrowing. Diesels also get better mileage and thus have lower emissions of gases that a number of scientists think are causing a global-warming trend.
 William Clay Ford Jr., Ford's chairman and chief executive, appears determined to make his company the world's third auto manufacturer to sell a hybrid. Its Escape hybrid, due next summer, could be the first hybrid S.U.V., although Toyota's Lexus division plans to sell one in the fall and Ford has previously delayed the Escape. 
 "The Escape hybrid is designed to be the cleanest S.U.V. on the planet," Mr. Ford said at the company's annual meeting in June, adding that it would appear in 2004. 
 G.M.'s research and development executives are most enthusiastic about the hydrogen fuel cell, a system that uses hydrogen and air to generate electric power. Fuel-cell cars emit only water from their tailpipes. 
 But far-reaching questions remain about how hydrogen will be produced, how it would be stored in vehicles and how the nation's gasoline stations would be retrofitted to distribute it.

SMYTHE, SHEILA MARY

 BODY:
 SMYTHE--Sheila Mary. Suddenly on November 4, 2003. Devoted daughter of Patrick and Molly (nee Gonley) Smythe. Dear friend of Anne E. Schneiders. She is also survived by a loving family in Ireland and England. She was a caring, compassionate woman who was always ready to help anyone in need. At the time of her death, she was Executive Vice President of New York Medical College and Dean of its School of Public Health. She had previously served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield and as Chief Health Policy Advisor for the U.S. General Accounting Office. Ms. Smythe had a passion for education and public health, with a special interest in children. She served as a member or chair of numerous boards and advisory councils throughout her career, including Manhattanville College, Dominican Academy, the March of Dimes, Catholic Charities USA, the Astor Home for Children, the Dominican Sisters of Hope (Newburgh), the Dominican Sisters of Saint Mary of the Springs (Columbus, OH.), the Visiting Nurse Service of Westchester, and Mutual of America Life Insurance Company. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave at 81 St, Thursday and Friday, 3-5 and 7-9PM. Mass of Resurrection Saturday, November 8th, 10AM, Saint Vincent Ferrer Church, Lexington Ave at 66 St. Interment Cedar Hill Cemetery, Washington, D.C. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made to the School of Public Health Scholarship Fund at New York Medical College. 
SMYTHE--Sheila M. New York Medical College is stunned and grieved by the sudden loss of our executive vice president and dean of the School of Public Health, Sheila Smythe. Her life was an extraordinary example of dedicated service to education and public health. Her leadership and influence among key decision-makers were far-reaching, and are only a part of the remarkable legacy she leaves to New York Medical College and the health and education communities.

HEADLINE: Free Trade Won't Free Cuba 

BYLINE:  By Claudia Marquez Linares; Claudia Marquez Linares is vice president of the Manuel Marquez Sterling Society, a journalists' group. This article was translated by The Times from the Spanish.

DATELINE: HAVANA 

 BODY:
According to our state television, the Castro regime was pleased that the United States Senate passed an amendment easing restrictions on American citizens traveling to Cuba. This was no surprise. Just days before the vote, Fidel Castro met here with a group of American travel agents. Both sides are impatient to make business deals in tourism on our island. But how much this would really benefit Cubans outside the top Communist Party leadership remains to be seen. 
 Democratic dissidents here are divided on the travel ban and the American trade embargo. But there is unanimity that the Cuban government does not deserve any sort of reward now, just half a year after it carried out the worst crackdown on the opposition in decades -- the arrest of 75 dissidents, who were quickly given prison terms of up to 28 years. 
 Of course, American lawmakers have the right to defend the freedom of movement for their citizens, and American farmers understandably want to sell agricultural products to whomever they wish. But the assertion by lawmakers that they want to lift the obstacles to travel and trade for the good of average Cubans rings false.
"Unilateral sanctions stop not just the flow of goods, but the flow of ideas," said Senator Michael Enzi of Wyoming, a sponsor of the bill. "Ideas of freedom and democracy are the keys to positive change in any nation." The problem is that when it comes to Cuba, the flow of ideas, not to mention people, is hardly free. Sharing ideas can land you in jail, and one has to ask the government for a permit to travel abroad -- and if you are a dissident, the chances of getting one are almost zero. My husband, Osvaldo Alfonso Valdes, has always been denied travel because he has headed the Democratic Liberal Party of Cuba.
In addition, freedom to trade with the United States is a privilege reserved for those who belong to the Communist Party nomenklatura. Merely selling newspapers in the streets or refilling cigarette lighters without a permit can get you arrested and fined. 
My husband's party's platform calls for freedom of movement and free markets. For the next 18 years, however, my husband's movement will be reduced to the two square yards of his cell in the high-security prison at Guanajay. He was one of the first of the 75 dissidents detained in March, just weeks after he had met with Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota and his family in Havana to talk about the Liberal Party and about the chances of freedom and democracy in Cuba. The next day my husband met with staff aides to six other senators, including Mr. Enzi. Two other Cubans at these meetings were also condemned: Oscar Espinosa Chepe, an economist, to 20 years and Hector Palacios, founder of the Democratic Solidarity Party, to 25 years.
Senator Conrad is not the only American politician to have shown an interest in Cuba. In April, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa came to promote agricultural products from his state. Senator Max Baucus came in September with farm leaders from Montana; Senator Evan Bayh came last month to sign food accords advancing the agricultural interests of Indiana.
Of course, all these senators voted in favor of easing the travel restrictions. Could they not see the irony in that meeting with Senator Conrad and with the Senate staffers were central accusations against many dissidents, because talking to American officials can be considered an "act against the security and the territorial integrity of the state"?
I understand that now the Senate amendment (and an identical House measure passed long before) will probably be sent to President Bush for his signature. Mr. Bush wants the travel ban to stay, but if he vetoes the bill he would go against the majority of his own party. I can only hope that in their deliberations, Mr. Bush, Congressional lawmakers and the farmers they represent will consider the "freedom of movement" I and the other wives of Cuban political prisoners will enjoy for years to come: traveling every three months to spend just two hours with our husbands.

HEADLINE: Heavy Reading 

BYLINE:  By Ian R. Williams; Ian R. Williams lives in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
Last week Dr. Howard J. Bennett of the George Washington University Medical Center diagnosed one of those half-serious maladies of modern living, like Frisbee finger or Nintendinitis. In a whimsical letter to The New England Journal of Medicine, he gave it a name: the Hogwarts headache. 
 This alliterative affliction is named after the wizarding school in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, and is suffered by children embarking on marathon reading sessions of the 870-page "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix." Reports of Hogwarts headaches circulated wildly on the Internet, and no doubt prompted some parents, already worried about children lugging around 30-pound backpacks, to consider limiting their reading material. 
 After all, Dr. Bennett's letter is accompanied by a graph showing "Page and Weight Inflation in the Harry Potter Series"; the latest volume tips the scales at almost three pounds. But the physical mass of the book may be less relevant than the content. 
Dr. Bennett's letter fails to mention that "Order of the Phoenix" is basically a book about headaches. As any child will tell you, Harry Potter has a psychic connection with the evil Lord Voldemort, an extrasensory link that gives Harry a searing migraine any time the two are close to each other (or when Voldemort feels a particularly strong emotion). As a result, Harry spends much of the book needing an Advil.
It's no wonder these young readers have headaches: their hero gets them all the time. Human beings often share physical conditions without any visible contagion. The Couvade Syndrome, for example, is a phenomenon in which the husbands of pregnant women get morning sickness. Through a sort of intimate empathy, we shoulder the condition of our close company -- just try yawning in a crowded elevator.
Deep commiseration with a fictional character is nothing new. American readers of Dickens's serialized novel "The Old Curiosity Shop" were so taken with the selfless heroine, Little Nell, that they swarmed the boats bringing the latest installment of the book from England. "Is Little Nell dead?" they asked, and the country went into mourning when her fate was revealed.
Who knows what ailments Ms. Rowling's next volume will bring? But parents should be happy that their children are willing to drag a three-pound book around. These young readers may be aching, but they are unbowed. They aren't reading too much -- they're feelingtoo much, which is the miracle of fiction. Here's to the Hogwarts headache. Long may it throb.

HEADLINE: Sri Lankan President Declares a State of Emergency 

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: COLOMBO, Sri Lanka, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Sri Lanka's president declared a state of emergency Wednesday, deepening a political crisis in the country and giving herself sweeping powers to ban assemblies, detain people without cause and censor news reports. 
 The move came a day after the president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, suspended the country's Parliament, took control of the powerful Defense, Interior and Media ministries and deployed a small number of troops at key government buildings. 
 Political analysts said the actions were an attempt by the president to undermine her longtime political rival, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is in Washington where he met Wednesday with President Bush. President Kumaratunga has criticized Mr. Wickremesinghe for making too many concessions to rebel Tamil fighters in the current peace negotiations. 
In a television address to the nation late Tuesday night, President Kumaratunga, who lost an eye in a 1999 rebel suicide bombing, said she was acting to protect the nation's security and remained willing to negotiate with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. She said she would discuss a "just and a balanced solution of the national problem within the parameters of the unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Sri Lanka."
Emerging from his meeting with Mr. Bush, Mr. Wickremesinghe tried to play down the events. "This is not the first crisis I have had," he told reporters. "When I go back, I'll sort it out. We have a majority in Parliament. I have a mandate to bring peace to the country."
Rebel officials said today they were monitoring the situation, but declined to comment further.
The streets of Colombo appeared calm tonight, with pedestrians strolling down sidewalks and music blaring from shops. But American, British, Indian and Japanese officials all expressed concern that the country's fragile peace efforts could be derailed. Under Sri Lanka's Constitution, both the prime minister and president are popularly elected, but the president weilds far more power.
For the last 20 months, a cease-fire between the government and the ethnic Tamil rebels has generally prevailed. But negotiations stalled in April and some fear that the president's move could lead to a resumption of fighting on the island nation of 19 million. 
The turbulence appears to be taking a major economic toll, with a plunge today in the Sri Lankan stock market, which had risen by 70 percent this year. The Colombo All Share Index suffered its largest one-day loss since it opened in 1985, dropping by 13 percent. With the cease-fire in effect, Sri Lanka's economy was expected to grow by 5.5 percent this year.
Tamil rebels, citing discrimination by the country's majority ethnic Sinhalese population, have fought a 20-year battle for an independent Tamil homeland in the country's north and east. An estimated 64,000 people have died in the brutal conflict, in which both government and rebel forces have been accused of gross human rights violations.
Analysts said the course the prime minister chooses would determine what happens next. He is expected to return to Sri Lanka from Washington on Friday, after which he has a range of options, including mounting a legal, legislative and popular challenge.
Aides to the prime minister said the president's actions have broadened the slim, two seat majority the prime minister's party held in Parliament.
"It looks as if Parliament will continue to be controlled by the prime minister," said Rohan Edrisinha, director of the Center for Policy Alternatives in Colombo.
The state of emergency declared by the president will lapse in 10 days if it is not renewed by Parliament, Mr. Edrisinha said. He predicted the Parliament would not extend the state of emergency, but said the president had plenty of time to use her sweeping new powers.
"She can make use of the interim," he said, referring to the 10-day period. "She could prohibit demonstrations, rallies. She could promulgate regulations -- with force of law."

HEADLINE: Death Be Not Loud 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Who can blame poor President Bush? Look at his terrible dilemma.
 There are those who say the chief executive should have come out of his Texas ranch house and articulated and assuaged the sorrow and outrage and anxiety the nation was feeling on Sunday after the deadliest day in Iraq in seven months. An attack on a Chinook helicopter had killed 15 American soldiers, 13 men and 2 women, and wounded 21. 
 There are those who say Mr. Bush should have emulated Rudy Giuliani's empathetic leadership after 9/11, or Dad's in the first gulf war, and attended some of the funerals of the 379 Americans killed in Iraq. Or one. Maybe the one for Specialist Darryl Dent, the 21-year-old National Guard officer from Washington who died outside Baghdad in late August when a bomb struck his truck while he was delivering mail to troops. His funeral was held at a Baptist church three miles from the White House. 
But let's look at it from the president's point of view: if he grieves more publicly or concretely, if he addresses every instance of bad news, like the hideous specter of Iraqis' celebrating the downing of the Chinook, he will simply remind people of what's going on in Iraq.
So it's understandable why, going into his re-election campaign, Mr. Bush wouldn't want to underscore that young Americans keep getting whacked over there, and we don't know who is doing it or how to stop it.
The White House is cleverly trying to distance Mr. Bush from the messy problem of flesh-and-blood soldiers with real names dying nearly every day, while linking him to the heroic task of fighting global terror.
It's better to keep it vague, to talk about the "important cause" and the "brave defenders" of liberty.
If he gets more explicit, or allows the flag-draped coffins of fallen heroes to be photographed coming home, it will just remind people that the administration said this would be easy, and it's teeth-grindingly hard. And that the administration vowed to get Osama and Saddam and W.M.D., and hasn't. And that the Bush team that hyped the presence of Al Qaeda in Iraq has now created an Al Qaeda presence in Iraq. And that there was no decent plan for the occupation or for financing one, no plan for rotating or supporting troops stretched too thin to guard ammunition caches or police a fractious society, and no plan for getting out.
As the White House points out, Mr. Bush cannot fairly pick and choose which memorial services to go to, or which deaths to speak of.
"If a helicopter were hit an hour later, after he came out and spoke, should he come out again?" Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, told The Times's Elisabeth Bumiller, explaining Mr. Bush's silence after the Chinook crash. The public, he added, "wants the commander in chief to have proper perspective, and keep his eye on the big picture and the ball."
The ball for fall is fund-raising. President Bush has been going full throttle since summer, spending several days a week flying around the country, hitting up rich Republicans for $2,000 checks. He has raised $90 million so far out of the $175 million he plans to spend on a primary campaign in which he has no opponent.
At fund-raisers, Mr. Bush prefers to talk about the uptick in the economy, not the downtick in Iraq. On Monday, arriving for a fund-raiser in Birmingham, he was upbeat, not somber. As Mike Allen of The Washington Post reported in his pool report, "The president, who gave his usual salute as he stepped off Marine One, appeared to start the day in a fabulous mood. . . . An Alabama reporter who was under the wing shouted, 'How long will U.S. troops be in Iraq?' The president gave him an unappreciative look."
Raising $1.8 million at lunch, he stuck to the line that "we are aggressively striking the terrorists in Iraq, defeating them there so we will not have to face them in our own country." He didn't want to depress the donors by mentioning the big news story, the loss of 15 American soldiers, or sour the mood by conceding the obvious, that the swelling horde of terrorists fighting us there will not prevent terrorists from coming after us here. Maybe we should all be like President Bush and not read the papers so we don't get worn down either.
Perhaps the solution to Mr. Bush's quandary is to coordinate his schedule so he can go to cities where he can attend both fund-raisers and funerals. 
The law of averages suggests it shouldn't be hard.

Cisco Earnings and Growth Beat Predictions

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Cisco Systems, the large Internet equipment maker, reported quarterly earnings and revenue growth Wednesday that exceeded Wall Street's expectations.That result, company executives said, offered further evidence of economic recovery.
 John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco, said the sales growth gave him hope. "We are continuing to see signs that could be interpreted -- with the appropriate caveats -- as optimistic," said Mr. Chambers, who added that many chief executives he knows feel the same way. 
"About half the C.E.O.'s I talk with in the U.S. describe their position as having the wind at their backs for the first time in a long time." He said the other half were more skeptical and expressed a wait-and-see approach to the economy.
 Cisco reported sales of $5.1 billion for its first fiscal quarter, which ended Oct. 25. That figure is up from $4.8 billion in the quarter a year ago, and compares with $4.7 billion in the prior quarter. A consensus of industry analysts had projected that revenue for the first fiscal quarter would be $4.86 billion.
 Cisco reported net income of 15 cents a share for the first quarter, compared with 8 cents a share a year ago. Cisco shares gained $1.28 in after-hours trading to $23.08. In regular trading, the shares closed at $21.80. 
 Tim Luke, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said the revenue figure was particularly impressive and "exceeded the high end of even the whispered expectations." He said the results were likely to reflect well on the telecommunications equipment and the broader technology sector.
 Barry Jaruzelski, a consultant with Booz Allen Hamilton's global communications and technology practice, agreed that Cisco's results reinforced a sense of momentum in the sector.
 "This is a final proof point that confirms the uptick," he said. "This is the quarter that just about everybody turned up."
 The quarter was the first since the second quarter of 2001 that Cisco sales have been higher than $5 billion. The company said it expected revenue to grow 1 to 3 percent in the second quarter. 
 In the first quarter, Cisco saw a slight change in its product sales mix. The company -- built around routers and switches that are used to direct the flow of data -- is making inroads with some newer product lines. The company said that sales from its advanced product group, which makes, among other things, equipment for Internet-based telephone technology and wireless technology, rose to 14 percent of revenue, from 12 percent in the quarter before. 
 At the same time, router sales represented 25 percent of all revenue, compared with 26 percent the quarter before. Sales from switches were 41 percent of revenue compared with 40 percent in the previous quarter.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
The Gucci news looks good for LVMH, but looks can be deceiving.

BYLINE:  By John Tagliabue 

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
AT first blush, the announcement that Tom Ford and Domenico De Sole will be leaving Gucci at the end of April seems like nothing but good news for Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Gucci's archrival in the luxury goods market. 
 "It's a big hit," said a senior Arnault associate. "A lot of Gucci's capital is lost." 
 But some people in the fashion business say that Mr. Arnault and LVMH should enjoy the good news while it lasts. The entire luxury goods sector and not just Gucci, they argue, is facing profound changes that could change the way the industry does business. 
 The Gucci departures are taking place as the first harbingers of a luxury goods springtime are on the horizon, with growth in demand in Asia and the United States. Many companies, including LVMH, are predicting healthy growth, if not perhaps at the 1990's pace, as global tourism recovers and economies in the United States and Japan, voracious consumers of Vuitton bags, Hermes scarves and Gucci suits, reawaken.
 But with sales still relatively stagnant, the cash flow that so inebriated luxury goods groups over the last decade is gone. Moreover, while the luxury goods companies have hunkered down to weather the crisis over the last three years, retail marketing has undergone profound changes.
 To complicate matters, consumers have far more choice, particularly at the lower end of the luxury goods chain, which had the fastest growth in the 1990's. Companies like Gucci and Vuitton democratized the idea of a luxury product for those consumers who could not afford the $4,000 suit but could buy a branded $100 key chain. 
Moreover, new kinds of conspicuous consumption like luxury travel, cooking classes, fitness clubs and cosmetic surgery, even home improvements are competing increasingly with traditional luxury goods for the right to offer consumers emotional satisfaction. 
 For many retailing experts, the challenges confronting the big luxury conglomerates, like LVMH and Gucci, are particularly intractable. 
 "It's the classic Procter & Gamble problem," said Reiner Triltsch, chief international investment officer at WestAM, a Dallas asset management company. "You obviously have to compete for capital expenditures. You cannot concentrate on 20 different brands."
 By contrast, the companies that focus on one brand, like Hermes and Bulgari, "are as consistent as clockwork," he said. "Cash flow is consistent, and that allows them to strengthen." 
 Indeed, the big multibrand conglomerates -- sometimes referred to as the luxury poles -- all face similar conundrums. Each relies largely on a single brand: LVMH on Louis Vuitton, Gucci on Gucci, and Richemont of Switzerland on the jeweler Cartier. While Vuitton and Gucci have been the powerhouses of their respective parents, much of the cash they generate is burned up by less fortunate sisters, like LVMH's Fendi and Yves Saint Laurent at Gucci. With Cartier ailing, growth at Richemont has collapsed this year.
 "I am convinced that one of the lessons of the last three years is probably that the luxury poles are still, maybe more than before, questionable projects," said Armando Branchini, managing director of InterCorporate, a luxury goods consulting firm in Milan. 
 But others say the challenges facing the multibrand conglomerates are not insurmountable. Claudia D'Arpizio, a luxury goods consultant at Bain & Company in Milan, noted that the drive to multiply brands was characteristic of luxury goods groups that were publicly owned. Buying up brands impressed shareholders and the financial community with vigorous growth rates. 
 "Now they realize that while the principal brands keep them growing, it is really difficult to repeat the success story with the other brands," she said.
 But, she added, "it's not impossible."
 Whether LVMH or Gucci is in better condition to face the challenges is an open question but certainly the departures of Mr. Ford and Mr. De Sole seem to put Gucci at a temporary disadvantage. 
 Fashion houses like Gucci live in part from intangibles, like the creative flair of the designers who drive theme. No one fulfilled that quite as successfully over the last decade as Mr. Ford, who took over Gucci with Mr. De Sole in the 1990's when the fabled Florentine fashion house was on the ropes. With Mr. Ford reviving Gucci's flair, and Mr. De Sole its marketing machinery, the two transformed Gucci from a luxury goods has-been to the hot item of the late 1990's. 
 In 1999, impressed with Gucci's turnaround, Mr. Arnault made a run for Gucci, but lost out in a protracted battle with Francois Pinault, who entered the fray as a white knight on Gucci's side. Mr. Pinault, who owns the French retailing group Pinault Printemps-Redoute, was keen on building a multibrand luxury goods group like the one Mr. Arnault had assembled at LVMH. 
 But in a sense, Mr. Pinault was not acquiring Gucci the famous brand but Gucci the work-in-progress under Mr. Ford and Mr. De Sole.
 "He bought a project, and he bought two people with the ability and the skills and capabilities to manage that project," Mr. Branchini said. "Now he is going to change direction, and it is quite a risky situation."
 Yet others point out that great brands often survive their famous creators. While intangibles are crucial to a strong brand, they note, effective marketing and supply infrastructure are equally so.
 Ms. D'Arpizio denied that Mr. Pinault was buying only people and intangibles, insisting that, "he was buying brands." 
 "We have many examples of brands alive without their creators," adding that, "now, the strength is inside the brand."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
With Milton Friedman's ideas now accepted by theorists and policy makers, it's easy to forget how revolutionary they were.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the author of "The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness," published by HarperCollins. E-mail: vpostrel@dynamist.com.

 BODY:
TWENTY-FIVE years ago, I took my first economics class. Like many other college students, I wanted to understand why the economy of our teenage years was such a scary mess, with inflation and rising taxes eroding our parents' paychecks, interest rates soaring and unemployment an ever present threat.
 By my freshman year, inflation had morphed into "stagflation," combining rising price levels with relatively high unemployment. For most economists, stagflation was a puzzle. There was supposed to be a trade-off -- the so-called Phillips curve -- between inflation and unemployment. If you had one, you weren't supposed to have the other. 
The "Great Inflation" of the 1970's challenged and permanently altered economic theory. It vindicated the once-controversial analysis of Milton Friedman, then at the University of Chicago.
"Friedman's monetary framework has been so influential that in its broad outlines at least, it has nearly become identical with modern monetary theory," said the Federal Reserve governor Ben S. Bernanke, at a recent conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. (The full text of his speech is available at www.dallasfed.org/news/research/2003/03ftc--bernanke.pdf.)
 Mr. Bernanke is not a former Friedman student. He did his graduate work at M.I.T. Someone reading Milton Friedman's monetary economics today is likely to miss its significance, Mr. Bernanke noted, much as an apocryphal student called Shakespeare's plays "just a string of quotations."
 "His thinking has so permeated modern macroeconomics that the worst pitfall in reading him today is to fail to appreciate the originality and even revolutionary character of his ideas, in relation to the dominant views at the time that he formulated them," he said.
 Against the conventional wisdom, Mr. Friedman argued that "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon." Inflation had nothing to do with aggressive unions, greedy businesses or even oil cartels -- the bad guys who took the blame in the confusing 1970's. Prices shot up everywhere because the federal government made the supply of money grow faster than the real economy created value. Based on the historical record, he argued, the effects of monetary policy were fairly predictable.
 In a 1970 lecture, "The Counterrevolution in Monetary Theory," Mr. Friedman outlined 11 propositions about how monetary policy affects the economy. All were wildly controversial, almost disreputable, at the time. Most are accepted today.
 The first six propositions described the effects of tightening or loosening the money supply.
 Changing the money supply, Mr. Friedman argued, raises or lowers nominal national income -- production multiplied by the price level -- after six to nine months. That change appears initially in output, so an increase in the money supply spurs production. After another six to nine months, however, prices adjust. Real, as opposed to nominal, income does not change.
 With Mr. Friedman's original caveat that these empirical relationships are not perfect, Mr. Bernanke said, most policy makers and economists today would consider that 1970 description "spot on." A large body of empirical research has confirmed the same general pattern in many different countries.
 More revolutionary still was Mr. Friedman's proposition that monetary policy can affect real output only in the short run. The Phillips curve works only for a few months. Long-term economic growth depends on real factors like innovation, investment and entrepreneurship.
 This proposition "is universally accepted today by monetary economists," Mr. Bernanke said. "When Friedman wrote, however, the conventional view held that monetary policy could be used to affect real outcomes -- for example, to lower the rate of unemployment -- for an indefinite period."
 That belief led to terrible economic policy. Trying to maintain full employment, the Federal Reserve of the 1970's pumped out money faster than the real economy grew. A result, Mr. Bernanke said, was the "Great Inflation of the 1970's -- after the Great Depression, the second most serious monetary policy mistake of the 20th century." 
 Today, most macroeconomists also accept Mr. Friedman's most famous proposition -- that inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. Contrary to what I learned in macroeconomics class, "cost push" inflation was a myth. Pay and price increases did not drive inflation; they reflected it. Americans wanted higher nominal wages and prices to keep up as the real value of each dollar declined.
 To combat cost-push inflation, the Nixon administration imposed wage and price controls in 1971. Various controls, notably on energy prices, lingered throughout the 1970's. But inflation did not go away, because all these policies treated the symptom, not the cause.
 A few of Mr. Friedman's propositions remain subject to debate and research. He contended, for instance, that government deficits cause inflation only if they are financed by creating money. Economists do not yet agree on the exact relation between unsustainable government spending and inflation.
 Mr. Friedman tracked monetary policy by tracking the growth of the money supply. While theoretically sound, that practice has become increasingly difficult. Financial innovations keep changing the definition and growth rate of money.
 Beyond these descriptive propositions, Mr. Friedman's greatest monetarist legacy is a prescriptive one.
 "The most fundamental policy recommendation put forth by Milton Friedman," Mr. Bernanke said, "is the injunction to policy makers to provide a stable monetary background for the economy," avoiding both inflation and deflation.
 "Monetary stability actively promotes efficiency and growth," Mr. Bernanke said. It also makes the economy more resilient, because when people are not afraid of general inflation, they adapt more easily to shocks like rapid jumps in energy prices.
 Over the last two decades, central bankers here and abroad have worked to keep inflation low and stable, and they have largely succeeded. Back in the 1970's, Milton Friedman didn't think that was politically possible. About that one thing, perhaps, he was wrong.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Extends Statehouse Sweeps, but What Do They Mean for '04? 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Forecast as squeakers, the elections for governor in Mississippi and Kentucky turned out to be anything but on Tuesday, with Republicans comfortably on top. Haley Barbour won here by seven percentage points, defeating a Democratic incumbent, and Representative Ernie Fletcher won by 10 in Kentucky, ending 32 years of Democratic reign there.
 After elections last year in which Republicans turned out Democratic governors in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, the latest returns were another indication of the South's rightward march. 
 But even with Arnold Schwarzenegger's recent victory in California, in the recall of its Democratic governor, Gray Davis, Republican Party leaders are hesitant to suggest that statehouse success in 2003 necessarily improves the chances of President Bush's re-election next year. 
"A lot of times the winning party always claims their victories are a precursor," said Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, which now has 29 members. "If we had lost, there would have been a lot of words spoken by the Democratic Party that reflected a lack of popularity of the Bush administration. Republicans won both states, and that is certainly good news for Republicans, but I don't want to claim it'll be a national mandate."
Even Mr. Barbour, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican national chairman, cautioned against drawing larger conclusions, although he could not resist throwing a jab at Democrats.
"I wouldn't read too much into this nationally," Mr. Barbour said at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. "But Democrats who want to hurt President Bush in 2004 always said the best way was to beat Haley Barbour in 2003. Well, Winston Churchill once said there was nothing so exhilarating as to be shot at without results." 
The current Republican chairman, Ed Gillespie, attributed the recent victories to a campaign model "that works," one the party says it has also been using to contrast President Bush with the Democrats running to replace him.
"Republicans attack problems, Democrats attack Republicans," Mr. Gillespie said. "I don't want to overstate things about national impact; governors' races are about states and leadership at the state level. That said, there are things at play, like our positive message versus their negative message, that give us momentum going into 2004." 
For Democrats, the sting of the losses in Mississippi and Kentucky was at least eased by the knowledge that no Democratic presidential nominee was likely to win either state next year anyway. Mr. Bush carried Mississippi in 2000 by 17 points, and Kentucky by 16. And the rousing crowds he drew campaigning in both states last Saturday were ample evidence that his popularity remained high in the South. 
In any case, Democrats scrambled to make the best of it, pointing to other returns. "Last night was a mixed bag for us," said Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic national chairman. "I would love to have kept those two governorships, but we did great in Pennsylvania, and we can't win next year without Pennsylvania."
A battleground state with 21 electoral votes -- and 23 visits so far by President Bush, the most of any state -- Pennsylvania produced a number of victories for Democrats, including John Street's re-election as mayor of Philadelphia. Mr. McAuliffe said those victories offered signs that the state would resist the kind of Republican drift moving through the South.
At the same time, some leading Democrats suggested that the returns last month in California and on Tuesday in Mississippi and Kentucky -- where Mr. Fletcher defeated the Democratic candidate, State Attorney General Ben Chandler -- were actually bad news for President Bush. Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association, maintained that the national economy, moribund until recently, "has triggered a strong anti-incumbent mood in the electorate."
"National Republicans should take no joy in what was really a vote to change the status quo," Mr. Locke added. "This is an unsettled electorate looking for change, and that mood is likely to linger through next year's presidential election."
Some Republicans found that notion preposterous. "Three Republican governors in three weeks," said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority leader. "I've got to tell you, only the makers of the Reagan TV movie could argue that this is somehow bad news for the G.O.P. in 2004."
If in fact there was any bad news for Republicans nationally on Tuesday, there was none here in Mississippi. Ballots were still being counted on Wednesday, but Mr. Barbour had about 53 percent of the vote, to 45 percent for the Democratic incumbent, Ronnie Musgrove.
Befitting his reputation as a master strategist credited with helping engineer the Republican Congressional sweep of 1994, Mr. Barbour managed to overcome the Democratic argument that as a Washington-based operative, he was out of touch with problems facing ordinary Mississippians. Mr. Musgrove placed blame for the state's rising unemployment rate, for instance, on Mr. Bush and his tax policies.
Mr. Barbour, a tireless and garrulous campaigner, convinced voters that his ties to Washington, including friends in the highest of places, would eventually reverse social and economic trends that have left Mississippi suffering.
Indeed, he said, Mr. Bush called him at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, apologizing for not waiting until the result was official but certain nonetheless that he would win.
"He said he hoped to call me to congratulate me," Mr. Barbour said. "But he told me, 'I'm going to bed.' "

	 	 		--------------------	 	

The Vote Elsewhere
(By The Associated Press) -- Among the mayoral elections on Tuesday were those in San Francisco, where City Supervisor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and Matt Gonzalez of the Green Party advanced to a runoff; in Houston, where Bill White, a deputy energy secretary in the Clinton administration, won a runoff spot against City Councilman Orlando Sanchez; and in Indianapolis, where Mayor Bart Peterson, a Democrat, defeated his Republican opponent, Greg Jordan.

HEADLINE: In a 'Jam,' Dean Apologizes for Remarks on Rebel Flag 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN; David M. Halbfinger and Adam Nagourney contributed reporting for this article. 

 BODY:
Howard Dean apologized yesterday for his recent comments about Southerners who display the Confederate flag, saying, "I deeply regret the pain that I may have caused." He said he would lead the nation in a "difficult and painful discussion" about race.
 A day after the issue arose in a Democratic presidential debate, Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, interrupted a planned speech at Cooper Union in Manhattan about campaign finance to invoke the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Abraham Lincoln, and condemn the Confederate flag as " a painful symbol and reminder of racial injustice and slavery." 
 By day's end, in New Hampshire, he added that he also "apologized for any people in the South who thought they were being stereotyped." 
Dr. Dean's remarks came in response to a controversy that began last weekend when he was quoted by The Des Moines Register as saying that he wants "to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks." That quotation was a shorter version of remarks he had made to the Democratic National Committee last winter about the party's need to use an economic appeal to draw Southern white voters back into its fold -- including those "who drive pickup trucks with Confederate flag decals." 
Under attack from other candidates, he then refused to back away from his remarks at a debate in Boston on Tuesday night.
But by yesterday he made clear that he realized that his "clumsy" handling of the issue had become a large problem. In an interview with editors of The New York Times, he spoke of being in a "jam" and a "big contretemps." He used the phrase, "assuming we get through the current unpleasantness."
He said he had been up most of the night pondering the problem, and called former President Jimmy Carter yesterday morning for advice.
At the same time he said his comments had been misconstrued and he did not back away from his conviction that the party had to make inroads with white Southerners noting that the Republicans "have played the race card" since 1968 and the Democrats had to find a way to win them back with issues like health insurance. He insisted "the African-American community gets this."
Throughout the day Dr. Dean, 54, appeared subdued and reflective, a sharp contrast to the defiant tone he struck at Tuesday night's debate.
He said that his main mistake had been not immediately condemning the flag during the debate, and that he had decided to change course as he came to understand that his comments had been personally offensive to two of his rivals, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who is black, and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina.
"When people get in my face, I tend to get in theirs," Dr. Dean said in the interview at The Times. "Al Sharpton was in my face last night and I was not going to step one step, half a step, backwards, and I don't care who's in my face.
"I tend to be reflective rather later than sooner," he added. "Now, unfortunately, we all know that nobody's personality is perfect. So the things that make me a strong candidate are also my Achille's heel."
He said in several interviews that Mr. Edwards' suggestion at the debate that he was being patronizing to the South had played a "significant role" in his decision that he had to speak out further and clarify his views. "I came to the conclusion that he actually had been really wounded, that he felt the patronizing personally," he said at The New York Times.
Dr. Dean's apology quelled the criticism from some of his rivals, and many African-American leaders attributed his gaffes to a lack of communications discipline rather than a deeper misunderstanding of blacks or the South.
Told of Dr. Dean's Cooper Union remarks, Senator Edwards said at an appearance in Concord, N.H., that "it sounds like he said the right thing," but that "what matters is how people across the country respond." 
Another Democratic candidate, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, issued a statement after Dr. Dean's speech, saying, "Rather than politics as usual, Howard Dean should have taken responsibility for his rhetoric and simply said, 'I was wrong.' "
Mr. Kerry's campaign manager, Jim Jordan, said in an e-mail message that the situation is "a completely self-inflicted crisis, and it's highlighted already-growing impressions of a campaign that puts expediency over principle every single time."
Several civil rights leaders and black Democrats who are unaligned in the presidential contest said the apology would likely be sufficient.
"He's probably stopped the hemorrhaging," said Kweisi Mfume, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., adding that Dr. Dean reached out to him on Sunday to put his flag comments into context. "It was important for him to get in front of this issue, lay his soul to bare, explain his context."
The Rev. Joseph Lowery, a founder of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said he would not vote against Dr. Dean because of the misstep, adding, "I think what Dean said was a slip from the lip more than a dart from the heart." 
But Michael Eric Dyson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is a leading black cultural critic, said Dr. Dean came off as defensive and snide during the debate, "exacerbated the situation by waiting until today" to retreat, and still seems "racially insensitive."
"If you say, 'I'm interested in bringing back poor white people, and Southern whites who are disaffected with the Democratic party,' that's fine," Professor Dyson said. "But to make your appeal at the expense of black folks only reinforces the perception that Democrats use black people when it's necessary, but at the same time exploit us when it's convenient."
In his appearance at The New York Times, Dr. Dean spoke at length about issues of race. "The irony of this Confederate flag thing," he said, "is that there has been nobody who has been more outspoken about race on this campaign trail than me," Dr. Dean said. "I talk about affirmative action. I talk about it in ways that nobody else talks about it. I talk about institutional racism.
"Every election in the South is about race and a good many in the North are about race as well," he said, "and until we openly discuss the problems in this country they are not going to go way."
Kurt Schmoke, the dean of Howard University law school, who attended Yale with Dr. Dean and advises him on urban and minority concerns, said that "it's not fatal" but that he hopes his candidate has learned from this to watch his words, particularly as he climbs in the polls.
"What concerned me was his staff up in Vermont reacted by saying, 'Well, he said this before, these guys took him out of context,' " said Mr. Schmoke, the former mayor of Baltimore. "That was the wrong response. The right response was what he finally ended up with today -- wait a minute folks, my heart is in the right place but I chose the wrong words."
Some in the Dean campaign had wanted to stick to today's script, an important announcement about letting supporters vote on whether to abandon the public-financing system.
Even an hour before his Cooper Union appearance, Dr. Dean said he was unsure how or when he would address the flag issue. In addition to President Carter, Dr. Dean consulted yesterday with the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, as well as several African-American labor leaders and elected officials. 
Behind stage moments before noon, aides said, Dr. Dean scribbled down remarks on race, saying his gut told him to go ahead.
"You can blame the media or blame my opponents, but the fact is, I've got to own my own words," Dr. Dean explained yesterday evening in Manchester. "And that's what I decided at about 3 o'clock this morning."
The apology came on the eve of an endorsement vote by the nation's largest and most diverse union, Service Employees' International, which has been leaning toward backing Dr. Dean.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Dean's Remarks on the Confederate Flag"Howard Dean's campaign has come under fire for remarks he has made about the Confederate flag. A look at some of what he has said: FEB. 21, 2003At a Democratic National Committee meeting"I intend to talk about race during this election in the South. The Republicans have been talking about it since 1968 in order to divide us, and I'm going to bring us together. Because you know what? White folks in the South who drive pickup trucks with Confederate flag decals on the back ought to be voting with us because their kids dont have health insurance either, and their kids need better schools too." MARCH 7On the "Iowa Press" television program"Health insurance is an enormous issue. I go to the South and I say, look, I want to talk to white people who drive pickup trucks with Confederate flag decals on the back window, because you ought to be voting with us because your kids dont have health insurance either." SATURDAY, NOV. 1In an article in The Des Moines Register"I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks. We cant beat George Bush unless we appeal to a broad cross-section of Democrats." TUESDAY, NOV. 4During CNN's "Rock the Vote" debate"I'm not going to take a back seat to anybody in terms of fighting bigotry. ... We have to reach out to every single American.

YESTERDAYDuring a speech at Cooper Union"And I do not condone the use of the flag of the Confederate States of America.

HEADLINE: Senate Debate Due on Hotly Contested Internet Tax Bill 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
A long-delayed federal Internet tax bill that would turn a temporary moratorium on taxes on Internet access into a permanent ban is scheduled for debate today on the floor of the Senate.
 The argument over the bill has been as heated as a chat-room brawl. Opponents contend that state coffers will be emptied as more areas of commerce -- like telephone service -- become Internet-based and fall within the ban. "Every time we, in our wisdom, tell a state or a city that it cannot use this tax, all we are doing is increasing the chance that Minnesota or Tennessee will increase some other tax, or fire some teachers or lay off some employees or close some parks," Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said Tuesday on the Senate floor. 
 Supporters argue that the states want to tax every e-mail message, even every electron. The bill, they say, will not have the dire effects that opponents predict. "You now have what amounts to a final assault on the bill," said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who is sponsoring the bill with George Allen, Republican of Virginia.
 Senator Wyden said that his opponents had been predicting "the fall of Western civilization" since the first moratorium passed seven years ago. "Who do you want to believe, the people who were wrong over the last seven years, or the facts?" he asked in a telephone interview.
The only thing that both sides agree on, it seems, is that the bill has nothing to do with banning sales taxes on online purchases. The moratorium bans taxes on Internet access, including high-speed access through telephone digital subscriber lines; "discriminatory" taxes, which include taxes by multiple states on the sales of a single item; and taxes that would treat Internet purchases differently from sales at brick-and-mortar stores. 
 The moratorium, which was passed in 1998 and extended in 2001, expired on Nov. 1. The House has already passed a similar version of the bill. The new bill would take away the right to tax Internet access from a handful of states, including Texas and Wisconsin, which passed such taxes before 1998 and have been allowed to keep collecting those taxes under a grandfather clause. It would also cancel taxes on residential digital subscriber line access being levied by more than 15 states, causing the loss of as much as $80 million a year in total revenue to those states, the Congressional Budget Office said. 
 Bush administration officials weighed in yesterday, urging Congress to pass the bill. "Keeping the Internet free of multiple or discriminatory taxes will help create an environment for innovation and will help ensure that electronic commerce remains a vital, and growing, part of our economy," Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans said in a joint statement. "A permanent moratorium means a permanent victory for American consumers and businesses."
 But state and local governments oppose the bill. David Quam, the director of state-federal relations for the National Governors Association, said that the "the debate is over whether you want to reach into state and local pockets in these difficult fiscal times, to unnecessarily expand the scope of the moratorium to existing state and local taxes." Mr. Quam said that despite assurances from Senator Wyden to the contrary, the bill would help companies evade billions of dollars in state and local taxes on telecommunications and other services. "Our position has always been, if you're going to pre-empt state and local law, then you need to do it precisely, so there are no unintended consequences of that action," he said.
 Senator Alexander has called the bill an unfunded federal mandate because it restricts the ability of states to impose taxes. In his speech Tuesday, he said that he would raise a point of order that would require 51 senators to waive the ban on unfunded mandates and suggested that he might demand a companion law that would use federal money to repay the states for any lost revenue. "If we think it is so important, we should pay the bill," he said.
 Senator Wyden said that the bill would not exempt telecommunications and other services from taxation, and that he had worked with Senator Alexander and the states to write language in the bill to resolve any ambiguity.
 He acknowledged that state and local governments had "very significant financial needs," but said, "they don't come about because of Internet tax policy -- they come about by misguided tax policies put in place by the executive branch and its supporters" and because of a "fumbling economy." 
 States have long wanted to be able to collect taxes from Internet merchants who sell within their borders, just as they have wanted to collect sales taxes on catalog and telephone sales. But under a 1992 Supreme Court decision in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, merchants are only required to collect sales taxes in those states where they have a physical presence, or nexus. 
 "They can't overturn Quill, they can't overturn mail order, they can't overturn phone sales," Senator Wyden said. "They see this as the last cash cow they can possibly milk."

HEADLINE: Credit Agencies Worry About Health of China's Banks 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Responding to hints in recent weeks from senior Chinese financial regulators that another bailout of the country's biggest banks might be needed, two credit rating agencies issued separate reports on Wednesday suggesting that China's previous efforts had not solved the banking system's troubles.
 The ratings agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, said that the banks' troubles had not been resolved by an attempt in 1999 and early 2000 to shift $170 billion in nonperforming loans into asset management companies. The companies resemble the Resolution Trust Corporation that the United States used successfully to dispose of bad loans after the collapse of much of the American savings and loan industry in the late 1980's. 
Moody's has generally been more optimistic than Standard & Poor's about the health of the Chinese economy and its banks, and its statement on Wednesday, although carefully hedged, was noteworthy. "As China continues its reform of the financial sector, the health of the state banks remains a central concern," Moody's said in a report issued in Hong Kong. 
 Standard & Poor's publicly welcomed hints in the last month by Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, and Liu Mingkang, the chairman of the China bank regulatory commission, that the government was looking at ways to shore up the finances of the country's four main banks.
 Ryan Tsang, a banking analyst at the rating agency, said that the percentage of bank loans overdue on principal or interest payments had fallen to 45 percent from 50 percent. But the drop, he said, mainly reflects a huge expansion in new loans that might later go bad, as opposed to a resumption in overdue payments on bad debts.
 "The diluting effect at the moment is more obvious," he said.
 Chinese banks over all, not just the four main banks, lent more in the first seven months of this year than in all of last year. China's efforts to hold down the value of its currency, the yuan, in foreign exchange markets by buying dollars with newly issued yuan have flooded the domestic economy with extra credit. This has happened despite the Chinese central bank's efforts to buy back extra yuan through the sale of special financial contracts to banks.
 The four main banks -- the Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the China Construction Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China -- are government-owned and account for two-thirds of the banking system's assets and nonperforming loans. 
 Beijing has also been looking at ways to sell small stakes in the banks through stock offerings in the hope of introducing some market discipline to the banks, which have suffered from fraud, corruption and poor judgment in lending decisions.
 China's four big banks transferred 19 percent of their loans in 1999 and early 2000 at face value to asset management companies in exchange for these companies' bonds. The specially created government-owned asset management companies have been struggling since then to sell the bad loans even at steep discounts.
 Moody's warned that by the end of last year, bonds from the asset management companies made up 8 percent of the assets of China's four main banks, and produced 10 percent of their net interest income, which for some produces an enhanced accounting profit, but no added cash flow.
 Moody's concluded that while the concept of using asset management companies was sound, "the financial risks which were once thought to have been transferred out of the state banks may in fact be re-emerging, especially if the pace of resolution is slow."

HEADLINE: Fight Over Tips Prolongs Strike at La Caravelle 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Striking workers at the "21" Club and La Caravelle, two top-drawer Manhattan restaurants, reached a tentative labor contract yesterday, but there was one pesky issue that kept the workers out at La Caravelle: the sommelier's share of the tips.
 What that meant was that dozens of striking cooks and waiters continued to chant and picket outside La Caravelle on West 55th Street yesterday because management and labor could not resolve the battle of the wine steward's tips. 
 In what some said was an only-in-New York dispute, La Caravelle's management wanted the sommelier, Andrew Brisker, to get the same percentage of tips as senior waiters. But the waiters howled that management was improperly interfering in what has traditionally been the waiters' prerogative, determining how tips should be shared. The waiters, convinced that the sommelier was getting a sizable salary before tips, insisted that he receive a smaller share of the tips than a busboy. 
"It's absolutely baffling that these workers would lose $200 or $300 for a night's work over this," said Richard Wilsker, the restaurants' main negotiator. But last night the waiters were not backing down in what seemed like a battle not over dollars and cents but over equity and pride. "The sommelier gets too much," said Eduardo Cunha, a Caravelle waiter for two years. "He earns twice as much as the captain."
Just as the waiters said management should not meddle in how the tips were shared, Rita Jammet, the restaurant's co-owner, said the tips dispute should not involve the union, Local 100 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union.
"It's unfair they cut his share by two-thirds and some weeks they even eliminate his share," she said. Mr. Brisker declined to comment.
The two sides reported good news at the bargaining table shortly after midnight yesterday. The "21" Club, La Caravelle and the Four Seasons had reached a basic economic agreement with the union.
Within hours of the deal, union officials began boasting that they had achieved their main goal -- the workers would not have to begin paying premiums toward their health insurance, as those three restaurants had demanded. Management wanted the workers to pay $260 in premiums in the first year of a three-year agreement, $520 in the second year and $780 in the third. Union members voiced fears that if they agreed to begin paying premiums, those amounts would soar in future years.
"There's good news -- there's not going to be any increase in out-of-pocket costs for health coverage," said Brooks Bitterman, the union's research director. The union achieved that goal through a highly unusual twist. It accepted smaller wage increases than those management had proposed before the strike began on Tuesday morning. The agreement calls for cooks and dishwashers to receive weekly raises of $8 in the first year, $7 in the second and $7 in the third. 
Before the strike began, management had offered a $15 weekly raise for cooks and $12 for dishwashers. Most assistant cooks earn $400 to $520 a week, the union said, while most dishwashers earn $280 to $400. 
The union has been seeking to negotiate contracts for 800 workers at 25 restaurants whose contracts expired last Saturday. It has reached agreements at eight of the 25 and is threatening strikes at Gallagher's and the Oyster Bar.

PERSON: Christopher O. Ward 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Higher Profile, and a Smaller Car

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
YOU won't often find Christopher O. Ward, commissioner of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection, traveling around town in the back of a shiny, black car.
 He prefers to drive his own department vehicle: a cute little green car powered partly by electricity. On Tuesday, he hummed over to the Central Park reservoir for an interview, before taking his son, John, 10, to the dentist. 
 Off for Election Day, Mr. Ward, 49, was dressed very Upper West Side: running shoes, jeans and a blazer over a polo shirt. The buildings along Central Park West were shrouded in the morning mist as Mr. Ward and his son walked the rock jetty that traverses the reservoir. "It's called the dividing weir," he reminded his son. 
The department, which manages the city's water supply and wastewater treatment systems, among other things, routinely spends more than a billion dollars a year on construction projects, but its commissioner does not typically enjoy a high profile. How many New Yorkers, for example, remember Mr. Ward's predecessor, Joel Miele, a Queens Republican who kept a pistol strapped to his ankle?
Mr. Ward is a Democrat who was raised in Amherst, Mass., in an academic family. He has a master's degree from Harvard Divinity School. His profile has risen lately, thanks to a busy press office and certain other circumstances, including last year's drought, post-9/11 fears about the watershed's vulnerability to terrorism and several huge projects in the city's water system infrastructure.
Then there was the water main that ruptured last month, flooding much of Washington Heights, and Mr. Ward publicly scolding a water filter company that put ads on city subways suggesting that the city's tap water needed filtering.
The upside to such mishaps, Mr. Ward explained, is that New Yorkers are reminded of their delicate, aging water system and the need to maintain it. The more sympathy for the system, the wishful thinking goes, the less resistance there will be to rate increases needed to upgrade it.
"I don't think New Yorkers are aware of their infrastructure," Mr. Ward said, leaning against a huge pipe in the reservoir's south pump house, the one used in the climactic scene in "Marathon Man," when Dustin Hoffman forces Laurence Olivier to eat diamonds.
"It's a difficult agenda to keep them focused on for a long time. But once they see it's in jeopardy, they begin to appreciate it."
MR. WARD talks and looks like a man who is constantly thinking on a larger scale. The city consumes 1.3 billion gallons of water a day, from the 19 reservoirs and three lakes over the roughly 2,000 square miles of watershed land in the Catskills and the Hudson River Valley. The 160-year-old water system is a subterranean network of tunnels with thousands of miles of pipelines.
The water system is byzantine and idiosyncratic, which is not unlike the bureaucracy that infrastructure projects must make their way through in New York City. Mr. Ward learned much about that system as a planner for the city's Economic Development Corporation and then for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
"I became known as a guy who gets big things done," said Mr. Ward, who proceeded to rattle them off: getting Brooklyn's Metrotech project going; getting community approval in southeast Queens for the AirTrain to Kennedy International Airport; getting commuters to "accept" the fare increases on tunnels and bridges; getting a project under way to build a filtration plant under part of the Mosholu Golf Course in the Bronx by finding "the perfect solution for everyone."
After working five years at the Port Authority, Mr. Ward interviewed with Mr. Bloomberg in April 2002, for the environmental protection post.
"He was fascinated with the intricacies of how we got big projects done at Port Authority and how we got people to accept things they initially don't want to pay for," recalled Mr. Ward, whose speech has the same trace of accent as that of Mr. Bloomberg, who grew up in suburban Boston. "I guess we hit it off fairly quickly. I was hired a week later."
Mr. Ward created a capital improvement program -- $16 billion over a decade to upgrade the water system, including more construction on Water Tunnel No. 3, a project that began 33 years ago and is expected to cost up to $6 billion. In Westchester, he is planning to build a pipeline to the city as well as a plant that would use ultraviolet light to treat water for harmful bacteria.
Mr. Ward revamped the agency's watershed police force, long criticized as inadequate, and selected his own candidate (not the person Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the environmental attorney, was pressuring him to select) to run it. By managing to meet federal clean-water guidelines, the agency has avoided having to construct a $6 billion filtration plant upstate.
Mr. Ward, after a stint working on a Texas oil rig, enrolled in divinity school but stopped short of his doctoral degree. He wrote his master's thesis on Walter Rauschenbush, a Baptist minister who preached that salvation comes through effective social reform. He lives on the Upper West Side with his wife Pamela, their son, John, and daughter, Kate, 15.
Mr. Ward was working for the Port Authority during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and, while rushing with colleagues to a command center, was saved by an underpass when 1 World Trade Center fell. He has no nightmares or need for counseling, he said, only "a sense of lasting sorrow."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 17, 2003

 CORRECTION:
The Public Lives profile on Nov. 6, about Christopher O. Ward, commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, referred imprecisely to a 1976 film's use of the Central Park reservoir pump house, where he was interviewed. Although the climactic scene of "Marathon Man" was set there, it was filmed in a reproduction at Paramount Studios in Hollywood.

HEADLINE: Footing the Bill For Computer Lab 

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY SELINGO

 BODY:
FOR Nancy Couto, the director of technology for the Armada school district in suburban Detroit, walking into a computer lab at the high school is like stepping back in time. There, beat-up machines still run Windows 95 and barely chug along on 120-megahertz processors and 16 megabytes of memory, a tiny fraction of what even the most basic new desktop comes with these days.
 It has been seven years since voters approved a bond issue that bought many of the 750 computers that sit in nine labs across the district today. With a bare-bones budget and school officials unwilling to ask voters to borrow money again, Ms. Couto has had to scavenge parts from dead computers to repair problems with the machines that are still hanging on. 
 "They're so old we can't even buy parts for them anymore," Ms. Couto said. "I tell teachers not to shut them down after class. It takes five minutes just to boot them back up, and when you're in class, you just don't have that kind of time." 
With states facing big budget deficits because of a long period of weak economic growth, public schools have been forced to tighten their spending, often choosing to pay only for basic services and not for what they see as luxury items, like new computers. One result is outmoded equipment that makes it hard for teachers to use technology in their lessons or to engage students who have become accustomed to faster computers at home.
Rather than wait for the budget situation to improve, some cash-strapped schools are asking for money from parents' groups -- including foundations established expressly to help pay for technology purchases -- to buy computers. Other districts are looking for donations of used equipment from local businesses and colleges.
"The bar is higher for technology in the schools," said Peter Grunwald, president of Grunwald Associates, a consulting firm in Burlingame, Calif., that focuses on school technology. "They are operating in an environment of expectations that is formed by students who get to play with everything in their own homes." 
The budget cuts, which have also reduced dollars for support staffs and teacher training, could not have come at a worse time, Mr. Grunwald said. "School districts were finally turning their attention to how to use all this stuff in the classroom."
Outdated computers are usually acceptable for the lower grades, where they can be used for basic tasks like word processing. But teaching advanced applications to older students with aging machines is nearly impossible. Thomas Watchorn, a computer teacher at the middle school in Ms. Couto's district, said he had given up on the desktop computers in his lab for video editing or Web design. On most days, he is happy if the machines simply function. "I never have 30 computers that exactly work the way they are supposed to," he said. Screen colors change unexpectedly, programs shut down without warning, and machines crash. 
One of the labs in Armada Middle School is so riddled with problems that the computers there are not used at all. Mr. Watchorn said he wondered how long it would be before his lab suffered the same fate. "If we're lucky, maybe two more years," he said.
Given the conditions under which school computers operate -- multiple users throughout the day, some of them less than gentle -- the machines never last as long as the average home or office desktop. Ideally, schools need to replace equipment at least every four to five years, school technology directors agree. But that schedule is usually only met with an infusion of cash, typically through a bond issue for technology or for a new school. 
Nearly half the 1,100 computers in the public schools in Fitchburg, Mass., are less than four years old, thanks to money furnished to build a new high school that opened there in 2000. But the warranty on the high school computers expires in June, and "then we'll be in real trouble," said Art Newcombe, the district's director of technology. 
Elsewhere in the district, most of the computers are five to seven years old. Mr. Newcombe's budget has been cut by $200,000, or 84 percent, over the last three years, and many of the technology grants he has received are for teacher training, not new equipment. 
Like technology directors in other districts, Mr. Newcombe is trying to get more out of what he has by relying on networked computers. Instead of buying new desktops, some schools have opted to buy servers, which cost about $5,000 each and provide the needed disk space for 40 or 50 outdated computers, as well as a connection to a common printer. "Servers expand the life of our computers and give us more versatility," Mr. Newcombe said.
Even so, with state lawmakers looking to pinch every dollar possible, putting budgets in constant flux, some school officials are reluctant to begin the often long process of purchasing new equipment. In New York last year, for instance, Gov. George E. Pataki proposed eliminating a state program that provided as much as 50 percent of the cost of new computers. The legislature later preserved the program, but not before some school districts decided to delay their technology plans. 
"A lot of schools were in no man's land," said Pete Reilly, the director of the Lower Hudson Regional Information Center, a consortium of 62 school districts north of New York City. "Without that state money, there was no way they could have afforded to buy that equipment." 
Faced with that uncertainty, many schools have decided to bypass state and local lawmakers altogether to subsidize their technology purchases. Some have turned to their own private nonprofit foundations, a new kind of parent organization that has gained in popularity in recent years, particularly in wealthier districts. The foundations help pay for items like playground equipment, music and art classes and technology. 
The Mount Laurel Public Education Fund in New Jersey, for example, donates $30,000 annually to the Mount Laurel school district, most of which is used for technology. "Sure the schools could survive without our money, but you could always have better equipment and better education," said Kevin Scarborough, the president of the foundation. It was created in 1994 and raises most of its funds from an annual golf tournament. Now its leaders are considering art and sports-memorabilia auctions to increase their donation to the schools. "Quite frankly, the better the education system, the better the town, the better the property values," Mr. Scarborough said. 
Although the money from the parents foundation is a drop in the district's $900,000 annual technology budget, "it's something I count on every year," said Ken Ruhland, an assistant superintendent in Mount Laurel. Because the donation, which this year paid for interactive whiteboards, comes in the fall, well after the district has planned its other computer purchases, it allows officials to buy "the latest in technology," Mr. Ruhland said. 
In other districts, officials are looking for donations of used equipment. When elected officials in the town of Mansfield, Mass., opposed a $200,000 request for new computers last year, Lincoln Lynch, the assistant superintendent of the 5,000-student school district, sent 300 letters to colleges and businesses in the region asking for their old machines. He has since received 346 computers. Students and local retirees refurbished about 250 of them and placed them in classrooms and labs, with the rest used for spare parts. 
To control the cost of overhauling the used computers -- a factor that leads many schools to refuse to accept second-hand computers -- Mr. Lynch limits his donations to Pentium II computers in groups of 12 or more. "We need computers, businesses and colleges need to get rid of hazardous waste, and colleges need students to be trained using the latest technology," said Mr. Lynch, who estimates that he has saved at least $150,000 by using donated machines. "To me, it's a win-win situation."
But not everyone sees it that way. Howie Schaffer of the Public Education Network, which coordinates community groups involved with schools, said that gifts from foundations and donations of used equipment allow schools to shirk their duties. "The fact of the matter is they are taking away a very critical district responsibility, and it will be almost impossible to give it back to them," Mr. Schaffer said.

HEADLINE: Dominican-Made Powder Remedy Is Poisonous, Health Officials Say 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
A powder sold to Dominicans for years as a remedy for everything from body odor to foot fungus is highly poisonous, health officials warned yesterday, and New York City is trying to persuade botanicas, the herbal medicine shops that cater to Hispanic communities, to stop selling it.
 The substance, litargirio, contains high levels of lead, which can cause irreversible brain damage when it enters the bloodstream. Several companies in the Dominican Republic make it, distributing it as a yellow or orange powder in cellophane packets, and some have exported it to the United States for years. The powder is generally sprinkled on the skin, where it is not readily absorbed into the system, but once it is on the hands it can be ingested by accident. 
 Of eight botanicas in Washington Heights and the Bronx checked recently by the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, five carried litargirio, the health commissioner, Thomas R. Frieden, said yesterday at a news conference in Washington Heights. Officials said the powder was also sold at some bodegas, pharmacies and beauty supply stores.
"There is absolutely no health benefit from using it, only danger," Dr. Frieden said. "If you're using it, stop right away, and go to a doctor to get a blood test for lead. If you have any of it, call 311, and we'll come and get it."
Litargirio is just a small piece of a vast economy of traditional ethnic remedies sold in little shops around the city, a trade conducted in various languages and without much official oversight. In Chinese neighborhoods earlier this year, stores that stock folk cures did a brisk business in herbal concoctions said to ward off SARS.
The unregulated trade in immigrant communities is not limited to curatives. City health officials said they had found unsafe levels of lead in imported cosmetics and ceramic pots sold in some areas.
There are so many such products being imported that Dr. Frieden said he was not surprised that the danger of litargirio had escaped official notice in this country, though it has been sold here for decades.
Moises Perez, executive director of Alianza Dominicana, a community service group, said that litargirio was widely used by Dominicans as a burn remedy and as a tonic for sore feet, among other things, but that no one knew how widely because it is unregulated. "It was news to us that it was dangerous, and that it had lead content," said Mr. Perez, who joined Dr. Frieden at the news conference. "But when we talked about it, everyone on my staff knew about it, knew someone who had used it."
Litargirio is legal because, until recently, the government was not aware of it, officials said. Now, the federal Food and Drug Administration is considering banning it.
City officials stressed yesterday that lead paint remained the main source of lead poisoning in New York, far ahead of litargirio. They said there were no particular cases they could attribute to litargirio. Dr. Frieden said that except in extreme cases, lead poisoning had no obvious symptoms, making it very hard to detect without a blood test.
The health officials said that they sent letters to stores several days ago asking them not to sell the powder, and that most of the businesses were cooperating.
At about 15 shops canvassed by a reporter in Washington Heights, where thousands of Dominicans live, merchants said that while they had heard of litargirio and knew of its use among Dominicans, they had never sold it. Workers and customers at several stores said a botanica at 182nd Street and Audubon Avenue sold it. But at that shop, a dank place lined with containers, a woman and a man who were separating dried plants near packets of powders insisted that they had never heard of litargirio.
"We don't know what that is, and we don't have it," the woman, who would not give her name, said in Spanish.
At a nearby pharmacy on St. Nicholas Avenue, a clerk said: "That's something they used back in the Dominican Republic. I've heard about it here, but not as much."
Litargirio first came to the attention of public health officials a few months ago in Rhode Island, when several people -- including adolescents who used it as a deodorant -- were found to have severe cases of lead poisoning. Some had lead levels in their blood above 40 micrograms per deciliter, four times the threshold for lead poisoning.
The F.D.A. looked into the matter and issued an advisory last month, warning people not to use the product.
In Rhode Island, officials found that one brand of litargirio was 79 percent lead. In New York, city officials said that the samples they found all had significant lead content, and that the highest was 42 percent.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by Times critics of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Art Fair

PRINT FAIR, Seventh Regiment Armory, Park Avenue and 67th Street, (212) 674-6095, through Sunday. If you appreciate fine art prints, you should not miss this show. Always a superior production, the International Fine Print Dealers Association's annual fair regularly offers a terrific abundance of graphic skill, ingenuity and imagination. In its 13th incarnation 87 dealers will display everything from Rembrandt and Durer to Picasso, Chuck Close and young, emerging contemporaries. The prices are as low as a few hundred dollars and as high as $1 million. Hours: today and tomorrow, noon to 7 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $15. (Ken Johnson).

Museums

* "BESIDE 'THE ROSE': SELECTED WORKS BY JAY DeFEO," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Feb. 29. The Bay Area legend Jay DeFeo spent eight years painting "The Rose," which accumulated nearly a ton of pigment, built up at its thickest to 11 inches. This show includes 25 works from a career that spanned 40 years, out of which "The Rose" was only the most conspicuous part. Weight, scale, material experimentation, surface modulation, muted color and centripetal form: these were among the conceptual through-lines of DeFeo's art, with mystical ideas conveyed (but never stated outright) via transparent signs of physical exertion. "The Rose" is like a mandala. It is also an artifact of intractable effort, with a beauty that you can appreciate only when you stand in front of it and see how light plays across its face, in which there seem to be buried pentimenti of color. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50 (Michael Kimmelman).

* "EL GRECO," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 11. The world is full of second-class El Grecos, but they are not in this first-class show. The portraits are fresh, true to life and understated. Elsewhere, El Greco emotes. The pitch hardly varies or drops. It's no wonder people tend to fall in love with him when they are young. Modern artists especially love him, as if he were a protomodernist. As the Belgian painter Luc Tuymans says of El Greco's work: "Everything goes upward. That's its mystical meaning. It's about the evaporation of material life." The show is also gorgeously installed. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Kimmelman).

* "PHILIP GUSTON," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 4. A handsome, eloquent retrospective. Even now the late pictures, from the 1970's, have a shock value nearly unsurpassed in recent art. Guston let loose the demons and out they tumbled, like clowns from a Volkswagen. But in crucial ways, as this show demonstrates, Guston's work didn't change as much as people first thought. The transitional decade leading up to the late work may be Guston's most fascinating and underrated: soulful abstractions that have the rough, barely muffled anger of raised voices approaching from the other side of a closed door. Then the door bursts open. Just before he died, Guston painted a sweet, pathetic head, like a bandaged Olmec rock, gazing dubiously up a rubbly hill. It is his self-portrait as Sisyphus: the artist, an eternal pessimist, hoping against hope, awaits the avalanche that we can't yet see tumbling toward him. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

* "HUNT FOR PARADISE: COURT ARTS OF IRAN, 1501-1576," Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, through Jan. 18. Islam is constantly in the news now, but exhibitions of Islamic art are rare. This international loan show, of exceptional beauty, features objects from the Safavid dynasty, which began as a Sufi order and ended up ruling an empire. In the process, it developed an exquisite court art, which is sampled here. Included are pages from the great Book of Kings painted for Shah Tahmasp, a famous carpet from the Poldi Pezzoli Museum in Milan and an even more beautiful one from Boston. The piece de resistance is a glorious, mint-condition silk applique hanging, hidden away in Hungary and being exhibited for the first time in nearly a century. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; students and 65+, $5 (Holland Cotter).

* "THE JEWISH JOURNEY: FREDERIC BRENNER'S PHOTOGRAPHIC ODYSSEY," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 11. Following the tangled trails of the Jewish diaspora over 25 years in more than 40 countries, the French photographer Frederic Brenner has photographed factory workers in Birobidzhan, Russia; sellers of Christian souvenirs in St. Peter's Square; village women in the mountains of Ethiopia; a wealthy merchant of Calcutta; and countless other examples of Jews who have developed roots in countries around the world. His intent, he writes, was "to document these permutations of survival in exile before they disappeared," and what he found inevitably poses the questions, what is a Jew and who are "the Jews"? Stereotypes tend to be dispelled by those who pass before his camera. The superb quality of his photographs, not only in their conception and composition but also in their technical finish, make this a show that demands a visit. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; students and 62+, $3 (Grace Glueck).

* "PETRA: LOST CITY OF STONE," American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100 (through July 6). Petra, an ancient city in what is now the Jordanian part of the Negev desert, was at its zenith from the first century B.C. to the third century A.D. Prosperous, safe and abundantly supplied with water, it was the center of bustling trade in incense, ivory, textiles and other precious goods that flowed through it by camel caravan from points east to the Mediterranean. And it was a highly sophisticated cultural crossroads whose inhabitants carved from rock not only a lively metropolis but also a necropolis of monumental tombs for their kings and leaders. While learned diggers are still uncovering its ruins, this show, said to be the first cultural collaboration between Jordan and the United States, offers a generous glimpse of Petra's vibrant civilization through art objects, architectural elements, photographs and film. The installation, set up with the museum's usual expertise and helpful graphics, is one of the busiest around, but undaunted, Petra comes through. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Timed tickets to the exhibition are $19; $16.50 for students and 60+; $13 for children under 12 (Glueck).

* "JAMES ROSENQUIST: A RETROSPECTIVE," Guggenheim Museum, Fifth Avenue at 88th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Jan. 25. Notwithstanding the enormous size of many of his paintings, Mr. Rosenquist is a haiku master of the American psyche. Intermittently great, his show is spaciously installed but too big. He is an uneven genius. The early works look as good as ever. His lesser-known forays into sculpture and mixed media, a selling point for the show, don't serve him well here. Invaluable are the collages on which he based many paintings, tools of his trade that demonstrate his process of constructing a work, which, contrary to what you might think, is not mechanical but intuitive. Some of the recent works, with their confetti entanglements of cosmic scenery, fish and flowers, technically adept and erratically magnificent, have something of the psychedelic look of 60's commercial art. They can seem dated in a way the classic paintings refuse to be. A different possibility is that, as before, it will take time to catch up with Mr. Rosenquist, who still has a restless imagination, huge energy and an uncanny knack for spotting how two unlikely things go together. Hours: Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $8 (Kimmelman).

* SCHOENBERG, KANDINSKY AND THE BLUE RIDER, Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, through Feb. 12. Did Arnold Schoenberg's controversial atonal music help Wassily Kandinsky break through to what he called "pure painting" in works like "Sketch for Composition V" from 1911? Perhaps. With paintings, musical scores, concert programs and photographs, this exhibition explores the mostly long-distance friendship between two giants of the early 20th-century avant-garde, and also includes works by other painters in Kandinsky's art collective, the Blue Rider (a fabulous landscape by Gabriele Munter, for example). But its visual coherence comes mostly from Schoenberg's aberrant lugubrious little paintings -- mostly self-portraits that are variously outsiderish, semi-abstract or conventionally representational. They flit in and out of the more stringently Modernist efforts like double agents, lagging behind, then zooming ahead, and have an inadvertent radicality that still astounds. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m.; Fridays, to 3 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7.50 (Roberta Smith).

* "TURNING POINT: ORIBE AND THE ARTS OF 16TH-CENTURY JAPAN," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 11. A tsunami in a tea bowl; that was Japan in the late 16th century. The social and political tempests were very real. So were the tea bowls, funky, wild-style, fanatically valued little things that distilled the self-image of the Momoyama (1573-1615) period. This carefully shaped show of modest-size objects focuses on one of the era's most dynamic figures, the warrior and cultural arbiter Furuta Oribe, who directly or indirectly had a catalytic effect on art, particularly art associated with that most sacramental of all intimate social events, the tea ceremony. The show has dozens of funky-beautiful ceramic tea vessels in the squashed, pulled and racked Oribe style, along with resplendent genre paintings and texiles. Several objects will be rotated out, and new ones added, on Dec. 3. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

Galleries: 57th Street

JAMES BROOKS, Artemis, Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444, through Nov. 15. Rugged yet lyrical paintings from the 1960's and 70's by one of Abstract Expressionism's more self-effacing personalities: brushed, dripped and poured in unabashedly rich colors, Brooks's canvases have a kind of slowly simmering spontaneity. They are full of art-historical echoes -- Miro, Matisse, de Kooning, Motherwell, Helen Frankenthaler -- and they have an infectious spirit of hedonistic optimism. (Johnson).

* SALLY MANN, "Last Measure," Edwynn Houk, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 750-7070, through Nov. 15. In this elegaic visit to Civil War battlefields, Ms. Mann suggests the earth and its relationship to mortality, producing a group of retro-looking, painterly photographs whose minimal but eloquent imagery has the charge of somber poetry. The prints, blurred, often hazy and streaked and spotted with points of light, reflect the technical crudeness of the old camera equipment used by Mathew Brady and Alexander Gardner nearly 150 years ago in the Civil War (Glueck).

Galleries: SoHo

JAN GROOVER, Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 431-0166, through Nov. 15. Ms. Groover, the Morandi of photography, continues to produce still lifes that are rigorously formal and evocatively enigmatic. Set against disappearing black backgrounds, her painted bottles, pieces of fruit and swatches of rumpled fabric gather into carefully arranged groups in which subtle relationships of color and texture are brought out by a cool, clear light (Johnson).

PHILIP GUSTON, BRUCE NAUMAN, RAYMOND PETTIBON, Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212) 925-4338, through Dec. 21. Converging from three directions -- Abstract Expressionism, Process Art and California Pop -- three artists arrive at a zone of mordant existentialism. Consisting almost entirely of black-and-white prints, the exhibition sets up an absorbing, triangular conversation among Guston's studio nightmares, Mr. Nauman's harsh wordplay and Mr. Pettibon's mix of hare-brained erudition and comic-book illustration (Johnson).

MICHAEL HEIZER, Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, through Nov. 15. A sculptor known for his immense earthworks is here represented by four dryly analytic, gallery-scale works from the late 1960's and 70's. Two circular paintings have curved or angular cutouts, setting up a paradoxical interplay of the positive and the negative. A stone sculpture consists of a circle and sections of circles in smooth pink granite. And a wide, near-Minimalist painting offers a vaguely architectonic composition of rectangles (Johnson).

CHRISTINE HILL, "Home Office," Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, through Nov. 15. Ms. Hill, a performance artist and conceptualist, has set up a "home office" for running a company called Volksboutique. Every day the artist is there at her desk managing whatever it is she does. Five open steamer trunks neatly display accouterments of her different jobs: reception, management, accounting, public relations and production. Whether this is earnest social activism, witty social satire or thecanny marketing of Ms. Hill herself is something to ponder (Johnson).

ALEX KATZ, "Cartoons," Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through Nov. 15. "Cartoons" in this case refers to an old master technique for transferring images to canvas, wall or panel. Mr. Katz's elegant charcoal drawings of trim, good-looking people on large sheets of brown paper are richly atmospheric, in part because of the burnt sienna pigment that he dusts over the fine perforations that follow the drawing's contours. Seeping through the pinpricks, the brown dust creates a ghost of the drawing on the underlying canvas for the painter (Johnson).

"READING BETWEEN THE LINES," Wooster Arts Space, 147 Wooster Street, (212) 777-6338, through Nov. 22. A six-woman show about meaning in art, organized by Joyce Kozloff. The best works are Julia Randall's grotesquely erotic, hyper-realistic tongues drawn in colored pencil. Also included are Ann Messner's floor mats branded with portentous texts by Edward Said, Salman Rushdie and Susan Sontag; Mira Schor's word paintings; Judith Henry's photographs of pedestrians mixed with brief quotes from their comical conversations; Barbara Zucker's steel cutouts based on wrinkles in women's faces and bodies; and Jeannie Crosby's cut-paper Rococo works hinting at sex and violence (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

DAVID KIMBALL ANDERSON, "Winter Tracks," Linda Durham, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 337-0025, through Nov. 27. Mr. Anderson, a West Coast sculptor who is 57, produces an intriguing, curiously moody blend of Modernism and kitsch. A rough, glassy, pale green surfboard hovers near the floor within a square framework of industrial steel parts; a pedestal sculpture mixes rusted steel Cubism, fallen leaves cut from steel and a small, glowing red electric light; and two plywood A-frame houses have roofs piled high with snow made of fiberglass and gloppy resin, a grungy winter fantasy (Johnson).

ADAM FUSS, Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212) 242-7727, through Nov. 15. Childhood and death preoccupy this British-born photographer, who has come up with one of the season's more bizarre shows. Each in a group of daguerreotypes with mirrored surfaces presents a memento mori in the form of an eerily cheerful skull. Look at it and your face becomes part of the image. In a lengthy series of "gravestone cameos," fashioned into the ovoid shapes affixed to cemetery headstones, each bears a childhood image of Mr. Fuss. But the piece de resistance is a life-size sculpture of him as a toddler, clad in a fluffy white snowsuit made of ice. His technical tricks are impressive, but substance is apparently not a large issue (Glueck).

STEFAN KURTIN, "Something to Believe In," Alexander & Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, at 18th Street, (212) 367-7337, through Nov. 22. The modernistic architectural banalities painted by Mr. Kurtin, composed of modular bays, glass walls, picture windows and white or pastel exteriors, represent the house as a locus for middle-class hopes and dreams. Lush vegetation overcomes the starkness of these unpeopled housescapes, which are prettily tricked out with gold bronze paint and often overlaid with finely painted decorative screens that resemble grillwork. One work departs from this format: tucked into the foliage are birds, snakes, airplanes, pets, cottages, idols, mushrooms -- and pistols! It could be a satirical statement about the indiscriminate equations of the American mind-set (Glueck).

TAYLOR McKIMENS, "Day Old Bread," Clementine, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-5937,through Nov. 15. This young follower of R. Crumb has an amusing way with the comic abjection of everyday objects, which he paints in sickly pastels on shaped pieces of paper. He pictures hairy, slovenly people in their underwear -- in a broken-down house sculpture -- but there's more personality in the giant bologna sandwich covering one wall and smaller images like the spilled milkshake, the glasses with a shattered lens, the gnarly hot dog on white bread with a worm of mustard on it, the dripping pink soap bar and the melting ice cube (Johnson).

"MOTI MENTALI: MIRRORING VICTORIAN AND CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHY," Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-3363, through Nov. 15. Two eminent English Victorians (Lewis Carroll and Julia Margaret Cameron) and three present-day women (Rineke Dijkstra, Ingar Krauss and Hellen van Meene) find common ground in suggestively enigmatic portraiture focused on girls, young women or androgynous teenagers. It is an interesting meditation on the timeless and the time-bound (Johnson).

"MY PEOPLE WERE FAIR . . . " Team Gallery, 527 West 26th Street, (212) 279-9219, through Nov. 15. This messy, intermittently exciting and irritating 39-artist show, organized by the independent curator Bob Nickas, ranges from things blatantly offensive and inept to things of genuine beauty, like Lucky de Bellevue's royal blue pipe-cleaner sculpture or the finely drawn hippie-visionary cartoons by Jeff Davis. It also spans some 40 years of bohemian nonconformity, from pioneers like Jack Smith and Paul Thek to newcomers like Paul P. and Jules de Balincourt (Johnson).

GEORGE NICK, "Plein-Air Meditations," Fischbach, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 759-2345, through Nov. 15. Mr. Nick, who studied with Edwin Dickinson at the Brooklyn Museum of Art School in the 1950's, has been painting buildings in Boston with painterly verve and a keen eye for light for many years. Highlights here include pictures of Victorian town houses now occupied by fancy boutiques and a Hopperesque winter scene of an old rambling suburban house raked by a chilly afternoon sun (Johnson).

ERNESTO PUJOL, "Silence of Songbirds," Ramis Barquet, 532 West 24th Street, (212) 675-3421, through Nov. 15. A sculptor known for metaphorically loaded assemblages about sex, identity and history meditates on captivity in a series of large-format color photographs and a video of caged canaries. In the back room is an installation of smaller photographs, drawings of birds on Spanish dictionary pages and actual cages (Johnson).

JULIAN SCHNABEL, "New Indian Paintings and Selected Sculpture," PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-7000, through Nov. 16. The artist's talent for enlarging upon existing paintings and then disfiguring -- "Schnabelizing" -- them with abstract blurs is blandly recapitulated in canvases based on George Catlin's 19th-century paintings of American Indian chiefs. The bulky morose bronze sculptures from the mid-1980's are blatant instances of raging artistic ego made three-dimensional (Smith).

JESSICA STOCKHOLDER, "Table Top Sculptures," Gorney Bravin & Lee, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-8372, through Nov. 15. This two-for-one show contrasts the domestic and commercial by juxtaposing a stage-set living room, hung salon style with work by the artist and 30 colleagues, with a white cube presentation of her latest excursions into Color Field Assemblage. Given the domestic complications and quirky formal resolutions that abound in Ms. Stockholder's work, the homey installation, while generous in spirit, seems both redundant and undigested (Smith).

GORDON TERRY, "The Supernatural World in Which I Am Professionally Involved," Mike Weiss, 520 West 24th Street, (212) 691-6899, through Nov. 15. With their candy colors and swirly concentric rings or blobby cellular dots, Mr. Terry's puddles of paint on glossy plastic panels suggest psychedelic spontaneity. Yet the way they are arranged, like stickers for sale in an East Village boutique, bespeaks the overwhelming order of modern industrial economics. A throwback to the Neo-Geo-style commodity critique of the 1980's, his hyper-slick work elicits nostalgia more than sharpened critical consciousness (Johnson).

"TRILOGY," Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, (212) 645-1701, through Nov. 15. This selection of works by the Dadaists Francis Picabia, Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp is not the best introduction to any of them, but fans will appreciate the show. Duchamp's retrospective in miniature, "The Green Box," is always good to revisit and his delicate etchings from the 60's are interesting. Picabia's mysteriously ham-fisted works are worth puzzling over. And Ray's small photographic portraits and snapshots of Surrealist luminaries have historical resonance (Johnson).

SARAH BRAMAN AND BRIAN BELOTT, Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, through Nov. 30. These artists were made for each other, and for this moment of psychedelically flavored, busywork formalism in art. Ms. Braman's abstract geometric sculpures are like giant crystals in formation, one constructed from painted cardboard, the other from plexiglass. Mr. Bellot's collages fill the gallery walls. Most are paper-on-paper using clips from magazines, food wrappers, cartoons and children's books, with the occasional addition of paint, fabric and kitty litter. The ingredients join to create dreamlike landscapes, part fairy tale, part science fiction, though a little too weird to be utopian (Cotter).

* "DL: THE 'DOWN LOW' IN CONTEMPORARY ART," Longwood Art Gallery, Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture, 450 Grand Concourse, near 149th Street, the Bronx, (718) 401-7866, through Nov. 15. Longwood, housed for years in an old public school building in the Bronx, has moved to Hostos College. The move seems like a smart one, and is bound to have a salutory effect on a neighborhood that has begun to attract young artists and new galleries. The kickoff group strikes a scrappy, enterprising note by addressing a subject that the art world has pretty much overlooked: the African-American and Latino gay subculture referred to as the "down low." The show includes familiar artists -- Glenn Ligon, Kori Newkirk, Susan Smith-Pinelo -- but is notable for introducing a host of new ones, several of them making New York debuts. Karlos Carmaco, Alex Donis, Terence Koh, Ivan Monforte and Gigi Otalvaro-Hormillosa are some of the names to track (Cotter).

* "EVERYTHING MATTERS: PAUL KOS, A RETROSPECTIVE," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 6. Mr. Kos's name rings too few bells here. He helped germinate the Bay Area Conceptual movement that pioneered video, performance and installation art in the late 1960's and early 70's. The spirit of his work is lighthearted and sly. One of his best early videos, from 1974, was shot in Wyoming: "Pilot Butte/Pilot Light" switches back and forth between that butte and Mr. Kos fashioning a lens out of a block of ice (you see him spinning the block on the inside of the lid ofa pot to get the proper curvature), then focusing sunlight through the ice to spark kindling. The constant is Mr. Kos's catholic approach to materials. He balances a candle and a bell on the tip of a broomstick, which he discovered one day would stand up on its own if he jammed the business end of the broom against the floor just right. Better late than never to remind New Yorkers that some of what we take to be fresh or our own discovery has been going on for a long time elsewhere (Kimmelman).

VINCENT LONGO, "Reflections on Abstraction," Hunter College Times Square Gallery, 450 West 41st Street, (212) 772-4991, through Nov. 22. A five-decade 160-painting retrospective celebrates Mr. Longo's retirement after 35 years of teaching at Hunter College. Starting out under the influence of Abstract Expressionism, Mr. Longo turned to the grid and never looked back. His evolutionary exploration of the tactile, optical and spiritual possibilities is consistently engaging all the way through (Johnson).

* NASREEN MOHAMEDI, Talwar, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096, through Nov. 20. Mohamedi (1937-1990) was born in Pakistan, spent time in London and Paris, and taught art in Baroda, India. She is best known for linear drawings that suggest perspectival Agnes Martins floating in the fourth dimension. This show presents her photographs from the 1960's and 70's. Abstracted images of places and things -- Islamic architecture; painted directional markings on Japanese streets; ocean swells after a storm -- have clear connections to her drawings and reflect an artist who broke with essentialist ideas of what Indian art should look like, engaged with the advanced international art of her day and left a deeply personal body of work (Cotter).

Last Chance

EVEREST HALL, Bellwether, 335 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 387-3701, through Monday. This young artist's first New York solo show is made up of graphite drawings and oil paintings with perversely unpalatable content. The work is based on found photographic images lifted from magazines or Internet databases that cater to marginal tastes, and the mix of frat-house humor, gross-out obsession and polymorphous sexuality makes a potent visual combination, particularly because each image is so masterly executed (Cotter).

KRISTINE MARX, "Approximation," Plane Space, 102 Charles Street, West Village, (917) 606-1268, through Monday. Works in this young video artist's first New York solo don't look like much at first. She projects nondescript images of herself and others walking through or sitting in mostly empty rooms onto gallery walls and multidirectional arrangements of panels. Look more closely and you discover curious disjunctions of space and time, making an intriguing electronic update of Cubist painting (Johnson).

MICHAEL NAJJAR, "Information and Apocalypse," Goethe Institute, 1014 Fifth Avenue, near 82nd Street, (212) 439-8700, through Thursday. A Berlin photographer and digital artist shows glossy computer-assisted images and videos about how the mainstream electronic media covers war in the Middle East. His point is that the facts always surrender to the imperatives of visual entertainment, so his staged images of sex and death in the desert have a vivid artificiality, like television (Johnson).

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Finding Surprises as They Are Turned Up by the Karma Wheel

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
"Everyone Gets Lighter" is the good-news message on a billboard across the street from the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art at Snug Harbor on Staten Island. The words, by the New York poet John Giorno, introduce a show titled "The Invisible Thread: Buddhist Spirit in Contemporary Art." And after a visit, you may indeed feel a little more buoyant than usual.
 To be honest, I'm surprised at how well this exhibition turned out, given the fact that it came together on a wing and a prayer. It is one of the best things I have seen at Snug Harbor's Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art. 
 Conceived as the centerpiece of a yearlong multi-institutional series of events called "The Buddhism Project," which began last winter, the show had high ambitions. But cash was tight (apparently there still isn't enough loose change to print a catalog). Loans were hard to nail down. And last-minute changes in personnel rocked an already tipsy boat. (One of the curators, Olivia Georgia, director of the Newhouse Center, left for the Bronx Museum of the Arts.) 
But as any Buddhist knows, change is life's only certainty, and a spin of the karma wheel can bring unlooked-for blessings. So it was here. When loans fell through, better ones materialized: how much more interesting it is, for example, to see Agnes Martin's only video, the 1976 "Gabriel," in place of unobtainable paintings that would have presented her in a familiar mode.
A roster of nearly 50 artists that looked unpromisingly eclectic on paper turns out to be a beguilingly unobvious mix. And almost all the work is seen to advantage in the Newhouse Center's oddball Main Hall exhibition space, once a dormitory for the retired seamen for whom Snug Harbor was built in the 19th century.
With so many wild cards in play, it makes sense that the show's shape is free-form. Neither a systematic survey nor a closely argued thematic essay, it is fueled by the "Buddhist Spirit" of the title, whatever that may be. While some of the artists are practicing Buddhists, as their work reflects, others come from somewhere else entirely. But everyone arrives at more or less the same place, a place where the incidence of negativity is low, the harmony level high. In short, however the spirit is defined, it's communal and contagious.
And at least one of its sources takes traditional form in a Himalayan-style brass sculpture of the Buddha himself. Borrowed from the Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art on Staten Island, it is set, bright as a lamp, at the start of the show.
The figure, seated on a celestial lotus throne but touching the earth with one hand, is a classical embodiment of the dharma, or the way, a path to salvation that lies in an immersive but unpossessive identification with every aspect of the natural world. The Buddhist sutra known as the Scripture of Inconceivable Liberation envisions this interactive connection in the marvelous image of the Diamond Net of Indra, an infinite field of faceted gems, each gaining its radiance from the light of the others.
On a less exalted plane, there's also some modern historical grounding in a gallery devoted to a group of artists who did much to nurture the Buddhist spirit in postwar American culture. The Zen-masterish composer John Cage is one of them, represented by written notations for a chance-generated score. (He is honored elsewhere in a charming video piece by Nam June Paik.)
Another is Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk deeply involved in Asian spirituality. Three of his calligraphic pieces are here, as is a painting of rocks by Morris Graves and a gorgeous little sea-and-shore photograph by Minor White. Two floor-hugging bronze Noguchi sculptures clinch an effect of raked-garden spareness.
Calligraphy, a touchstone of the Zen aesthetic, had a significant influence on Abstract Expressionism and continues to be a reference point for gestural painting. Louise Fishman's somber "Lifting, Moving, Placing" offers evidence, with its inverted stepped pyramid of vermilion strokes emerging from a gray-blue storm. So does Tattfoo Tan's "United We Stand," with its ribbons of blood red twisting across a landscape of mountains and exploding stars traced in gold on a dark ground and visible only close up.
Perceptual ambush, another Zen staple, animates a fountainlike piece by Tom Friedman. Made from a single clear plastic cup and dozens of linked drinking straws, it's some kind of masterpiece of idiot savant virtuosity. Nearby, pixilated, Zen-inflected Fluxus lives on in Yoko Ono's "Wish Tree," which invites viewers to tie handwritten personal requests to a potted ficus.
A ritual-intensive, icon-centered Buddhism is a model for other work: altarlike pieces by Top Changtrakul and Hoang Van-Bui, for example, and mandala-inspired installations by Arlene Schechet and Chrysanne Stathacos. Alex Grey's painting, "Universal Mind Lattice," with its glowing emblem of neural circuitry set in a Christian altarpiece format, exemplifies hybrid. interfaith "American Buddhism" that some historians of religion see as the way of the future.
If it proves to be so, it is a Buddhism that will necessarily encompass a political dimension, a degree of social awareness and critical self-reflection that complicates the meditative, soft-grained, interiorized Buddhism that predominates in this show.
Like every religion, institutional Buddhism has a dark side. Zen was a militant samurai religion, teaching warriors how to kill and be killed with unflappable self-composure; in Japan today, Zen temples accept lucrative contracts to provide obedience training for corporate employees. And in the United States, where the word compassionate, which carries specific ethical meanings in a Buddhist context, has been jingoistically linked to the word conservatism, Buddhism may need to rethink its self-presentation.
But changes are already under way. Maybe it means something that the show's single overtly political piece, Adelle Lutz's "Burkha/Womb Project," addresses the issue of international violence with an image from Islamic culture; and that one of the largest figurative pieces on view, a walk-in sculpture of the Buddha's head by Long-bin Chen, is composed of hundreds of New York City telephone directories, as if an entire polyethnic, spiritually diverse population were united under his protection.
Such art may hold the seeds of the Buddhist "planetary culture" envisioned by the poet Gary Snyder as an antidote to a now global Western culture, "economically dependent on a fantastic system of stimulation of greed which cannot be fulfilled."
As the Buddha himself implied, however, the personal and the political are inseparable. The only model for an ethical life he had to offer was his own stripped-down life, and he encouraged others to imitate it so they, too, might become Buddhas -- awakened beings -- in a process of self-transformation that, almost accidentally, generated universal beneficence. Something like this idea is suggested in a huge, air-filled fabric sculpture by Lewis deSoto, which depicts the reclining Buddha simultaneously dying and entering the energy stream of nirvana. The image is based on a revered stone image in Sri Lanka, but its face is a self-portrait of Mr. deSoto.
The piece, which looks as if it could drift up out of the gallery like a dirigible, is given plenty of breathing space. So is other work installed in the small rooms off the Main Hall on two levels, a layout vaguely corresponding to that found in the very early Buddhist cave monasteries in India, with their courtyards surrounded by monks' cells and chapels, all carved from rock.
The show's organizers -- Robyn Brentano and Lilly Wei, independent curators; the writer Roger Lipsey; and Ms. Georgia -- have supplied wall texts that often clarify individual artists' connection to Buddhism but too seldom address the specific work at hand, which occasionally needs some decoding. But this oversight is a minor flaw, as is the quotient of less than riveting contributions that almost inevitably comes with large-scale curatorial collaborations. 
What matters in the end is a gathered atmosphere, in this case stimulating and pacific. It tends to stay with you after you have left the show, like the scent of incense on clothing, and charges the outside air. I caught the ferry back at dusk, when Lower Manhattan was beginning to generate its own corporate jewel-net of light. During the trip, a sea-going street preacher paced back and forth through the cabin, exhorting us, his captive audience, to turn our attention to a certain path-marking spiritual leader of a non-Buddhist persuasion. "He is the way in no way!" the evangelist suddenly shouted. Several of us -- readers, dozers, daydreamers -- levitated in alarm in our seats; then at least one of us smiled at a pure Zen moment, American-style. 

"The Invisible Thread: Buddhist Spirit in Contemporary Art" is at the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718) 448-2500, through Feb. 29.

HEADLINE: JOURNEYS; 
After the Fires, Back in Business

BYLINE:  By CHRIS DIXON 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
JUST a week ago, it looked as though Mountain High ski resort might not open at all this year. The ski area, 220 acres in the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles, is less than 10 miles from the reach of the Old Fire, one of the worst of the blazes that tore through almost 750,000 acres here in late October. Then the temperature dropped 40 degrees, snow started falling and, Monday morning at 8:30 a.m., the first skier of the season headed up on the chairlift.
 "We went from summer to winter in the course of two days," said John McColly, the mountain's marketing director. "It's actually our earliest opening ever." 
 But while Mountain High is welcoming skiers, the rest of California's tourism industry is still struggling with the impact of the fires -- and, even more, with the impact of the widely broadcast pictures of devastation that may have some travelers staying away.
"We're a huge state," said Jennifer Jasper, deputy director of the California Travel and Tourism Commission, which has just launched a publicity campaign aimed at convincing tourists to come back. "Ninety-nine percent of California has been unaffected by this fire," she said.
Indeed, even while the fires were burning, much of Southern California was largely untouched, other than a pall of smoke. At Disneyland "there were no operational impacts from the fires," said Bob Tucker, a Disney spokesman. "And no effect on our crowds." (Mr. Tucker would not reveal visitor numbers during the fires, but last year Disneyland and its adjacent California Adventure park together averaged 340,000 visitors a week.)
And Los Angeles hotels had one of their best weeks ever, said Carol Martinez, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau. "Walt Disney Concert Hall just opened," she said, "and we had a Microsoft convention in town. We had 8,000 people for that and only 53 cancellations."
Ms. Jasper said that hard numbers on the fires' effects on Southern California's $35 billion tourism economy would not be available for 10 days or more, but that the San Diego area was probably the hardest hit.
Many flights into and out of Southern California were canceled, diverted or delayed when the regional air traffic control center at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in the San Diego hills was forced to close on Oct. 26. "It was getting hot in there and the place was filling up with smoke," said Donn Walker, a Federal Aviation Authority spokesman, who added that by Oct. 28 things had returned to normal.
But even with a thick blanket of smoke covering San Diego, hotels here were not necessarily emptying out. Craig Jacobs, the general manager of the landmark Del Coronado Hotel, said that cancellations during the fires ran about even with calls from local residents in need of places to stay. (The hotel gave burned-out locals rooms at half rate.) The bigger problem: smoke and ash soiling upholstery and carpets. Ash was also settling on the hotel's sprawling red roof. "We brought in a team of people to scrub," Mr. Jacobs said, and, by Wednesday of this week, "you really couldn't tell anything had happened."
NOT everyone was so lucky, of course. The smoke and the difficulty of getting around San Diego at the height of the crisis forced the closing of attractions like SeaWorld Adventure Park, which usually draws more than 70,000 visitors a week; Legoland California; and the 1,800-acre San Diego Wild Animal Park.
SeaWorld suspended operations for four days, Oct. 26 to 29. The animal park closed only briefly on Oct. 27, when the Paradise Fire came close to local roads, but reopened the next day, said Christina Simmons, a spokeswoman. And, she said, the warm weather that helped bring on the fire gave a boost to the park's annual fall chrysanthemum display, which is now in full bloom. The famous San Diego Zoo made it through without closing.
Dianne and David Reid of West Dundee, Ill., planned their family trip to San Diego for eight months but almost did not come because of the fires. "We were just waiting day by day to make our decision," said Mr. Reid, who works for a large accounting firm. When they called their hotel last week to check on the situation, Mrs. Reid said, the desk clerk told her, "Well, we're not wearing masks anymore."
"I thought, 'Oh, then it must be really good,' " she said. 
But it wasn't until Mr. Reid flew to San Diego on business on Monday that the rest of the family finally decided to come. "I could see it was a lot better," he said. 
So on Thursday morning, under clear sunny skies, the couple unloaded their three children from their rented car in the SeaWorld parking lot. In addition to seeing Shamu they were planning to visit Legoland and Tijuana, Mexico. Were they glad they came? Absolutely, Ms. Reid said. "It's 40 degrees back in Chicago right now." 
And at Mountain High, almost 2,000 skiers and snowboarders have been on the slopes each day, including Josh Montoya, a 20-year-old outdoor education instructor who spent opening day at the resort's Chisolm Terrain Park. "It's awesome to see all these people up here," he said. "The terrain's excellent for so early in the season." 
That's the kind of message tourism officials are hoping will get out, and soon. "Outside of fire-ravaged areas it's still the same," said Sal Giametta, a spokesman for the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau. "The message we're putting out now is much like we saw from New York post 9/11. We're here, we're open for business and what you could do for us now, would be to come out and visit."

Mobs! Murder! Mayhem! (And a Few Good Deals)

BYLINE:  By KIMBERLY STEVENS and SARAH ROBERTSON 

 BODY:
LAST June, Baltimore police officers Karen Brzowsky and Timothy Beall were patrolling their beat in the city's Northern District when something caught their attention -- a middle-aged man walking along the street pushing a lawn mower to which he had strapped two bicycles and a handful of tools.
 Not a scene one usually encounters at 3 in the morning. 
 The officers stopped the man, George M. Wilson, 45, and asked him what he was doing with all those items. According to Officer Brzowsky, Mr. Wilson said that he had "found them on the street." 
A few hours later, though, when a resident in that neighborhood reported the theft of items much like the ones Mr. Wilson had been carrying, the officers went to his house and discovered what turned out to be roughly $2,500 in stolen property, including more bicycles, weed trimmers, tools and leaf blowers.
What the officers had stumbled onto was not just a one-time burglary. Instead, it transpired that Mr. Wilson had been repeatedly stealing property out of his neighbors' garages and homes -- roughly 40 burglaries in just over six months. Then, the police said, he would quickly sell the items at tag sales outside his apartment.
"It is almost the perfect crime," said Officer Brzowsky, explaining that the stolen items were often sold before the owners realized they were missing. Plus, she added, the very nature of tag sales -- with people coming and going and few records kept -- made it hard to trace stolen property, particularly the lawn-care equipment that Mr. Wilson seemed to specialize in. "These are all hot sellers at yard sales," she said.
Mr. Wilson was arrested and later pleaded guilty to theft, for which he was sentenced to six months in jail. The Baltimore police said that other theft charges are pending.
It used to be that yard sales were a quaint weekend custom, a place for neighbors to come by and pick over hand-me-downs while picking up the local gossip. If you actually came away with a bargain -- say, an Eastlake mirror for $35 -- so much the better. The events, sometimes called tag sales or garage sales, were mostly relaxed social occasions, a pleasant way to pass a Saturday morning.
That is changing. While grand theft is hardly a common occurrence at these events, police departments around the country report that these sales represent a growing crime problem in their towns, with trespassing charges, complaints about noise and crowds, and accusations of petty thievery and assault peppering their court dockets. 
Part of the problem is the sheer number of yard sales. Some people hold sales so frequently, according to officials around the country, that neighbors complain to city hall that they are running unlicensed businesses on their lawns. City streets are littered with homemade signs that are up for many days before and after the sales.
Meanwhile, sellers have to contend with early birds who line up on their property hours before the sale starts and shoppers who get into fights over items.
"Do I believe it's more aggressive now?" asked Sonia Weiss, a co-author of the Pocket Idiot's Guide to Garage and Yard Sales. "Yes, absolutely." 
The increased numbers of sales -- and the heightened competition among shoppers -- has brought out the "unseemly side of yard sale," said Christina Heiska, 40, a Lusby, Md., resident who has run the www.yard salequeen.com Web site for the last five years. She recently added a section on yard sale scams to warn people about the more unsavory characters they might encounter, like browsers who use small children to distract sellers while they shoplift a few items. 
"Maybe it's the economy or eBay, but I've heard all sorts of stories about people shoplifting, changing price tags and cheating people out of change," she said. "They attract the run-of-the-mill swindler, so it's important to keep an eye out." 
Andrea Checovich, 40, an antiques dealer who has had a booth at Christine's Crossing, a shared retail space in Rye, N.H., for more than two years, said that the competition has gotten much fiercer in recent years. She said that in her searches for merchandise she has seen arguments, near fistfights and women leaping over barriers in heels and skirts to attach "sold" stickers to the things they like. And, she said, angry yard-sale attendees complain bitterly when they arrive at a sale at the posted starting time only to find that "early birds" were let in early. 
"I notice it immediately," she said. "People get this look in their eyes. There is a certain etiquette that everyone tries to maintain, but once you give into bad behavior, the craziness begins. That's when I call it quits."
EFFORTS to slow down the proliferation of yard sales have popped up around the country. In Santa Ana, Calif., residents can only hold sales on four weekends every year, with strictly enforced hours of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., while in San Jose, Calif., residents are restricted to just two sales a year.
"Activities like this are intrusive in neighborhoods," said Garry McLeod, a code enforcement officer for the city of San Jose. "Small issues become larger issues if you let them continue."
After officials in Westborough, Mass., prohibited sale signs on public property, residents advertised their sales by plastering their cars with signs and parking them in the heavily trafficked downtown. So the town then imposed a two-hour parking limit there. "The area is around funeral homes and churches," said Lt. Paul Donnelly of the Westborough police department. "It's not appropriate."
Josh Thomas, citizen information coordinator in Lake Oswego, Ore., said that his department was flooded with so many garage sale complaints -- including one about a woman who had nine sales in one month -- that city officials last December passed an ordinance restricting garage sales to two a year. Previously, homeowners there could have sales up to 14 days a year.
Yard-sale rules can be strict. Want to have a sale in Atherton or Ventura, Calif.? Make sure it is a gangbuster because you can have only one a year. In Lone Tree, Colo., residents are required to use special white and green signs provided by the city to advertise their sales. In New Holland, Pa., residents must have a permit to hold a sale and use the city's special signs, then take them down within 24 hours. Violations can mean a fine of up to $600.
"We've had to close yard sales down when they get too crazy," said Jessica Meihle, who handles the yard-sale permits for the police department in North Hampton, N.H., another hub of yard-sale activity.
In Collinsville, Ill., Marcy Basden, 38, a day care director, said that she had high hopes for her yard sale last fall. She bought a permit, placed an ad in the paper, and laid out all her goods. But she ended up making only $25 on the sale. Why? She was fined $83 for putting a sign on public property on the corner of her street. "It stopped me from having a sale this year," she said. "I'll just give my things to Goodwill." 
Trespassing and breaking and entering are not unknown in connection with yard sales. When Margaret Ponzer and her siblings decided to have a sale at her childhood home in Rye, N.H., they sorted through dusty boxes and painstakingly put price tags on old belongings. And then they listed the sale in the local newspaper a week in advance, which according to Ms. Ponzer was "a giant mistake." 
"I couldn't believe it when I came over to the house later that week to do some last-minute pricing and there was a dealer sitting in the middle of the living room with a pile of things she wanted and a handful of cash," said Mrs. Ponzer, who had left the house unlocked. After the initial shock of discovering a stranger in her home, and thinking of calling the police, Mrs. Ponzer said, she just told the woman to leave and come back during the sale.
Likewise, when Dan Hardee, of Vero Beach, Fla., had a tag sale in late June, he thought it was going to be "good, innocent fun." On the day of the event, he said, he quickly realized he was in over his head, beginning with the unexpected early start. "I heard noise in the garage at 6that morning and the sale was scheduled to start at 8," he said. "I couldn't believe people actually let themselves into the garage." (Which he had not locked.)
Things only got worse later in the day when he realized that someone had apparently helped himself to $600 that Mr. Hardee had briefly stashed under a ceramic bowl for safekeeping. Mr. Hardee considers that a hard-earned lesson. "I will have another sale, and I probably won't hire a security guard," he said. "But I'll definitely have a lockbox."
Detective Joe Flescher from the Indian River County Sheriff's office, who investigated Mr. Hardee's theft complaint, said that Mr. Hardee had not been prepared for the crowds or for the possibility of criminal activity. "People have become shameless over an old eight-track or a fishing rod," Detective Flescher said. "I think the only frontier left is the church bazaar." 
Gunfire and bloodshed are not what you would expect a yard sale to produce, but that's what occurred two years ago in Las Vegas.
Over the years, David Earl Reed often held yard sales in front of his Las Vegas home, doing a brisk business as neighbors and passers-by sifted through the dozens of cast-off items he had assembled. But when Gene Cattaneo came by late one November afternoon two years ago, he was not looking to pick up used patio furniture or a few pieces of Fiestaware.
Instead, Mr. Cattaneo started taking pictures of the items arrayed on the lawn, apparently agitated by the sight of all the merchandise displayed in the front yard. "It was not your normal yard sale," said Brian Rutledge, a deputy district attorney later involved in prosecuting Mr. Reed. "There were 20 different computer monitors out on the lawn, dozens of rolls of carpets, tables and tents." Soon, the two men got into an argument that continued later nearby, according to the police, and ended when Mr. Reed shot Mr. Cattaneo.
Shortly afterward, Mr. Cattaneo, 59, was pronounced dead at University Medical Center and Mr. Reed, then 61, was charged in his death. Last August, Mr. Reed pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to up to 20 years in prison, according to his lawyer, Joseph Abood.
George Sherwood, a Las Vegas detective assigned to the case, said that the two men apparently didn't know each other, but that the constant yard sales seemed to bother Mr. Cattaneo, as well as many other neighborhood residents. "There was junk all over the yard and piled up," Detective Sherwood said recently. "It was your basic eyesore." 
Mr. Reed, he added, was "the neighbor you pray never moves into the area."
For Jeffrey Maybaum, of Wellington, Fla., holding a yard sale last spring was an experience that he said he was not eager to repeat. The event turned violent after he accused a shopper, who had purchased a painting, of stealing three others. Mr. Maybaum said that the accused man, fleeing in an S.U.V., struck him in the shoulder. 
Mr. Maybaum said that he called 911 and later pursued charges of aggravated assault with a motor vehicle. Eventually, however, Mr. Maybaum's four paintings were returned and he dropped his complaint. 
"It was immensely traumatizing," he said. "I will never, ever have a garage sale again."

HEADLINE: Flags Versus Dollars 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Howard Dean's remarks about the need to appeal to white Southerners could certainly have been better phrased. But his rivals for the Democratic nomination should be ashamed of their reaction. They know what he was trying to say -- and it wasn't that his party should go soft on racism. By playing gotcha, by seizing on the chance to take the front-runner down a peg, they damaged the cause they claim to serve -- and missed a chance to confront the real issue he raised.
 A three-sentence description of the arc of American politics over the past 70 years would run like this: First, Democrats and moderate Republicans created institutions -- above all, Social Security and Medicare -- that provided a measure of financial security to ordinary working Americans. The biggest beneficiaries of these institutions were African-Americans and working-class Southern whites, and both were part of the moderate-to-liberal coalition that dominated American politics until the 1960's. 
 But the right opened an increasingly effective counterattack, with a strategy that included using racially charged symbolism to get Southern whites to vote against their own economic interests. All Mr. Dean was saying was that Democrats need to understand and counter this strategy.
I know these are fighting words. But the reliance of modern Republican political strategy on coded appeals to racism is no secret. Controversies over efforts to remove the Stars and Bars from the top of the South Carolina Statehouse, and to reduce its size on the Georgia flag, played a significant role in Republican victories in 2002. And the evidence that race is still a crucial factor is as fresh as Tuesday's election. 
The big story in that election was the victory of Republicans in Mississippi and Kentucky. The secondary story, however, was a string of victories by Democrats in affluent suburban areas in the Northeast. In my state, New Jersey, Democrats took firm control of the state's Legislature.
What this tells us is that some people -- either in New Jersey, Mississippi or both -- voted against their economic interests. For whatever you think of Bush's economic plan, it's clearly much better for New Jersey -- a rich state, which gains a lot from tax cuts tilted toward the affluent -- than for a poor state like Mississippi.
Consider, for example, the effects of estate tax repeal, a central feature of the 2001 tax cut. Almost nobody in Mississippi pays the estate tax. In 2001 only 249 estates in Mississippi paid any tax at all; raising the exemption to $5 million, which some Democrats suggested as an alternative to full repeal, would have reduced that to a couple of dozen. By contrast, New Jersey, with three times Mississippi's population, had almost 10 times as many taxable estates. 
Or consider the 2003 tax cut. It was also heavily tilted toward the affluent, and therefore toward rich states. According to Citizens for Tax Justice estimates, the typical New Jersey family got a $409 tax cut. In Mississippi, the number was only $165.
So did Mississippi voters support the Republicans, even though they get very little direct benefit from Bush-style tax cuts, because they -- unlike New Jersey's voters -- understand the magic of supply-side economics? If you believe that, I've got an overpass on the Garden State Parkway you may be interested in buying.
Now maybe New Jersey voted Democratic because of irrational Bush hatred. But I think it's a lot more likely that white Mississippi voters, unlike their counterparts up north, are still responding to Republican flag-waving -- and it's not just the American flag that's being waved. 
Yet the fact is that Mississippi, being relatively poor, will lose disproportionately if the right wins on its full agenda, which involves a big rollback of New Deal and Great Society programs. (I'll explain in a future column how Republicans are using the prescription drug bill to lay the groundwork for later Medicare cuts.) 
Mr. Dean wasn't suggesting that his party adopt the G.O.P. strategy of coded racial signals, and by and large African-Americans -- my wife included -- understand that. What he meant by his flag remark was that Democrats must make the case to working Americans of all colors that the right's elitist agenda isn't in their interest. And he's right.

HEADLINE: Catholics in Survey Seek Accountability by Church 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
Three of every four Roman Catholics who regularly attend Mass say they want their church to be more financially accountable in the wake of its sexual-abuse crisis, according to a new Gallup survey, and one in four say they did not respond this year to financial appeals from the national church.
 But the survey also suggests that many Catholics who were angry about the scandal last year have begun to change their attitudes toward their local bishops. Forty-nine percent of the respondents said they felt that the bishops were doing a "good job" in handling the scandal, up from 35 percent last year. 
 Most also said they had not reduced donations to their parishes or local dioceses and bishops.
"They're blaming the bishops as a group rather than their own individual bishop," said Francis J. Butler, president of Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic Activities, an association of philanthropists, which commissioned the survey. 
"They're making distinctions, cutting contributions to things that originate at the bishops conference, whereas things that originate at the diocese or the parish get a more positive reaction," Mr. Butler said in an interview.
The survey, conducted in October by the Gallup Organization, polled the same Catholics who answered some of the same questions in a similar Gallup survey last year. The poll last year included 656 parishioners, of whom 309 responded this year. The margin of error when comparing the two polls is plus or minus seven percentage points, because the group of respondents is small. 
It has been nearly two years since the sexual-abuse scandal involving priests first made national headlines in Boston, and the Gallup polls are the most detailed publicly available polls to gauge Catholic donors' opinions over the last two years.
The bishops say they are still instituting the policies they enacted in June 2002 to apprehend and discipline child molesters among the clergy. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops meets in Washington next week.
Msgr. Francis Maniscalco, a spokesman for the conference, said that while some fund-raising appeals by the national church showed a slight drop in donations last year, others had slight increases. Among the national collections are the Catholic Campaign for Human Development, the Catholic Communications Collection and the American Bishops Overseas Appeal, Monsignor Maniscalco said. 
The survey results found that 75 percent of Catholics said the church should be more accountable on financial issues. 
Charles E. Zech, an economics professor at Villanova University who analyzed the survey results, said in an interview that "folks still want accountability."
"That hasn't dissipated, even with the sexual-abuse story off the front page," he said.
And two-thirds of those polled agreed in both years that "each diocesan bishop should give a full accounting of the financial costs and settlements arising from the sexual abuse by priests." 
The bishops have commissioned a study to find the extent of sexual abuse in the church and how much dioceses paid in settlements and legal fees. That study should be released in February, Monsignor Maniscalco said.
"The bishops are open to greater accountability," he said, "and they are in agreement with the laity that it is important to the church."

HEADLINE: The Great Job Machine 

BYLINE:  By W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm; W. Michael Cox, chief economist of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and Richard Alm are co-authors of "Myths of Rich and Poor."

DATELINE: DALLAS 

 BODY:
Apparently unconvinced by last week's eye-popping growth figures, economic pessimists remain fixated on the labor market. Today's release of the Labor Department's latest employment figures, we are told, will give a true picture of the pace of economic recovery. 
 But the monthly statistics, while relevant within the larger context of all economic indicators, don't tell the whole story of what is happening with Americans' jobs. Focusing on net employment gains or losses misses the real show, the long-running drama that drives the economy forward. 
 While it may seem that little progress is being made on the jobs front, beneath the surface the economy is doing what it's done for decades: orchestrating a relentless and enormous recycling of jobs and workers. 
Large-scale upheaval in jobs is part of the economy; the impetus for it comes from technology, changing trading patterns and shifting consumer demand. History tells us that the result will be even more jobs, greater productivity and higher incomes for American workers in general.
New Bureau of Labor Statistics data covering the past decade show that job losses seem as common as sport utility vehicles on the highways. Annual job loss ranged from a low of 27 million in 1993 to a high of 35.4 million in 2001. Even in 2000, when the unemployment rate hit its lowest point of the 1990's expansion, 33 million jobs were eliminated. 
The flip side is that, according to the labor bureau's figures, annual job gains ranged from 29.6 million in 1993 to 35.6 million in 1999. Day in and day out, workers quit their jobs or get fired, then move on to new positions. Companies start up, fail, downsize, upsize and fill the vacancies of those who left. It is workers' migration to new and existing jobs that keeps the country from sinking into some Depression-like swamp. 
Yes, this disruption can be very hard on some workers who lose their employment and have trouble adapting. But in the larger sense, the turmoil in the labor market is vital to economic progress. A good part of the turnover takes place in a handful of industries, like restaurants and retailing, but to greater or lesser extent the churning grinds on across the board, in bad times and good. Tallies of net jobs lost or gained capture only a fraction of the flux in the job market. As this plays out, most workers end up better off. 
Societies grow richer when new products emerge that better meet consumers' needs, and when producers adopt new technologies that reduce costs by making workers more productive. In a dynamic, innovative economy, these forces unleash waves upon waves of change. Some industries and companies prosper while others wither. Some companies find themselves with too many workers while others struggle with too few. A free-enterprise system responds by moving resources -- in this case workers -- to where they're more valuable.
For example, e-mail, word processors, answering machines and other modern office technologies are cutting jobs for secretaries but increasing the ranks of programmers. The Internet opened jobs for hundreds of thousands of Webmasters, an occupation that didn't exist as recently as 1990. Digital cameras translate to fewer photo clerks.
A century ago, 40 of every 100 Americans worked on farms to feed a nation of 90 million. Today, after one of history's most brutal downsizings, it takes just two agricultural workers out of 100 workers to supply an abundance of food to a nation more than three times as large. Suppose we'd kept 40 percent of our labor on the farm. Absurd, yes, but if we had, we wouldn't have had enough workers to produce the new homes, computers, movies, medicines and the myriad other goods and services of our modern economy. 
Likewise, the telecommunications industry employed 421,000 switchboard operators in 1970, when Americans made 9.8 billion long-distance calls. Thanks to advances in switching technology, telecommunications companies have reduced the number of operators to 78,000, but consumers ring up 98 billion calls. Let's face it: Americans are better off with more efficient long-distance service. To handle today's volume of calls with 1970's technology, telephone companies would need 4.2 million operators, or 3 percent of the labor force. Without the productivity gains, a long-distance call would probably cost 40 times what it now does.
Microeconomic failure is not macroeconomic failure. Quite the opposite, "failure" is the way the macro economy transfers resources to where they belong. It is the paradox of progress: a society can't reap the rewards of economic progress without accepting the constant change in work that comes with it. Efforts to soften the blows, by devising policies or laws to preserve jobs or protect industries, will lead to stagnation and decline, the biggest threat to American workers. 
Job losses for farm hands and telephone operators came so long ago that they don't sting anymore. Today we see the benefits clearly and forget the costs. That's harder to do in the short term -- it rightly distresses us to see newspaper photographs of laid-off industrial workers. But these are the economic forces that raise living standards. 
Since 1980, Americans have filed 106 million initial claims for unemployment benefits, each representing a lost job. Facing unemployment and rebuilding a life can be hard on families, but the United States today is better off for allowing it to happen. Even with the net decline in jobs over the past three years, during the past decade total United States employment has risen to 130 million from 91 million since 1980, a net gain of nearly 40 million jobs. Productivity, measured by output per worker, increased a staggering 56.2 percent. 
Some people tend to forget this. The almost daily drumbeat of reports and "expert commentary" about a so-called jobless recovery prompts the question, "What's gone wrong with the labor market?"
The surprising answer: nothing. 
Job growth will come, as it always has in the past. The economy, meanwhile, is as busy as ever in shifting labor from one use to another to make the country richer and more productive.

HEADLINE: Clark Proposes Transferring Military Operations in Iraq to a NATO Force 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: ORANGEBURG, S.C., Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Gen. Wesley K. Clark said Thursday that military operations in Iraq should be turned over to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization force under United States command and that he would replace the civilian administration there with an international effort not under American leadership.
 General Clark, who is retired from the Army and who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, made the proposals to build international involvement and stabilize Iraq in an an address here at South Carolina State University. 
 It was the fourth in a series of speeches laying out his platform for the presidency, based on what he calls a "new American patriotism." He also said he would conduct a conference with leaders from Europe, Japan, the Arab world and other countries to enlist their support for a more international approach to Iraq. 
As part of that effort, General Clark said, he would recall the former Iraqi army and ask the cooperating nations to commit tens of thousands of troops to help the Iraqis in policing, police training, oversight and border control.
The creation of a new "reconstruction and democracy council" in Baghdad would be modeled, he said, on the international coalition that oversaw security and military operations in the Balkans in the 1990's.
While he struck themes that are common among the nine Democratic candidates -- saying the Bush administration's unilateral approach to Iraq has bred contempt for the United States -- he sought to capitalize on his experience as the former Supreme Commander of NATO forces in Europe, who prosecuted the 1999 war in Kosovo.
General Clark said his proposals would promote self-sufficiency among the Iraqi people. To foster that effort, he also called for "exchange programs in multiple fields so that Iraqis who have been isolated for years can see the rest of the world," learning about economics, education, health care and other elements of democratic societies.
"We can give the Iraqis a much bigger sense of ownership over their country and move much more quickly toward a government that answers to its people than the plan the Bush administration is currently pursuing," General Clark said. "Until Iraqis believe they can control their future, they will huddle in fear. They will watch others attack, rather than stand with pride, expose the guerrillas and stop the violence."
Senior officials on the Clark campaign said he chose South Carolina State for the foreign policy address because its R.O.T.C. program, in a state with a strong military presence, is one of the largest minority officer-training programs in the country. The program has commissioned more than 1,900 officers, most of them African-American.
In addition, three graduates of nearby Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School have been killed in the current war in Iraq, including Specialist Darius T. Jennings of the Army, who died this month after the helicopter in which he was riding was shot down near Falluja. 
Bridgette Frazier, a junior from Bluffton, S.C., who is president of the Young Democrats organization and who introduced General Clark, said the war in Iraq "has hurt the community."
"Of course, we applaud the efforts of our young men being over there," Ms. Frazier said, "but a lot of people here don't understand the reason for it."
South Carolina's primary on Feb. 3 is the first in the South, and General Clark is hoping it will establish him as the strongest rival to Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, for the Democratic nomination.
Seeking to repair ties with European allies that he said have been damaged by the Bush administration, General Clark said he would propose "a new Atlantic Charter to reinvigorate our security partnership with Europe." 
He said such an organization would supplement NATO rather than replace it and would "define the threats we face in common, create the basis for concerted action from our allies to meet them, and offer the promise to act together as a first choice, not a last."
General Clark also said that the makeup of American military forces in Iraq should be overhauled, with more special forces and light units and fewer conventional infantry units, which require significant amounts of lightly armed logistical support units that also make tempting targets for attacks.
The military forces in Iraq also need more specialists in language and intelligence, he said. He proposed asking international inspectors to take over the search for unconventional weapons, which would free American linguists and intelligence specialists to work on efforts "to find the people who are killing our soldiers."
To help to close Iraq's borders to infiltration by terrorists, General Clark said, "We should engage with the Syrians, the Iranians and the Saudis, and we need carrots as well as sticks." 
"Unfortunately, this administration has made the region wary of working with us," he said. "I'll make sure as president that we don't ever get into a mess like this again."

HEADLINE: With U.S. Tax Checks Spent, Retailers Report Slower Gains 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores and the Target Corporation reported slower sales gains for October yesterday after a boost from federal tax-credit checks wore off and warmer weather limited the demand for autumn clothing.
 October sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.4 percent, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail index. 
 Sales at Wal-Mart, the largest retailer, increased 4.5 percent in October from October 2002. The figures were within Wal-Mart's forecasts. 
Shoppers curtailed spending after they spent tax-credit checks mailed in July and August and concerns lingered about unemployment. Many retailers have trimmed their inventories so that fall merchandise could be sold in time to open shelf space for the holiday season.
"Apparel softness is clearly tied to the warmer weather," said David Ritt, who helps run investments, including shares of Wal-Mart and the Gap, at ASB Capital Management. "It has to be considered a negative that consumers burned through the cash from the tax rebates."
Sales at Target's discount stores increased 1.6 percent. But at Kohl's, revenue fell 11.6 percent. 
Many shoppers are keeping their budgets tight amid job concerns. The Labor Department is expected to report this morning that unemployment remained at 6.1 percent last month, based on median forecasts. The rate has remained above 6 percent since April.
Some retailers said they expected third-quarter profits higher than forecast after they kept inventory low. Gap said earnings rose to as much as 28 cents a share, exceeding analysts' estimates. Federated Department Stores said profit would be slightly more than its forecast of as much as 33 cents a share.
Discounters like Costco and Wal-Mart benefited as shoppers bought more Halloween merchandise. Costco said sales rose 11 percent, buoyed by a 23 percent increase outside the United States. 
Retailers expect moderate sales gains in November as shoppers prepare for the holiday season. Wal-Mart said sales would rise as much as 5 percent, and Target expects sales at its discount stores to increase 4 percent to 6 percent.

Cisco's Strong Profit Propels Nasdaq to 22-Month High

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, led by technology companies, as Cisco Systems reported a record quarterly profit and the most sales in almost three years. The Nasdaq composite index closed at its highest in 22 months.
 "This is going to be a very positive sign," said Tim Leach, who helps oversee $140 billion at Wells Fargo Private Client Services in San Francisco. "If technology is recovering, it says a lot of good things about the market in general." 
 Benchmark indexes climbed in the last two hours of trading as some investors speculated that a government report to be released today would show that the economy gained jobs in October, which would be the second consecutive month.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.24 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,058.05, with technology companies accounting for almost half the increase. The Dow Jones industrial average added 36.14 points, or 0.4 percent, to 9,856.97.
The Nasdaq, which gets 42 percent of its value from computer-related companies, advanced 17 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,976.37. The index is at its highest point since January 2002.
Cisco, the maker of data-networking equipment, jumped $1.10, to $22.90. The company earned $1.09 billion, or 15 cents a share, in the quarter. Sales increased 5.3 percent, to $5.1 billion, their highest level since January 2001.
Shares of Cisco's rivals also gained. American depository receipts of Ericsson climbed 59 cents, to $16.57. Nortel Networks added 9 cents, to $4.42.
Stocks rose after the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level since January 2001 as faster economic growth prompted companies to retain workers, a government report showed. First-time jobless claims fell by 43,000, to 348,000, during the week ended Saturday, the Labor Department said.
Signs of an economic recovery "are now clearly there," billionaire investor George Soros said in a televised interview with Bloomberg News. "Today's employment number may be a bit of a fluke, but nevertheless, it shows a trend." 
Some money managers said investors were focused on today's Labor Department report. The economy may have gained jobs for a second month in October and the unemployment rate probably held at 6.1 percent, signals that the recovery will endure, economists said.
"Folks are just biding their time before the jobs report number tomorrow," said Richard Nash, chief market strategist at Victory Capital Management, which oversees $48 billion in Cleveland.
Telecommunications companies had the biggest percentage decline among the S.&P. 500's 10 industry groups. SBC Communications lost 46 cents, to $23.14. BellSouth dropped 49 cents, to $25.26.
The Federal Communications Commission may free consumers to move their home numbers to cellphones. An F.C.C. commissioner, Kathleen Abernathy, said that the agency might rule on the matter by the end of the week. On Monday, SBC and 70 other local carriers said such a rule would illegally favor wireless operators.
Janus Capital Group added 62 cents, to $14.28. The New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, has been in talks with several companies, including Janus, Strong Capital Management, Bank One and Bank of America, to settle accusations that they allowed favored investors to make improper mutual fund trades, Bloomberg and Reuters reported.
Alliance Capital Management Holding shed 38 cents, to $30.15. The nation's biggest publicly traded money manager said the Securities and Exchange Commission might penalize the company for improper mutual fund trading.
T. Rowe Price Group, a manager of stock mutual funds, added $3.11, or 7.7 percent, to $43.56. The company may win clients from firms that have been accused of allowing improper fund trading, Guy Moszkowski, a Merrill Lynch & Company analyst, said.
T. Rowe Price has not been implicated in the investigation, he said, and its fund performance is among the best in the industry.
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 15/32, to a price of 98 23/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.41 percent from 4.35 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond plunged 28/32, to 101 27/32. The bond's yield jumped to 5.25 percent from 5.19 percent on Wednesday.

PERSON: JEFF SOREF 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Keen Eye and Oh, Such Compelling Friends

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
IN deference to the nervous Nellies who insure the extroverted contents of Jeff Soref's art-centric apartment on Gramercy Park, a scholarly itemization of his collection of African and Eastern sculpture, most of it carved in timeworn wood, is forbidden. But gawking is permitted. He is constantly asked which pieces he'd rescue in a fire: fortunately he has no spouse, kids or pets to further complicate things. He's inordinately fond of an ancestor figure, presumably a king, from Congo; it seems a good king is hard to find. Then there's the 11th century hermaphrodite from Mali. Decisions, decisions.
 Suffice it to say that the phalanx of statuary that guards the living and dining rooms, some of it life-size with expressions ranging from meditative to malevolent, makes a serious first impression on visitors, even those devoid of an artistic eye. Mr. Soref, the newest addition to the Lincoln Center board, and, according to his preliminary research, the first openly gay activist on the board of any of New York City's benchmark cultural institutions, takes glee in recounting the experience of a friend who borrowed his apartment and was so intimidated by the statues that he locked them in a closet. 
 "A lot of people have trouble appreciating African art," says Mr. Soref, 55. "People either find it scary or they just don't get it. I see a lot of humor in it. And elegance. And simplicity. There are no hidden agendas: for me, collecting art has been a great break from politics."
Mr. Soref, whose other hobby is philanthropy, traces his political activism to a hodgepodge of sources: a Bolshevik grandfather, a Democrat mother, a Republican father, a Vista stint in the rural black South, an affinity for the underdog, and the AIDS epidemic, which claimed a slew of friends and propelled him to the presidency of the board of the Gay Men's Health Crisis from 1991 to 1994. Bill Clinton, on hand to give him an award at an Empire State Pride Agenda dinner last month, respectfully referred to him as "a thorn in my side." Mr. Soref's seven years as co-chairman of the Pride Agenda ended on a festive note last December when, after a 31-year stalemate, New York passed a nondiscrimination bill.
"Certain issues need to be bipartisan," he says, scratching a hand through his silver-tipped hair. It mirrors his persona -- scrupulously bristly. Back when he wore it long, he tamed it with Vaseline. "Sure, Vaseline," he says. "What do you think Elvis used?" Smooth. No wonder Mark Green, Elizabeth Holtzman, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy enlisted him as press secretary or spokesman. "Sometimes it's not about ideology, it's about doing the right thing." 
WORD has it he's relentless when pressing a cause, be it government funding for AIDS research or government funding for the arts, now his mission at Lincoln Center; or half his mission. The other half is providing outreach to the gay and lesbian community; overdue, he says. As is -- listen up, Lincoln Center officials -- what Mr. Soref envisions as an "out" music festival.
"I've spent my whole life raising money for AIDS, and for the gay community," Mr. Soref says. "I made my reputation, such as it is, by being a gay activist, and the fact that Lincoln Center was willing to reach out to that is a significant breakthrough even if it wasn't intended to be a breakthrough. Given the involvement of the gay community in the arts, in performance, and in philanthropy, you kind of wonder how it can be that there's been no openly gay board member of a top-ranking cultural institution; typically they draw from the corporate world, or very senior government officials, and we know there's still a glass ceiling there for lesbians and gays." 
Reynold Levy, the Lincoln Center president, says his board was not necessarily looking for a gay activist, but he sounds thrilled with Mr. Soref: "Jeff brings to the board a highly refined sense of political skills, a broad network of friends and colleagues inside and outside the gay community, and a passion for the arts: that combination is extremely compelling." 
Mr. Soref grew up wealthy in Milwaukee; the family money came from his father's manufacturing firm, and when it was sold, Mr. Soref collected his share in a lump sum. He joined Vista after a medical deferment kept him from the Vietnam War, graduated from Brandeis University and, hoping to become a spy, graduated from the London School of Economics with a degree in Russian government in 1974. The great irony of his rocky romantic career -- he is, alas, single these days -- is that it was not his homosexuality but a love affair with a Czech woman during grad school that disqualified him from spy duty when he applied to the State Department. Back in the States, he devoted himself to politics and the civil rights of the AIDS-afflicted. When he became ill in the mid-90's, the scuttlebutt was that he himself was battling AIDS; actually, it was kidney disease. He underwent a transplant in 1994. 
Besides buying art in conjunction with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he is a longtime patron of the Metropolitan Opera and a classical music buff; he says it was his passion for performance art, not his art collection, that swayed the Lincoln Center board. "They made me promise not to redecorate," he says in jest. "None of that queer eye for the straight guy stuff."

HEADLINE: Putin Says Oilman's Arrest Is No Threat to Private Enterprise 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday cast the arrest of the country's richest man almost two weeks ago as part of a law and order campaign aimed at Russia's hugely wealthy oligarchs.
 Speaking heatedly at a news conference in Rome, he said: "People earned billions, I repeat billions, of dollars in the space of five or six years. This would not have been possible in any Western European nation." 
 He emphasized that the arrest of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, who owns the giant Yukos Oil company, did not mean that Russia would reverse its policies of private ownership.
"I say officially that the Yukos case will not lead to revision of the Russian Federation's policy in the economic or political sphere," he said. "There are no plans of this kind."
As Mr. Khodorkovsky has sat in jail awaiting trial on charges of economic crimes, analysts and investors have debated whether his arrest signaled a broad crackdown or even a rollback in the privatization of state property in the 1990's.
Earlier, Mr. Putin downplayed the case as "an isolated criminal matter." On Thursday he said Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest was the latest of many for economic crimes.
"High-ranking officials in the Interior Ministry were arrested too," he said. "Criminal cases were initiated against the heads of some regions of the Russian Federation. The investigation of a former federal minister has been completed and sent to the courts.
"Our actions are guided by a desire to instill law and order in the country and have everybody abide by the law and fight corruption."
The targets of the campaign are the hustling entrepreneurs who seized much of Russia's natural resources during the last decade, said Michael McFaul, an expert on Russia at Stanford University who is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
The men in the Kremlin who are behind the campaign "see themselves as restoring the Russian state after this period," he said on a conference call with worried investors.
Whatever policy issues are involved, Mr. Khodorkovsky has angered the Kremlin with his public activities, financing opposition parties and charitable foundations as well as academic institutions like the Carnegie Endowment.
Mr. Putin addressed that issue too. "They will of course spend millions -- tens and hundreds of millions -- in order to save their billions," he said. "We know how that money has been spent, on what lawyers, what public relations companies and what political figures." He said the government would fight back "tenaciously and toughly, no matter how these people try to defend themselves, by blackmail and other means."
The United States has expressed concern over the actions against Yukos, which precede parliamentary elections to be held on Dec. 7. On Thursday a regional court stripped one of the company's top shareholders, Vasily S. Shakhnovsky, of his parliamentary seat and his immunity from prosecution. He has been charged, like Mr. Khodorkovsky, with tax evasion.
In an odd development, the agriculture ministry of Sakha, a Russian region where Yukos operates, also took a swing, with a report saying cows and rabbits were beingmistreated at farms run by a company subsidiary. Among the rabbits it said, "Couplings take place unsystematically and no zoological-technological monitoring records are kept," according to the report quoted by the Interfax news agency.
Aleksandr Shadrin, the beleaguered Yukos spokesman, seized the light moment.
"The unsystematic coupling of buck rabbits at a farm of a company affiliate is an outrage, indeed," he told Interfax. "Those responsible will definitely be punished."

HEADLINE: BUSH ASKS LANDS IN MIDEAST TO TRY DEMOCRATIC WAYS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
President Bush on Thursday challenged Iran, Syria and two crucial Middle East allies of the United States -- Egypt and Saudi Arabia -- to begin embracing democratic traditions, and to view the fall of Saddam Hussein as "a watershed event in the global democratic revolution." 
 "Sixty years of Western nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the Middle East did nothing to make us safe," Mr. Bush argued, in a critique that embraced both Democrats and Republicans who preceded him, "because in the long run, stability cannot be purchased at the expense of liberty." 
 The speech, before the National Endowment for Democracy, appeared to be part of an effort by the White House to change American and world perceptions of the Iraq occupation, describing it in far broader strategic terms than the ouster of a dictator.
But it came at a moment when Mr. Bush is struggling to create democratic institutions in Iraq itself, and when the daily casualties among the American and allied soldiers have led many in the region to question whether the United States is capable of transforming the nation it invaded. 
In the speech, the president sought to position the American experiment in remaking Iraq alongside the United States' efforts to spread democracy in Asia and Europe after World War II and to bring about the fall of the Soviet Union. He directly compared what he called his administration's new "forward strategy of freedom in the Middle East" to President Ronald Reagan's 1982 declaration in England that Soviet Communism had failed.
He identified four nations where he said dictatorship was doomed to failure: North Korea, Myanmar -- which he referred to by its former name, Burma -- Cuba and Zimbabwe, declaring that "these regimes cannot hold back freedom forever." He predicted that just as Nelson Mandela emerged from captivity in South Africa to lead his nation, "one day, from prison camps and prison cells and from exile, the leaders of new democracies will arrive" in the four countries.
Mr. Bush had sounded similar themes before, notably in a speech at the American Enterprise Institute a month and a half before he ordered the invasion of Iraq. But until Thursday's speech, he had not identified nations that he thought urgently needed to reform. For thefirst time, he also raised, gingerly, the issue of the absence of liberty in Saudi Arabia, one of America's major oil suppliers and a nation that has long been spared presidential rebuke.
"The Saudi government is taking first steps toward reform," he said, choosing his words carefully about a country that one of his senior aides said recently "is probably the most resistant to change of any nation in the region." He referred to its experiment with local elections, avoided any mention of the struggle within the Saudi royal family over whether and how to surrender some authority, and he offered the most gentle of encouragement.
"By giving the Saudi people a greater role in their own society," Mr. Bush said, "the Saudi government can demonstrate true leadership in the region."
He also pressed Egypt -- which receives upward of $2 billion annually in aid from the United States -- saying it "has shown the way toward peace in the Middle East, and now should show the way toward democracy in the Middle East." But later, his spokesman, Scott McClellan, said the president was not threatening any consequences for his Arab allies if they failed to heed his warning.
The pressure runs the risk of backfiring. In the Arab world, Mr. Bush's remarks about human rights and democracy are often viewed as hypocritical, and Arabs often compare those statements to the treatment of suspected terrorists held by American forces at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or the president's reluctance to demand that Israel stop constructing its barrier along the West Bank. 
Some Arab intellectuals urging greater civil liberties say Mr. Bush's endorsement undermines them, because it paints them as stooges of the United States. 
But a scattering of experts feel that it is welcome pressure on governments that have been stuck in place for decades, and Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, praised Mr. Bush for doing something the Clinton administration had been loath to do: identifying Middle East nations that have refused to liberalize. 
"They have ended the Mideast exception to American human rights policy," he said of the Bush administration. "It is welcome moral clarity in the service of a policy that still lacks moral authority."
Not surprisingly, Mr. Bush heaped the most scorn on Iran and Syria, which his administration accuses of seeking to undermine the Iraq occupation. "The regime in Tehran must heed the democratic demands of the Iranian people or lose its last claim to legitimacy," he said. 
He lumped Syria's leaders with Mr. Hussein, saying they had promised a restoration of ancient glories but instead left "a legacy of torture, oppression, misery and ruin."
By the time Mr. Bush spoke, it was already evening in the Middle East, and there were no official reactions from governments. But Imad Fawzi Shueibi, a Syrian political analyst and professor at Damascus University, suggested that Mr. Bush's message would be tainted in the Middle East by the widespread negative perception of the messenger.
"I don't think someone who violates the human rights against people all over the world and especially the Arab world can speak about freedom and democracy," he said. "How can we believe that Mr. George Bush wants us to enter the era of democracy and the era of freedom when he remains biased toward Israel despite its violations of human rights, despite its long occupation of Arab land and its apartheid system toward the Arabs in the occupied territories?" 
Others found plenty to praise. 
"It was exciting," said Omar Baghour, a Saudi economist and columnist at the newspaper Al Madina. 
The United States, he said, "is hated in the Arab and Islamic world because it has always been viewed as supporting repressive regimes." Mr. Bush has now turned, he said, to "a more moderate approach, a more rational approach to democratization in the Arab world rather than the threat of force."
Most notable about Mr. Bush's speech was his tone in discussing Iraq. In February at the American Enterprise Institute, he said with certainty that Mr. Hussein's ouster would make Iraq the democratic kernel at the heart of the Middle East. But on Thursday, he raised the specter of what a nondemocratic Iraq might look like in a post-Hussein era, though he assured listeners that success was inevitable. 
"The failure of Iraqi democracy would embolden terrorists around the world, increase dangers to the American people, and extinguish the hopes of millions in the region," he said. "Iraqi democracy will succeed, and that success will send forth the news, from Damascus to Tehran, that freedom can be the future of every nation."
Mr. Bush did not mention the issue of weapons of mass destruction. The possible threat from such weapons was the administration's chief argument for war against Iraq, but no evidence of them has been found. 
Two hours after the speech, the president gathered leaders of the House and Senate and his security team in the East Room and signed the legislation that provides $87 billion for military action and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. Flanked by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, he called the money "the greatest commitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan."

HEADLINE: Brazil Eases Its Dependence on I.M.F. 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Confident it has stabilized Brazil's economy, the country's left-leaning government said this week that its 12-month extension of a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund signals an end to years of dependence on I.M.F. bailouts.
 Confounding market fears of just a year ago that he would lead Brazil into a free-spending dash for growth, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and his pragmatic economic team have succeeded in reining in inflation and public spending. Though Brazil has increased exports to earn much-needed hard currency to plug holes in the current account, the government still faces the daunting task of getting the economy growing again without upsetting the country's delicately balanced accounts. 
 Outlining the agreement Wednesday to extend Brazil's current $30 billion standby agreement that runs out next month, Antonio Palocci, the finance minister, said the government would draw on the new $14 billion I.M.F. package, which includes $6 billion of fresh cash and eases debt repayments terms over the next four years, only if absolutely necessary. 
"It's a sort of insurance policy against the ever present risk of external shocks and unforeseen difficulties," Mr. Palocci said. "We believe we should, after a long period, propose an end to this series of deals with the fund."
Anne Krueger, the I.M.F.'s first deputy managing director, said she would support the proposal before the I.M.F.'s board.
Brazil has been relying on I.M.F. aid since a currency crisis in 1998. The country has proved unable to wean itself off support as it experienced stop-start growth and a series of international financial crises that shook confidence in emerging markets.
But Mr. Palocci insisted there were now "real and effective" signs that the next economic recovery would be on the back of sustainable growth.
Whether such optimism is justified or not, the markets hailed the I.M.F. extension as a signal that Brazil would not stray from the path of fiscal and monetary orthodoxy. Fitch Ratings on Thursday upgraded Brazil's sovereign debt from B to B+.
"The I.M.F. agreement was just one factor in the upgrade," said Roger Scher, managing director and head of Latin American sovereign debt at Fitch in New York.
"Generally, there is a feeling the Lula government has been very successful in macroeconomic policy," he said. "Basically, they have made few mistakes and surpassed everybody's expectations."
But the success has not been without pain. The economy, anemic since 1998, is expected to grow just 1.1 percent this year. Spiraling inflation forced Mr. da Silva to increase interest rates to 26 percent early this year, decimating business and consumer confidence. Industrial output has slumped; the jobless rate has soared to 13 percent nationwide and is over 20 percent in Sao Paulo, the country's economic heart.
In recent months, however, the threat from inflation has waned and interest rates are ticking down. With a weak currency and feeble domestic demand, exports are booming. The trade surplus is expected to top $23 billion this year, leaving Brazil's current account in the black for the first time since 1993. 
In contrast to 12 months ago, when Mr. da Silva's leftist past and pugnacious election campaign sent markets into a panic, investors are returning to Brazil with enthusiasm. Sao Paulo's stock index, the Bovespa, is up 59 percent this year and the benchmark C bond is trading at more than 90 percent of its face value, after being below 50 percent last fall.
"This time last year, we were one step away from the abyss, now it seems we've taken quite a few steps back," said Rodrigo Azevedo, chief economist at Credit Suisse First Boston-Garantia in Sao Paulo. "So I think this is a good agreement. It creates a framework for better perspectives next year and, I hope, beyond."
Like Mr. Azevedo, many economists say the Lula administration must now get down to tackling potentially unpopular changes to make the economy more flexible and attractive to foreign investment.
Two crucial moves -- realigning Brazil's bankrupt social security network and its byzantine tax system -- have already cleared the principle hurdles in Congress, but smaller, yet important, measures await action. 
A bankruptcy law that would make it easier for banks to seize collateral to recoup the value of bad loans would ultimately allow banks to lower interest rates and should stimulate the economy. Liberalizing labor laws to make it easier to hire and fire workers is also seen as important, though that is bound to meet resistance from many members of Mr. da Silva's Workers' Party.
Another problem with a return to growth is that a revival of domestic demand will make a dent in the trade surplus.
Mr. Azevedo expects this year's projected $23 billion trade surplus to shrink to $16 billion next year if the economy recovers, turning this year's projected $2.6 billion current account surplus into a $6.4 billion deficit in 2004.
One answer to that would be to push the currency, the real, down against the dollar. As Brazil has stabilized, the real has gradually recovered, and is now trading below 2.9 to the dollar. Exporters say the currency must stay above 3 to the dollar to keep Brazilian goods competitive on world markets.
"Growth is the question," Mr. Scher said. "G.D.P. growth and export growth -- that's the onlyway Brazil can pay off its domestic and foreign debt."
If Brazil cannot guarantee growth, Mr. Palocci might be thwarted in his hopes of never knocking at the I.M.F.'s door again, Mr. Scher said.
"Brazil's balance of payments still remains quite vulnerable to external shocks," he said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Hints at End To Low Rates 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, offered a first hint on Thursday that the era of rock-bottom interest rates may be slowly drawing to a close.
 Acknowledging for the first time that the economy has grown at a blistering pace in recent months, Mr. Greenspan gave an optimistic assessment of the prospects for strong growth and a gradual reduction in unemployment. 
 The Fed chairman also departed slightly from the central bank's recent open-ended commitment to retain a policy of cheap money "for a considerable period." 
In a speech delivered to the Securities Industry Association, Mr. Greenspan said that the Fed was still more worried that inflation would be too low rather than too high and that the Fed could afford to be patient before changing monetary policy.
But he also cautioned that "no central bank can ever afford to be less than vigilant about the prospects for inflation."
The comments left little doubt that Mr. Greenspan wants to keep interest rates low for at least the next several months. But they also offered a guarded hint that the Fed's open-ended commitment to easy money may be waning.
"They know they have an exit problem," said William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. "I think they want the exit to be gradual and smooth rather than abrupt and scary."
On a separate front, Mr. Greenspan bluntly criticized both President Bush and Congress for not reducing a federal budget deficit that could exceed $500 billion next year.
"Recent budget deliberations have not been encouraging," he said, pleading for a return to Congressional rules that make it much harder to cut taxes or raise spending without finding new sources of revenue.
"The current debate appears to be about how much to cut taxes or how much to increase spending," he continued. "No significant constituency seems to support taking the actions that will be necessary to move toward, and one hopes achieve, budget balance."
Mr. Greenspan's remarks were his first since the Fed decided on Oct. 28 to keep the federal funds rate for overnight loans between banks at 1 percent, the lowest level in 45 years. They were also his first comments since the government reported last Thursday that the economy surged at an annual rate of 7.2 percent in the third quarter, the fastest pace in nearly two decades.
The combination of rapid growth and exceptionally easy money has increased expectations among investors that the Fed will tighten the reins some time next year to keep the economy from overheating.
Before Mr. Greenspan delivered his remarks, the government released two reports that showed signs of an economy gaining strength.
The Labor Department reported that the number of new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to 348,000 last week, the lowest level since 2001.
Though weekly claims for unemployment tend to be volatile, the drop in claims was bigger than expected. Many economists believe that a level below 400,000 indicates that the job market is strengthening. 
On Friday, the Labor Department will release unemployment data for October. Most analysts estimate that the jobless rate remained about 6.1 percent last month but that the economy added 60,000 jobs.
The government also reported on Thursday that the nation's productivity -- the amount of goods and services produced per worker -- soared at annual rate of 8.1 percent in the third quarter of this year.
Productivity gains have been a two-edged sword for Mr. Greenspan and other top officials, just as they have been for President Bush. On the one hand, higher productivity makes it possible for companies to increase production and increase their profits without hiring additional people.
But productivity growth has been so fast this year that job creation has been stagnant and joblessness has remained stubbornly high. Fed officials remain worried that a weak job market and heightened job insecurities among workers could short-circuit the economic recovery. 
In his speech, Mr. Greenspan noted that per-hour output in the nonfarm business sector had climbed at an annual rate of 5 percent for the last two years. In the second and third quarters of 2003, he said , per-hour output climbed at a rate of 7.5 percent.
"If businesses are to spend and hire more vigorously, they will need to be convinced that economic growth can be sustained beyond the short run," Mr. Greenspan said. "One prominent concern is that, if the labor market remains weak, household confidence will suffer."
But in a nod to the mounting evidence of rapid economic growth, Mr. Greenspan said "the odds increasingly favor a revival in job creation."
Minutes from the September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, show that some Fed officials were already trying to rein in the open-ended commitment to keep interest rates low "for a considerable period."
According to the minutes, which were released last week, "the members generally agreed that the committee should not commit itself to a particular policy stance over some pre-established, extended time frame." But committee officials agreed to leave their language unchanged, citing the "unusual configuration" of economic conditions. 
In a speech on Thursday, a Fed governor, Ben S. Bernanke, contended that the Fed still had room to keep interest rates low, in part because rapid productivity growth has reduced the risk of inflation.
"Inflation appears subdued and likely to remain so," Mr. Bernanke said in Pittsburgh.

HEADLINE: Going Alone, Britain Lifts Its Key Rate To 3.75% 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Breaking ranks with other leading central banks, the Bank of England raised its benchmark interest rate by one quarter of a percentage point Thursday, bucking a global three-year trend toward lower borrowing costs.
 The bank's decision to lift its base rate to 3.75 percent, from 3.5 percent, was announced shortly before the European Central Bank in Frankfurt left rates in the 12-nation euro zone unchanged, underscoring the substantial distinctions between the more sluggish Continental economy and its faster-growing but more volatile British counterpart. 
 The decision by the European bank was the first under its new president, Jean-Claude Trichet of France, who succeeded Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands on Saturday. Economists and investors had expected the British increase and the euro zone decision to keep interest rates at 2 percent. 
It seemed unlikely, though, that the British move presaged any imminent increase in global interest rates. "I wouldn't imagine many other major central banks following suit in the near term," Mike Taylor, senior European economist at Merrill Lynch in London, said. That view was reflected in remarks from central bankers.
In Frankfurt, Mr. Trichet said at a news conference, "We are pursuing a strategy of a stable euro, a strong euro and a euro which inspires confidence." In the United States, where the benchmark rate is 1 percent, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said Thursday that American monetary policy makers could afford to be "patient."
The United States and Continental Europe have pushed interest rates to their lowest levels since World War II in their quest for growth to create jobs -- a less pressing issue in Britain, where several years of growth fed by consumer spending have kept the unemployment lines at their shortest in memory.
Using measures defined by the International Labor Organization, Britain's unemployment is 5 percent, the lowest in decades, while the jobless figure for the United States is 6.1 percent by the same standard. Euro zone unemployment is the highest of the three at 8.8 percent, and the region's growth this year is forecast to be about 0.4 percent compared with an expected 2.5 percent in Britain.
Mr. Trichet said he expected a European recovery to gather steam in 2004. "We see additional signs of recovery in the euro area," he said, adding that "the medium-term outlook for price stability remains favorable."
The biggest distinction between the British and Continental European economies, however, lies in Britain's overriding dependence on consumer spending, which, coupled with a still-buoyant housing market, has left economists concerned about runaway inflation as boom gives way to bust.
Mortgage lending in September reached a monthly high, for instance, while mortgage lenders this week estimated annual average house price increases at 16 percent -- down from last year's highs of 25 percent but still much higher than the Bank of England's economists say is sustainable.
"The Bank of England has finally run out of patience with British consumers," said Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, a business group. "Having waited patiently for British households to bring their borrowing under control, it has finally decided to intervene."
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee said Thursday: "Neither household spending nor the housing market have slowed by as much as the committee expected. Underlying inflationary pressures are therefore likely to build gradually as demand strengthens and sterling's depreciation earlier this year feeds through."
In the euro zone, by contrast, Europe's inflation rate of 2.1 percent in October did not change from September or August, which surprised some analysts who had expected inflation to decline because of the Continent's sluggish growth.
"We anticipate some further stickiness of inflation rates in the shorter term, while the medium-term outlook for price stability remains favorable." Mr. Trichet said.
The Bank of England's mandate is to keep inflation at 2.5 percent, but it walks a delicate line among competing pressures.
Britain's manufacturers, for instance, had just begun to sense a revival when the prospect of a return to costlier borrowing emerged Thursday. Economists and traders are forecasting that Thursday's rate increase will be followed by more in early 2004, a possibility that manufacturers find worrisome.
"Despite more encouraging world growth, we should be clear that the economic recovery is still at an early and extremely fragile stage," said Digby Jones, director general of the Confederation of British Industry. "It would be misguided to opt for overly aggressive monetary tightening before that recovery has really taken hold."
Some economists worry that higher interest rates could begin to erode confidence by slowing consumer spending far more than the Bank of England intends. Hilary Cook, an economist at Barclays Stockbrokers, said the increase Thursday "will make consumers think more about the debt levels they have been accumulating."
Others, however, argue that even with further moderate increases next year, consumers are not likely to feel too much pain. "It would take rates of 4.5 percent or more before you start seeing a significant squeeze on the British consumer," Mr. Taylor at Merrill Lynch said.
Even with the increase Thursday, British rates are still lower than they were at the beginning of this year. But the increase was the first since February 2000, when the Bank of England raised its benchmark rate a quarter of a point to 6 percent. 
Since then it has been steadily cutting rates to keep the economy away from the slowdown that has afflicted much of Continental Europe. British rates hit their lowest in 48 years, at 3.5 percent, with the last reduction, in July. The increase Thursday was "just taking back the precautionary rate cut in July," Mr. Taylor said.

HEADLINE: Bertelsmann and Sony to Join Music Units 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Bertelsmann and Sony have agreed to combine their music divisions, becoming the latest partners in an industry roundelay that reflects the turbulent economics of recorded music.
 The nonbinding letter of intent signed by Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate, and Sony of Japan envisions a 50-50 venture to be called Sony BMG. It would create a stronger rival to the industry's leader, the Universal Music Group of Vivendi Universal, with 25.2 percent of the global market and stars ranging from Britney Spears to the cellist Yo-Yo Ma. 
 The combination has echoes of a proposed joint venture of BMG, Bertelsmann's music division, and Time Warner's music division, which foundered two months ago when Time Warner decided to enter into talks with EMI. EMI is close to lining up financing for a cash-and-share bid of up to $1.7 billion for Warner Music, according to people involved in the proposal. 
The prospect of a competing merger may have prodded Sony and Bertelsmann to move quickly, according to industry executives. In an announcement vague on details, one point was explicit: the deal hinges on approval from antitrust regulators in the United States and Europe.
Many industry executives doubt the regulators would bless back-to-back mergers, which would shrink the number of major recording companies to three. By announcing their deal first, Bertelsmann and Sony could increase their chances of approval -- or even scare off Time Warner and EMI.
"It's not a disadvantage to be first," said Rolf Schmidt-Holtz, the chief executive of BMG, who would be chairman of the board of the new company. "In the end, the regulatory bodies will decide."
The European Commission has taken a hard line on music industry mergers, quashing two in the last three years. Given that record, a person close to the commission said that filing first was an advantage.
Sony and Bertelsmann also plan to keep their music publishing units out of the joint venture, removing an element that provoked regulators in Brussels in judging previous mergers.
Fusing two troubled music giants will not solve their problems with piracy and the peer-to-peer sharing of files, which have devastated the industry in the last few years. But it would enable Sony and Bertelsmann to cut costs by combining sales and marketing offices in dozens of countries. 
"We live in fragile and, for the record industry, very difficult times," said Andrew Lack, chairman of Sony Music Entertainment. "A partnership like this allows us to manage our way through the difficulties." Mr. Lack, a former television executive who has cut a wide swath as a music mogul, would be chief executive of Sony BMG.
Sony and Bertelsmann could still face internal obstacles. While they have agreed to value each other's assets equally -- a hurdle that tripped up Bertelsmann and Time Warner -- they have not yet performed due diligence on each other's accounts. In the music business, with its often-murky contracts for artists and star executives, that could be fraught with danger.
"It is mostly accounting issues, to my way of thinking," Mr. Lack said. "We may be a touch naive, but I don't think we are."
Mr. Lack said he and Mr. Schmidt-Holtz hammered out the deal over five weeks, using relatively few lawyers and investment bankers. While Sony's chairman, Nobuyuki Idei, and Bertelsmann's chairman, Gunter Thielen, were kept informed, they did not take part in the negotiations.
The speed of this deal surprised some people in the industry, who have become used to protracted negotiations that often end in failure. But analysts said the combination had an underlying logic.
"They have to consolidate because they can't afford the overhead," said Porter Bibb, managing partner of Mediatech Capital Partners, a media investment firm. "When you have the specter of vastly reduced profits, there isn't enough room for five or six major companies."
Both companies have felt growing pressure to stem the bleeding from their music operations. BMG reported an operating loss of $126 million in the first half, nearly triple its loss in the period last year. Sony Music had an operating profit of $2 million in the second quarter that ended in September, but sales slumped 8.9 percent, to $1.1 billion, from 2002.
Sony, which has also suffered from a slowdown in its consumer electronics business, announced last week a radical plan to lay off 20,000 workers and cut $3 billion in annual operating costs by 2006.
Bertelsmann, under Mr. Thielen, has concentrated on whittling down its debt and scaling back its ambitious forays into electronic distribution. A no-nonsense executive who rose through the bookbinding business, Mr. Thielen has said previously that he has few misgivings about placing Bertelsmann's music operations in a venture with a chief executive from another company.
Mr. Lack, a former president of NBC News and NBC, was brought into Sony Music in January by his former colleague, Sir Howard Stringer, the chairman of Sony's American operations, to shake up a culture that had been dominated by old-line music executives. Perks and lavish contracts abounded. Mr. Lack laid off more than 1,000 people and recast Sony's corporate culture to focus on digital distribution of music.
Mr. Schmidt-Holtz, a onetime television journalist and executive, said his shared background with Mr. Lack might have helped smooth negotiations. It also helped that neither man has a music pedigree, according to people at the companies, since that has been a hurdle in other negotiations.
Even now, as Time Warner and EMI negotiate to meld their operations, industry executives question whether Roger Ames, the chairman of the Warner Music Group, could co-exist with Alain Levy, the chairman of EMI Music, who was Mr. Ames's former boss at Polygram Records.
Mr. Ames, industry executives said, was pushing for a joint venture with BMG that would have him become chief executive and Mr. Schmidt-Holtz the chairman. In those talks, the stumbling block was not the relationship between the two men, but a distrust of Bertelsmann on the part of Time Warner's chief executive, Richard D. Parsons, after a publishing deal soured.
For Time Warner, the Sony-Bertelsmann announcement changes its calculus, but not necessarily in predictable ways. It could accelerate its negotiations with EMI in the hopes of presenting a deal to regulators at the same time that Sony and Bertelsmann make their pitch. Or it could drop EMI and take up a buyout bid made by a group of investors, including Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Haim Saban, a billionaire media investor.
Such a strategy would make sense if it appeared that regulators would not tolerate a music industry with only three major players. Selling Warner Music to Mr. Bronfman's group would not reduce the number of companies.
For EMI, the latest news is just one more twist in its perennial quest to find a partner. EMI, based in London, agreed to be bought by Time Warner in 2000, only to learn after announcing the deal that Time Warner had negotiated a $165 billion merger with America Online.
Regulators, who worried that the AOL-Time Warner combination would give the company undue control over content and distribution, agreed to approve it only if Time Warner abandoned its purchase of EMI. A subsequent merger of EMI and BMG was also snuffed out by regulators.
Shares of EMI fell 1.7 percent on Thursday, to 177 pence ($2.95). In New York, shares of Time Warner rose 25 cents, to $15.75, while American depository receipts of Sony fell 2.3 percent, or 85 cents, to $35.92. The New York Post and The Los Angeles Times reported on Thursday that a deal between Sony and Bertelsmann was imminent.
Mr. Schmidt-Holtz said the competitive landscape in recorded music had changed so drastically in the last two years because of piracy and file sharing that he believed that regulators would view this merger as much less of a threat. That view is shared by many outside analysts.
Indeed, Mr. Bibb, the media banker, said, "If the regulators take a step back, they would conclude there is no threat of monopoly, because essentially, these companies are in disarray, with no sound business model going forward."

Final Round for an Everlast Plant

BYLINE:  By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
FROM the outside, it's a gloomy gray building in a gloomy gray industrial section of the Bronx, not far from the Triborough Bridge, about as far away as you can get from the casino glitz of a big fight these days. But inside, the Everlast plant is where most of the boxing gloves in a big fight have been made for decades -- Muhammad Ali's gloves, Joe Frazier's gloves, George Foreman's gloves, Larry Holmes's gloves, Mike Tyson's gloves, Lennox Lewis's gloves.
 "When my corner wanted me to jab," Holmes has said, "they would yell, 'Everlast.' " 
 But this Everlast plant is in its last days. Sometime next month, all of Everlast Worldwide's gloves, punching bags, headgear, boxing shoes, trunks and robes will be produced at its Moberly, Mo., plant, nearly a century after its original factory opened on the Lower East Side in 1910, long after Jack Dempsey and Benny Leonard popularized Everlast gloves in the years after World War I. 
"We're saddened we have to close the Bronx plant; nearly 100 workers will be out of a job," George Horowitz, Everlast's principal owner, was saying in the company's Midtown office, which will remain its corporate headquarters. "But our lease there is over, our union contract is over, our landlord wants to more than double the rent."
And New York will be losing another page of its boxing history. Once upon a time there were enough neighborhood fight clubs in the city to provide boxing six nights a week; there were big fights almost every Friday night at Madison Square Garden; there were occasional outdoor title fights at Yankee Stadium and at the Polo Grounds.
But now there are no regular fight clubs here, the Vitaly Klitschko-Kirk Johnson heavyweight bout on Dec. 6 will be the first boxing show at the Garden's main arena in more than two years, promoters never consider putting on outdoor title fights, and Everlast gloves will no longer be shipped from a Bronx plant, according to Horowitz, to about 80 percent of the professional boxers in some 80 countries.
"Ali had hands that hurt," Horowitz said. "He needed extra padding in his training gloves to protect his hands."
For decades, a pro boxer's gloves were stuffed with horsehair, but Everlast now uses foam rubber.
"In the Thrilla in Manila," Horowitz said, "it was so hot in that indoor arena the horsehair in Ali's and Frazier's gloves broke down. By the late rounds, the gloves were just pieces of leather flopping around. It was almost like fighting with bare knuckles. Foam rubber doesn't break down."
Ali wore large-size gloves, but Lewis, the reigning World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, who is taller and heavier than Ali, needs extra-large gloves. Lewis also wears the biggest boxing shoe, a 16 triple E."
At its peak, the Bronx plant's daily production included 50 pairs of pro gloves, 50 headguards, at least 400 speed bags and at least 700 heavy bags. In the countdown to closing, the output is less, but the workers, many of whom are Bronx residents who have been employed there for years, remain proud of what they do.
"I make all the gloves for Ali," Gloria Kitchens said Tuesday. "When he and others were fighting, I would see them on TV and say, 'Ooh, that's my gloves.' "
Kitchens is from Nicaragua, and when Ricardo Mayorga, the welterweight champion from Nicaragua, stopped by the plant not long ago, he asked Kitchens to bless his gloves. When the plant had an anniversary party last year, Frazier attended.
"He told me, 'Congratulations,' " Kitchens said. " 'You made my gloves for me. You're special.' "
But in another month, after 32 years in the Everlast plant, Kitchens will be unemployed.
"I've been happy here," she said. "Now I don't know what I'll do. This is all I've done."
Guido Parales, from Ecuador, has been stuffing gloves for 29 years on a metal device that appears to have been shaped specifically for the job who knows how long ago. "When I started, the stuffer was here," said Parales, 59, who will be looking for work elsewhere. "The day Ali came, he hugged me and told me that he appreciated the quality."
One of the last shipments of equipment from the Bronx plant will be addressed to Tyson.
"Mike just called," said Adam Geisler, the Everlast marketing director. "He ordered 10-ounce XL gloves, 22-ounce training gloves, three pairs of shoes, headgear and a 250-pound big bag. Mike has often told us that his original trainer, Cus D'Amato, loved Everlast so he'll always love Everlast. He wanted it all shipped to him in Hawaii because he said he's going into training there soon."
That's news. Could he be training for a fight yet to be announced? Maybe with Roy Jones Jr.?
But no matter where Tyson or any other boxer trains, in a few weeks the Everlast equipment will be shipped to them from Missouri, not the Bronx.

HEADLINE: A Professor Who Refuses To Pull His Punches 

BYLINE:  By EMILY EAKIN 

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
In the ring his nickname was Busy Louie. In the classroom, where he spends much more of his time these days, it is easy to see why. Confined by street clothes, his feints and jabs accompanied not by leather gloves but merely by a dwindling piece of chalk and a blackboard eraser, Loic Wacquant, a professor of sociology at the University of California campus here, all but dances his way through a seminar on the criminal justice system.
 Twisting, turning, hopping, scribbling, he is in constant motion, demonstrating, for an oblivious audience of a half-dozen sleep-deprived graduate students, the fleet-footed agility that fueled his brief, abortive stint as a pugilist and nearly derailed his academic career. 
 A slight, excitable Frenchman with a mop of curly brown hair, hyperactive eyebrows and a high-pitched chortle of a laugh, Mr. Wacquant, 43, talks even faster than he moves, and with the same unflagging energy. "It's like drugs," he said of boxing's hold on him. "You have it in your veins." 
Weaning himself of the sport, which he took up as a means of gaining access to a poor black neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, has taken him the better part of a decade. He stopped sparring in 1997, and now, after years of delay, his analysis of his days in the ring is finally coming out in print. 
Mr. Wacquant (pronounced Vah-KAAHN) calls "Body & Soul: Notebooks of an Apprentice Boxer," which will be published by Oxford University Press later this month (a French edition appeared in 2001), a "sociological-pugilistic Bildungsroman." And for an ethnographic study, it is a remarkably personal work. In novelistic detail it recounts Mr. Wacquant's improbable transformation from winded graduate student to Busy Louie, a 137-pound junior welterweight who manages to pin his opponent on the ropes during the third round at the 1990 Chicago Golden Gloves tournament (though in a controversial decision by the judges, he ends up losing the match): 
"I rush at Cooper and attack without letting up. I'm taking a lot of punches but I'm dishing out some of my own in return and the wild shouts of my supporters give me an extra boost of energy. We're both running out of steam and getting tired. Three minutes in the ring is an eternity! Jab, jab, right, double jab, I really am busy -- at least I will have earned my ring name!"
"To finish the book was like closing that chapter of my life," Mr. Wacquant said, explaining why it took so long to complete. "It was like burying Busy Louie." 
Of course, he is hardly the first intellectual to come under boxing's spell. With "Body & Soul," he joins a long line of writers and philosophers -- from Sartre and Heidegger to Arthur Conan Doyle, Ernest Hemingway, Norman Mailer, George Plimpton and, the rare female exception, Joyce Carol Oates -- who have tried to capture the brutal sport's allure on paper. 
But Mr. Wacquant has serious academic ambitions for the book as well. It is intended not simply as a corrective to the romantic depictions that dominate the literary canon -- "Norman Mailer compared two boxers going at it to a metaphysical discussion," he said incredulously -- but also as a scholarly manifesto: a model for what ethnography, or field research, should look like.
In this endeavor, however, he may not get much sympathy from colleagues. During the decade it has taken him to write the book, Mr. Wacquant has acquired a reputation as one of his profession's fiercest critics. In more than half a dozen articles and essays, several written in collaboration with his French mentor, the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, he has subjected his field to withering rebuke. 
Among his charges: sociologists ignore racism and the role of the state in creating ghettos; they offer sanitized portraits of the urban poor instead of rigorous analysis of the reasons for their plight; and, worse, their work ends up providing unwitting legitimacy to regressive policies on race and poverty. He has also accused American scholars of cultural imperialism, of importing the peculiar national dynamics of race and racism to their studies of countries like Brazil, where the concepts make little sense.
As Mr. Wacquant put it last year in The American Journal of Sociology in a scathing review of three otherwise well-received urban ethnographies: "U.S. sociology is now tied and party to the ongoing construction of the neoliberal state" and its "punitive management of the poor, on and off the street." 
This grim view of government conduct is the subject of his next book, "Deadly Symbiosis," due out in the spring, which argues that American ghettos and prisons have become a single interconnected system for segregating and controlling the poor. 
And while his writings have earned him acclaim -- his honors include a MacArthur Foundation "genius award" -- they have angered many of his colleagues.
"He's upset a lot of people," said William Julius Wilson, a university professor at Harvard who has made extensive studies of Chicago's ghettoes and been a central proponent of the view that racism is increasingly less significant in perpetuating urban poverty than are changes in the global economy and the local job market. He said he had read several chapters of "Deadly Symbiosis" and found much in them brilliant. "However," he added, "as with much of Loic's work, I'm afraid that many readers will focus on the polemical attacks on the urban poverty literature instead of the powerful and substantive theoretical arguments he makes." 
Particularly galling, some scholars say, is that Mr. Wacquant has devoted much of his energy to reprimanding others while, at least until now, producing little fieldwork of his own. "He doesn't go into these communities himself and often criticizes those who do," said Elijah Anderson, Charles and William Day distinguished professor of social sciences at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of "Code of the Street: Decency, Violence, and the Moral Life of the Inner City" (Norton, 1999), one of the ethnographies Mr. Wacquant has attacked. "He'd like to see more militancy in the ghetto, but I'm trying to represent what's going on. If people in the ghetto community espouse a certain conventionality and conservatism, it's not for me to misrepresent."
Certainly, "Body & Soul," which Mr. Wacquant says is only the first installment of his work on boxing -- a second, more ambitious book, "The Passion of the Pugilist," is under way -- bears little resemblance to Mr. Anderson's book. Mr. Wacquant calls his approach "carnal sociology" or "ethnography by immersion." The goal, he says, is to convey his subjects' world by experiencing it firsthand -- in the case of his boxers, from the point of view of their sweaty, pummeled bodies. It's an ambition, he insists, that represents a radical departure from what passes as ethnography today. 
"Either people are portrayed as maximizing computing machines pursuing their interests, or they're portrayed as symbolic animals that manipulate language and obey norms because they're members of a group," Mr. Wacquant said at a cafe near the campus here, throwing up his hands in dismay. "What's missing is that people are first and foremost embodied, carnal beings of blood and flesh who relate to the world in a passionate way." 
Comparing himself to Carlos Castaneda, who claimed to have learned the secrets of shamanism and peyote rituals from a Yaqui Indian in the Mexican desert, he said: "I'm a Castaneda who has returned. I think he was right to go off the deep end. But you have to return." 
Going off the deep end was not originally part of Mr. Wacquant's plan. When he arrived at the University of Chicago from France in 1985 to earn a Ph.D. in sociology, he already had a dissertation topic in mind: colonialism in New Caledonia, the French-run island in the South Pacific where he had spent the previous two years completing his obligatory military service. 
But at Chicago, he soon became distracted by something else: the ghetto. His apartment, the last available unit of graduate student housing that year, was on East 61st Street, two blocks into Woodlawn, a black neighborhood with no high school, movie theater, library or job training center and where a third of the families lived below the federal poverty line. 
"I had never seen such scenes of desolation," Mr. Wacquant, who grew up in a tiny village in southern France, recalled. "I remember thinking: It's like Beirut. Or Dresden after the war. It was really a shock." 
A friend trying to get in shape took him to the Woodlawn Boys Club, a boxing gym two blocks from Mr. Wacquant's apartment. Though he had been an athlete in high school, enrolling in a special sports track with the intention of becoming a professional tennis player, he had never boxed. But what began merely as a way to get to know some of Woodlawn's residents quickly became an obsession. 
Within a year, Mr. Wacquant was spending every afternoon at the club, taking instruction from its coach, sparring with its members and attending fights and tournaments around town. By the spring of 1990, after he narrowly lost the fight at the Chicago Golden Gloves, he was seriously considering giving up his academic career to turn pro.
"When I was on campus, I thought, This is like death," Mr. Wacquant recalled. "Three minutes on campus was too much. I was going to the gym every day for three to five hours at a time." 
Mr. Bourdieu begged him to stop. The prestigious Society of Fellows at Harvard awarded him a three-year fellowship, warning him not to incur a brain injury in the meantime. But for the first year and a half, Mr. Wacquant hardly set foot in Cambridge, spending most of his time in Woodlawn instead. 
"I was trying to figure out a way so that I could stay in the gym," he said. "It was totally unrealistic. I was sane enough to know that I didn't have a future in boxing. I would have had a lousy record."
Finally, in 1991, Harvard demanded that Mr. Wacquant return. A year later, the Woodlawn Boys Club was closed -- and eventually razed -- to make way for a parking lot. "I was in a clinical depression for years," Mr. Wacquant said. "It was very difficult for me to get my libido scientifica back." 
Still, he emerged from the experience with ample material for his book: more than 3,500 pages of field notes documenting his boxer friends' views on everything from the sport to race, poverty, their families and their neighborhood. (Their casual comments about having done time in prison -- "They all thought it was perfectly normal," Mr. Wacquant marveled -- became the germ of "Deadly Symbiosis.") But more important, he said, he came away with avisceral understanding of what draws poor black men to the sport.
"It's not the money, not the fame or the possibility of occupational mobility," none of which are likely to be forthcoming, he said. "What binds boxers to their gym is just how gripping it is. It's the sheer sensuous, aesthetic and moral experience of being embedded in that universe." 
Mr. Wacquant said he worried that "Body & Soul" would be misunderstood, that its graphic evocations of blood and stench and sweat might strike some scholars as literary embellishments rather than legitimate social science. But the prospect of doing battle with critics doesn't faze him.
"I'm tough," he said with a grin. "I've taken worse in the ring."

HEADLINE: Selling of Tax-Credit Forms Is Investigated 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WILSON

 BODY:
The city's Department of Consumer Affairs said yesterday that it had opened an investigation into a Brooklyn woman who has been selling state tax forms for a credit for homeowners and renters with annual household incomes of less than $18,000. 
 The woman, the Rev. Carolyn Hester-White, used fliers to promote the tax credit forms at Holy Trinity Beauty Supply Store at 874 Willoughby Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant last week. After a television news report, thousands of people lined up over several days seeking the forms, which Ms. White was selling for $2 to $10, though she later gave them away. 
 "These are people crying," Ms. Hester-White said yesterday. "They're all hurting. They don't have jobs, they're unemployed. They write letters to me saying, 'Please help me file my application.' I tell them they have to be qualified first. I'm not ashamed. I have nothing to hide."
Taxpayers can fill out the form, IT-214, provided free of charge by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. Credits can be as much as $75 for an individual in the household under 65, or as much as $375 for those over 65, according to the state agency's Web site. 
But Ms. Hester-White's fliers suggested that higher payments were possible: "Receive up to $1,824 in rent repayment in the state of New York." 
The Consumer Affairs Department has subpoenaed the store's records and Ms. Hester-White must appear at the department on Monday morning, a department spokeswoman said. 
"Charging poor people for free tax forms is an outrage and obviously a scam," Gretchen Dykstra, the department's commissioner, said in a statement. "It is not at all clear that the thousands of people lining up at Ms. Hester-White's door each day will receive the thousands of dollars in tax credits they appear to have been promised." 
Ms. Hester-White said the fees went to cover the expense of the application envelopes. She said she shut down the business this week because her shop was too small for the number of people who still needed applications.

HEADLINE: Dean's Flag Remarks Thrill and Repel in South 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Tywon McLamore is 21 and black and has been thinking about putting a Confederate flag sticker on his bumper, to make a statement.
 "It's about overcoming the past," he said of his idea, sitting on a park bench here and eyeing the Confederate battle emblem that waves for a different reason from a flagpole in front of the statehouse. 
 But Mr. McLamore has no use for those who fly the flag as a divisive symbol -- or for Howard Dean, who stepped into trouble this week by saying he wanted to gain the votes of the rebel-flag-waving crowd. 
"I know a lot of people who dislike him for saying that," Mr. McLamore said.
Maurice Bessinger, by contrast, may not have been the kind of voter Dr. Dean was trying to reach -- but reach him Dr. Dean has.
Mr. Bessinger, who is 73 and white, flies the Confederate flag all over Piggy Park, his barbecue joint a few minutes west of the capital, where he also gives away booklets calling Lincoln a traitor. His reputation is such that many grocery stores will not sell his barbecue sauce.
And he was just thrilled by Dr. Dean's remark, calling it proof that the South is rising again, at least politically. "They've got to get our vote to win," he said.
"If I was voting in the Democratic primary, I'd vote for Dean," Mr. Bessinger said, recording his own words to make sure a Yankee newspaper did not misquote him. "No doubt about it -- he's a great American."
Mr. McLamore's disapproval and Mr. Bessinger's embrace neatly encapsulate the problem that Dr. Dean's remark has caused him here in South Carolina, where he barely has an organization. In courting what Southerners bluntly call the redneck vote, Dr. Dean was trying to cross a divide that many Democrats would love to see bridged: bringing back to the party poor, rural whites who have spent the last few decades voting Republican.
Yet with his reference to the Confederate flag, Dr. Dean fell into a pothole that for South Carolinians is the size of a quarry. This state, after all, has waged a second civil war of sorts in the last few years over the flying of the Confederate battle emblem first atop, and since 2000 in front of, the Capitol. The N.A.A.C.P. continues to boycott South Carolina to protest the flag's presence on the statehouse grounds.
"My first impression was, gosh, does he not understand what that flag represents?" said Waring S. Howe Jr., a Charleston lawyer and Democratic National Committee member. "Does he not have a single Southerner on his staff?"
State Senator John Matthews, a black Democrat from Orangeburg, said Dr. Dean's comment would cost him with African-Americans. "I think he only apologized after he checked the polls and with his supporters in this state," he said.
He also suggested that Dr. Dean was misguided for even bothering with those who fly the Confederate flag. "I don't think it'd bring anything to the table to go after those voters," Mr. Matthews said. "They will never support Howard Dean. Most of the people supporting the Confederate flag tend to be right-wing, anti-African-American, anti-Jewish, anti-everything. Believe me -- I live here. I know."
Lonnie Randolph, the state N.A.A.C.P. chairman, said he was not offended by Dr. Dean's remark, as he believed that the former Vermont governor "didn't understand his own comments." But, he added: "Probably more damaging than anything else is that he didn't want to apologize. It shows a degree of arrogance that I don't think people in public office can afford to have."
There are also plenty who had absolutely no problem with Dr. Dean's remark -- that he wanted to woo the "guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks" -- but took umbrage at Democrats like Senator John Edwards and the Rev. Al Sharpton for suggesting there was something wrong with it.
"People thought that it was inclusive, rather than exclusive," said Andy Thomas, a radio host in Columbia who has devoted part of every show this week to the flag flap. "Sure, he was stereotyping Southerners, but they didn't feel any apology was necessary." 
Then again, Mr. Thomas said, his callers were mostly white and not the likeliest to participate in South Carolina's Democratic primary on Feb. 3.
There are those here in South Carolina who see in the turn of events an opportunity of sorts for Democrats, and for the state.
Tom Turnipseed, a Columbia lawyer and self-described "reformed racist" who was Gov. George C. Wallace's national campaign director in 1968, said, "Democrats have got to reach across, and understanding is the only way."
"You can get those folks together on economic issues," he said, referring to the Southern whites Dr. Dean wants to court. "And on war and peace -- they're the ones who fight and die," he said, referring to the war in Iraq. "They feel like they were very much misled."
Mr. Howe, the Democratic committee member, called the flag a "symbol we'd just as soon not be reminded of." Yet in Columbia, where the flag flies from a 20-foot pole next to a Confederate soldier monument on the northern edge of the Capitol grounds, it is hard to lose sight of.
Mindy Lucas, a public-affairs strategist who works across the street from the statehouse, said she had less of a reaction to Dr. Dean's remark than she did to a Boston-based commentator she heard on television describing "what Southerners think."
"It just cracked me up," Ms. Lucas said. "Here we go again. What do you think of us? As if we're two-headed aliens."

HEADLINE: Mining Again in a Montana Town That's Fallen on Hard Times 

BYLINE:  By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: BUTTE, Mont. 

 BODY:
Burned by the promises of a New West an economy based on the Internet and telecommunications -- this city high in the Rockies is celebrating a return to the Old West, as hundreds of copper miners return to work.
 This month, the last of more than 350 workers is expected to be on board at the Continental Pit mine, which is being brought back on line by the Montana Resources Inc. with the help of a $2 million loan from the state. The mine was shuttered three years ago when electricity prices soared to record highs in the West. Reopening it will also create hundreds of jobs in support industries, from steel to tires to fuel. 
 The opening of the mine is both an economic and psychological relief for a city that has had little but bad news in recent months because of electrical deregulation and the decline of the Internet economy. 
"The reopening of the copper mines is symbolic," said Evan Barrett, head of the Butte Local Redevelopment Corporation. "It says this town will not die. It's not in the future of the people to give up."
Butte has been plagued by lost jobs, business failures, population declines and festering toxic waste.
But the demise this year of Montana Power, the state's largest electric company, was the worst economic news in recent years. Montana Power was an economic mainstay here for decades, with more than 500 high-paying jobs. In 1997 the State Legislature, led by Gov. Marc Racicot, a Republican, passed legislation to deregulate power companies. Montana Power, with headquarters here, sold off its electrical business and became an Internet service provider called Touch America. 
In August, Touch America's stock price plummeted from a high of $65 a share to a few cents, and the remains of the company were sold to a Canadian company. Anger toward Touch America, whose demise was part of the decline of the Internet economy, still runs deep here.
"The first layoffs were done by e-mail," said Judy Jacobsen, chief executive of Butte-Silverbow, a combined city and county entity. "They e-mailed them and said 'you're done.' " There are still 70 to 100 jobs, but no one knows if they will remain.
Meanwhile, Northwestern Energy, which bought Montana Power's assets and has more than 500 employees, recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing losses at its nonutility businesses, including Expanets, a telecommunications company. 
In still more bad economic news, a marketing company called Teleperformance USA announced last week that it would close its Butte office, throwing more than 100 people out of work.
Several years ago Butte landed a Washington-based silicon-manufacturing company, ASiMI, which built a plant on the outskirts of town that employs some 250 people. Local boosters named the area Silicon Mountain. But with the computer market in trouble, ASiMI is the only resident. 
"We're not making money, but we're going to muddle through," said Dave Keck, vice president for business development at the plant. "Everyone in the industry is suffering now." 
Much of western Montana has thrived in an economy driven by retirees and others moving to claim a piece of unspoiled Big Sky Country. But it is more difficult for Butte to lure companies and others here. One deterrent is a 2,200-foot-deep, milewide pit on the edge of downtown filled with a reddish-brown water so acidic that birds that land on it die. Much of the city is part of one of the largest Superfund complexes in the country. It sprawls for miles around, a legacy of decades of mining and smelting copper ore.
"Overlooking the north side of Butte you realize that history is not always a story of progress," said Pat Williams a nine-term congressman from Butte, who now teaches at the University of Montana, adding that the town's heyday in mining "extracted a terrible price."
Now, as a result, hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space here, in some of the West's most elegant architecture sit empty and boarded up. 
And so Butte has welcomed back the copper miners, though it is a far cry from its heyday.
In the early 1900's, this was Montana's largest city, with more than 80,000 people. While much of the West was wilderness, Butte was a thriving, often bawdy metropolis, with an opera house, restaurants and rows of houses of prostitution. Thousands from England to Czechoslovakia came here to work the mines. With three shifts operating, bars often stayed open around the clock.
In every census since the 1920's Butte has lost population, and now about 34,000 people live here. Like the miners who called this place home, the city of Butte prides itself on its feisty, blue-collar character. That attitude of the city, which sees itself as a fiercely independent entity, is summed up on a recorded message that runs on a local rock station between songs: "The Spirit of Butte, America, will never be broken."
Few, however, think the mine will assure Butte's future. A safer bet is attracting small to medium-size companies, Mr. Williams said. 
"The future of Butte is hitting singles, not home runs."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 17, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 8 about the effect of the reopening of a copper mine in Butte, Mont., misstated the year in which Montana Power, an economic mainstay of the city, sold off its electrical business and became an Internet service provider, Touch America. It was 2000, not 1997. (Touch America went out of business this year.)
 Because of an editing error, the article misstated the time during which stock in Touch America fell from a high of $65 a share to a few cents. It was over more than three years, not in August. The article rendered the name of a city-county governing body incorrectly. It is Butte-Silver Bow, not Butte-Silverbow.

HEADLINE: Bloom Is on the Economy 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
One flower may not prove the winter is over, but yesterday's employment report provided a strong indication that the economy is in an accelerating recovery.
 The surge in employment was greater than most economists had expected, including gains in October and higher counts than previously reported for both August and September. 
 "At business cycle turning points, upward revisions are the rule," said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig. "You can be pretty confident that the initial estimate for October will be revised upward, as well." 
The growth in employment now appears to have begun in August, as tax rebate checks were being received and cashed by millions of American parents. Those checks were the driving force in a surge in retail sales, which provided the demand that seems to have led some businesses to start hiring.
The pickup in the American economy has been mirrored elsewhere. Economic numbers in recent weeks have been better in most industrialized societies. Central banks in Australia and Britain even decided to raise interest rates this week, citing fears that their economies were starting to overheat. And some economists were quick to forecast that the Federal Reserve would soon follow suit, perhaps as early as its January meeting.
To some economists, the surge in growth should not come as a surprise. Both the Federal Reserve, through a sustained campaign to lower interest rates, and the government, through a combination of spending increases and tax cuts, have taken the actions intended to stimulate economic growth.
But there has been so much talk of a "jobless recovery" that some skeptics had concluded that no increase in employment was likely. And that made the impact of the employment numbers greater than might have been the case otherwise. The Labor Department found there were 270,000 more jobs in October than it counted a month ago when it released the September report.
"The lesson is that macroeconomic policy is powerful, even though it sometimes works with a lag," said Richard Hoey, the chief economist of the Dreyfus Corporation. "The economic cycle is back."
By no means are the current job numbers especially impressive. The government says that 130.13 million Americans were employed in October, fewer than the number working in February of this year and down 1.8 percent -- or 2.4 million jobs -- from the peak of 132.56 million registered in February 2001.
But the direction seems clear. One statistic compiled by the government is an index of hours worked in the private sector of the economy. Using a three-month moving average to smooth out volatility in the data, that figure is now showing an increase in hours worked for the first time since the end of 2000. It is rising at a 1.1 percent annual rate. At the low, in November 2001 -- when the recession officially ended -- the number of hours worked was falling at an annual rate of 5.4 percent.
"The number of people working is rising, and the workweek is rising," Mr. Barbera said. "Going from an economy on life support from mortgage refinancings and tax cuts to a self-sustaining recovery requires growing jobs to generate income."
There is not yet conclusive evidence that the economy has made that transition, but the fact that job growth ran ahead of schedule is an indication that it probably is. Retail sales are less impressive than they were when the tax rebate checks were being cashed this summer, but that is to be expected.
One sign of the beginning of a recovery is the rise in the number of temporary jobs. Companies often hire temporary workers when business picks up, since they need help but are concerned that the need may be temporary. The latest numbers show that the economy has gained 286,000 jobs since employment hit bottom in July. Of that total, 19 percent have been in the form of temporary employment.
By contrast, in the final months of the economic expansion that ended in early 2001, the number of temporary jobs was declining even as overall employment was growing. In that case, employers facing weakening demand chose to drop temporary workers first.
The extent to which the recently created temporary jobs are replaced by full-time jobs in coming months will be one clue to whether the recovery is really gaining speed.
The unemployment rate fell to 6 percent in October, down from a peak of 6.4 percent in June but still far above the low of 3.9 percent reached in December 2000. The rate would have gone higher save for the fact that some people dropped out of the labor market, and therefore were not counted as unemployed.
By September, noted John F. Vail, senior strategist of Mizuho Securities USA, just 66.08 percent of the adult population was in the work force, either employed or unemployed. That was a 10-year low, but it ticked up to 66.11 percent in October. "As this number picks up, it will keep the unemployment rate from falling too low, as more people look for jobs," he said.

Hiring Surged Last Month; Jobless Rate Falls to 6%
The longest hiring slump in more than 60 years appears to be ending. Employment grew by 126,000 jobs in October, the best showing in nine months, and job growth in August and September was stronger than the government had initially estimated, the Labor Department said. It was the greatest job growth over three months since late 2000.
 The unemployment rate fell to 6 percent, from 6.1 percent in September. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Design Guidelines for Ground Zero Point More to Space City U.S.A. 

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
How did we end up in Houston? That is the burning question raised by a new set of design guidelines for the office towers at ground zero. True, we've got a hole the size of Texas sitting down there in Lower Manhattan. But how did ground zero come to inherit a vision of glitzy, structurally inept towers that would look more at home in an office park for energy companies in Space City U.S.A.?
 Students of architecture and urbanism will be pondering such questions for years. Many of the answers lie beyond an architecture critic's grasp. They will be found within the realms of politics and economics. But no building can be properly analyzed without taking the social and ideological structures of power into account. The guidelines, which were prepared by Studio Daniel Libeskind, reveal the extent to which such structures have dishonored the ground zero design process, which was supposed to be open and democratic. 
 Thus far the guidelines, which are dated Oct. 23 and 27, exist only in draft form. But they have already been circulated among the group of architects retained by the developer Larry A. Silverstein to design office towers for ground zero. 
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, of course, says that these guidelines are already outdated, that the process is still very fluid.
Even so, they do provide a glimpse into Mr. Libeskind's inflated ambitions for the World Trade Center site. Contradicting his earlier assurances that different architects would design the towers, the drawings establish that Mr. Libeskind's intention all along has been to become their sole architect. What he calls design guidelines are just short of schematic designs for actual buildings. Mr. Silverstein's architects, not to mention the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, would be fools to accept them.
So would we. In fact, the time has come to examine in some detail the ground zero design process as it has unfolded in the last two years.
The process began as a political story and has again become one. What's needed now is a cultural framework for interpreting it. Until such a scaffold is in place, it will be impossible to make artistic sense of this or that scrap of design as it comes floating along.
More balloons are due shortly. On Nov. 17 the development corporation will present designs by finalists in the competition for a memorial to the victims of 9/11. Next month Mr. Silverstein is expected to present a preliminary design by David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Mr. Libeskind for Freedom Tower, the first office tower on the construction schedule.
Mr. Libeskind's design guidelines build on material presented in September as the Refined Master Site Plan. The title was odd: the public had yet to see a master plan. What they saw was a patched-together collage of an obsolete site plan, new plans for below-grade uses (chiefly transportation) and architectural renderings submitted by Mr. Libeskind in February.
Unless you've been living on Mars, you've already seen those illustrations and the familiar features depicted in them: the wedge of light, the exposed slurry wall, the spiral of skyscrapers culminating in the 1,776-foot-tall Freedom Tower, and so on. Mr. Libeskind's plan partly transforms those images into architectural designs. Though less impressionistic than the earlier images, the drawings present a set of highly articulated building envelopes. These are shaped entirely by formal concerns and do not reflect a serious analysis of structure, circulation and interior organization. Those, presumedly, would be left to the individual architects on Mr. Silverstein's team.
Not a lot else would be. If these guidelines -- or ones anywhere near as rigid -- are adopted, Mr. Childs, Jean Nouvel, Fumihiko Maki and Norman Foster, architects whose experience, talent and professional experience vastly exceed Mr. Libeskind's, would be reduced to the level of executive architects, producing working drawings for designs they had virtually no hand in shaping.
Forget Freedom Tower. It should be renamed Straitjacket Tower. The guidelines for it are so rigid as to virtually exclude Mr. Childs from shaping the building he was hired to design. As a formal composition, the design is feeble. Conceptually, it is kitsch, with its broadcasting spire intended to echo the Statue of Liberty's upraised arm more nearly resembling a skyward salute. The design is not worth the increased expense that its complex and illogical structure would incur.
When first appraising this proposal last December, I noted its resemblance to unbuilt designs for the stadtkrone, or city crown, developed by German Expressionist architects in the early 20th century. Those with a sense of history have found this resemblance highly disturbing.
For historians of the Expressionist period, the stadtkrone has long been a controversial concept. The architecture critic Wolfgang Pehnt, among others, has seen it as a forerunner of National Socialist ideology. As developed by Expressionists like Bruno Taut, the city crown's imposing scale, its subordination of individuals to the mass, its homogenous formal vocabulary and its aura of religious spectacle offered a glimpse of a totalizing aesthetic that came to fruition in the cathedral of light, Albert Speer's design for the 1936 Nuremberg rallies.
Similar forms, of course, can convey different meanings. Expressionism has inspired many architects of Mr. Libeskind's generation to design projects that are antifascistic. But the Libeskind design flirts perilously with the ideology of its source.
It is, for one thing, a creation of the state, and its rhetorical themes conform obediently to prevailing political views. The "assault on freedom" -- Mr. Libeskind's term for his plan's underlying theme -- is a propagandistic notion, not a historical fact.
Any design guidelines that insist on restrictiveness and homogeneity should be rejected. There is not just one way to respond to 9/11. The exclusion of other architectural visions is an assault on the idea of the city as a place where every voice counts.
Design guidelines in general are problematic for ground zero. Commonly used in suburban residential neighborhoods, they are now most often associated with the followers of the New Urbanism, developers of suburban communities known for their "traditional" period pastiche styles. Plans originally prepared for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation by the New York firms Peterson/Littenberg and Beyer Blinder Belle adhered to this retro design philosophy. That is one reason for which these plans were rejected by the public at town hall meetings held at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in July of last year.
The development corporation's "innovative design study," organized after that meeting, was intended to bring contemporary architecture into consideration. The selection of Daniel Libeskind was the end result of that process.
Yet as David W. Dunlap noted in The New York Times in March, Mr. Libeskind's proposal was strikingly similar to the earlier plans. It differed chiefly in the angular and fragmented forms of the buildings depicted in Mr. Libeskind's renderings. The problem is that those illustrations were not intended as designs for buildings, a task that in any case fell outside the scope of the planning tasks that the architect was hired to perform. Rather, they were stand-ins for the buildings that would be designed by the "other architects" that Mr. Libeskind himself had specified. That inclusiveness was possibly the best feature that his proposal had to recommend it.
I don't doubt that Mr. Libeskind and his supporters believe that artistic principles are at stake in the formulation of his guidelines. Even, or perhaps especially, considering the doubt that has already been raised about the wedge of light, the slurry wall and other features, I wouldn't expect them to think any other way.
But there are other ways to think, build and remember. Isn't this the point of freedom? The point of cities? The point of art? We need not recast our urban centers according to suburban styles of taste, or in the image of cities where rigid conformity is the rule.
"Art," Marshall McLuhan wrote, "is anything you can get away with." In that sense, at least, the guidelines are of the highest artistic order.

HEADLINE: A Global Democracy Policy 

 BODY:
Addressing the National Endowment for Democracy on Thursday, President Bush sought to look beyond the current bloody chaos in Iraq. Successfully implanting a democratic government in Iraq, he predicted, would energize a democratic revolution that would sweep away tyrannies from Cuba to North Korea. Specifically, Mr. Bush proclaimed a new "forward strategy" for advancing freedom in the Middle East, rightly declaring that 60 years of excusing and accommodating dictatorships there "did nothing to make us safe" because stability cannot be purchased at liberty's expense. 
 Mr. Bush spoke well. He is right that Washington has failed to support abroad the values Americans live by at home. Too often, putting realpolitik ahead of freedom has backfired, causing anti-American rage. Mr. Bush is not the first president to promise to put democracy at the forefront of American policy. We hope he does a better job delivering on his promises than some of his predecessors. 
 Unfortunately, his biggest experiment in democracy promotion has been in Iraq, and he has not been going about it in the most promising ways. As Iraqis are showing, even a terrorized population does not much enjoy foreign invasion and occupation. Nor does it help that Washington is running the show itself, keeping the United Nations and Iraqis mainly on the sidelines. 
The president's warning of the futility of excusing dictatorship in the name of security seems custom-made for Saudi Arabia, the original home of Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001. Promoting democracy there must become an urgent American priority. Washington should give itself more leverage for doing so by drastically decreasing American dependence on imported oil. The United States should alsoencourage the work of democracy campaigners in Egypt, Syria and Iran, providing them with educational and legal resources where appropriate and documenting and denouncing the crimes of dictatorial governments.
Another country where America relies too much on a dictator for security is Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country that harbors Kashmiri terrorists and lets Taliban military recruiters operate near its border with Afghanistan. President Pervez Musharraf's timely support for Washington in Afghanistan two years ago should not permanently immunize his dictatorship from needed criticism.
It is not surprising that Mr. Bush's speech paid homage to Ronald Reagan and his 1980's invocations of freedom's unstoppable momentum against a failed Soviet communism. Mr. Bush should remember what Mr. Reagan well understood: America's most effective cold war weapon was the power of its democratic ideas. The Reagan administration's support for democratic opposition movements across Central and Eastern Europe played a crucial role in hastening the Soviet empire's collapse. Washington's willingness to outspend Moscow on arms and maintain strong NATO defenses also helped. But there is a big difference between defending existing democracies and trying to create new ones through invasion and occupation.
America, with its reverence for law and freedom and its awesome economic power and cultural influence, is well equipped to help democrats around the world. To succeed in this vitally important endeavor, the Bush administration will have to learn to put the same kind of energy and resources into the diplomatic and educational sides of foreign policy as it has devoted to unilateral military action.

HEADLINE: JetBlue Backs Off on Move to Jamaica From Forest Hills 

BYLINE:  By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Attempts to lure JetBlue Airways into moving its headquarters to a planned $200 million office tower in Jamaica, Queens, appear all but dead for now, with the company saying the move would be too costly and would take longer than expected to complete.
 The three-year-old airline, based in Forest Hills, has been negotiating for months with the city and the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation about possibly relocating to the 500,000-square-foot building. The tower is to be the first phase of JFK Corporate Square, a major project hailed by economic development officials as an engine of commercial growth for Jamaica. 
 But yesterday, Richard Smyth, vice president of redevelopment for JetBlue, splashed cold water on the proposal, saying, "At this stage, it looks like it's not going to happen."
"We were approached and we considered it," Mr. Smyth said in a telephone interview. "However, the numbers did not work out. The move was supposed to be financially neutral, but it looks like it won't be."
Mr. Smyth added that the expected completion date for construction of the office building was further away than initially expected, causing additional complications. "The timing of the development was not, at this time, meeting our needs," he said. "The date had slipped from 2005 to 2006, and even beyond."
Still, Mr. Smyth would not rule out a move to the Jamaica site at some point. He said JetBlue had no other plans to leave its current headquarters.
Economic development officials reacted with puzzlement to JetBlue's statements, and insisted that talks over a possible move were still alive. Michael Sherman, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, said city officials expected to meet with JetBlue executives for further talks in the next two weeks.
"They did call us and said they had some concerns," he said. "But we're optimistic. We're still hopeful that we can make it work."
Mr. Sherman declined to comment on the negotiations with JetBlue or on what financial incentives, if any, the city might be prepared to offer. He called the airline "an incredibly important company for New York City."
A spokesman for the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, Sam Samuels, issued a statement saying, "We are still hopeful that the discussions the airline is having with the city will be fruitful."
The problems with the JFK Corporate Square proposal are unrelated to another major project by JetBlue and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey: the construction of a 26-gate terminal at Kennedy International Airport. That project, expected to cost $600 million, would greatly expand JetBlue's already dominant presence at the airport.
JFK Corporate Square, a 4.5 million-square-foot complex of office and retail space, would be built next to the Long Island Rail Road's Jamaica station and the new AirTrain rail line to Kennedy Airport. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has tentatively agreed to lease space in the first office tower to be built, and officials had been hoping that JetBlue would be the other major tenant.

HEADLINE: Job Figures Buoy Bush, but Democratic Hopefuls See Room to Attack 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM and ELISABETH BUMILLER; Elisabeth Bumiller reported for this article from Winston-Salem, N.C.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
The Democratic presidential candidates persisted in pounding President Bush about the economy on Friday, even in the face of new data showing strong growth in jobs last month that the president said was a vindication of his policies.
 "Good luck in using statistics to convince working Americans that the Bush administration has their economic interests at heart," Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said in Salem, N.H., in remarks typical of all the potential challengers. "The deep unfairness of the Bush economy is real to Americans." 
 Economic matters have long been the Democrats' strong suit. Now, although the jobs numbers suggest that the economic recovery may be genuine and that the issue may not be the sure winner it seemed a few months ago, the party's strategists said the candidates had no choice but to continue to play this hand. 
"I still think the race will be run on the economy," said Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, an organization of moderate Democrats. "But it won't be so much on the recent past as on the outlook for the future."
Another tactician who is not affiliated with any candidate, Howard Wolfson, said the improving jobs picture made "the argument on the economy tougher to make but still not impossible." 
Mr. Wolfson added, "What we have to argue is that he bought a short-term uptick in jobs at the expense of structural deficits as far as the eye can see."
Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser in the Clinton White House, encouraged Democratic candidates to use his calculations showing that even if the number of jobs increased every month between now and the election at last month's pace of 126,000 new jobs, it would still be the slowest recovery in terms of job creation since World War II.
In Winston-Salem, N.C., Mr. Bush said the employment figures released Friday were evidence that his policies were working. But with the state having lost more than 150,000 manufacturing jobs since July 2000 and struggling with one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation, he stopped short of triumphant claims of victory.
At a fund-raiser that brought in $1.1 million for his re-election campaign, the president said, "This administration has laid the foundation for greater prosperity and more jobs across America."
"We've had some good news recently about our economy," Mr. Bush added, "but we won't rest until everybody who wants to work can find a job."
Later, on a stage with students and administrators at Forsyth Technical Community College in Winston-Salem, he praised the college's retraining programs and said: "This is the beginning of good news for job seekers. Over the last three months, the economy, the entrepreneurs, the private sector and others have driven the job base up by 285,000 jobs, new jobs, which is good."
White House officials indicated that Mr. Bush's rather cautious tone was driven by the rough economic terrain in North Carolina. Mr. Bush is aware that his father was criticized in 1992 for paying too little respect to people in economic distress.
The Democratic presidential candidates insisted that they welcomed the good news on employment, but they said Mr. Bush's record was unimpressive.
"I hope that the economy will turn around," Gen. Wesley K. Clark said at a forum in Atlanta. But he said the employment increase was meager compared with the three million jobs lost during the Bush presidency. 
"The mission's not accomplished on the economy," General Clark said.
Like several other Democrats, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, campaigning in New Hampshire, focused on the line in the employment report on Friday showing that manufacturing jobs were still being lost. "I don't believe there is a sustained economic recovery happening," Mr. Edwards said.
Another Democratic theme was that Mr. Bush's economic policies were not only ineffective but also unfair. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri had no public events on Friday, but campaigning in Iowa earlier in the week, he said of the president: "He doesn't have a clue what to do. He has only one thing in his head: tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, that he follows by tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, that he follows by tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut also had no public events, but he issued a statement questioning whether the good news would be long-lived. "We have graduated from sinking to treading water," Mr. Lieberman said.
Howard Dean had only one public appearance on Friday. It was early, before the economic news had registered, and the former Vermont governor discussed only his policies for helping military veterans. 
In response to a reporter's question, a Dean spokesman, Jay Carson, said: "This administration has compiled the worst economic record of any administration since the Great Depression. It's going to take more than this to take this country out of the mess it has caused."
Not surprisingly, this early in the election campaign, the Democratic candidates do not have fully formed economic platforms. 
All of them criticize the three years of Bush tax cuts and say the resulting budget deficit is irresponsible. Mr. Gephardt and Dr. Dean would repeal the tax cuts entirely. Mr. Gephardt would use all the revenue to pay for health insurance for nearly all Americans. Dr. Dean would use some of the money to make health coverage more available and allocate the rest for job creation and domestic security.
The other leading Democratic candidates would repeal the tax cuts for the wealthiest people -- in most cases, those with incomes of more than $200,000 a year -- but would retain the cuts for everyone else.
All the candidates offer programs they say would create new jobs, but in most cases, their proposals are not developed to the point where the cost has been established and the legislative language written.

HEADLINE: Fine Print Is Given Full Voice in Campaign Ads 

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
In one of his television commercials, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts announces his candidacy for president before a throng of adoring, placard-waving supporters.
 But at the end of the spot, amid the roar of the crowd, Mr. Kerry abruptly steps from the podium, looks into the camera and shouts, "I'm John Kerry, and I approve this message!" 
 Such odd juxtapositions occur often in the first commercials of this election season because of a little-noticed provision of the new election law requiring candidates -- including President Bush, when his campaign begins running ads -- to pledge responsibility for their ads. 
Campaign strategists are in near-revolt over the rule, complaining that the words take up precious seconds, confuse voters and garble their messages while possibly violating free-speech rights.
"It's really clumsy and awkward to put in an ad," said Steve McMahon, whose firm is handling the advertising for Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont. "Focus groups say 'Of course you approve it, you wouldn't have said it.' "
Academics, lawmakers and lobbyists who helped write the provision said it was intended to force campaigns to stand by any attack ads they produce. That, some argued, could dissuade the production of such ads to begin with.
But the campaigns contend that it is unclear whether the provision will ultimately stanch the flow of negative political advertisements this election season anyway.
At the very least, strategists with every presidential campaign now advertising said the rule seemed silly at this early stage, when the vast majority of spots are positive.
"It's just one more example of reform gone amok," said David Axelrod, a consultant for Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. "It was meant to police negative ads, and now you have this absurd addendum to positive ads that makes absolutely no sense."
Campaign strategists said the provision could pose a particular problem for Mr. Bush, whose campaign is expected to unleash an unrivaled advertising blitz in the coming months.
Don Sipple, a Republican media strategist, said Mr. Bush's required presence in his own advertisements could interfere with any effort to keep him above the political fray. "It politicizes his role," Mr. Sipple said.
Nicolle Devenish, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, had no comment other than to say the campaign fully intended to follow the law.
Some complained that the statements take up precious air time.
"I understand what the genesis of it was: Stand by your ad," said Jim Margolis, a strategist for Mr. Kerry. "But this idea of spending four or five seconds in a 30-second ad declaring 'It's our ad' is a little crazy."
Mandy Grunwald, a media adviser to the campaign of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said the provision had even reduced the types of positive spots she can produce.
For instance, she said, during New Hampshire's Senate campaign in 2002, she made a commercial for former Gov. Jeanne Shaheen featuring millworkers crediting the candidate with saving their jobs. "That wouldn't have worked if at the end she had to come on to say something like 'I'm Jeanne Shaheen, I approve this message because I'm really appreciated,' " Ms. Grunwald said. "There are so many different kinds of ads you can't do properly with this language stuck in the middle of it."
No lobbying against the rule is under way, but the campaign advisers said it should be changed to focus solely on negative advertising. Election-reform advocates said there was no fair way to achieve that. 
"Who, pray tell, is going to decide which ads are positive and which ads are negative?" said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a campaign reform advocacy group.
For now, at least, the campaigns are stuck with the rule, a provision of the campaign-finance bill passed into law last year. Though the law is being challenged before the Supreme Court, the advertising regulation was not a target. 
Floyd Abrams, the lawyer representing opponents of the law, said he had lodged free-speech challenges against other parts of the law -- including a separate, narrower ad-disclaimer requirement -- that could lead to the end of the provision about commercials if successful. "That a candidate who wants to put an ad on television has to assert, in a rather stupid-sounding manner, 'I stand behind the views I just articulated' certainly has a First Amendment price," Mr. Abrams said.
But advocates for the law said they believed that the regulation would probably stand regardless of the court decision. And, they contended, no real free-speech issue existed: The rule simply stiffened looser existing disclaimer requirements.
The provision was first raised by campaign reform advocates years ago after voters condemned nasty ads whose sponsorship was often difficult to discern. 
"Many viewers have complained that when they see these ads they have no idea whose they are," said Trevor Potter, general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, a political reform advocacy group. "The goal here is to make the disclaimers more efficient."
The new regulation requires candidates to use their own voices to endorse their advertisements while their images are covering at least 80 percent of the television screen. The most popular solution so far has been to write the statements into the scripts. For instance, toward the end of a spot in which Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri spoke with a couple enduring economic woes, he told the TV audience, "I'm Dick Gephardt and I approved this message because I want to stop George Bush and fight for America's middle class."
Strategists said they faced a harder task to work the approvals into tougher spots. Bill Carrick, a senior adviser to Mr. Gephardt, said, "It's going to be hard to do a negative ad that is a classic 'John Q. Candidate kicks his dog' and then come on and say 'Hi, I'm Bill Carrick.' " 
Some consultants predicted, though, that independent groups could move in to pick up the slack. Whatever the case, some experts wondered whether the candidate approvals would truly ward off negative advertising in a heated race. "You could say it in the context of another attack," said Ken Goldstein, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin. " 'Snodgrass beats his wife and I approve this message because I really believe that my opponent really does beat his wife.' "

Sniper Trial Prosecution Heartens Defense in a 2nd
Lawyers for Lee Malvo, the younger suspect in the wave of sniper shootings that terrorized the Washington area last fall, have taken heart at the first weeks of the trial of the other defendant, John A.

HEADLINE: 3 Months of Job Growth Best in 3 Years 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The longest hiring slump in more than 60 years appears to be finally ending.
 Employment grew by 126,000 jobs in October, the best showing in nine months, and job growth in August and September was stronger than the government initially estimated, the Labor Department reported yesterday. It was the greatest job growth over three months since late 2000. 
 The unemployment rate fell slightly last month, to 6 percent from 6.1 percent in September. 
"We've turned the corner," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Banc of America Securities. "Businesses are finally shedding some of their cautiousness." 
Restaurants, real estate companies, doctor's offices and other parts of the giant service sector added to their payrolls. The number of people working part time because they could not find full-time work fell by 139,000, to 4.8 million. Average hourly wages rose by just a single cent, but an increase in hours, as businesses worked harder to keep up with rising demand, fattened weekly paychecks.
Still, the recent job gains remain modest by many measures. They are not large enough to keep up with the growth of the labor force over the long term and are far smaller than the average gain over the last 50 years when the economy was growing as rapidly as it has been recently. 
For both the economy and the 2004 presidential campaign, a central question becomes whether hiring will continue to accelerate even as the recent stimulus from tax cuts and low interest rates fades.
The report offered obvious political benefits for the White House, which has credited the three tax cuts passed since 2001 with softening the economic slump and predicted that they would eventually lead to job growth.
"We're delighted," said N. Gregory Mankiw, the chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. "I think we'll see robust job growth going forward."
Mr. Bush, speaking in Winston-Salem, N.C., said, "This administration has laid the foundation for greater prosperity and more jobs across America." He added that he would not rest "until everybody who wants to work can find a job."
The recent job gains have already complicated life for Democrats, who have made the severe job losses a centerpiece of their political message. On the campaign trail yesterday, however, they continued to attack Mr. Bush's record on the economy. Page A11. 
Representative Pete Stark of California, the ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, noted that the current pace of job growth would need to continue for 19 months for the country to return to the peak employment level reached in early 2001.
The stock market changed little after the report's release, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,053.21, down 0.5 percent. But the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes rose to the highest level since September, suggesting that investors were more confident that economic growth would remain healthy.
The job increases represent clear progress after two and a half years of layoffs and weak hiring that have sliced the nation's payrolls by more than 2.5 million jobs, the biggest decline since the early 1980's.
Most forecasters say that interest rates that are still low and the large tax refunds that many families can expect next spring will help keep household spending strong through early next year. By then, the economy will have enough momentum -- in the form of rising employment and business investment -- to grow at a healthy pace without the help of government stimulus, the economists say.
In the three months ended Sept. 30, the economy expanded 7.2 percent, the fastest rate since 1984.
"The fundamentals of the economy are lined up pretty darn well," John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary, said in a phone interview. "This recovery is beginning to take hold."
A smaller group of economists remain concerned, however, that the same forces that prevented job growth in 2002 and early 2003, despite the economy's expansion, will continue to mute hiring next year. They point out that even many service-sector companies are moving jobs to countries with lower wages and that the steps business have taken to become more efficient allow them to make more goods with fewer workers.
"We've really boosted growth with a Herculean stimulus effort," said Lakshman R. Achuthan, managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York, referring to interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve and the tax cuts. "And we have only 100,000-plus jobs."
The economy must add about 150,000 jobs or more each month to keep up with population growth and bring down the jobless rate over a long period of time. In the 1990's, the economy created an average of 181,000 jobs a month.
In a recent survey, only 12 percent of chief executives of large companies said that they planned to increase employment in the last three months of this year, according to the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group made up of the executives. Thirty-six percent said they would reduce their work forces.
If the job gains do continue, they will increase the odds that the Fed will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate during the first half of next year. Since June, the Fed has kept the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at its lowest level since 1958 in an effort to jump-start the economy.
Low interest rates have led to a surge in mortgage refinancing, giving many families more cash to spend, and also decreased the cost of many other types of loans.
The job market also began showing signs of life late last year, when employment grew during four consecutive months, only to deteriorate early this year. But the 2002 increase -- 205,000 new jobs in four months -- was not as large as the 286,000 gain in the last three months.
In October, the service sector, construction industry, and state and local governments all added to their payrolls. 
Kohl's, the department store chain, opened 48 stores last month as part of its continued expansion and since August has hired about 140 workers, on average, at each store, a company spokeswoman said. Since July, Microsoft has hired about 1,300 workers, many of whom will work on software for cellphones and other machines that are not computers. 
These increases and others outweighed job cuts at federal agencies and manufacturers. Still struggling against foreign competition, manufacturers cut jobs for the 39th consecutive month, but the loss was the smallest since the early months of the streak. 
The recent upturn in jobs has helped college graduates, who have suffered over the last two years more than they typically do during a downturn. But the jobless rates for workers with only a high school education and for blacks increased, while the rates fell for whites, Latinos and college graduates. 
The labor market recovery "is still in its early stages and still somewhat fragile," Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman Brothers, wrote in a note to clients yesterday. "This is at most the beginning of the end, not the end itself."

HEADLINE: Our Man In Havana 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It would take some chutzpah for me to accuse President Bush, Congressional Democrats and a courageous Nobel Peace Prize-winning dissident of bolstering some of the world's most odious dictators.
 But here goes. 
 The Bush administration has variously backed, threatened, acquiesced in or hinted at tough new sanctions against Cuba, Syria, North Korea and Burma. Democrats helped lead the fight for a new ban on imports from Burma. And the gutsy Nobel laureate from Burma, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, backs sanctions that help impoverish her own people. 
The U.S. imposed 85 new unilateral economic sanctions on foreign nations from 1996 to 2001. But sanctions, which cost U.S. companies up to $19 billion in 1995 alone, aren't a policy; they're a feel-good substitute for one. Usually they hurt just the people we're trying to help.
Fortunately, the Senate last month joined the House in voting to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba. There is now some hope that the U.S. will dismantle the Cuba sanctions, which have hurt ordinary Cubans while helping Fidel Castro, giving him a scapegoat for his economic failures.
Take Burma (or Myanmar, as its thuggish generals have tried to rename it). Republicans and Democrats alike approved tough new sanctions against Burma this year, by a vote of 97 to 1 in the Senate. 
The reality is that Western sanctions have already been failing in Burma for the last 14 years, as they have for more than 40 years in Cuba, as they did for a dozen years in Iraq. We should have learned from Iraq that arms embargoes and U.N. inspections can do some good, while economic sanctions kill children. The claim that sanctions killed 500,000 Iraqi children, a figure that originated in a Unicef report, was probably exaggerated, but no one doubts that U.N. sanctions contributed to child malnutrition and mortality in Iraq.
The U.S. State Department says in a new report that our July ban on Burmese imports has already led to 30,000 to 40,000 layoffs in the garment industry, and that ultimately 100,000 Burmese may lose jobs. Most of them are young women who have no other way of earning a living, and the State Department says that some are being forced, or duped, into prostitution (where many will be killed by AIDS). 
"We do believe that some of those young women have gone into the sex trade," said Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, although he defended sanctions and said that they would eventually make life better in Burma. So in the best-case scenario, we're ousting 100,000 people from their jobs -- while the generals keep theirs.
The Burmese are already living on the margins: one child in 10 dies before the age of 5, 44 percentof children are malnourished, and 58 percent of pregnant women are so poorly fed that they have anemia. Fewer births are attended by a trained nurse now than back in 1982.
So our sanctions will cause babies to die, young women to succumb to AIDS and families to go hungry. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has shown exceptional courage in standing up to Burma's generals and the harm they cause. She should also be brave enough to back down and call for ending sanctions that hurt her people.
If we knew that sanctions would lead to a better Burma, I could understand sacrificing helpless young women. But when sanctions, especially unilateral ones, are mostly ineffective -- one major study found that they worked to some degree one-third of the time -- why are we so eager to adopt measures that impose such suffering on innocent Burmese, or Cubans or Syrians?
In fairness, I was also skeptical of sanctions against South Africa, and in retrospect I was wrong: partly because they were multilateral, they were one of many factors that led to peaceful change there. But in the more typical cases of Iraq, Haiti, Cuba and North Korea, sanctions have seemed only to empower dictators. And when dictatorships crumbled in places like Indonesia, Taiwan, South Korea, Brazil, Spain and Portugal, it was because growing wealth nurtured a middle class, not because of sanctions.
That's why I fervently hope that Congress's push for easier travel to Cuba marks a sea change in attitudes toward sanctions. They are ill suited to a complex world where a senator can nobly stand before the cameras to denounce Burmese tyrants, and the upshot is that a child on the other side of the world dies of hunger.

New York City Has Ally In Latest Tourism Push

BYLINE:  By KATE ZERNIKE 

 BODY:
THIS fall, New York City tourism officials inaugurated their newest goodwill ambassador: a cartoon bunny named Miffy who stars in a series of children's books, including the latest, "Miffy Loves New York City!" in which she extols the wonders of the five boroughs (pretzels, the Plaza, Ellis Island and the Empire State Building, to name a few). 
 Tourism officials hope Miffy's tale -- part picture book (illustrated by Dick Bruna), part guide, and available in bookstores across the country (you can get a glimpse at www.nycvisit.com) -- will lure more families to the city. They are trying to build on one of the city's recent successes: families helped lift New York's tourism numbers out of the severe slump that followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 According to recently released statistics by NYC & Company, the city's tourism agency, 35.25 million tourists visited New York City in 2002, up from 35.15 million in 2001. That was not quite as high as 2000, the peak year, with 36.2 million visitors. Still, the city set records in three categories: tourists from within the United States (30.2 million), tourists traveling with family (10.7 million) and leisure travelers (25.9 million). 
 Two weak spots remained: the number of tourists from overseas dropped 10 percent from 2001, to 5.1 million. And the number of business travelers declined for the second year in a row, by 7 percent, to 9.4 million.
 Tourism officials credit what they call patriotic tourism for the rise in domestic visitors after the terrorist attacks. At the Empire State Building, for example, the number of visitors from Jan. 1 through September 2001 declined 67 percent compared to the same period the year before. But it shot up 115 percent in the same period in 2002. Over all, the city was second only to Orlando -- with its theme parks - in the number of domestic travelers.
 "People felt strongly about paying respects to New York City, and if they traveled, they did not want to leave their family at home," said Cristyne L. Nicholas, president of NYC & Company. "What we're usually finding with the families is that it's their first visit to New York City, and they're usually wearing red, white and blue." 
 Many international and business travelers seemed to wait until the first anniversary of the attacks had passed to return to New York. Their numbers rebounded in the last four months of 2002, with almost twice as many visiting in those four months as in the same period the year before.
 Still, the city is feeling the drop in international visitors. Foreign travelers made up about 14 percent of all tourists in 2002, but they generally account for 40 percent of the spending at hotels, restaurants and stores. 
 Half of New York City's visitors come from New York or bordering states -- Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut -- and the biggest proportion of tourists are day-trippers. Only half of all families stay overnight, and hotel occupancy rates in 2002 and 2003 have not nearly rebounded to 2000 levels, when the city's roughly 70,000 hotel rooms were, on average, 85 percent occupied. The occupancy rate was 75 percent in 2002 (with about the same number of rooms) up slightly from 2001, but visitor spending declined 7 percent, to $14.1 billion.
 "I met people from Ukraine and Japan today, but you just don't hear as many foreign languages as you did three years ago in the halls," said Harold Holzer, the vice president for communications at the Metropolitan Museum, which had 4.9 million visitors in 2002, down from 5 million in 2000. "It's part recession, part post-9/11 fallout."
 Esther Barbosa, director of sales for the Fitzgerald Manhattan Hotel, which is popular with British and Irish travelers, said: "Anti-Americanism is up. That has been a huge issue for us." In addition, she said, "People feel that the United States is a little more dangerous now."
 Officials note the 12 percent decline in international visitors nationwide in 2002 from 2001. New York still attracts more international tourists than any other city, and lost fewer visitors than Miami and Los Angeles, its closest competitors. 
 To win back tourists after the Sept. 11 attacks, city officials changed their "Paint the Town" campaign to "Paint the Town Red, White and Blue" and redesigned the nycvisit.com Web site to allow tourists to book hotels and travel packages.
 To woo international tourists, officials got the State Department to delay for a year its requirement for machine-readable passports. The requirement is to go into effect next October. NYC & Company has recently opened promotional offices in Paris and Munich, adding to one in London. With French visits down 30 percent since 2001, it also hired a French marketing firm. 
 The agency is making a special push to win back Japanese tourists. Ads in Japan feature Hideki Matsui, the Yankees left fielder. City officials also hope to publish a Japanese version of the Miffy book. 
 "They're big spenders," Ms. Nicholas said. "It's been about 12 years that their economy has been soft, and we think there's pent-up demand, and some recovery."
 With hotel rates still low -- an average of $201 this September compared with $256 in September 2000 and $195 last September - occupancy levels are beginning to rebound. More business travelers, when they do come, are staying overnight. 
The city is projecting 35.9 million visitors for 2003, with a slight increase in domestic travelers and a roughly 5 percent increase in international travelers, to 5.4 million. If the forecasts hold true, overall spending is expected to rise to $15.1 billion, about what it was in 2001.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY; 
Stronger Canadian Dollar Weakens Tourism

BYLINE:  By SUSAN CATTO 

 BODY:
With the Canadian dollar at its strongest in nearly a decade, visiting Canada has become less of a bargain for travelers from the United States. Until recently, Americans could count on highly favorable exchange rates; in 2002, for example, one United States dollar bought an average of $1.57 Canadian. At the start of November, the typical credit card rate was about $1.34. (Put the other way, the Canadian dollar was worth 64 U.S. cents in 2002 but is worth about 77 cents now.) 
 The Canadian dollar began its ascent early in 2003, propelled by relatively high interest rates and a strong economy inCanada and the weakening United States currency. For Americans, this means travel to Canada costs about 20 percent more than it did last year, even with no change in prices. 
 At the Fairmont the Queen Elizabeth hotel in Montreal, a standard room has held steady at $229 Canadian, but the cost in U.S. dollars has gone up by $30, from $153 on Oct. 21, 2002, to $183 a year later. (These prices reflect the hotel's exchange rate, which differs slightly from bank rates.) A two-night package at the Deerhurst Resort in Huntsville, Ontario, at $520 Canadian, cost $337 U.S. last January, when the dollar bought $1.54 Canadian; now, it's about $390. 
 The change is most noticeable on big-ticket trips. Peter Oickle, head of Atlantic Canada Nature Safaris, estimates that his eight-day all-inclusive tours of Nova Scotia cost Americans about $250 more than they did last year. (The Canadian price is $2,425.) 
 The strong dollar is just one of many woes affecting travel to Canada, which sustained a 14 percent drop in the number of visitors from other countries in the second quarter of 2003 compared to the first quarter. 
 The factors, said Rod J. Harris, president of Tourism British Columbia in Vancouver, included "everything from the Iraq war to SARS and forest fires," adding, "Those geopolitical and environmental forces probably have more impact on travel than the variable exchange rate." 
 Still, with some economists predicting that the U.S. dollar could drop as low as $1.25 Canadian next year, Canadian tourism's recovery could prove difficult. 
 For Canadians, the cost of a vacation in the United States is suddenly less prohibitive, something some tourism agencies have been quick to exploit. Officials in Spokane, Wash., are actively recruiting tourists from Alberta and British Columbia, and a new Canadian link on the Spokane Regional Convention and Visitors Bureau Web site attracted 1,194 hits in its first month, much more than usual promotions, according to Nancy Goodspeed, a bureau spokeswoman. The main draw: a list of hotels and attractions that accept the Canadian dollar at par. SUSAN CATTO

HEADLINE: WINTER IN THE SNOW; 
Change Is in the Air at Mammoth

BYLINE:  By TIM GOLDEN; TIM GOLDEN is a journalist in New York.

 BODY:
FOR years now, some of the most caustic debate over the future of Mammoth Lakes, Calif., has centered not on the quirky ski town itself but on a lonely, windswept stretch of ground about six miles away, just off Highway 395.
 It is there, at the tiny Mammoth-Yosemite Airport, that developers and their allies see a crucial next step in the resort's transformation into a national and even international destination. Having long depended on California skiers willing to drive six or seven hours each way, Mammoth's expansionists want to widen and lengthen the airport's runway to accommodate midsized passenger jets like Boeing 757's. 
 It is also at the airport, which now serves only smaller private planes, that Mammoth's preservationists see a last dagger pointed at their laid-back way of life. Their nightmare is of jets roaring over the magnificent Eastern Sierras, of affluent hordes rolling in from Dallas and Chicago. In no time, they say, Mammoth could become another Aspen, or close enough. 
The airport battle was stilled at least temporarily last April, when a federal district judge in San Francisco ruled that Federal Aviation Administration must produce a comprehensive environmental impact statement before going ahead with the $30 million overhaul. This process is expected to take more than a year. 
Whatever the fate of its airport, though, it is quickly becoming apparent that Mammoth's future is already here. This season, the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area and the Intrawest Corporation, the Vancouver, British Columbia, development company that swooped in to help remake the resort in 1996, will cut the ribbon on some of the biggest pieces of a $1 billion makeover that is perhaps the most ambitious in American skiing. 
Mammoth residents are not yet finished arguing about the impact of the changes on their community. But for out-of-state visitors willing to brave both a flight and a drive (165 miles from Reno, 310 from Los Angeles), this winter may be a great opportunity to judge the transformation for themselves before the crowds get bigger.
On Nov. 26, three weeks after Mammoth's official opening day, a new, high-speed gondola is scheduled to begin running skiers from the edge of town to the base of the mountain, making that trip possible for the first time without a car or shuttle bus. The gondola is the latest in a long series of lift improvements that have reduced the once-endless weekend lines and opened up new trails on one of the biggest and most challenging ski mountains in North America.
A new 17,000-square-foot day lodge will open beside the gondola, offering not only lift tickets and rentals but also a special floor for children and even space for wedding receptions. The Mammoth Mountain Inn, the dowdy old lodge at the foot of the mountain, has been partly remodeled. Summer tweaking of the various rails and half-pipes is said to have improved the terrain parks that have made Mammoth a favorite of the more X-minded snowboarders and skiers in recent years.
The biggest of the big-ticket items is a 20-acre development, the Village at Mammoth, a four-story complex of restaurants, shopping areas and high-end condominiums that its developers say will be the critical mass Mammoth never had.
"Mammoth was really like Oakland: there was no 'there' there," said Dana C. Severy, who oversaw the planning and development of Intrawest's properties at Mammoth. "The Village provides some gravity. It's the ingredient that's always been missing in terms of a town center."
Like Los Angeles, its primary source of visitors, Mammoth has always been a car town. Its restaurants, motels and ski shops lined a half-dozen small strip malls and a few main streets, most of which did not even have sidewalks. Condominium developments spread from the edges of the town to the base of the mountain and the Forest Service land that surrounds it.
When I started skiing at Mammoth in the 1970's, one of the keys to a good day was to start out early enough to find a parking space within a half-mile's hike to the lifts. Things have improved with the addition and expansion of two base lodges closer to town, but it is still hard to imagine spending even a weekend in Mammoth without a car.
How much the Village might shift Mammoth's center of gravity remains to be seen. Its nice pedestrian mall and ersatz European styling notwithstanding, some residents seem to have taken more note of the franchise outlets like Starbucks and Ben & Jerry's. Most of the town's popular restaurants and bars are some distance away.
But Intrawest is working from a well-tested formula. The company helped to develop two of Canada's most successful ski resorts, Whistler-Blackcomb in British Columbia and Tremblant in Quebec. Among its other ski resort properties are Copper Mountain in Colorado, Stratton Mountain in Vermont, Snowshoe in West Virginia and Mountain Creek in New Jersey.
What Intrawest saw on Mammoth Mountain is clear. It has always had some of the best skiing in the West. With a summit of 11,053 feet, it averages 32 feet of snow a year, and its season often stretches from before Thanksgiving through Memorial Day.
Above the tree line, Mammoth is a mecca for strong skiers and boarders. I was reminded of its joys one afternoon last spring, when the top of the mountain opened up after a two-day dump of new snow.
Such moments at Mammoth have always brought giddy stampedes for fresh tracks: the hungriest powder skiers lurk by the chairlifts that reach just shy of the summit -- No. 3, which parallels the summit's Panorama Gondola, No. 5 to its left and No. 23 to its right. When the first tell-tale cars swing out of the gondola station, the rush is on.
On the best days, there is a surfeit of good options once you arrive at the top. The volcanic shoulders of the mountain are covered with wide bowls that are a joyous experience in deep snow. On steep, open runs like Scotty's, one can ski almost a straight line to the bottom, hop the gondola back up and do it again.
The top of the mountain is cut with steep, rocky chutes that carry appropriately forbidding names: Wipe Out, Hangman's Hollow, Huevos Grande. When the wind whips up the face of the mountain, as it loves to do, even the prospect of dropping into wider runs like Climax and the Cornice Bowl can shrivel one's courage to nothing.
But there are lots of ways down. Toward the end of a long day, I realized that I had skied six or seven different runs from the top -- and it had only opened up after lunch. 
The bottom half of the mountain is as comfortably blue-green as the top is forbiddingly black, and even more expansive. Twenty of the mountain's 27 chair lifts and gondolas serve this lower part , which mixes "the corduroy," as ski people call the groomed runs, with narrower alleys through the trees and a few more bowls and steeps.
"Mammoth is a skier's mountain," said Doug Ogilvy, the regional vice president for Intrawest. "We've got the terrain. We've got the snow. We've got the sunshine. If we can improve the resort experience at the Village and elsewhere in the community, we think we can compete with anybody."
At the peak of its popularity, in the mid-1980's, Mammoth also had weekend lift lines that recalled the freeway traffic jams that many of the out-of-towners had fought through to get there. As resorts in Utah and Colorado became more easily accessible, thousands of Southern Californians quit making the drive. After attracting 1.4 million skiers in 1985-86, Mammoth saw its annual visitors plunge to 767,000 in 1993-94.
There were other conspirators in the drop, a multiyear drought and the long California recession among them. But Intrawest and the McCoy family, which had owned the mountain, also saw problems they might profitably attack: creaky old lifts, mediocre mountain services and a sagging nightlife, not to mention the travel time.
Since Intrawest bought 33 percent of the ski area in 1996 (it later increased its shares to 58 percent, while leaving voting control with the McCoys), Mammoth has replaced all of its outdated lifts, expanded its snowmaking and revamped or rebuilt all of its lodges. The modernization has improved the capacity of the lifts to 55,570 rides an hour from 41,338 in 1985. 
The advent of high-speed quad chairs has made it possible to ski Mammoth up one face and down another, chasing the best snow and shortest lines. While the weekends and holidays can get crowded, most weekdays are, by comparison, blissfully empty.
That emptiness is a continuing cause of concern for the developers. But if they don't seem overly worried, it may be because of another set of indicators. Since Intrawest came to town, property values have increased at a dizzying rate. By various calculations, real estate prices have risen perhaps fivefold over the last decade. And Intrawest's betting seems to be that the boom isn't over. 
The Village that has risen on Minaret Road, for example, is merely the first phase of at least four or five that are planned. (The second phase is already under construction.) The company is negotiating with the Westin chain to operate a 313-bed hotel, and it expects to add some 750 more condominium units to the 166 there already. Other developers are planning to build 1,000 condominium units in the same area. 
Intrawest is also negotiating with the Four Seasons chain to build a 350-room luxury hotel beside a golf course at yet another high-end condominium complex. 
"The development projects that are planned are about to avalanche over us," said Mammoth's mayor, Rick Wood, a vocal supporter of the plans. "I think we are doing well, but we are now having to deal with the consequences of our success."
By Mr. Wood's admission, the real estate boom has priced most working-class families out of the market if they didn't already own a home and created a severe shortage of affordable rental housing. "You can't find anything in this town for less than $500,000," he said, with a hint of satisfaction.
Many of Mammoth's 7,000-odd residents are less pleased by the gentrification.
"A lot of families are moving out," Greg Newbry, a senior planner for Mono County, which encompasses Mammoth, said. "A lot of the new property owners are affluent people from places like Los Angeles. The sense of soul, the sense of home, seems to be escaping us."
There is still some quirky charm to be found. Breakfast at the Stove, on Old Mammoth Road, remains a chaotic banquet of oversized pancakes, egg dishes and biscuits. The morning lines are equally long at Schat's Bakery and Cafe on Main Street.
Comical echoes of Mammoth's swinging 1970's bar scene come with the steaks at two old standards, the Chart House and Whiskey Creek. On Mexican night (which tends to be more Tex-Mex or Cal-Mex), my favorite is Roberto's. But high-end renovation has come to Mammoth's food, too, with good new restaurants like Skadi, a vaguely Scandinavian restaurant that looks out at the mountains from atop a strip mall. 
There is still the challenge of attracting visitors from beyond California. Despite the mountain's improvements and a considerable marketing effort, Mammoth continues to draw 87 percent of its visitors from inside the state. Town officials and developers said the federal court ruling in April, requiring a full environmental impact statement before the Mammoth airfield can be overhauled, could delay the introduction of larger jets until at least two winters from now.
For the time being, the developers are resisting a less-controversial alternative proposal to refurbish the runway of an airfield at Bishop, Calif., about 45 minutes away. They are also trying to revive commercial service to the Mammoth airport from Southern California with a regional carrier and much smaller jets. 
Pam Murphy, a senior vice president for the mountain, said the improved Mammoth airfield had been expected to bring in no more than 36,000 out-of-state visitors over its first winter. Eventually, though, proponents of the project hope it will help level out the area's surge-prone flow of visitors. 
"We need 500 instructors during Christmas vacation, and we need 100 on a typical Wednesday," she said. "It's just a very roller-coaster way to do business."
It isn't hard to understand the argument, especially when you hear it from small-business owners in town who struggle with similar ups and downs. Selfishly, though, I can only hope it takes a while before the empty weekday of skiing in the Sierras becomes one more thing of Mammoth's past.

 BAYARD RUSTIN became famous for working behind the scenes. This paradox of his celebrity was, to a large degree, inherent in the role he chose to play in the history of his time. From the end of the Great Depression to his death in 1987, at the age of 75, Rustin was the "master strategist of social change," as the historian John D'Emilio writes in his biography, "Lost Prophet." The tactics of public protest that became familiar in the 1960's -- marches on Washington, Freedom Rides, sit-ins, passive resistance, civil disobedience -- were pioneered and refined by Rustin two decades earlier. Indeed, through his decisive influence on Martin Luther King Jr., whom he instructed in the philosophy and tactics of Gandhian nonviolence, Rustin created the model for the social movements of post-World War II America -- civil rights, antiwar, gay liberation, feminist. "He resurrected mass peaceful protest from the graveyard in which cold war anti-Communism had buried it," D'Emilio writes, "and made it once again a vibrant expression of citizen rights in a free society."
On four continents, he was esteemed for his mastery of nuts and bolts: "precisely the number of toilets that would be needed . . . how many doctors, how many first-aid stations, what people should bring with them to eat in their lunches." Rustin played major roles in two defining social protests: the Aldermaston march in England in 1958, in which 10,000 people demonstrated against nuclear weapons, and, most famously, the March on Washington in 1963, in which a quarter-million people (more than double the anticipated turn-out and including fully 1 percent of the country's black population) turned out, evidence of a national consensus in support of black rights. The result of eight frantic and exhilarating weeks of work, in which, as D'Emilio writes, Rustin "had to build an organization out of nothing," the March on Washington epitomized why Newsweek called him "a genius at organization." 
Characteristically, however, in the immediate aftermath of the march, he was already looking ahead. He had been "aiming for more than individual resistance," as D'Emilio writes. "He wanted to stimulate a movement." As he wrote in one of the pieces collected in "Time on Two Crosses," the March on Washington was "the termination of the mass protest period -- during which Negroes had destroyed the Jim Crow institutions in the South -- and the inauguration of an era of massive action at the ballot box designed to bring about new economic programs." Pointing out that the theme of the march had been "Jobs and Freedom," he declared that "the civil rights movement will be advanced only to the degree that social and economic welfare gets to be inextricably entangled with civil rights."
Such emphasis made Rustin almost unique among the major figures of the civil rights movement; along with an appeal to morality, he had an economics of equality. Perhaps that is why he had such extraordinary perceptiveness concerning what directions the movement should take as the struggle moved north in the latter half of the 60's. In the South, "no profound analysis, no overriding social theory was needed in order both to locate and understand the injustices that were to be combated," he wrote. "All that was demanded of one was sufficient courage to demonstrate against them." (Rustin spoke with the authority of experience. In 1942, his defiance of Jim Crow seating on a bus near Nashville earned him a beating in the police station, which he endured with such Gandhian sang-froid that the frustrated police chief cried, "Nigger, you're supposed to be scared when you come in here!" Five years later, following a Supreme Court decision declaring segregation in interstate travel unconstitutional, Rustin was part of the first Freedom Ride, for which he served 22 days on a North Carolina chain gang.)
However, Rustin continued, "the evils in the North are not easy to understand and fight against." These, Rustin emphasized, "are problems which, while conditioned by Jim Crow, do not vanish upon its demise. They are more deeply rooted in our socioeconomic order; they are the result of the total society's failure to meet not only the Negro's needs but human needs generally." In Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, Rustin perceived the promise of social democracy in the United States; the civil rights coalition -- "Negroes, trade unionists, liberals and religious groups" -- could act, in a union of enlightened self-interest, to achieve what Rustin called "the Freedom Budget," in effect a domestic Marshall Plan that would devote $185 billion to job creation.
This program (and vision) represented the summation of Rustin's wide-ranging career up to the mid-60's. When he arrived in Depression-era Harlem from his native West Chester, Pa., in 1937, the 25-year-old Rustin "was an eager young explorer of the American left," D'Emilio writes, briefly engaged with the Communist Party before its cynical exploitation of the race issue disillusioned him (as it did other young black intellectuals like Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison). His thinking was molded by his association with A. J. Muste, the militant pacifist ("we must resolutely carry our political task to the end"), and A. Philip Randolph, the socialist labor leader; Rustin was a youth leader with Randolph's March on Washington Movement of 1941, whose threatened demonstration forced President Franklin Roosevelt to ban racial discrimination in federal and defense hiring and to establish a Fair Employment Practices Committee. 
A quarter of a century's worth of work with pacifist organizations confirmed Rustin's belief in direct action -- that principle had to be found in practice, a belief with immense social repercussions, as Gandhi had demonstrated in India. (His greatest pupil in this regard was, of course, King, for whom Rustin was an adviser beginning with the Montgomery bus boycott in 1956: "Rustin was as responsible as anyone else for the insinuation of nonviolence into the very heart of what became the most powerful social movement in 20th-century America," D'Emilio writes.) From Randolph, his constant protector in the deadly turf wars among civil rights organizations (D'Emilio gives superb detail on this surprisingly understudied topic), Rustin learned the importance of attention to bread-and-butter issues and of the proper use of protest. "A demonstration should have an immediately achievable target," as Rustin put it. He came to see that the goal of protest, social reform, necessitated political participation -- itself the mark of inclusion in a society. "The issue is which coalition to join and how to make it responsive to your program," he wrote. "Necessarily there will be compromise. But the difference between expediency and morality in politics is the difference between selling out a principle and making smaller concessions to win larger ones. The leader who shrinks from this task reveals not his purity but his lack of political sense."
And so, after his great triumph in 1963, Rustin proposed transforming the civil rights movement "from a protest movement into a full-fledged social movement." As Robert Penn Warren noted in 1965, in his book "Who Speaks for the Negro?," Rustin "had anticipated the direction in which lately more and more of the Negro leaders have been moving"; King, it will be remembered, was planning his Poor People's Campaign when he was assassinated in 1968. 
But Rustin discovered that the momentum of social protest is hard to redirect. Three months after the March on Washington, he told the youthful members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee -- who constituted, as D'Emilio says, "the most courageous group of activists in the country" -- "The ability to go to jail should not be substituted for a social reform program." Their response? "SNCC had to work on discrimination and not worry about the broader economic issues." 
Moreover, in pinning his hopes on Johnson, Rustin -- oddly for a lifelong peace activist -- did not foresee how Vietnam would subvert the Great Society. He recognized that "a perilous polarization is taking place in our society," caused by the war and the generation gap. "But generations come and go and so do foreign policies. The issue of race, however, has been with us since our earliest beginnings as a nation." Such statements caused him to become "a target of intense ire" from white radicals, who, as D'Emilio shows, were abandoning the civil rights movement long before Stokely Carmichael uttered the fateful words "black power." For the rest of his life, despite his continued activism, Rustin witnessed the increasing decadence of public protest in the United States -- reduced to symbolic gestures like colored ribbons, the narcissism of identity politics and that most fatuous of slogans, "the personal is political." As he wrote, "People who seek social change will, in the absence of real substantive victories, often seize upon stylistic substitutes."
This trivialization of the political threatens to engulf Rustin himself; in the current fashion, he is studied less as an activist exemplar than as a putative victim. The editors of "Time on Two Crosses" -- Devon W. Carbado, a professor of law and African-American studies at U.C.L.A., and Donald Weise, an editor of "Black Like Us: A Century of Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual African-American Fiction" -- write that "Rustin remained an outsider in black civil rights circles for much of his life. He was openly gay." D'Emilio -- who teaches history and gender and women's studies at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and is the author of the groundbreaking "Sexual Politics, Sexual Communities: The Making of a Homosexual Minority in the United States, 1940-1970" -- several times refers to "the stigma of his sexuality" and declares that Rustin's homosexuality "severely restricted the public roles he was allowed to assume." But his own scholarship shows quite the opposite. 
Rustin was remarkably open for a pre-Stonewall gay man. A lover from his youth told D'Emilio: "I never had any sense at all that Bayard felt any shame or guilt about his homosexuality. And that was rare in those days. Rare." The shame came in Pasadena in 1953, when Rustin was convicted on a morals charge, the result of improvident cruising. The incident was devastating personally, caused a rupture with his mentor, Muste, and left Rustin vulnerable to scandal. Always publicity-conscious, the heads of the major civil rights organizations (Randolph always excepted) camouflaged their turf jealousy with a veiled prejudice. However, it does not minimize recognition of the venomous bigotry directed at gay people to note that Rustin's civil rights activism was virtually unimpaired by his homosexuality or (remarkably) by his arrest record -- no small matter in a movement predicated on moralism. 
Indeed, D'Emilio documents that the major civil rights leaders, as well as the establishment press, rallied in support of Rustin when the Southern demagogue Strom Thurmond attempted to smear him as a pervert (and a Commie) on the eve of the March on Washington. And though it is King's "I Have a Dream" speech that has become the emblem of the march, when Life magazine published its report, the cover bore a photograph of Bayard Rustin. D'Emilio, whose scholarly conscientiousness coexists with his tendentiousness, points out that after the march, Rustin was "always in the papers. . . . Reporters sought his views on any and all civil rights matters." (The New York Herald Tribune called him the "Socrates of the Civil Rights Movement.")
"I don't think that even a social movement can be based on past sins" -- do Rustin's words now sound odd for a protest leader? Such is the distance from the movement, from principled heroism to licensed resentment, from social justice (the very term sounds anachronistic) to the spoils system of preferences, from celebrating a remarkable man to fabricating a victim. Rustin probably would not have been much surprised; certainly he would not have been discouraged. "God does not require us to achieve any of the good tasks that humanity must pursue," he once said. "What God requires of us is that we not stop trying."

HEADLINE: Five Truths About Tuition 

BYLINE:  By Christopher Shea; Christopher Shea writes a column about the academic world for The Boston Globe.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
Can anything besides an act of God stop the rise of college tuition? 
 For the last several months on Capitol Hill, the higher-education establishment has been on the defensive over the question -- and at times things have gotten very testy. 
 The occasion is the once-every-five-years review by Congress of its federal aid policies -- the grants and loans that ensure that rich children aren't the only ones who get to waltz across academia's green lawns and into the best jobs in the knowledge economy. Five years ago, during the last such review, Representative Howard P. McKeon, a California Republican, and some colleagues decided to confront head-on the trend that was making federal aid so expensive: the rising cost of college. The result, after months of hearings and tough talk? "A nice book," Mr. McKeon says, smiling but distinctly unamused. 
The 326-page "Study of College Costs and Prices, 1988-89 to 1997-98" is, indeed, a fine document, bristling with statistics and nuanced arguments. Tuition, of course, looked at it, laughed, and headed back up Mount Everest. 
This time around, Mr. McKeon, a senior member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, ditched the scholarship. In September, the committee's Republican leaders released a blistering, emphatically unnuanced report recounting alarming tuition increases at public colleges in recent years -- over the last decade, after adjusting for inflation, up 48 percent in Michigan, 80 percent in Idaho, 52 percent in Maryland. The House members culled alarming quotes from students, drawn from news articles (a philosophy major at the University of Kansas: "It's almost come to the point of starvation at times") and lit into colleges for their lack of "accountability." 
Mr. McKeon brought out the stick in October, introducing a bill that would punish universities that raise tuition too far too fast. Institutions that increase tuition more than twice the rate of inflation would be placed on a "watch list" and, in 2011, possibly lose federal money. (The cheapest 25 percent of colleges in each category -- two-year, public and private -- would be exempt.)
A large swath of academia has reacted to the legislation with indignation. The main objection is that the eye-popping percentage increases have mostly been caused by state legislatures gutting university financing. In Wisconsin, for example, the Legislature solved its budget woes largely on the back of the University of Wisconsin system, cutting $78 million, or 7.2 percent of its budget. The tuition increase of 15 percent, to $5,139, didn't come close to making up the difference. The state has announced that further deep cuts are to come.
From New York to California it's the same story. The proportion of public-college budgets supplied by the state has dropped precipitously. Someone has to pay for public colleges. Should state colleges take the heat when the legislatures purposely shift the burden from taxpayers onto students and their parents?
Stanley Fish, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, doesn't think so. In two op-ed articles criticizing the McKeon proposal, he seems to reflect the consensus among college officials: "If the revenues sustaining your operation are sharply cut and you are prevented by law from raising prices, your only recourse is to offer an inferior product," he wrote. "Those who say, as the state has said to the University of Illinois, 'We're taking $200 million from you but we expect you to do the job you were doing and do it even better,' are trafficking either in fantasy or hypocrisy. I vote for hypocrisy."
At this point, the two sides -- the colleges and the Republican would-be cost containers -- are talking past one another. At a late-September hearing on the college cost crisis, Representative Phil Gingrey, a Georgia Republican, glared down over his glasses at several witnesses -- among them the president of Murray State University in Kentucky, a representative of state colleges and a Washington-based higher-education analyst -- and ridiculed their argument that the best way to soften the blow of tuition increases would be more money for poor students. 
"My father used to say," Mr. Gingrey said, "that when you ask a rich man how much money he needs to be happy, he'll say, 'Just a little more."' Colleges, he said, would just use more money for the poor as an excuse to jack up tuition even higher. Congress had significantly increased Pell Grants for poor students in recent years. At what point, he asked, were colleges going to stop making excuses and start "stepping up to the plate on the cost side of the equation"?
A week later, Republicans invited a new set of college leaders to a roundtable talk. As Mr. Gingrey again lectured the officials, William E. Kirwan, chancellor of the University of Maryland's 13 institutions, was having trouble maintaining his diplomatic smile. "I think we need to communicate better with you," he said. "I want to repeat: We had a $200 million hole in our budget. We covered $75 million of that with tuition. We ate $125 million. Our faculty and staff haven't had a raise in two and a half years." 
In his office between hearings, Mr. McKeon, a genial 65-year-old father of six, responded in a baffled tone: "To me, it's like they've got their heads in the sand. Their view is, 'Things are fine, we know what we're doing, just send more money."' Like the college officials, he, too, claims to be fighting for poor students. He likes to cite a finding of a recent federal report that 22 percent of low-income students are shut out of college by cost alone.
Indeed, if Congressional leaders seem to be skipping over the story at the state level, college officials have been hardly beyond criticism. When the Republicans want to demonstrate that colleges would keep raising tuition regardless of what state legislatures do, they don't have far to look for evidence: Tuition at private colleges rose 6 percent, to an average of $19,700 this year. It has increased at a rate greater than inflation basically for the last century. That can't possibly continue forever. Or can it?
Higher education is an astonishingly complicated, quasi-public, quasi-private industry, onethat charges annual fees ranging from $2,000 to $40,000. It's difficult to generalize about it. Is college too expensive? For whom? Poor students? The middle class? How much is too much? On Capitol Hill and across the country, policy makers are grappling with the complexities -- as well as the myths and misunderstandings -- of the tuition crisis. As witnesses paraded before Mr. McKeon's committee, several key points emerged that help to frame the debate.

1. Tuition is cheaper than you think.
News articles about the Ivy League's $40,000 annual cost -- and reports of 10 and 15 percent increases at state colleges -- have had an effect. Call it panic. Seventy percent of Americans think college tuition is "beyond the reach of the average family," the Republican report says. But do they know what they're talking about? In fact, Americans wildly misstate tuition levels. In 2001, according to a survey by the American Council on Education, the typical American thought in-state tuition at a public college was $11,600. (It was $3,750 that year.) Asked about the full cost, including room and board, they still guess double the actual costs.
And then, colleges are quick to add, you have to remember the role of financial aid. For example, at the University of Maryland -- one of the most expensive public colleges in the country, with an annual cost, including room and board, of $14,000 -- three-quarters of the students get financial aid: an average $7,000 each.
Once you factor in financial aid, the net cost of a four-year public-college degree rose only 7 percent from 1992 to 1999, according to Sandy Baum, an economics professor at Skidmore College. (Note, though, that that leaves out the last few years of erratic increases.) And many institutions still qualify as genuinely inexpensive: San Francisco State University: $2,480 for tuition and fees. The University of Florida: $2,780. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign: $3,527. It is still expensive, of course, to forgo work to attend college, and federal grants aren't growing as fast as living expenses. At public colleges where tuition is creeping up to $6,000 and $7,000, debt levels are also inching dangerously close to private-college levels, proving a serious hurdle for low- and moderate-income families. But still, with aid, many more people can afford college than think they can.

2. There's no single "cost crisis": privates and publics are different worlds.
The complexity of financial aid aside, the size of tuition at private colleges -- and its rate of increase -- at least gives some sense of how well a college is controlling costs. That's not necessarily so at public colleges.
States set their tuition artificially low to keep the barriers to college as surmountable as possible. States have different policies about this. Those in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast set their tuitions somewhat higher than average, and then steer aid to poorer students. States in the South and West tend to keep tuition lower for everyone. (This has led to some incongruous moments: Florida student leaders were well represented in September on Capitol Hill protesting tuition increases. But Florida's tuition is less than half that of some states and would be considered a steal in many parts of the country.)
One catch is, the lower the tuition, the easier it is to have a high-percentage increase when the state's portion of the budget shrinks -- as the president of Murray State University, F. King Alexander, explained at a recent hearing. Murray State, which sits in the poor lakes region of WesternKentucky, suffered a 1.8 percent budget cut this year, which led to a tuition increase of 15.9 percent for this fall. (Murray State also closed its television station, cut or froze 69 positions and stopped upgrading its heating system.) And yet a year at Murray State still costs only $3,436. Including state and federal financial aid, the increased cost over four years is a few hundred dollars. Is that worse, Mr. Alexander asked, then the private Vanderbilt University's 5 percent increase, to $28,440?
If Congress were to punish the universities that have the highest percentage increases, that would mean attacking "the very institutions that are the most affordable and accessible throughout the nation," Mr. Alexander argued. As his reference to Vanderbilt suggested, public colleges think they're taking an unfair proportion of the heat on the tuition issue.
One source of the tension is that public colleges, once a low-cost alternative to private colleges, are falling behind in quality because of state spending cuts. According to the researchers Peter R. Orszag and Thomas J. Kane, per-student spending at state institutions dropped from 70 percent of that of private colleges in 1977 to 58 percent in 1996 -- and the gap has surely grown since. Professors' salaries are less and less competitive with those at private colleges, causing a slow bleed of talent; class sizes are swelling; and low-paid adjuncts teach more courses. "If politicians want to bash private higher education for raising tuition, they actually have a right to do so," says Ronald G. Ehrenberg, director of the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute. "In private higher education there may well be waste. Especially at these selective places, there isn't any force to keep costs down." But at state colleges, he says, the cuts have long since moved from fat to muscle.
Differences are emerging at the policy level, too. Many private-college officials want the government to allow college students to borrow more money through federal programs to pay for their educations. But the American Association of State Colleges and Universities argues that heavy borrowing to attend a private college is a luxury -- and a burden on students -- and federal money would be better directed toward Pell grants and other services for poor students. Being able to attend Columbia University (tuition and fees: about $30,000), they say, is not a public policy issue or a moral imperative.

3. Colleges are both inescapably expensive to run and inefficient.
Here's the colleges' line: The things colleges need to buy to do what they do -- the time of highly educated people, new computers, laboratories and dormitories -- are all rising in cost far faster than families' abilities to pay. And so college officials argue that higher education must be viewed like health care: Unless you want to go back to the days before antibiotics (and to registration, by hand, in the gym) you have to get used to it getting more expensive every year.
Even if that's so, consider what happened in 2002 when Governor-elect Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, facing a $2 billion budget deficit, asked the business analysts at Bain & Company to identify potential sources of savings in the higher-education system. The Bain team found that, unwittingly, different campuses were spending very different amounts on administration, maintenance and other expenses not directly related to the classroom. Fitchburg State spent 35 percent more than Framingham State, though the institutions serve similar purposes and students. If the inefficientcolleges borrowed the practices of their slightly more efficient peers -- not even of the most efficient colleges -- the system could save $100 million a year.
How did the colleges react to the visit from the Bain crew? "It wasn't a warm reception," says Ron Kermisch, the vice president who led the team.
Frank Newman, director of a higher-education policy group at Brown University called the Futures Project, would not have been surprised. He told Mr. McKeon's committee, "Academics often argue that even to think in terms of efficiency is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of the collegiate enterprise." 
In his book "Tuition Rising: Why College Costs So Much," Dr. Ehrenberg recalls arguing against building an extraordinarily expensive new science building as well as new squash courts and a boathouse at Cornell. He was always outvoted: like other top private universities, Cornell pursues near perfection across the board, unable to say no to any expense that might lure a star professor or a high-SAT-scoring student. The trick in rooting out inefficiency, he says, is to separate the things that are inefficient in a good way, like a classics department, from the things with no purpose.

4. Damage is creeping up the income ladder, but the poor are being hurt the most.
Some scholars of higher education lament that in the 1990's, the focus of federal higher-education policy swung from poor families to the middle and upper-middle classes. President Bill Clinton sought, and got, tax credits for such parents with children in college, now worth $6 billion a year; those tax cuts softened the tuition increases of recent years for anyone who pays federal tax. Whole states like Georgia created scholarship programs to keep bright, not-necessarily-poor students from leaving the state to attend college. Even colleges that get good press for reducing their tuition by a few thousand dollars -- Muskingum College in Ohio, for example -- are in part trying to attract students who are wealthy enough to just about pay the full freight, according to higher education economists. 
Meanwhile, despite a significant increase in recent years, the average Pell grant, the chief federal aid scholarship, has gone from covering 77 percent of the cost of a four-year public college in 1980 to 40 percent today. Even with all the other aid that's out there, that would force poor students to take out more loans, a particular burden to them. In fact, many react to higher tuition costs not by taking out more loans, as the middle class does, but by forgoing college. In the study that Mr. McKeon often cites, an expert committee appointed by the Education Department reported that the students hurt most by rising tuition were those with incomes under $25,000, with the effects extending to those with incomes up to $50,000. 
Gordon Winston, an economist at Williams College, told Congress that poor "stars" were doing well -- through scholarships awarded by private colleges -- but "the good-but-not-great low-income kid, and the average, are being lost."
It's "not a crisis" if the top half of the income bracket has to pay more for a public education, writes Sandy Baum, the Skidmore economics professor. But paradoxically, it's the wrath of the upper middle class that has helped galvanize lawmakers: Students who once thought private education was their due find that rising debt makes it a painful choice.

5. Colleges aren't sitting on their hands.
What can be done about the "cost side of the equation"? Some ideas tinker around the edges -- more colleges, including almost all the private ones in Wisconsin, are banding together to leverage buying power and drive down the cost of everything from health insurance to information-technology support. Maryland's public colleges have proposed a way to reduce the unpredictability of tuition increases and prevent last-minute raids on their budgets: The state and colleges would outline financial commitments to one another several years in advance. The state would pledge a certain dollar amount; colleges would set cost-cutting targets. 
But other changes involve a deeper restructuring of the academy. The Pew Foundation, for example, is helping 30 colleges nationwide rethink how they teach introductory courses like Econ 101, which collectively enroll about a fourth of their students. Through the smart use of technology -- frequent online quizzes to make sure students are digesting material -- and by tapping successful upperclassmen to tutor struggling freshmen and sophomores, the pilot courses have raised passing rates and cut costs by more than a third. And there are more radical ideas floating around -- one campus in each state concentrating on science, say, to reduce the duplication of costly labs.
In the private arena, Ronald Ehrenberg argues that only one thing would end the arms race among colleges: a pact among the richest colleges to hold the line on costs. A slowdown in tuition increases at the top would ripple downward, since it would simply be too embarrassing for second-tier colleges to charge much more than Harvard.
If such changes don't reverse the course of rising tuition and legislatures don't rethink their budget cuts, something else will have to give. What will it be? Tenure? The quality of public education? America's promise that low income won't stand in the way of a college degree? Unfortunately, the answer may come sooner than you think.

 BODY:
 Shakespeare, Einstein and the Bottom Line: The Marketing
of Higher Education. By David L. Kirp. Harvard University Press.
 Mr. Kirp opens his timely look at marketing in the world of academe with sketches of the University of Chicago and Hamburger U., the training arm of McDonald's. The missions -- and customers -- of these two Chicago-area campuses differ greatly, and the comparison offers a crisp demonstration of how colleges at both ends of the spectrum are driven by economic motives as well as educational ones. 
Mr. Kirp, a public policy professor at the University of California at Berkeley, offers more than a dozen illuminating narratives chronicling academic efforts to sell themselves. Some are trying to climb to the top of the competitive heap, others simply to survive.
New York University's philosophy department buys star scholars to enhance its prestige and uses cheap adjuncts to teach undergraduates. Columbia tries to strike it rich during the dot-com boom. University of Southern California departments compete among themselves for students (and tuition dollars) by advertising courses like one on Shakespeare that doesn't require reading. 
Many of the examples are not new. But Mr. Kirp has an eye for telling examples, and he captures the turmoil and transformation in higher education in readable style. While he views the change as inevitable, he longs for a miracle, asking plaintively: "If there is a less dystopian future, one that revives the soul of this odd institution, who is to advance it -- and if not now, then when?"

HEADLINE: Kill Bills: The Cost of Living 

BYLINE:  By Greg Winter

 BODY:
 Timothy DALY wants to be president. Seriously. As a 22-year-old senior majoring in economics at the University of Maryland at College Park, he admits he has a long way to go. But he has already built a reputation as student body president, beating the drum for what he calls the injustice of tuition increases. "The governor was in the Bahamas when his staff announced that an additional $60 million in cuts would be made to the university," he says, "so we created a character named Bahama Bobby Ehrlich." Mr. Daly (above, driving) dressed as a Secret Service agent, a friend donned a wig and they toured the campus in a golf cart shouting, 'I'm Bahama Bob, I'm going to raise your tuition."' 
 With the exception of a $2,500 grant from the university, Mr. Daly, an independent student from upstate New York, pays for his tuition and housing with a popular and potent student cocktail: loans and credit cards. He has borrowed about $25,000 over the last two years. He also makes $10 an hour as a fund-raiser for a campus organization. "It's become extremely difficult to make ends meet," he says. He calculates his expenditures at about $34,000 for the academic year. Here are some.
$16,242 Out-of-state tuition and fees. 
$800 Textbooks.
$4,500 Rent on a town house, two roommates.
$1,200 Utilities.
$1,950 Groceries, at $50 a week.
$1,170 Eating out, at $30 a week (pizza, Chinese, McDonald's).
$1,440 Cellphone. He uses 4,000 minutes a month ($160 per) on two phones: one for political use, another because "I have to have some form of a personal life."
$1,800 Entertainment. He goes to football games. Parties "now and again, now and again, I try."
$2,680 (full year) Car, including $1,400 for insurance, $780 for gas and $500 for repairs. "Come on, it's a 1992 Ford Taurus. It's going to need them." 
$2,500 (full year) Medical. Because of a congenital circulatory problem, he carries two health insurance policies -- one paid by his mother, the other through the university, costing about $1,600. Expenses like medications come to another $100 a month. GREG WINTER

New Law School Helping to Fulfill Islip Master Plan

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE

DATELINE: CENTRAL ISLIP 

 BODY:
CONSTRUCTION has begun here on a law school that represents an important piece of a comprehensive plan created 20 years ago for the 788-acre former Central Islip Psychiatric Center, which once housed more than 10,000 patients.
 The $28 million, 168,000-square-foot building will be the home of the Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center of the Manhattan-based Touro College. It will be part of a major legal complex that also includes federal, state and local courts that were completed three years ago. 
 The 23-year-old Fuchsberg Center has been in Huntington since 1982. The new building is expected to open within two years. 
The development of the former psychiatric center site has been exceptionally faithful to the master plan. "This is a real success story," said Lee Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board and a former Suffolk County planning director, who worked on the plan in the early 1980's.
"To me it is a thrill because it is not usual that a plan gets carried out to the nth degree," he said. "We wanted to get rid of the slum housing in Central Islip, centralize the courts and get a federal court there and a law school. Most of the elements fell into place, and having Touro come in completed the plan." 
Housing was also a major element of the plan, and more that 600 units have been built and another 1,000 are proposed. In the process, the quality of housing in the area has improved considerably from what was there in the 1980's.
A $20 million hotel and restaurant complex, for which ground will be broken in the spring, is "very important because of all the different uses there," Dr. Koppelman said.
Nancy Manfredonia, executive director of the Central Islip Civic Council, who was also involved in creating the comprehensive plan, said: "The amount of economic activity coming into Central Islip with all these initiatives is very exciting. This is an example of the best reason to have a master plan and of the success of a master plan. It is the final icing on the cake to have the synergy of a law school and the court centers, with the rest of the facilities. We have benefited in prestige, jobs, economy and housing." 
The Central Islip property is one of four psychiatric center parcels on Long Island -- totaling approximately 2,000 acres in the towns of Islip, Huntington and Smithtown -- that were sold by the state when it deinstitutionalized patients and auctioned off property, beginning some 30 years ago. It is just north of Southern State Parkway and is divided by Carleton Avenue, the main north-south road in Central Islip. 
Many of the original brick buildings have been refurbished for new use. A medical building on the east side of Carleton Avenue, for instance, is now an eight-story, 175,000-square-foot office building, called the Courthouse Corporate Center. It is near the court complex and a stadium owned by Suffolk County and leased to a minor league baseball team, the Long Island Ducks. 
On the west side of Carleton Avenue, the former psychiatric center property now holds 1.5 million square feet of industrial buildings and a 268,000-square-foot shopping center. In addition, New York Institute of Technology, which has campuses in Manhattan and Old Westbury, opened its third campus at the Central Islip property in 1982, when it purchased more than 500 acres that included 60 buildings. It refurbished 24 smaller buildings for school use and sold off the most of the property and buildings it owned for uses recommended by the master plan, including the industrial park. 
Eugene Murphy, Islip's planning commissioner, said the college is selling another 45 acres to the Jobco Corporation of New York City, which plans to demolish a building and construct about 250 housing units. Jobco also plans to renovate a 100,000-square-foot building that now holds the New York Tech architecture school for 96 housing units for older people and has proposed building a 60-unit apartment building.
The Arlen Contracting Corporation, a company owned by the Benjamin Development Corporation of Garden City, which purchased 70 acres from the state and created the Courthouse Corporate Center, has proposed constructing 224 town house and condominium units on 22.6 acres, with a portion for older people, Mr. Murphy said.
The developer Engel Burman of East Meadow has purchased 21 acres of vacant land and has proposed 252 condominium units, including 110 senior units.
The court complex has the 495,000-square-foot John P. Cohalan Jr. Center, a state and county court complex named after a late State Supreme Court justice, and the 822,000-square-foot federal courthouse and office building designed by Richard Meier & Partners of Manhattan, working with the Spector Group of North Hills. All federal courts on Long Island have been moving to the white 11-story building, named the Alfonse M. D'Amato District Court. 
TOURO'S new Fuchsberg Center -- named for a Manhattan trial attorney and judge on the State Court of Appeals -- will be on 14.5 acres. 
Howard A. Glickstein, dean of the law center, said that the new location would offer an advantage in delivering legal education. "Not many law schools are near courthouses and not many law students go to court," he said. "It's been a struggle over the years between legal academia and practicing law. There have been a lot of complaints that students are not prepared to practice law. We hope to bridge that gap."
When the law center opened, it had 300 students, and now has 750, Dean Glickstein said. Annual tuition is $23,000.
The school has an annual operating budget of $17 million, most of it coming from tuition. It has initiated a $30 million fund-raising campaign for the new campus and has raised $10 million so far and also received $4.5 million in state and federal grants. The land was purchased from the state for $1.5 million four years ago.
The four-story building, designed by Spector, will include wireless technology, 17 classrooms, a 48,000-square-foot library and a 450-seat two-level auditorium. 
Islip Town Councilman Christopher Bodkin said: "On many levels this has been great. The town's economic development is getting another prestigious institution. Central Islip just 15 years ago had bottomed out economically. Now, it's a happening place." 
A short distance north of the court complex -- on nine acres adjacent to the stadium and fronting Carleton Avenue -- will be the 170-room Hampton Inn and Suites and two 8,000-square-foot restaurants, according to John C. Tsunis, an owner, and the president of Hauppauge-based Long Island Hotels, which will manage the property, which was purchased two years ago from Arlen for $3.4 million. 
The eight-story hotel is expected to be completed by spring 2005. It has been designed with a white brick exterior to resemble the federal courthouse and will be connected by walkways to the corporate center, ballpark and courthouse complex. 
The guest facilities include 55 suites, an indoor pool, health club, conference rooms and a 1,000-square-foot great room, where continental breakfasts are served. 
Mr. Tsunis is in negotiations with major chains for three restaurants: a 1,200-square-foot coffee shop inside the hotel and two 225-seat restaurants in separate buildings in front of the hotel. 
"Both the hotel and law center are true to the master plan for activity and economics," Mr. Murphy said. "Most of the development is on track. The one thing that is lagging is the shopping center. We expect some serious proposals to develop it in the next year."
The 180,000-square-foot building at the shopping center, which is owned by J. D. Carlisle Development of Manhattan, was originally intended to include a supermarket, multiplex theater, restaurant and retail tenants. However, a new King Kullen supermarket is the only tenant and the rest of the building has not been subdivided.
"After 2001 the economy weakened and the multiplex theater didn't happen," Mr. Murphy said. "Without its draw, it appeared the restaurants didn't commit and neither did other tenants. 
"However, with all the things happening, it should go forward now," he said.

To the Editor:
Your moving report about undocumented children crossing the border into the United States (front page, Nov. 3) serves as a reminder of the human cost of current immigration policies. 
 Adding resources to border interception singles out certain kinds of immigrants (those coming from Mexico and as far south as Ecuador), causes them to take increasing risks in crossing through the desert, and has generally failed to stem a flow of workers who respond to economic reasons rather than law enforcement. 
 The result is hundreds of deaths a year, and children separated from their families. Meanwhile, the United States economy continues to depend on low-wage undocumented labor, andlonely children keep trying to cross north.

HEADLINE: Big, Loud Clubs Seek New Glitter 

BYLINE:  By JULIA CHAPLIN

 BODY:
"I DIDN'T invite her," said Eve Salvail, a model with a dragon tattoo on the side of her head, who gets $500 to linger a few hours and look cool at Avalon, the latest incarnation of the Episcopal church in Chelsea once known as Limelight.
 It was 3 a.m. on a recent Sunday, and Ms. Salvail, a part-time employee known as a tastemaker -- a k a eye candy -- watched helplessly from her free V.I.P. table in the hip-hop room while the uninvited woman, who looked like the Colombian pop star Shakira with streaked hair and a mini-kilt, wrapped herself around a stripper pole. When the woman began a deafening tap dance in her knee-high boots, two male models in Ms. Salvail's entourage gathered their free glasses of vodka and cranberry juice, slid out of the banquette and left. 
 "She's scaring people away," Ms. Salvail said. "I wish she'd just sit down." 
So it goes on the front lines of New York's latest attempt to revive the glittery era of huge dance clubs -- that halcyon 80's moment of celebrities, downtown artists and well-dressed nobodies mixing under strobe lights at Danceteria and the Palladium.
A new batch of entrepreneurs is betting that chic New Yorkers, after years of holing up in low-key lounges, are ready to hit the dance floor with the masses again. Over the next four months, no fewer than five clubs --each with room for hundreds or even thousands of dancers and featuring new-generation diversions like bungee-jumping cocktail waiters and raw-food kitchens -- will open in two square blocks of West Chelsea. The area -- bounded by 10th and 11th Avenues and 26th and 28th Streets -- is already thick with art galleries. Now it bids to become the center of New York clubland.
"Tenth Avenue is great, because it's wide enough for limos and Escalades to pull up outside," said Noah Tepperberg, who is opening one of the clubs, so far unnamed, on 10th Avenue near 27th next month.
Among the others to come are Spirit, which is to open this month in the old Twilo space on 27th Street; Crobar, a branch of a club with sites in Miami and Chicago, which plans to open next month; and Quo, due in February, whose name, in a very loose translation from the Latin, means "where it's at," its owners say.
Applications to add more clubs are pouring in, according to Community Board 4, which oversees West Chelsea. They would include an Indian-theme nightclub and a dance club on 16th Street. Add the Avalon and Club Deep, both of which opened between Avenue of the Americas and Fifth Avenue in September, along with lounges that were already in the neighborhood (Lot 61, Glass, Bungalow 8, the Coral Room), and the Studio 54 question is, Who is going to fill all these places?
David Rabin, president of the New York Nightlife Association and an owner of Lotus, a lounge on West 14th Street, said: "I can't figure out how all these places are going to make money. New York has been hit so hard by unemployment, particularly in the finance and dot-com industries that drive trendy night life. If one or two were opening I'd think, 'Well, yeah, maybe.' But this many at once is really puzzling."
A bigger question, perhaps, is how the new discos will escape the kinds of drugged-out club kids who, in legions, contributed to the demise of New York's last dance-club wave. That boom, in the 1990's, was a dark chapter riddled with drugs, violence and elephant pants. After a crackdown on clubs by the Giuliani administration, which made it nearly impossible to get the cabaret licenses required for dancing, night crawlers retreated to small lounges catering to a privileged few. Dancing became a naughty and spontaneous act for the drunken and daring, performed atop cocktail tables and on banquettes. (Places like Lotus and Bungalow 8 regularly replaced the stiletto-punctured upholstery.)
The empire built by the club owner Peter Gatien crumbled when federal agents labeled his Limelight "a drug supermarket" and shut it in 1996. In a separate case, the club's star promoter, Michael Alig, pleaded guilty to manslaughter for killing a clubgoer who was a reputed drug dealer (the subject of the recent film "Party Monster"). And in 2001, Twilo, a big black room with all-night D.J. parties, was also closed by the authorities. A favorite of glow-stick-twirling ravers, it kept an ambulance to run victims of drug overdoses to emergency rooms.
Some old club hands say it is going to be hard to change a business that has habitually thrived on hard drugs and bad behavior. "Where are they going to get a club crowd that isn't young and on drugs?" asked Steven Lewis, who was a director of Danceteria, the Palladium and Club USA, and who went to prison himself for nine months on drug charges. "I'm sure the 22-year-olds that do go out and are creative and cool would rather be at a divey rock club in the Lower East Side or Williamsburg."
Residents of the club district are essentially powerless to block them, community board members say, because the area is zoned for manufacturing. "Many residents oppose the opening of all these nightclubs," said Kevin Kossi, a co-chairman of Community Board 4. But instead of trying to block the issuance of liquor licenses and risk being overruled by state authorities, Mr. Kossi said the board has persuaded the clubs to help control the likely throngs of pedestrians, the heavy late-night street traffic and the thumping music.
But some say the clubs will bolster the area. "It's better to have clubs, which are a controlled grittiness, than what used to be there, which was a derelict area with prostitutes and people having sex in cars," said Danny Emerman, an owner of Glass, a lounge, and Bottino, a restaurant, both on 10th Avenue.
Almost all the owners interviewed for this article said they were trying to attract "an older, more sophisticated crowd," a code phrase that some of them acknowledged means "no 21-year-old 'bridge and tunnelers' on Ecstasy."
Callin Fortis, an owner of Crobar, said the club's entertainment would influence the behavior of its crowd. "We're not going to book one trance D.J. for 14 hours in a big dark room," he said. "It's going to be like a creative playground." Crobar, which will hold 2,750 people, will feature live performances, an art gallery, acrobats on trampolines and what he described as bungee jumpers delivering cocktails. (Next door to Crobar, a branch of the "upscale" topless club Scores plans to open early next month.)
Like many of the other new clubs, Crobar is being designed to feel less like a giant disco and more like a series of lounges. It will have a V.I.P. lounge, an ultra-V.I.P. lounge and several small rooms catering to different subsets and designed by fashion companies including Heatherette (the flamboyant fashion-techno crowd), As Four (a downtown rock crowd) and Supreme (alternative hip-hop and street wear).
Richie Rich, a designer for Heatherette who was once Michael Alig's assistant at Limelight, said the new clubs would have it easier because indiscriminate drug consumption is no longer so acceptable. "Now it's become cool to get up earlier and be professional," he said, although he acknowledged that he may just be growing older.
Robert Wootton, an owner of Spirit, the 35,000-square-foot club in the former Twilo space, is betting that the neo-clubgoer enjoys tarot readings, astrology and organic foods. Testing the outer limits of a concept, Spirit will combine nightclubbing and New Age. It will be divided into zones: Body, a dance area with "uplifting" house music; Mind, a spa with aromatherapy and massage; and Soul, an organic and raw-food restaurant. It will have no V.I.P. areas. "The concept doesn't really make sense on paper," Mr. Wootton said. He said he had "no idea" if it would make money, but it was something he felt called upon to do.
The competition is heating up among club owners to enlist the city's top promoters, models and night-life regulars to draw in the many thousands of paying customers they will need to stay in business. On the weekends, Avalon pays more than 100 people, including promoters and eye candy, to pull not just a crowd, but the right crowd.
"It's like 50 dogs fighting over a bone, and the bone is the A-list," said Ronnie Madra, who promotes parties at Lotus and Avalon and is considering offers from several of the new clubs. One of his tactics is to hire what he calls "extroverted beautiful people" like Ms. Salvail, whose sole purpose is to hang out and look good, a job description at other clubs, too, like Plaid and Lotus.
"I say here's $200, all you can drink and a table to fill with a few of your good-looking friends," Mr. Madra said. "When the average person walks past and sees them there having fun, it makes the place seem a lot more 'happening.' "
On a recent Saturday night at Avalon, such social engineering seemed to be paying off. The club, which has a $25 cover charge, was mobbed at the entrance, with a line down the block. Inside, the Habitrail-like hallways were jammed with Japanese and German tourists and other curiosity seekers. But a few glitches were apparent: the lounge crowd and the techno dancers were not getting along.
Up in one of the three V.I.P. skyboxes, to which entry could be gained only with the password "Brazil," Morgan Handbury, 21, a model from Canada who moved to New York City last month, was clutching her cocktail. "You can get this big club thing anywhere in the world -- Miami, South Africa," said Ms. Handbury, who was wearing Levi's and a lingerie top. "I'd much rather be in a small lounge without all these random people. I hate the lighting in here, and the music is awful."
She craved a smoke. "but there's no way I'm walking through that crowd to get outside," she said.
In a bar off the main dance area where the D.J. Josh Wink was spinning, Tyson Gorrie, 28, a lawyer who recently moved to Manhattan, was wigging out. "There's too much of a money vibe here, man," he said. "I'm not into it. It's like a Euro place where you've got to buy a bottle just to get a girl to talk to you."
A couple of blocks away, Club Deep, which caters mostly to a clientele from outside Manhattan, was gelling better. The two-level space with five V.I.P. areas was packed at 1 a.m. Young men in Von Dutch trucker hats and leather pants and young women in tight spandex tops inhaled cocktails and bobbed their blow-dried hair to Chingy's "Right Thurr."
The club, decorated with amber-tinted mirrors, candles and several giant photographs of half-naked women, looked like a trendy lounge, only much bigger. A large dance floor with spinning colored lights was deserted. Lauren Greenfield, a 24-year-old stripper from Queens, stood by the bar with her friend Jennifer Fernandez, 28, a high school teacher from Edgewater, N.J., who was celebrating her birthday.
"At most places you go out to, 80 percent of the guys are going to be duds, which leaves 20 percent who are eligible, right?" said Ms. Greenfield, who said she had no intention of putting a toe on the dance floor. "Now at a big club, that 20 percent is going to be a much higher number. I want to go up to the V.I.P. area where the rich guys are."
In the V.I.P. area directly in her line of vision, Nick Arsenis, 23, an accountant from Queens, and a 24-year-old friend, Scott, who would not give his last name, were sizing up the crowd from behind a velvet rope as they mixed cocktails from carafes of orange and cranberry juice and a $300 bottle of vodka. "We don't like to dance," said Mr. Arsenis, who wore a button-up shirt and jeans and had gelled hair.
Scott, who looked roughly the same, nodded. "We just like to sit up here with bottles and meet cute girls," he said.
