HEADLINE: Congress's Missing Vision 

 BODY:
Congress's main budget adviser has looked years into the future and concluded that the nation cannot afford its overheated present as Republicans continue cutting taxes, enriching spending and rolling ever larger debts a decade over the horizon. "Fiscal autopilot is not an option," warned Douglas Holtz-Eakin, director of the Congressional Budget Office in a no-nonsense estimate of serial budget imbalances to come. 
Unless the deficit-and-tax-cut-happy Congress begins to put the brakes on now, future Americans will most likely be caught in an impossible crunch of historically higher taxes and plummeting health care and retirement benefits, Mr. Holtz-Eakin concluded in his forecast.
 The cost of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid inevitably must eat up a "sharply increasing" chunk of the nation's economic output as baby boomers retire and people live longer, said Mr. Holtz-Eakin, a former Bush adviser. They will face more expensive health care with fewer active workers to help pay the escalating costs, he said. 
 With short-term economic indicators finally on the rebound, no incumbent Republican is likely to applaud these warnings. They are about problems that will effectively reach a crisis beyond the careers of the very politicians who are most responsible for them. But world markets, in which the dollar is steadily declining against the euro, are already showing a deepening suspicion about President Bush's policy of budgeting by deficit and debt. Congress should heed Mr. Holtz-Eakin's message that "moving sooner is better than moving later."

HEADLINE: MAD COW DISEASE IN THE UNITED STATES: REACTION; 
Long String of Countries Suspend Imports of American Beef

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER; Clifford Krauss contributed reporting from Toronto for this article.

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Concern over the possible spread of mad cow disease has impelled the largest international markets for American beef to suspend imports from the United States after the discovery of a single suspected case of the disease on a farm in Washington State.
 Japan, South Korea and Mexico, the three largest importers of American beef, led a growing list of countries that announced import bans, among them Russia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan and the Chinese territory of Hong Kong. 
 Additional tests on a Holstein cow slaughtered on Dec. 9 in Mabton, Wash., were being conducted Wednesday and Thursday. 
Canada restricted the import of many American beef products, although the import ban was far from total. Robert Speller, the agriculture minister, said Canada would restrict the import of American processed meats and otherwise "limit the range of ruminants and ruminant products." 
Canada will continue to allow the import of live cattle intended for immediate slaughter. Boneless beef from cattle under 30 months old and dairy products will also be allowed in Canada.
Initial tests indicated that the cow in Washington State was infected with the disease, and its carcass and the farm on which it was raised were put under quarantine. One sample of its brain tissue was being flown to a laboratory here in Britain, which since the 1980's has suffered one of the largest epidemics of mad cow disease. In 2001 its livestock herds were struck by an even larger epidemic of foot and mouth disease. 
The tissue sample is expected to arrive at Heathrow airport early Thursday morning. It will be taken to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency laboratory, in Weybridge, Surrey, said Kevan McClair, a spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in Britain. Results are expected that day.
If confirmed by testing here and in the United States, it would mark the first appearance of the disease in the American herd, which supports a multibillion-dollar industry.
Australia, still free of the disease and a major cattle and beef exporter, is expected to gain a larger market share from the sudden interruption of American beef supplies to Asia. 
Still, recent history in Japan, home to some of Asia's pickiest eaters, shows that beef sales overall tend to drop precipitously on the news that the disease has re-emerged. When Japan's relatively small cattle industry was hit by mad cow disease in September 2001, beef sales plunged and fast food chains like McDonald's were hard hit as consumers switched to pork, chicken and fish. 
Beef producers in Canada, where the discovery of a single case of mad cow disease last May cost more than $1 billion in lost sales to the Canadian beef industry, said that the outbreak of mad cow disease in the United States would only slow their own recovery from the discovery of one infected cow in the spring.
"U.S. turbulence equates to turbulence in Canada," Ted Haney, president of the Canadian Beef Exporters Association, told reporters. Many producers said they feared that beef prices would fall across North America, and that any Canadian action against American beef would only slow efforts by the United States to open the border gradually to imports of Canadian beef.
The Canadian beef industry is just beginning to rebound after the reported outbreak on a northern Alberta ranch in May. The United States and all of Canada's major trading partners closed their borders to the Canadian beef industry, which is far more dependent on export markets than American producers are, causing losses of $1.2 billion and slowing the national economy.
The European Union took no immediate action on American beef because Europe already bans most American beef imports in a dispute over the use of growth hormones in the American cattle industry.
Britain is still in the final stages of its multiyear mad cow epidemic, with 147 animals confirmed infected by the disease in 2003, though the rate of infection dropped 50 percent from 2002 levels. Additional concerns over the transmittal of the human variant of mad cow disease, known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, arose this week when John Reid, the health secretary, told the House of Commons that a number of blood donors who contracted the disease may have transmitted it more broadly in the population than previously thought. 
Russia's agriculture minister, Aleksey V. Gordeyev, said Wednesday that Moscow had temporarily suspended American imports of beef, which account for 4 percent of Russia's meat imports, or 20,000 tons. He emphasized in remarks to the Interfax news agency that the suspension would be lifted once "we are confident that the safety of Russian consumers and livestock is guaranteed."
Mexican officials said Wednesday that they had halted all imports from the United States of beef and live cattle. "This is a precautionary measure in which Mexico is saying, 'stop everything' and we'll study the situation," Javier Trujillo, head of the Agriculture Ministry's animal health commission, told Reuters by telephone. 
The Mexican market is the largest in terms of volume, with 106,000 head of cattle shipped to Mexico last year and 384,900 tons of beef. Japan is the largest importer in terms of revenue, taking 221,874 tons of beef in the first 10 months of this year and paying $983 million to American beef growers and accounting for about a third of their business. South Korea's beef imports totaled $610 million last year, and 187,000 tons of American beef had been landed there through November. 
The Mexican authorities said they would aggressively examine the new threat from mad cow disease by dispatching their own inspectors to the United States. "We're even going to send inspectors to Washington State, and once we know the exact dimensions, we will decide if we maintain" the import ban, Mr. Trujillo was quoted as saying.

HEADLINE: Revised Subway Map (and Alphabet) Awaits Riders in '04 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL LUO; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Like the "easy to assemble" train set wrapped in a bow under the Christmas tree, New Yorkers will get a gift early in the New Year that requires reading the instructions carefully.
 Verrrry carefully. And you still might not get it. 
 The rehabilitation of the Manhattan Bridge is finally coming to an end after nearly two decades, which means that four subway tracks, instead of two, will be in use over the 94-year-old span for the first time since 1986. 
The changes, scheduled to take effect on Feb. 22, will be the most substantial alteration to the subway map in decades, and it means New York City Transit must now gear up to try to explain the changes to the riding public. As anyone who have ever furrowed a brow over a garbled announcement in the subway knows, communication has not always been so clear underground.
The first posters announcing the changes came out recently but are vague: "B, D, M, N, Q, R, W," it reads. "New subway service. Early 2004. Good news: New and improved subway service over the Manhattan Bridge. More than you have had in more than 20 years. Look for posters and a special brochure in stations soon."
Writers are completing the language for literally "thousands of pieces of literature," said Charles F. Seaton, a spokesman for the transit agency. Clearly, with the alphabet soup they are working with, they have their work cut out for them.
Try this potential line, for example: "The Brighton line, currently the Q, formerly the D, and soon to be the B, will now go up Sixth Avenue."
Or: "The W, currently the only line to Coney Island, will now terminate at Whitehall Street, but will be replaced by the D, which used to be where the B will be."
As part of a huge publicity campaign, transit officials will place newspaper ads, issue new subway maps, post signs in trains and hand out brochures. Employees will also be posted in stations to guide commuters.
"It's going to be a full-court press," said John McCarthy, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The bottom line, according to transitofficials, is that the changes represent a huge improvement over the convoluted system now in place for 600,000 riders between Brooklyn and Manhattan.
The current scrambled map, in place since 2001, was spurred by design limitations in the Manhattan Bridge that prevented trains from just switching over to the opposite tracks during repair work. As a result, when work was finally completed on the southern side after more than a decade, and workers shifted their attention to the north, a complicated rerouting was required. 
Back then, ominous signs warned riders: "It's too much to explain on a poster."
Riders may see similar signs this time around, but no more after this, transit officials promise. Planners have studied how best to handle the new ridership patterns that have emerged since 1986, the last time they had four tracks available. 
Among the winners in the reworked system: those who live in outlying areas of southwestern Brooklyn, like Bay Ridge, who will get back an express train to Midtown, the N, after nearly 20 years of waiting. Suddenly, they will be 15 to 20 minutes closer to Manhattan. 
"It's as if their neighborhood is moving up to where Park Slope is," said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group.
Other winners include users of the Brighton line (see above: currently the Q, formerly the D, soon to be the B). They will now have more choices heading into Manhattan. Previously, they had only the Q-circle (the local) and the Q-diamond (the express), which both headed up Broadway. Now, they will still have the option of the local Q up Broadway or they can take the B train up Avenue of the Americas.
Finally, residents and merchants in Chinatown, battling for economic survival since Sept. 11, 2001, will get back full B and D service into the Grand Street station.
Even so, the changes will take some getting used to. The swapping of the old B and D lines is especially confusing to longtime residents, many of whom remember growing up near the old lines and have to switch things around in their heads.
Krista Kolanovic, 23, a paralegal in downtown Manhattan who lives in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, was riding a Q train toward Brighton Beach yesterday.
"If you take the Q line, which used to be the D line, and call it the B line, which is now the W in Brooklyn, that could confuse a lot of people hopping on the wrong train," said Ms. Kolanovic, before pausing to question her own recollection of the lines she had mentioned.
"Q becomes B," she mused. "That's like calling the F train the A train. It doesn't make any sense."
That's why you have to read the instructions.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Subway Changes Planned for February"N -- from Coney Island once again will run express through much of Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan, using the Broadway line after crossing the bridge. That express route was halted in April 1986. B -- will run express from Brighton Beach on the Brighton line, cross the bridge and run express through Manhattan to 59th St. along Ave. of the Americas. It will continue as a local to 145th St. or Bedford Park in the Bronx. D -- replaces the W in Brooklyn. It will run express from Coney Island through much of Brooklyn along the Fourth Ave. line, go over the bridge to Manhattan, and up to 145th St. It then will continue to the Bronx. S -- The Grand St. shuttle will be discontinued as B and D trains will once again stop at the Chinatown hub. W -- will run from Whitehall St. in Lower Manhattan as a local along the Broadway line and terminate in Astoria, Queens. Q -- will be replaced by the B in Brooklyn and the N in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: MAD COW DISEASE IN THE UNITED STATES: RANCHERS; 
Beleaguered Cattle Farmers Prepare to Weather Another Blow

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW; Matthew Preusch contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: MABTON, Wash., Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Not much can faze the men who raise dairy and beef cows here in the heart of Washington's cattle country. Even the news that a Holstein right here in Mabton appeared to have come down with mad cow disease -- the first such case in the United States -- was chewed over in bars and living rooms with a certain nonchalance. 
 Certainly, this development was disturbing to the dairymen who make their living raising cows. It was unnerving, a black eye on the beef industry, farmers said, and it seemed to come out of nowhere. Yet to many of the ranchers and farmers here, only recently rebounding from huge losses in the last decade, it was also more of the same. In the words of Doyle Kelley, a grape grower, "It's just another punch in the nose." 
 Gordon Hansen, owner of a small dairy farm here, said: "I don't get excited. After about two weeks, everyone will forget about this and we'll start eating beef again." But, he added, the farmers will suffer.
Still, virtually everyone in this town of 2,000, which is tucked in the Yakima Valley, was talking on Wednesday about the sick cow; telephones were ringing constantly and the whispering was nonstop about who might have owned the heifer. There were deep worries about devastation in the beef market. 
The news has flooded this town with reporters from across the country and the world -- and rumors were flying all day Wednesday. Each fresh tidbit -- was the mad cow over at Art's place? Was the culprit at the Hidden Valley Dairy? -- sent a throng of camera crews rushing to a new ranch to confront police officers standing guard. A half dozen or so farmers in the Mabton area denied, sometimes vehemently, that this now-famous dead cow ever grazed in their pastures.
Reporters swarmed to the Sunny Dene Ranch after a news report that it was the source of the infected cow, but men in pickup trucks and the local sheriff shooed them off the property without commenting. A telephone call placed to the house was not returned.
Even as farmers kept quiet, some townspeople expressed fear that the local ranchers, buoyed by the recent rise of beef prices after years of decline in beef and milk prices, would be devastated by foreign countries banning American beef and American consumers shunning it.
"We have a lot of agriculture, and a lot of the agriculture has been beaten down pretty good anyway," said Mike Chester, owner of the Silver Dollar Tavern, a local farmers' haunt in a town with only a handful of businesses. "This sure ain't going to help it."
And as matter-of-fact as many of the farmers here were, saying they believed that the diseased cow was an isolated case, industry experts said they expected significant economic fallout in Yakima County and nationally.
The county has the largest number of cattle in Washington, and with a decline in the price of hops, a huge crop here, dairy is a growing part of the agricultural economy. Dairy farmers often sell older cows to slaughterhouses. 
A drop in beef prices could upset the already fragile economic prospects of dairy farmers, who are struggling with low milk prices, farmers said. 
Melanie Geertsma, whose family has owned a dairy in Mabton for seven years, was watching coverage of the mad cow case on the "Today" show when her telephone rang. 
"That's just it, we don't know anything," she explained to her sister on the other end.

HEADLINE: MAD COW DISEASE IN THE UNITED STATES: ECONOMIC EFFECTS; 
Businesses Tied to Beef Expect to Feel a Pinch

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
The rising concern about the safety of American beef will most likely dent the business of supermarkets, meat processors and others involved in its sale and distribution, experts said yesterday.
 Cattle futures dropped immediately yesterday at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said James E. Brooks, floor operations manager for R. J. O'Brien, the nation's largest cattle futures trader. Trading in February cattle, the most active group, was halted after prices fell 1.5 cents a pound, the maximum allowed in a single session, to 89.175 cents. The markets are closed today, and when trading resumes tomorrow, the limit will be raised to 3 cents in an unprecedented step to determine the true price. It will rise to as much as 5 cents on Monday if the decline continues, Mr. Brooks said. 
 "It's an emergency action," he said of the wider limits. Trading was "stressful," he added, particularly for Christmas Eve. "There was a lot of concern, a lot of nervousness and a lot of people who just aren't sure what this is going to mean for the future. This is the biggest disaster that's been feared for a long time among many participants in the cattle market."
With several nations banning imports of beef from the United States, producers have lost 10 percent of their market, at least in the short term, said Leonard Teitelbaum, a food analyst for Merrill Lynch. About half of that is exported to Japan, and the rest to South Korea, Mexico and other countries. Consumer prices in the United States are likely to continue falling until import restrictions end.
It is also unclear whether American consumers will reach for beef or will turn instead to other protein sources like pork or poultry, Mr. Teitelbaum added.
The National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a trade group representing about 95 percent of the country's ranchers, held a conference call yesterday to answer questions about the situation. 
"Our export market affects us by about 12 to 15 cents a pound," said Terry Stokes, the group's chief executive, who has a herd of Brangus cattle near San Antonio. "It's hard to ignore a part of the industry that takes 10 percent of your production." Beef producers had been having a banner year, with demand and prices up after a long, lean period.
The cattlemen's group has petitioned the government to intervene on the ban, Mr. Stokes said, and he said he was sure it would. 
"Our producers are concerned," he said, "but they're confident that we have a government and an industry that is addressing this issue."
Among the ranchers' worries are the value of their investments and the image of beef going forward.
Public reaction has not yet been overwhelming, beef industry officials said. At the Albertsons supermarket headquarters in Boise, Idaho, a hot line set up to answer shoppers' concerns received just 20 calls yesterday, said Karianne Cole, a spokeswoman. But that is probably just the beginning, she added.
"Obviously, that will increase as this unfolds," she said. "This is a critical issue for us. Our No. 1 goal is to make sure our customers understand that we always offer safe, high-quality foods."
The market values of companies with significant stakes in the beef business, either as processors or producers, will be hurt in the short term, even if profits are not affected, Mr. Teitelbaum said. "What will determine this is how long the concern lasts," he said.
Among the companies with major exposure are Tyson Foods, which has about 49 percent of its business in beef and the rest in pork and chicken, he said. Tyson acquired IBP Foods, a large beef producer, last year. A spokesman for Tyson did not return calls seeking comment. Other food processors, among them ConAgra Foods, also handle beef, which they turn into products like frankfurters. 
American consumers remain a wild card. "The demand curve is what has to be looked at," Mr. Teitelbaum said. "If people decide they would rather not buy their protein requirement in red meat and switch to other products, then those producers would be the beneficiaries." He added that it was unclear whether demand would drop and remain low or drop and then rebound.
"We think this is going to take at least several weeks to play out," he said. "Then the market will have time to digest it."
At Swift Foods, a privately held company that bought beef-processing plants from ConAgra last year, answering questions about food safety was the main order of business for executives all day yesterday.
"We have been vigilant in our own monitoring of cattle," said Jim Herlihy, a spokesman. "We buy live cattle, we slaughter it, we process it from there. We disassemble the carcass into the primary muscles, and we do grind some beef and sell beef trimmings to others."
For some time, Mr. Herlihy added, Swift has not used meat taken from near the spinal column of an animal. That material, he said, is sold for rendering into "nonfood products." Meat taken from that area, in a process known as advanced meat recovery, is thought to have the highest risk of contamination if an animal is infected with B.S.E.
In addition, Swift does not process any cattle that is classified as "downer," meaning it cannot walk on its own when it arrives at the slaughterhouse. Animals unable to leave the truck are returned to the supplier, Mr. Herlihy said, and those that become unable to move after arrival are killed and sent to landfills.
The company monitors cattle feed after animals arrive in its feed lots, before slaughter, and requires suppliers to sign affidavits stating that they were fed according to standards, which prohibit the use of bone meal and animal byproducts in the feed.
Meanwhile, beef's natural competitors are awaiting more information. Richard Lobb, a spokesman for the National Chicken Council in Washington, said he could not comment on the effect of the situation on his members, who include most of the chicken producers and processors in the country. "We're going to wait and see what happens," he said.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Mad Cow Fallout"The shares of publicly traded companies that process beef or own restaurants that offer beef as a mainstay of their menus fell yesterday. Prices of cattle futures and corn, a staple in the cattle diet, also fell. Some companies did very well, however, because they process alternatives to beef or sell tests to detect bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.

HEADLINE: Mad Cow in America 

 BODY:
Let's begin with the ifs. If the Holstein cow that was slaughtered in Washington State two weeks ago proves to be an isolated case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, and if the quarantine of the remaining herd was established in time, and if the cow's herd origin can be determined and the chain of events -- including the feed source resulting in that infection -- can be identified with no open ends leading into the food supply or the broader national cattle herd, then there is a chance that the American beef and dairy industries will not suffer unduly.
 But to every one of these ifs there is a counter-if. And, as the single case of B.S.E. discovered in Canada last May surely proved, this is a disease whose economic effects are dire for the simple reason that a single case leads to the immediate closing of international markets. Within hours after this case was announced on Tuesday, a number of nations closed their borders to American beef, just as we closed our borders this year against Canadian beef and against European beef in the early 1990's. 
 Cattle growers, industry representatives and the agriculture secretary, Ann Veneman, have gone out of their way to assure Americans of the continued safety of American beef. Their assurances are essentially correct, especially if consumers avoid ground beef and products like hot dogs, salami and bologna, which use meat obtained from systems that are designed to extract every last bit of usable tissue from carcasses. B.S.E. is not communicable among cattle on contact, and though humans can contract a version of it, called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the rate of infection is very low. All of this will be no consolation to cattle growers, who were enjoying historically high prices thanks to the absence of Canadian beef in the market and the Atkins diet fad. At the very least, they will get an unwelcome shock to the system. And at worst, they face the potential nightmare of the European epidemic, which began in Britain in 1986 and led to the destruction of more than a million animals.
This single case will expose the holes in the American system of meat production and disease testing. A tissue sample was taken from the sick Holstein, who could not walk, before it was slaughtered. The cattle industry has long resisted pressure to stop killing this sort of cow, known as a downer, and meat processors have so far refused to ban neck bones and spinal columns, where B.S.E. proteins can lodge, from automatic meat recovery systems. The government needs to dramatically increase the rate of testing nationwide. Last year, according to Secretary Veneman, the U.S.D.A. inspected only 20,526 cattle out of a herd of 35 million. And though the United States has prohibited the feeding of ruminant proteins to other ruminants, a major source of B.S.E. infection, those proteins can still be fed to chickens, pigs and other animals whose tissues end up in cattle feed. The risks that these gaps in the system pose are real and must be addressed swiftly. The fear is that any changes may come too late.

HEADLINE: G.I. Joes May Be Under Tree, but Not Around It 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL; Nate Levy contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: KILLEEN, Tex., Dec. 19 

 BODY:
When Specialist Nichola Gauthier of the First Cavalry Division in Fort Hood goes to war in March, who will watch her babies, Genevieve, now 2, and the 7-month-old twins, Gretchen and Isabella?
 Not their fathers. One has been a soldier in Iraq since April. The other was in the Army and now lives in Florida. Not her sister, Laura. She has been on duty in Iraq since April. The specialist's boyfriend cannot. He is leaving for Iraq in January. 
 So Specialist Gauthier, 27, Army mechanic and single mother from Brasher Falls, N.Y., is spending her Christmas arranging for her sister's husband -- a rare civilian in the family -- to be her interim nanny. 
Little Genevieve already senses something is up, her mother said. "She knows when I put on a green uniform, and she throws a tantrum." Still, Specialist Gauthier (pronounced GAH-tee-ay) said: "I feel strongly it's something I have to do. I've got my mind set on going. I just pray to God I'm going to come back to them."
Torn between country and children. It may sound like a particularly wrenching dilemma, a sort of Nichola's Choice, but it is just an extreme example of the countless everyday sacrifices being made by Americans in and out of uniform as the United States counts down a first year of war in Iraq.
Elsewhere, the war may be more distant, something seen on the news and in the headlines. But it is intensely personal here at Fort Hood, the nation's largest military installation, home to Lt. Gen. Thomas F. Metz's III Corps and its more than 40,000 troops, including the Fourth Infantry Division, which captured Saddam Hussein. The vast post covers 327 square miles, enough to fit all five boroughs of New York City.
For Mollie Miller, 26, whose husband, John, a lieutenant with the headquarters company of the Fourth Infantry, has been away since March 26, it is the loss of someone, as she says, "just to hold my hand."
For Emily Howard, 24, whose husband, Jess, is also a lieutenant away with the Fourth Infantry, it was waking up on their first wedding anniversary, Aug. 21, to a call summoning her husband to deploy that night. Still, she recalled wistfully: "We were able to go out to eat. We got to go to the Olive Garden."
For Melissa Phillips, 21, whose husband, Benjamin, a corporal with an armored unit of the Fourth Infantry, has been in Iraq since April, it is that he has not been around to see their year-old daughter take her first steps and say her first words. Ms. Phillips spends her time collecting furniture to store for other soldiers who have been deployed, and she works in a card store in the Killeen mall, where, she said, most people are buying cards that say "I miss you" and "I love you."
"I take it day by day, and I pray to God," she said.
What does she pray? "I'm just blessed with such a wonderful family. If something was to happen to my husband, I know that we had a happy marriage, and that's the way things were meant to be. I just think everything's in God's hands right now."
And for Lula Lopez, 19, who held hands with her husband, Hector, 23, as they walked through the mall, it was worrying about his imminent deployment to Iraq as a driver of the Army's biggest trucks for the 1st Cavalry Division. They met at a gasoline station in Killeen a year ago, married in April, and now she is three months' pregnant. 
"I'm behind him 24/7, 100 percent," Ms. Lopez said. "He needs to know that." 
But she said she did not think the war was justified: "I don't think it's right for our troops to go over there. It's bringing the nation down, moneywise, bringing everybody apart."
She was frightened, she said. They have talked about Hector dying. "We're trying to plan now, the wills, the banks," she said. "It's scary."
But it is not just the women. There are men like Sgt. Ken Harvey, 44, a trumpet player with the First Cavalry Band, who worries here at home while his wife, First Sgt. Renee J. Harvey, a clarinetist, has been in Iraq since April leading the Fourth Infantry Band. Meanwhile, he has been caring for their daughters, Erin, 11, and Hannah, 7, at least until he departs for Iraq in March or April, by which time, he said, "she should be back." If not, he had a brother in Missouri City who could take the girls.
Was band music that vital to the troops? 
"We shoot our weapons too," Sergeant Harvey said.
But he said the performances in the field were such morale-boosters that another Fort Hood ensemble he knew styled itself "Music Without Mercy." He did not want to dwell on it, he said, but if he had to he could play taps, too, for fallen soldiers.
Those left behind share tears in "Family Readiness Groups" and pair off as "battle buddies" to comfort each other during long periods of loneliness. Some wives keep their absent husband's voice on the answering machine for solace, or have dispensed with Christmas trees. Others buy artificial trees that will stay up, defiantly, until their men come home, they hope, in March or April, when the Fourth Infantry is due to return and the First Cavalry will replace it.
Some will never come home. Ursula Pirtle's husband, Specialist James H. Pirtle, was killed in Iraq Oct. 4 -- four weeks before their daughter Katie was born -- one of the 41 deaths from Fort Hood in the war to date. It is the nightmare those at home all struggle with.
Killeen empathizes. "We're home of America's heroes," said Mayor Maureen Jouett. "We're symbiotic. What's good for Killeen is good for Fort Hood, and what's good for Fort Hood is good for Killeen."
An early rail stop named for an 1880's railroad man, Killeen, a quintessential Army town of 103,000 spread along the gritty axis of Route 190 in Central Texas, has boomed along with Fort Hood. The post is an economic engine churning some $3.9 a year billion into the economy. Boosters call it the largest business in Texas. And Elvis slept here. It is where he trained in 1958, with the Second Armored Division, which became the Fourth Infantry Division.
William C. Chamberlain, a retired colonel who has made Killeen his home for 30 years, said he cherished its warm welcome after being showered with eggs upon his return from Vietnam. "We came back with no nothing," he said, his voice catching.
Ann Farris, deputy superintendent of the Killeen Independent School District, said the community offered a guarantee of sorts to the troops: "We take care of your families while you take care of us." 
Ms. Farris and her husband, she said, recently took in two teenagers of an Army couple who both went to war. When the news of "We got him!" raced through Fort Hood, she said, "our first question was, Who got him?" When the answer was the Fourth Infantry, they burst with pride, cheering, "We got him!"
Many young wives who could go home to their families while their husbands are away decide to stay in Killeen. 
"This is my home," said Brandi Azua, 20, who works in a shoe store and attends community college while her husband, Gabriel, serves in Iraq.
But sadness comes out in many ways. Noel Taylor, 29, a history and social studies teacher at Clear Creek Elementary in Killeen, sees 95 pupils a day, most of them children of soldiers in Iraq or headed there.
"Right now their focus isn't learning," Mr. Taylor said. "Their focus is their mother or father's safety."
The capture of Saddam Hussein led many to think the war was over and that their parents were coming home, Mr. Taylor said. "I'm having to tell them it's not over. We have a lot more work to do. Their constant question is why, why, why?"
He tried to turn it into a history lesson, talking about other wars, from the Revolution to Vietnam. Saddam Hussein, he told them, was like King George. To motivate his pupils, he displayed a large stack of gift certificates from the El Chico restaurant chain. They came in red, green and yellow, for Perfect Attendance, Honor Student and Bravo -- the last a generic award for a student who just needs a boost. 
"They get a thrill out of this," Mr. Taylor said. "Plus, it allows the family to go out, and save money if a certificate is used."
At the Killeen Chamber of Commerce in a 1913 train depot, two workers, Amy Shepherd, 23, and Jennifer Kirkpatrick, 26, commiserate. "I'm very proud of him, he's so exited to be going," Ms. Shepherd said of her boyfriend, Chris Taylor, a First Cav sniper due to leave soon for Iraq. "At first I couldn't understand," she said. "How could you be so excited about going to war? But yeah, I would be excited about getting to do something I've been trained for."
Ms. Kirkpatrick said the imminent departure, too, of her husband, C. J., with the First Cav, made their remaining time more precious. "Right now, I'm so grateful to be crowded in bed or to trip over his boots," she said. "They are proofs of his presence."
As the wife of Sgt. Maj. Charles Fuss, the Fourth Infantry's highest ranking noncommissioned officer, now in Iraq, Roxanne Fuss, 44, is Fort Hood's cheery comforter in chief, dedicated to lifting the morale of relatives left behind. "There is no alone," she likes to assure them.
But when a group of wives -- her iron ladies, she called them -- presented her with some Christmas gifts the other day, her eyes misted. First was an action figure that is a big seller at the PX this Christmas -- a Fourth Infantry soldier doll complete with flak jacket, hand grenades and Meals Ready to Eat.
"He looks about Chuck's height, 6-2," Ms. Fuss decided, her voice strained.
Then she unwrapped a small glass figurine holding the division insignia, a cluster of four ivy leaves.
"It's an angel," said Jenny Murray, whose husband, Gordon, is a command sergeant major with an aviation battalion in Iraq. "Because," she continued, "you're the angel in our life."
"Oh, my God!" Ms. Fuss said, holding it up. "Do you see her? She's beautiful. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!" Then the tears came.
The women were hugging when a cellphone's trill intruded. Sharon Jones, 38, an emergency room nurse whose husband, Milton, is the Fourth Infantry's command sergeant major in Iraq, rummaged in her bag and held the phone to her ear. "Hello!" she said, suddenly beaming. "Yes, I'm here."
"Shhh," everyone said. The room fell silent. Ms. Jones was talking to her husband.

HEADLINE: In Search of a Lift, Canada Considers a R ate Cut 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
At the start of 2003, Canada was the industrialized world's star performer, boasting the highest growth rate among the major economies, a tidy budget surplus and a strong trade balance.
 But as the year draws to a close, the mood in Toronto's business and financial community is one of disappointment. The letdown is sufficiently pervasive that a growing number of economists expect the central bank to lower interest rates in early 2004 as a way of injecting more vigor into the economy -- even as it appears to be on the mend. 
 Citing recent trends in interest rate futures, Avery Shenfeld, senior economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto, said on Wednesday, "The markets are betting that either in January or March, the Bank of Canada will cut rates." 
 Dale Orr, a managing director at the Global Insight consultancy in Toronto, said that "the bank's leaning would be not to cut interest rates unless there's a real good reason to do that." With moderate growth, the bank has some reason to believe that things will improve and that cutting rates would be unnecessary, or even inflationary. 
 In Mr. Orr's view, however, the central bank faces "a pretty tough call" at its next review of monetary policy on Jan. 20. The reason is the lofty Canadian dollar.
 Business activity was dented earlier in the year by the outbreak of the SARS virus in Toronto, which hit tourism and retail sales, and the discovery of a single case of mad cow disease on a farm in northern Alberta, halting Canadian beef exports. But the chief reason for the slowdown was a surge in the Canadian dollar from a record low of 62 American cents in early 2002 to over 77 cents earlier this month, a 24 percent appreciation. The Canadian dollar traded at about 76 cents on Wednesday. 
 The buoyant currency has eroded revenues at many exporters, especially manufacturers, while making imported products more competitive. According to Statistics Canada, exports fell 9.2 percent in October compared with a year ago, lowering the trade surplus to 5.1 billion Canadian dollars, or $3.9 billion at the present rate of exchange, from 5.4 billion in October 2002. 
 Echoing many other companies, Samuel Manu-Tech of Toronto, which produces steel and plastic industrial products, cited the strong dollar for a 62 percent drop in earnings in the first nine months. 
 "Further appreciation will continue to have a detrimental impact on future earnings," the company said in its third-quarter report. 
 Global Insight has forecast that while total American imports would grow about 7 percent in 2004, Canada's exports to its neighbor would rise only 4 percent. "We're going to be losing market share to China and Mexico," Mr. Orr said. 
 The Bank of Canada's overnight rate is 2.75 percent. The bank raised the rate twice last winter, to 3.25 percent, when the economy was brisk enough to raise concerns about accelerating inflation. Canada's economy expanded 3.3 percent in 2002, after adjusting for inflation, compared with 2.2 percent in the United States.
 But this year, the roles are reversed. The Canadian economy contracted in the second quarter and expanded by 1.1 percent, at an annualized rate, from July to September -- far behind the United States' third-quarter growth of 8.2 percent. Statistics Canada reported this week that growth advanced 1.7 percent in October over the year-ago month.
 The Bank of Canada's governor, David Dodge, acknowledged in a speech this month that Canadian businesses had more excess capacity "than we had anticipated." But Mr. Dodge said that he expected fourth-quarter growth to be "well above" 4 percent annualized, thanks to stronger demand from the United States, rising domestic business investment and buoyant consumer spending. Mr. Dodge spoke before the release of the October growth data on Tuesday.
 Ted Carmichael, chief economist at J.P. Morgan Securities Canada, estimated in a report this week that if the economy continued to expand at the October rate through November and December, fourth-quarter growth would be 3.5 percent.

HEADLINE: The '12 Days' Index Shows a Record Increase 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
True love, at least when it comes to the gift-giving kind in the classic carol "The Twelve Days of Christmas," would cost an eye-popping $65,264 this year -- a record 19 percent increase over last year's price tag. 
 For nearly two decades, at the beginning of the holiday season, a Pennsylvania financial services firm has tallied the cost of the assorted tokens of affection detailed in the medieval carol -- from the lone partridge in a pear tree to the dozen drummers drumming. 
 This year, the price had its biggest jump since the firm, PNC Advisors started putting its Christmas price index together in 1984 as a tongue-in-cheek analysis of the economy. 
 Jeff Kleintop, chief strategist at PNC Advisors, attributed the abrupt reversal from 2002, when the index fell 7.6 percent, to rising costs of skilled labor. A case in point, he said, piping pipers and drumming drummers both rose a steep 22.8 percent this year from last.
 In the mid-1980's, the cost of merchandise dominated the indexes, he said, but "the trend over time has been toward lower goods prices, such as the pear tree, and higher prices for skilled labor, such as the pipers."
 Today's prices of $1,982.40 for the 11 pipers and $2,147.60 for the dozen working drummers, provided by a musicians' union, helped bring the total for the grand finale on Day 12 -- when all the components are in place -- to $16,885.28, up from $14,558.05 last year. 
 As for the cost of eight maids a-milking, at $41.60 an hour, that remained steady. This is because of abundant cheap labor in countries like China pressing manufacturers to maintain profitability by outsourcing their unskilled labor overseas, Mr. Kleintop said.
 So, "unfortunately, the unskilled maids haven't managed an increase in price for their services in many years," he said.
 Driving up the shopping list's total price tag this year were the required seven swans a-swimming. Unlike last year, when the price of swans sank to $300 apiece because of an oversupply of trumpeter swans, the majestic birds reclaimed their 2001 level of $500 each, according to the Philadelphia Zoo.
 But PNC also offset the swan expenses -- along with the 26.6 percent rise in the cost of four calling birds, which this year totaled $400 -- when it calculated a core index that excluded cost anomalies. Even then, the Christmas price index rose 7.4 percent, somewhat closer to the government's Consumer Price Index, which measures a far broader range of goods and services, and rose just under 2 percent this year.
 Some of the index's presents, including gold rings and pear trees, dropped in price. Pear trees plummeted 28.6 percent, to $62.50, from $87.50, reflecting a reduced demand for the trees, according to Rebekah McCahan, the investment strategist at PNC Advisors who has been putting together the figures since 1986. 
 Gold rings, at $361.25, dropped 5.6 percent. Cheaper gold rings could probably be found by the determined shopper on the Internet. But higher shipping costs eroded any online bargains this year.
 All told, in the 19th annual index the "true cost of Christmas" -- the total cost of all 364 items over 12 days -- is 19 percent higher than last year's grand total of $54,951.
 The previous record increase from one Christmas to the next was in 1987, when the price jumped 8.4 percent.
 Mr. Kleintop noted that the price tag this year was roughly the same as a luxury sport utility vehicle, which is a lot easier to buy.

As Beef Inquiry Continues, Export Market Shrinks
Agriculture officials hope to be able to determine where, when and how a Holstein in Washington State became infected with mad cow disease as a clue to whether other animals also carry it. But they have faced slow going because of a lack of centralized records on the animal's history.
 Jittery beef importers were not waiting for the results. About two-thirds of the export market for beef had already dried up early in the day. About 10 percent of American beef, worth about $2.6 billion a year, is exported. Commodity traders, meanwhile, beat down the price of beef futures by 1.5 cents a pound, the daily limit. Page A1. 

Concern about the safety of American beef will most likely dent the business of supermarkets, meat processors and others involved in its sale and distribution, experts said. A22.

McDonald's and Tyson Foods led stocks lower, after reports of the first case of mad cow disease. The Dow lost 36.07 points, to 10,305.19. The Standard & Poor's 500 declined 1.98 points, to 1,094.04. The Nasdaq fell 5.55 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,969.23. C5.

Durable Goods Orders Drop Sharply
Orders for big-ticket goods at factories dropped 3.1 percent in November, the Commerce Department said. It was the largest decline in more than a year, raising new questions about how firm a grip manufacturers have on their own fragile recovery. Also, the department said new-home sales declined 2.4 percent in November, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.08 million, New claims for unemployment benefits dipped last week by a seasonally adjusted 1,000, to 353,000, the Labor Department said.

HEADLINE: Grain Trader Restores Its Argentine Homestead 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
When the scaffolding enveloping 501 25 de Mayo Street comes down in January, the Bunge & Born logo carved in stone over the entrance to the historic headquarters of one of South America's most illustrious -- and now best-performing -- companies will have been restored to its former glory.
 "It will be magnificent," Raul Padilla, president and chief executive of what is today called Bunge Argentina, said of the grand building where the company's main offices will soon return. "It is a sign we are going back to our roots, both geographically and in terms of our core business." 
 But these days, what started out in the 19th century as an Argentine grain and oilseed trading business, run by the Bunge and the Born families, is part of Bunge Ltd., a global agribusiness company based in the United States with revenue last year of more than $14 billion. Bunge Ltd. now rivals giants like Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, though those two are still much more widely known in North America. Wall Street analysts consider Bunge to be one of the hottest stocks in its sector. 
 It has been a long evolution.
 Flush with the riches of South American agribusiness in the 1930's, Bunge & Born grew into an unwieldy, but still family-run, conglomerate doing business in grains, chemicals and other products in both Argentina and Brazil. It moved its headquarters to Brazil in the late 1970's. Its image was that of a secretive, clannish private corporation, known more for its internal feuding and political intrigue than for its profits.
 But after a protracted family feud in the 1990's, a group of shareholders gained the upper hand and decided to turn the company into a more professional organization.
 First it shed a variety of money-losing or extraneous businesses in Argentina and Brazil. In 1999, the company again moved its headquarters, this time to White Plains in the New York suburbs, and two years after that it sold about 20 percent of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Bunge refocused on its core business, processing and exporting grains and oilseed, principally soy, from three main markets: the United States, Brazil and Argentina. According to Mr. Padilla, about half the company's revenue comes from South America.
 So far, the company's return to its roots seems to be paying off. Since its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in August 2001 at $16 a share, Bunge's stock has more than doubled. In the same period, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen 10.3 percent, and Archer Daniels Midland has risen 21.9 percent.
 "There are not many companies in the food sector that can claim such performance," said John M. McMillin, an analyst at the Prudential Equity Group in New York.
 When Bunge & Born was founded here in 1884, a spinoff of a Dutch company founded by a German, Johannpeter G. Bunge, South America was poised to become the world's main grain supplier.
 It then lost that predominance to the United States. But with recent technological advances and wide-open farmland in Brazil and Argentina that is easily mechanized and farmed with low-cost labor, South America is clawing back toward the lead.
 "The United States used to be considered the breadbasket of the world," Mr. McMillin said, "but most now admit that South America is becoming more efficient." 
 This year, for the first time, the combined soybean output of Argentina and Brazil was more than that of the United States. And Brazilian farmers overtook American farmers as the world's largest soy traders, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.
 Bunge's chief executive, Alberto Weisser, expects earnings per share to grow 10 percent to 12 percent a year over the next five years, and annual operating profits to increase 30 percent or more a year in the short term, despite a recent earnings warning and disappointing third-quarter net income because of a weaker-than-expected soy harvest in the United States.
 Though some 55 percent of the company's global sales are soy-related, analysts say growth in South American harvests can more than make up for the United States shortfall.
 Bunge, of course, is not immune to the risks inherent to most Latin American businesses, which historically have faced extreme cycles of boom and bust, along with all sorts of political uncertainties and economic experiments. But the recent devaluations of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso mean the company's local operations are highly competitive in a dollar-denominated market. In both Argentina and Brazil, Bunge is now the third-largest exporter.
 According to Daniel Pasquali, an analyst at the brokerage firm Fator Doria Atherino in Sao Paulo, Bunge's global importance and prestige were reflected last month when Arminio Fraga, Brazil's former central bank president, accepted a seat on the board.
 "He is considered the creme de la creme here and abroad, so it's a vote of confidence for the company and for the agribusiness sector here in Brazil," Mr. Pasquali said.
 Though Bunge's stock has risen strongly on the Sao Paulo bourse since January, trading seems relatively lackluster. Last month, traders swapped an average of 400,000 reais ($130,000) a day in Bunge shares, four times the average a year earlier. But that amount is still dwarfed by trading in the benchmark telecommunications company, Telemar, which averaged 140 million reais a day.
 Investors might be put off, Mr. Pasquali said, because Bunge is still "a family-owned company sometimes lacking in transparency."
 "My impression," he added, "is that the family runs things with a firm hand."
 Mr. McMillan of Prudential disagreed. Though the family still holds about four-fifths of the shares of Bunge Ltd., "there are hundreds of family members who are shareholders," he said.
 "It's not like Ford," he added. "It's much more dispersed."
 Several Wall Street analysts declined to talk about the family members' involvement in Bunge's management. Traditionally, five main family factions have fought for control of the company.
 Perhaps the most turbulent point in Bunge's roller coaster history was the 1974 kidnapping of Jorge Born, then the company president, and his brother, Juan, by leftist guerrillas. A $60 million ransom was paid and the brothers were freed, but Jorge was soon involved in politics again, nominating two economy ministers to the cabinet of President Carlos Saul Menem in the early 1990's. That proved too much for other family members, who ousted him and paved the way for professional management.
Analysts agree that since the initial public offering, the shareholders have let Mr. Weisser get on with his job, giving the company a stronger focus and strengthening its market position.
 Since September, the markets have been awash with rumors that Bunge would totally or partly buy out a rival, the Paris-based Louis Dreyfus Group, something neither company has confirmed or denied. Such an acquisition would further strengthen Bunge's position as a global player.
 "Bunge has an acquisition-oriented management team, and they have a desire to buy Dreyfus," Mr. McMillin said. "But they're also a financially astute management team, and so they are only willing to buy for the right price."

Report of Cow Disease Hurts Shares in Short Trading Day

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks declined in trading shortened for the holiday, led by McDonald's and Tyson Foods, after reports of the country's first case of mad cow disease. The Dow Jones industrial average fell for the first time in seven days.
 "It's a negative for beef producers, a negative for restaurants serving beef," Russ Koesterich, equity strategist at State Street Global Markets, said in a radio interview. 
 The Dow lost 36.07 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,305.19, after increasing 3.2 percent in the previous six days. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 1.98 points, or 0.2 percent,to 1,094.04. The Nasdaq composite index fell 5.55 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,969.23. 
 The benchmarks stayed within relatively narrow ranges. The Dow average moved 102.59 points from its high to low. The S.&P. 500 fluctuated 3.67 points and the Nasdaq 9.43 points.
 Stocks were also hurt as orders for durable goods and sales of new homes unexpectedly fell in November, muting optimism that the pace of economic growth is sustainable.
 About the same number of stocks advanced as declined on the New York Stock Exchange. About 517 million shares changed hands on the Big Board in a half-day of trading.
 Stock exchanges shut at 1 p.m. in New York. Markets will be closed today for Christmas and will shut at 1 p.m. tomorrow.
 McDonald's, the world's largest hamburger chain, slid $1.32, or 5.2 percent, to $23.96, for the biggest drop in the S.&P. 500 and Dow average. Tyson, the world's biggest meat processor, shed $1.08, to $12.90.
 The agriculture secretary, Ann M. Veneman, announced that a cow in Washington State tested positive for the disease, a potential threat to the $175 billion beef industry. Japan, which is the largest importer of American beef, suspended imports as did South Korea and Taiwan. Mad cow disease, the common name for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, produces a lethal human variant, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, that has been blamed for more than 120 deaths, mostly in Britain.
 Wendy's International, the hamburger restaurant company, lost $1.87, to $37.79. Sonic, which operates drive-in restaurants, dropped $1.53, to $29.51. Rare Hospitality International, which owns three steakhouse chains including Bugaboo Creek Steak House, fell $1.88, to $23.69.
 Deere, the world's largest maker of farm equipment, fell $2.54, to $64.50.
 Bio-Rad Laboratories, which makes the best-selling test for mad cow disease in animals, rose $10.04, or 20 percent, to $59.82.
 Orders for goods made to last at least three years fell 3.1 percent in November from a revised 4 percent gain the previous month, the Commerce Department said. Economists had forecast an increase of 1 percent.
 United Technologies, a leading maker of elevators and air-conditioners, declined 92 cents, to $94.06. Boeing, the aircraft maker, fell 58 cents, to $41.36. 
 Sales of new houses last month declined to an annual rate of 1.082 million, the slowest since May, the Commerce Department said. Economists had estimated an increase to a 1.125 million annual rate.
 Centex, owner of Centex Homes, one of the largest American home builders, lost $1.09, to $110.01. Toll Brothers, a leading builder of luxury homes, declined 45 cents, to $40.54.
 Still, stock indexes are poised for their first annual gain in four years as growth in the American economy rebounds, fueling higher corporate profits. The S.&P. 500 and the Dow have risen 24 percent this year and the Nasdaq has climbed 47 percent.
 Some investors said stock prices already reflected prospects for earnings and economic growth. The S.&P. 500 is trading at 20 times estimated earnings, up from a low of 15 times in March.
 "Valuations reflect a lot of the economic recovery," said Jeff Van Harte, who manages $5 billion at Transamerica Investment Services in San Francisco. "We feel good about the economy next year and earnings will be good. But prices have somewhat recognized that."
 Treasury security prices surged in New York in response to reports on durable goods orders and new-home sales. The declines reported in that November data reinforced a view that the Federal Reserve might refrain from raising interest rates in 2004.
 In a shortened trading session, the benchmark 10-year note gained 19/32 to a price of 100 16/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 4.19 percent from 4.26 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: A Beef Scare, Adding to the Jitters 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "U.S. Is Examining a Mad Cow Case, First in Country" (front page, Dec. 24) is deja vu to us Canadians. 
After one cow tested positive for mad cow disease this year, the response from our international trading partners, including our largest, the United States, was swift and unjustified -- a complete ban on all Canadian beef products. 
 The United States will soon discover what it feels like to be the Typhoid Mary of the beef world. When Canada tried to defend its beef industry and argued in vain how reliable and safe its beef industry was, our words fell on deaf ears. The economic repercussions on Canada to date have been near catastrophic for our billion-dollar beef export market.
What is about to take place over the coming weeks for your country is sure to be a rough ride, as Canadians learned, and there is little you can do to offset the negative impact and stigma. Our sympathies go out to you.

HEADLINE: MAD COW DISEASE IN THE UNITED STATES: THE OVERVIEW; 
U.S. SCOURS FILES TO TRACE SOURCE OF MAD COW CASE

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Agriculture officials pored through cattle sales records at two Washington State companies on Wednesday in hope of finding where a cow with mad cow disease was born so they could trace the extent of the outbreak.
 Officials hope to be able to determine where, when and how the Holstein became infected with the disease as a clue to whether other animals were also infected. But they have faced slow going because of a lack of centralized records on the animal's history, officials said. 
 Beef importers abroad were not waiting for the results. By early Wednesday, about two-thirds of the export market for beef had already dried up, with Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Russia and South Africa all banning imports of American beef, agriculture officials said. About 10 percent of American beef, worth about $2.6 billion a year, is exported. 
Reacting to the announcement about the infected cow made late Tuesday, traders on Wednesday beat down the price of beef futures on the commodity exchange by 1.5 cents a pound, the daily limit, and the stock of the McDonald's Corporation fell 5.2 percent, to $23.96 a share, the day's worst performance among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial average. Tyson Foods, the world's biggest meat processor, fell 7.7 percent, to $12.90 a share.
Agriculture officials, meanwhile, repeated their assertions that meat from sick animals is not infectious -- only tissues in the nervous system -- and that those tissues are unlikely to enter the food supply of people or of animals susceptible to the disease. But they issued a "voluntary recall" for more than 10,000 pounds of beef.
And in restaurants and supermarkets, people talked worriedly about beef that was in their freezers or that might hit supermarket shelves in weeks to come.
The prevailing attitude among restaurateurs was wait-and-see. Still, some immediately adjusted their menus, removing items like braised beef cheeks and bone-marrow mashed potatoes, made from animal parts considered high risk. And fast-food chains issued statements assuring customers that they had put safeguards in place several years ago.
The extent of the reaction from the public and the economic markets may depend on how widespread the outbreak is determined to be. But on Wednesday, the Agriculture Department could say only that it was on the trail. Officials said that the cow that was found to have mad cow disease probably contracted it from feed as a young animal, but officials do not know where it was born or where the other animals in that herd were now. It came through one of two livestock markets, and "at least one of the livestock markets in question has very good records," said Dr. Ron DeHaven, chief veterinarian of the Department of Agriculture.
But officials continued to say that public health is protected because the parts of the animal that can spread the disease are not normally used in food for humans.
Those parts are not supposed to be used in food for cows, either, being diverted instead for food for poultry and house pets. Officials said only about 75 percent of processers complied with the rule when it took effect in 1997 but that figure has risen significantly since then. The Holstein appeared to be about four years old and was probably born in 1999, officials said. 
Critics have complained that progress toward compliance has been uneven. 
Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, an environmental and public health group, said that government reports in October 2003 and April 2002 showed that the number of violations had tripled. 
"It doesn't look like the word has gotten out," Mr. Blackwelder said. "You have to wonder, why with the dramatic impacts to the Canadian beef industry, and seeing what it's done in Europe, why mess around and take any kind of risk?" 
Canada, which normally exports most of its beef, reported a single case in May, and its exports are still limited as a result. Mr. Blackwelder said that because the United States Agriculture Department could not say where the sick cow came from, "the idea they've got just one area that's a problem is not a credible scenario."
But Dr. Stephen Sundlof, director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the Food and Drug Administration, said that 1,826 companies handle the parts of cattle that can transmit the disease -- the brains, spinal cord and the upper part of small intestine -- and that only two are out of compliance.
Dr. Linda Detwiler, a veterinarian who retired this year as head of the mad cow disease working group at the Agriculture Department, said the rules themselves were inadequate. For example, litter swept from poultry factory farms, consisting largely of food the birds have not eaten, can be fed to cows, but this might allow cow nerve tissue back into the cow food chain, she said.
And, Dr. Detwiler said, the country needs a way to trace animals quickly. Private companies have proposed a variety of solutions; one, Digital Angel Corporation, of St. Paul Minn., sells microchips the size of a grain of rice that can record data and be implanted in an animal. In this country the main market is house pets, but the company has a variant that also measures body temperature, which it is marketing in England. The hope is to find a pattern of body temperature that is an early clue to the disease, formally bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Currently it can be identified only post mortem.
Agriculture officials, meanwhile, continued to try to reassure the public. In a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, Ann M. Veneman, the secretary of agriculture, said that "the risk to human health from this situation is extremely low, and people should continue to feel very confident in our meat supply."
Dr. DeHaven said the outstanding questions about the infected cow were: "Where did this animal come from, where were the feed sources, where did animals move out of this herd?" The animal was purchased by a farm near Yakima, Wash., in October 2001, shortly before having her first calf.
Early Wednesday, his department issued a "voluntary recall" for 10,410 pounds of raw beef "that may have been exposed to tissues containing the infectious agents," he said. That consisted of the carcass of the diseased cow and 19 others that were processed at the same time.
Neurological samples were taken on the day the cow was taken from the herd and slaughtered, Dec. 9, and received at a government laboratory in Ames, Iowa, on Dec. 11, officials said. The samples were not prepared for analysis until Dec. 16 or 17. Dr. DeHaven said that the laboratory used a test that was "the gold standard," called immunohistochemistry but that it takes five days, so the initial results were not available until the Dec. 22. When those came back positive, more tests were run, taking another day. Final tests in England will take another few days. 
In the last few years, Congress has come close to approving legislation to prohibit the slaughter for human consumption of "downer" cattle -- those that cannot walk. The inability to walk can be caused by many factors, but it is one symptom of mad cow disease.
The measures have been vigorously opposed by the farm lobbies and have been blocked by leaders from both parties on the House Agriculture Committee.
In 2001 and 2002, the legislation was passed by the House and Senate as part of a large farm bill, but the committee leaders saw to it that the provisions were not in the bill that came out of the conference committee. This year, the Senate favored a rider on the agriculture appropriations bill that would have prevented the slaughter of these cows. In July, the prohibition was rejected by the House, 202 to 199, and it is not part of the omnibus spending bill now before Congress.
Representative Gary L. Ackerman, Democrat of Queens, the chief sponsor of the legislation in the House this year, argued in the debate that it would "improve the safety of our food supply and prevent animals such as these from entering our food chain." 
But Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who heads the agriculture committee, argued that if it were against the law to slaughter downer cows for human consumption, animals sick with mad cow disease would never be spotted by veterinarians or food inspectors. The animals would be buried on the farms or "perhaps even put into the food chain illegitimately, because the farmer has absolutely no incentive to do anything otherwise," Mr. Goodlatte said.
Chandler Keys, Washington lobbyist for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said that decisions about "downer" animals were made by government veterinarians at the slaughterhouses, and that he would be open to changing the guidance given to them. But, he said, "just putting out a government fiat about that, a poorly written law that says no to an animal that has a limp, that's not a risk-based system."
Mr. Keys also argued that the United States was not as vulnerable to problems like those in Europe, where bovine spongiform encephalopathy is believed to have caused scores of cases of a human form, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In Europe, he said, brain tissue was part of the normal cuisine. But, he said, "People wouldn't take kindly to eating brain in their hamburger. It's just never been the practice here."

AUDITOR SAYS CRITICALPATH IN DANGER OF CLOSING

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 Critical Path Inc., an e-mail software maker that earlier this year laid off 30 percent of its work force, said its auditor has said there is a possibility the company may go out of business. The auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, has said there is "substantial doubt" that Critical Path can continue as a going concern because of recurring losses and lack of capital, the company, based in San Francisco, said in a regulatory filing. 
Critical Path, which last month hired a chief financial officer, has not had a profitable year since its initial offering in March 1999. Software-license and messaging sales have fallen for two years. The company is trying to raise $36 million by the first quarter, through a private placement and by selling stock to existing shareholders; without that money it will not be able to stay in business, it said in the filing.

HEADLINE: Mining the Sanitized Mischief of Sitcomland 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
"Cheaper by the Dozen" is a bubbling crockpot of farcical mush to warm the tummies of anyone who really and truly misses "The Brady Bunch," and I mean really and truly.
 This story of a big, mostly happy family that includes 12 mostly adorable children and 2 mostly adoring parents, whose 23-year marriage still has a snap of sex, is set in suburban Illinois. But its real location is that imaginary playground of cheery roughhouse and sanitized mischief known as Sitcomland. It is a place where the darkest scowl has a silver lining of twinkling affection, and where the toys may be modern but the year will now and forever be 1955. 
 The movie, which opens nationally today, is nominally a remake of the 1950 family comedy starring Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy. (Both films are adapted from a best-selling 1948 memoir by Frank Bunker Gilbreth Jr. and his sister Ernestine Gilbreth Carey.) In this new version, which has little resemblance to the book, the parents' names have been changed along with their backgrounds. Tom Baker (Steve Martin), the genial ruler of the roost, is a college football coach who sacrificed his dreams of working with a first-division team to settle for a third-division outfit in cozy, sleepy Midland, Ill. His wife, Kate (Bonnie Hunt), gave up a career as a newspaper journalist to play supermom. Somehow she has found time to complete a family chronicle that she has been peddling to publishers.
With "Parenthood" and two "Father of the Bride" movies under his belt, Mr. Martin has earned his crown as the movies' most affably, reassuring 50's-style dad since Spencer Tracy, and he is the best thing in the movie. Mr. Martin barely has to think to play Tom, a role that is not just a piece of cake but a morsel of buttery fudge that instantly melts in his mouth.
Never mind that the notion of Mr. Martin as a college football coach is laughable. With his signature grimace, a wince that passes for a smile at moments of peak stress, he is the apotheosis of long-suffering paternal unflappability. Ms. Hunt's Kate, who supervises the brood's assembly-line breakfasts, is also perfect. But to accept her as the mother of 12 is to believe that rigorous child-bearing is the surest path to achieving the svelte figure, unlined face and perky temperament of an efficient, even-tempered high school girl enraptured by classes in home economics.
The movie follows the Bakers through a crisis brought on by Mom and Dad's late-blooming decision to try to have it all. Just when Mom's memoir is accepted by a New York publisher who insists that she go on a book tour, Dad's deferred football dreams are reignited with an invitation to coach a first-division team in another town. Despite a lot of grumbling by the children, the family moves from Midland to a sprawling dream house in Evanston, which the film portrays as a hypercompetive yuppie enclave out of sync with the Bakers' homier approach to life.
But with Mom away and Dad sweating to prove himself in his high-powered job, who will run the household? The oldest daughter, Nora, who has moved out of the house to be with her vain boyfriend (an uncredited Ashton Kutcher) sporadically pitches in. But there is finally no substitute for Mom (is there ever?), who is off hawking her book on "Live With Regis and Kelly," with Oprah waiting in line, and chaos erupts.
The movie farce revolves around elaborate comic set pieces in which a minor mishap like an escaped pet frog at the breakfast table sets off a dizzying chain reaction that leaves everything in a shambles. When the children disagree with family policy, they organize themselves into cute little protesting armies. The most distinctive of the younger children is Mark (Forrest Landis), a nerdy misfit called FedEx by his siblings to suggest he was sent to the family by accident. Not to worry, however: no one in this brood is capable of real cruelty. Two older children, football-playing Charlie (Tom Welling) and fashion-conscious Lorraine (Hilary Duff), are as bland and personality-deficient as Ms. Hunt's Kate. Neither role could be called career advancing.
If "Cheaper by the Dozen," directed by Shawn Levy, has only the most tenuous hold on reality, its happy times carry a sting of regret. To surrender to a movie like this is to buy on some level its impossibly idealized portrait of family togetherness. Once its cozy glow wears off, a tiny part of you is likely to feel a pang that your family isn't as happy and secure as the Bakers. No family could be.
"Cheaper by the Dozen" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has one or two profanities.

HEADLINE: Europe Weighs the Unthinkable: High College Fees 

BYLINE:  By SARAH LYALL

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
Europeans, led by Britain, are rethinking their long-held belief that university education should be financed almost entirely by the state.
 With costs rising, more students enrolling and universities lagging behind their American competitors, there is a growing sense that universities need to look beyond the government for money. In continental Europe, where universities charge either nothing or nominal tuition fees, governments are just beginning to talk about if, and how much, they can reasonably expect students to pay. 
 Here in Britain, which introduced tuition fees in 1998, Prime Minister Tony Blair faces a bruising fight next month over his government's bold and unpopular proposal to allow Britain's universities to triple their annual tuition fees, to $:3,000 a year, or $5,300, starting in 2006. 
The government argues that the move is essential if the country's universities are to remain internationally competitive. But Mr. Blair is confronting formidable opposition from inside and outside his party, as well as from student groups who say that the plan would discourage would-be students and contradict the deeply held believe that higher education is a citizen's right, as much as, say, health care. 
"There's a long welfare-state tradition in this country in which it's assumed that taxation will fund all public services, including education and higher education," said Prof. Ivor Crewe, president of Universities U.K., an organization made up of the vice chancellors of 122 British universities, which supports the government's proposals. 
That may have been reasonable when fewer Britons aspired to go to college, he said, but "it's quite different when 40 percent expect to go."
In a recent report, the European Commission said that European countries spend just 1.1 percent of their gross domestic product on higher education, compared with 2.3 percent in the United States, with the difference coming from private funding, including tuition fees. American universities also have higher endowments and better fund-raising operations, meaning that American universities have two to five times as much to spend on each student, according to the commission report. This translates into smaller classes, better facilities, a wider range of available courses, and higher-paid teachers.
"Countries have to get real about mass higher education," said Nicholas Barr, professor of public economics at the London School of Economics. "The way they've done it in mainland Europe is to cram more and more people in the universities without raising the financing per student." 
In France, where undergraduates pay from 280 to 350 euros a year, or $350 to $435, to take classes in sprawling, chaotic universities, students recently took to the streets to protest against a number of proposed changes to the system that, they feared, would lead to competition between universities and pave the way for increased privatization and higher tuition fees.
In Germany, where undergraduate education is still free in public universities, a number of state governments have gone to court to challenge a federal law, passed last year, that forbids public universities to charge tuition. At the same time, impending budget cuts in state university financing have touched off student strikes and protests in Berlin and other cities. 
"It is part of the Social Democrat ideology that one of the prime rights of humanity is to have a free university education," Toni Schmid, an official in the Bavarian education ministry, said of the German government. With about two million students, compared with some 200,000 in the early 1970's, Mr. Schmid said, the ratio of students to teachers at German universities is currently about 80 or 90 to 1. 
Bavaria, which has to cut 5 percent cut from its higher-education budget of $1.86 billion this year, is one of the states suing for the right to charge tuition. "In Bavaria, there's a saying, 'If it's free, it isn't worth anything,' " Mr. Schmid said. "Studying at university is very valuable, and we think it should cost something."
Under the British plan, low-income students would have access to scholarships and grants to help with living costs, and no one would have to pay the tuition up front. Rather, the fees would be handled as loans, which students would be required to repay only after after they have left school and begun earning about $25,000 or $30,000 a year.
Mr. Blair all but staked his job on the plan's passage. "It is a huge argument to make, and it is as big an argument as people made when they were founding the welfare state," he said earlier this month.
But students' groups are suspicious, saying the plan would deter poorer students from entering a university and lead to higher fees in future years, sending Britain down an American-style route of spiraling costs and debt-laden young people.
"I don't think anyone is in doubt that higher education is underfunded," said Dan Ashley, a spokesman for the National Union of Students, which represents student groups. "But we don't believe that asking the person who has the least -- the cash-strapped student -- to pay the most is the answer."
The British government and the schools say they have no choice but to pursue this course. The universities, which are receiving $14.6 billion this year from the government, need some $14 billion more over the next three years in order to maintain standards, Mr. Crewe said.
This is a time of rapid expansion in the student population, as Britons increasingly accept that higher education is not simply for the middle class. In 1985, only 14 percent of high-school graduates went to college; the figure is now close to 40 percent.
At the same time, physical plants are languishing; university departments are closing; and talented faculty members are being lured to the United States, where salaries are higher and research conditions more attractive. While British institutions produced 46 Nobel laureates in science in the past 51 years, according to the government, only 14 won in the last 20 years.
"Oxford and Cambridge are lagging behind, not in faculty quality, but in replacement," said Prof. David Hendry, chairman of the economics department at Oxford. "One worry I have about the system is that 35 to 40 percent of our top academics will retire by 2012, and there's nobody to replace them."
Oxford estimates that it loses about $4,000 per student per year and is running at a $40.5 million annual deficit, a gap it has filled by transferring cash from investments and other outside income. Undergraduates from outside the European Union pay $13,000 to $18,400 a year, depending on what courses they take. That range provides some insight into what the market would bear if the universities were free to set their own fees.
If objections to the proposal are formidable, many education experts feel it does not go far enough. Lord Butler, the master of University College, Oxford, recently suggested that tuition be at least $8,800 a year, while Sir Richard Sykes, rector of Imperial College, London, has suggested $17,600 to $21,000 a year.
The Conservative Party is fighting the plan by reversing its traditional free-market position and vowing to scrap university tuition altogether if it comes into power. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, favor raising taxes to close the financing gap. 
More worryingly for Mr. Blair, 159 Labor members of Parliament signed a motion criticizing the plan this month, saying it contradicted Labor's fundamental philosophy. With a vote expected in January, it is unclear whether Mr. Blair will have enough support for his plan.
"Introducing a market into higher education is something the Labor Party should not be doing," Nick Ashley, a Labor member of Parliament who opposes the measure, told Sky News recently.

With No Fanfare And Few Heroes, A City Rebuilds

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
IT'S assessment time, the calendar dictates, the time to declare what kind of year it has been. This always leads to facile theories and weak themes, but for once there does seem to be a credible title to this song. In New York, 2003 was the year of living modestly.
 In loud, boastful New York, the public seems willing, if not content, to be led quietly -- in almost every realm. The focus is on repairing schools, rebuilding devastation, restoring the economy, finding fiscal balance. New York has no person of the year -- and does not seem to want one. 
 The inevitable exceptions, first: Senator Charles E. Schumer, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs. Clinton is a national best seller and celebrity, and Mr. Schumer and Mr. Spitzer are practiced publicity magnets. They also happen to have solid claims on substance, what with Mr. Spitzer's campaign to reform Wall Street and Mr. Schumer's struggle to impose his standards on judicial nominees. They don't get all that news media attention merely because they are two more pretty faces.
But most other political figures in today's New York seem unable -- or unwilling -- to register with the public as their predecessors did. This is a place that produced the unavoidable Fiorello H. La Guardia, Edward I. Koch, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Nelson A. Rockefeller and Mario M. Cuomo.
Today's mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, is not only avoidable, but downright elusive. He has proved that the mayor of New York does not always have to be in the public's face, does not need a foreign policy or an opinion on everything everywhere. He disappears on occasional weekends, reads his remarks, defers to commissioners at news events. The mayor can still walk into a room without creating a stir, and make extravagant charitable contributions around town with no fanfare.
In a city where successful politicians have always been entertainers, his retiring persona is not helping his popularity. But that's who he is. And he fits a trend. Gov. George E. Pataki is better known now than in the past, but he is not a larger-than-life Rockefeller or Cuomo.
The people who actually run New York are mostly anonymous. That was always true, but not this true. Who, beyond Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta and Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein, even has a public face? Giants used to run the parks -- Thomas Hoving, Gordon Davis. (More recently, the quirky Henry J. Stern.) No more; Adrian Benepe is no household name. Neither is one of Mr. Bloomberg's aspiring rivals, the eager Council Speaker Gifford Miller.
For a time this year, it seemed as if New York had found one of those larger-than-life figures -- the flamboyant Daniel Libeskind. The architect won the competition to plan ground zero's renaissance and arrived with a built-in publicity machine. But he and his designs have faded, and nobody's name is fixed in the collective mind to the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site -- not David M. Childs, the architect who designed the latest version of the site's Freedom Tower, nor Larry A. Silverstein, the developer, nor the inconspicuous officials of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.
IN entertainment, New York can still boast of David Letterman and, for a short while, Sarah Jessica Parker and her friends on "Sex and the City." Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane are coming back temporarily. But Broadway no longer reigns, Seinfeld's New York is in reruns and Ray Romano of "Everybody Loves Raymond" lives on Long Island. The contained Lorin Maazel stands on the podium of the electric Leonard Bernstein and Zubin Mehta.
In today's New York, one couple -- Donna and Marvin Schwartz -- can donate the $2 million cost of replacing the rusty fence around the Central Park reservoir with an elegant replica of the original, and barely get public mention. They have restored unobstructed views of the reservoir and surrounding city for the first time in 77 years, without any of the fanfare that attended Donald Trump's restoration of the park's Wollman skating rink in 1986.
Mr. Trump, of course, demands publicity. But someone has to want to listen. Is it that prominent New Yorkers these days deliberately reject attention, or lack flash? Or is it the public that's tuned out? Maybe New York has been eclipsed by movie star governors and dictators in bunkers. Or maybe New York, so recently knocked down, is growing up.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
America is paying a significant price for favoring unilateralism over international cooperation. Is the price too high?

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine, and he also teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. His new book is "Why Economies Grow," from Basic Books and the Century Foundation. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
CONSIDER Christmas half a century ago. It was an age of international cooperation. Less well noticed, it was also an age of unusually enlightened economics. 
 In that era, the United Nations was formed, the Marshall aid plan for Europe was adopted, the Bretton Woods agreement stabilized international finance for more than two decades and trade barriers were torn down. 
 Almost all economic theoreticians agree that the cooperative policies stimulated rapid economic growth at home and abroad through growing trade, international investment and enormous new markets. The flaw in the economic design of the 1950's and 1960's was the expensive arms race with the Soviet Union.
 This Christmas, however, cooperation is increasingly giving way to division. Trade tensions are high, currencies are out of balance and little progress is being made on new international financial, environmental and labor regulations. Most important, defense spending is again on the rise for the first time since the end of the cold war. 
 All these will exact an economic price. 
 Let us consider defense spending first. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute calculates that the world's military defense spending, as a proportion of gross domestic product, bottomed out in 1998. But in the last few years, the pace of spending growth has picked up. 
 The main reason is the rise in America's defense budget, from $300 billion when President Bush took office to $400 billion in the new fiscal year, excluding the recent $87 billion authorized to fight the Iraq war. "We are back to Reagan-era defense spending levels," said Christopher Hellman of the Center for Arms Control in Washington.
 America's defense spending accounts for nearly half of the world's such spending, but defense expenditures are also rising rapidly in Russia, China, India, Brazil and several East Asian nations. To compound matters, Russia is not only spending more but also has recently put its multiple-warhead nuclear weapons back into service. Former Warsaw Pact nations, eager to enter NATO, are obliged to increase the amount they devote to defense. Defense spending is up even in Britain and France, and up sharply in several African nations. 
 A variety of factors are driving up defense spending, including terrorism, civil wars, border conflicts and modernization. But Mr. Hellman and others argue that some of the increase is also a reaction to America's more unilateralist military approach. This includes not just higher spending and the war in Iraq, but also a formal pre-emptive military doctrine, proposals for a new missile defense shield and development of low-yield nuclear weapons, or so-called mininukes. 
 Contrary to conventional wisdom in some quarters, economic research shows that such increases in defense spending bleed economies over time. Probably the best research on the subject was done in the late 1980's, during rapid increases under President Ronald Reagan. 
 The main argument in favor of defense spending is that it has civilian spinoffs. The Internet is the most spectacular recent example of this. 
 But Frank R. Lichtenberg, an economist at Columbia University, examined whether defense spending contributed to higher levels of productivity in the post-World War II period through investment in research and development. He could find no such relationship. Rather, it is a drag on growth by diverting money from private research and development spending (and some would argue from public investment). Research by Austan Goolsbee of the University of Chicago reinforced the findings. 
 Mr. Lichtenberg says that a couple of factors are at work. First, military R.&D. is usually focused on developing prototypes, not basic or even applied research. Defense spending also raises the costs of research done by private companies by driving up the salaries of engineers and scientists.
 In the current economic environment, America's defense spending is a principal contributor to its growing budget deficits. 
 But economic theory suggests that worldwide divisiveness will have other economic costs. Economists, for example, believe multilateral trade agreements that reduce trade barriers among all countries are significantly more efficient than bilateral agreements. With more countries reducing trade barriers, each will focus on what it does best. Bilateral agreements divert resources from more efficient nations, just like any trade barrier. 
 In the past two years, however, multilateral discussions under the World Trade Organization have twice failed spectacularly. Instead, the United States -- as well as the European Union and Japan -- are actively pursuing bilateral agreements. America's trade relations with China and Europe are increasingly sour. Consistent with a new unilateral spirit, President Bush antagonized China early in his administration by calling it a "strategic competitor," and he raised steel tariffs sharply on European imports. Even after Mr. Bush removed the tariffs, trade tensions remain high. 
 New regional competitive partnerships are also forming, partly in response to American power. East Asian nations, to take one example, have signed new currency swap arrangements to make them less vulnerable to demands by foreign bond traders as well as the International Monetary Fund. 
 Such strategies may presage a dawning age of regional competitors that can challenge the United States. Indeed, with perhaps a couple of hundred billion dollars on hand, China already holds a formidable weapon. If pushed far enough, it might drive the dollar down by selling dollars in large volume, igniting inflation and pushing up interest rates here. 
 Reasonable people can argue to what degree American unilateralism has contributed to the new divisiveness. Some would say the benefits of the new military and economic unilateralism to world security and America's economic vision are easily worth the costs. Others would say the world is far more dangerous as a result of American unilateralism, and the costs are just an added burden. 
 But serious costs there are, and they may well grow. Rather than assigning blame for the divisiveness in the world, it is time to recall our successful past and take responsibility for diminishing this divisiveness. If the recent efforts of the United States to encourage France and Germany to reduce Iraq's debt are the beginning of thawing relations, it is good news. Cooperation is economically advantageous. Unilateralism comes at a significant price.

HEADLINE: Pakistani President Agrees to Give Up Control of Military 

BYLINE:  By SALMAN MASOOD

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
President Pervez Musharraf announced Wednesday that he would step down as army chief by the end of next year but remain the country's president.
 The announcement was part of a deal he had struck with hard-line Islamist opposition parties after months of deadlocked negotiations over military rule. Under the agreement, General Musharraf will have to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament to serve out the remainder of his term as president. 
 "I have thought about it deeply, objectively, and I also thought about the security of Pakistan and I also thought about the political harmony," he said in an address on national television. "I have decided that I will take off my uniform by December 2004 and leave the office of the chief of the army staff." 
If the general, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999, keeps his promise, it will mark the end of military rule in Pakistan, at least formally, and it will bolster efforts to re-establish democracy in the country, Pakistani analysts said.
The agreement represents a sweeping political victory for the alliance of six hard-line Islamist parties that won record support in elections in October 2002, running on a vehemently anti-American platform. The alliance, known as the Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal, or United Action Front, advocates strict Islamic law, or Sharia, through democratic means. The group also opposes the presence of F.B.I. agents in Pakistan and American troops in Afghanistan.
In the year since the elections, the Islamist alliance, despite being only the third-largest bloc in Parliament, has managed to portray itself as the main opposition force in the country, as well as the true guardian of democracy in Pakistan. 
In a series of protests led by the alliance, that included banging shoes on desks, chanting and walking out en masse, political opponents of the president managed to paralyze the deeply divided Parliament, sapping political support for efforts by General Musharraf to modernize the economy, the educational system and the government bureaucracy.
Pakistani analysts said the agreement, which was signed in Islamabad between a pro-Musharraf political party and the religious alliance, was a setback for the president. 
In exchange for the vote of confidence on the presidency, scheduled for one month after General Musharraf resigns his army post, the religious parties promised to support the ratification of some of the 29 controversial constitutional amendments the president enacted unilaterally. Pro-democracy activists have said the amendments institutionalize the military's role in politics, give the president too much power and weaken Parliament.
In his 12-minute address on Wednesday, General Musharraf, wearing military fatigues, congratulated the nation over what he called the success of democracy in the country. "Today, I want to give you good news that an agreement has been reached," he said. "It is democracy that has won and it is Pakistan that has been the victor." 
In the amendments enacted in August 2002, he granted himself a five-year term as president, citing a national referendum held in April of that year. He said the referendum showed overwhelming public support. Opposition political parties dismissed it as fraudulent. 
Under the agreement, a constitutional amendment bill will be brought before Parliament on Dec. 26, 2004. It requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass. Together, the pro-Musharraf faction of the Pakistan Muslim League and the religious alliance control more than two-thirds of the seats. 
But General Musharraf's constitutional amendments appear to have been watered down. The original amendments gave him the authority to dissolve the Parliament and dismiss the prime minister. They also called for the creation of a National Security Council, consisting of the chiefs of staff of the army, navy and air force in addition to crucial civilian leaders as a forum for consultation on a range of strategic matters.
Civilian politicians denounced it, calling it a supra-parliamentary body. On Wednesday, General Musharraf said "the National Security Council will be established through an act of the Parliament." 
General Musharraf said that under the agreement between the parties, the Supreme Court's approval would be needed for the president to dismiss the government. The agreement also calls for the appointment of the chiefs of the branches of the military by the president in consultation with the prime minister.
Secular political parties criticized the agreement on Wednesday, saying it would still give the president too much power. For the last year, the secular parties, along with the religious alliance, waged the campaign against the president. 
The agreement "will disfigure the Constitution and demolish the parliamentary system," Sadique al-Farooq, a spokesman for the anti-Musharraf faction of the Pakistan Muslim League, told The Associated Press. 
In recent weeks, Western diplomats have said that the president's reform efforts appearedto have stalled in the last year. General Musharraf also narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on Dec. 14.
General Musharraf's supporters in Parliament have a slim majority. He retains significant popular support and is seen as far less corrupt than the two civilian prime ministers who governed in the 1990's, Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto. 
Diplomats said his problems stemmed from the parliamentary elections held in October 2002. Political commentators said General Musharraf's attempts to control the outcome of the elections ended in political disaster for him.
The general barred both of the civilian prime ministers from the elections. At the same time, he allowed the alliance of religious parties to campaign freely during the elections. The result, which appeared to surprise General Musharraf and Western observers, was record support for the religious alliance.
They received only 11 percent of the popular vote, but won control of one of the country's four provincial governments, earned a role in a coalition government in a second province and became the third-largest party in Parliament. In the end, the elections created an immobilized Parliament, demoralized the country's secular parties and strengthened the religious alliance, according to the general's critics. They now appear to have forced the president to compromise. 
The developments in Pakistan represent one possible unintended outcome of the Bush administration's campaign to press for democracy in the Muslim world. Under current conditions in Pakistan, the prime beneficiaries of the reintroduction of democracy are likely to be the hard-line Islamic parties. 
Some scholars said the agreement was a step forward. Dr. Rasul Bakhsh Rais, a political scientist at Lahore University of Management Sciences, called it "a positive development in the direction of constitutional and political development." 
But others saw the agreement in different terms. Najam Sethi, a columnist and editor of The Daily Times, said the deal was a major setback for General Musharraf. "On the face of it, the deal is supposed to benefit both the parties," he said. "But I think eventually General Musharraf is going to be the loser."
He predicted that the religious parties would eventually force the general to back off his strong support for the American-led campaign against terrorism.

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
Finding New Life By Selling the Old

BYLINE:  By ANNE GLUSKER 

 BODY:
ON a recent Sunday afternoon in Ellicott City, Md., a man and woman circled a small wooden table outside a store called Shoemaker Country on Main Street, inspecting it with great seriousness. Farther down the block, a young couple -- he with an infant in a baby carrier on his back, she holding a tall plastic-foam cup of coffee -- stood staring at the glass storefront at Cottage Antiques. They hesitated before the crowded display of plates, pitchers, doilies and chairs before deciding to go in. Meantime, Elisa Massimino, with the Cheshire-cat smile of a successful shopper, clutched a pale wooden box to her chest. On this day, she made a major score, an intact service of ornate Thai-made silver, complete with oyster forks, marrow knives and a lining of hot-pink velvet -- a steal at $115. 
 Ms. Massimino, a lawyer with three young children, is a frequent visitor to Ellicott City, making the 45-minute trip from her home in the Washington suburbs every few months for a day of antiquing and meandering. "Sometimes I just need someplace to wander around by myself for the day," she said. 
 Over the last decade, visitors like Ms. Massimino have given new life to Ellicott City, a faded mill town on the banks of the Patapsco River that has gradually remade itself as a thriving antiques center. Ellicott City is not the only place to have made this transformation. There are 30 to 40 similar towns around the country, ranging from tiny Cameron, N.C., whose handful of stores seem to contain the contents of every grandmother's attic within a 50-mile radius, to the more burnished Lambertville, N.J., which draws serious devotees of Arts and Crafts furniture. In Fredericksburg, Tex., German settlers brought little with them but left behind a legacy of utilitarian mid-19th-century furniture.
"The dealers have done a very good job of creating a specialty niche, gradually turning these old downtowns into high economic performers," said Kennedy Smith, director of the Main Street Program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
When superstores and malls began to decimate the country's downtowns some 25 years ago, Ellicott City was no exception. Main Street -- with its barbershop, department store, grocery and movie theater -- had been a commercial hub for the farmers of surrounding Howard County and the workers at the flour and woolen mills since the town's founding by three Quaker brothers in 1772. But by the 1960's and 70's, only the town's rowdy bars were still doing a brisk business. Antiques and furniture stores, which need a lot of inexpensive space, gradually moved in.
Now, roughly 60 percent of the downtown businesses are antiques dealers. The rest are a mix of restaurants, home-decor businesses and oddities like a calligraphy shop. Eighty percent of the town's retail revenue comes from furniture and antiques shops, according to Jared Spahn, president of the Ellicott City Business Association.
In a recent study by the Travel Industry Association of America, 81 percent of tourists said they were interested in history and culture when they traveled. Visitors to Ellicott City often speak of entering a time warp when they come into the town, and it is this sense of being far removed from contemporary life that seems to be a large part of the appeal of antiques towns. "People feel the need to connect with where we came from, who and what we are," said Cheryl Hargrove of the HTC Group, a public relations firm in Asheville, N.C., that specializes in heritage tourism.
Of course, people also feel the need to shop.
By 1962, when Enalee Bounds opened Ellicott's Country Store, there wasn't much to buy in Ellicott City. She stocked her shop on Main Street with antiques and more -- tablecloths, candles, soap, tea towels -- and it is now the oldest antiques shop in town. Ellicott City had long since seen better days, but Ms. Bounds stayed the course, and after flood waters reached the second floors of some Main Street buildings in 1972, serious rebuilding got under way.
Ellicott City became a federally designated historic district in 1978, and antiques stores became a steadily growing presence throughout the 1980's. Business picked up more steam in the 90's, though remnants of another time remained in the shape of body piercing and tattoo parlors.
The transformation into an antiques center has been slow and accidental. "There's been no plan from above in this town," said Leslie Lewart, whose shop, Rugs to Riches, has been on Main Street for 11 years.
In the last few years, the antiques shops have been joined by a clutch of stores whose wares are brand new: Rugs to Riches, Su Casa and most recently Whats In Store. Chester Overlock, co-owner of Whats In Store, which opened last spring, has found a niche in contemporary wares like a knockoff of a bright red-leather Mies van der Rohe couch. "There was a need that wasn't being fulfilled," he said. "More contemporary, more ethnic, more funky. We have about 500 people in here every weekend, and we do about $12,000 worth of business."
But where does this sort of success leave the lace-doily crowd?
The town is divided about the course it should take. Some of the granite Federal-style buildings lining Main Street have been handsomely preserved. But at least one shiny new building (constructed on the ashes of another that burned down in 1999) seems decidedly out of place, with a roofline much higher than its neighbors'. And the beer banners flapping on the facade of the recently opened Mexican restaurant La Palapa would look more at home in a beach town in August than on a Main Street striving for 19th-century veracity.
Although the Howard County Historic District Commission vets plans for all building exteriors, some critics say that the urge to encourage commerce is at odds with the pull toward preservation. Mike Walczak, executive director of the Howard County Historical Society, said: "If you walk Main Street and you look at some of these businesses, you get the feeling that they can do whatever they want." Transgressions, by Mr. Walczak's standards, include a small red neon sign set inside the window of one of the tattoo parlors. "There are times when I wonder what Ellicott City wants to be, a quaint old town or something else."
THE local merchants' association and the county tourism office sponsor special events -- Candlelight Night, Midnight Madness, Ye Haunted History of Olde Ellicott City Ghost Tours -- but some critics say that these events, especially Midnight Madness, which attracts hordes of teenagers, do nothing but create a circuslike atmosphere.
Others, like Ms. Lewart, argue that not enough is being done to bolster local business. "It's hard to understand why the town hasn't gone further, why the county is ignoring it. It's a diamond in the rough. If only someone just paid attention to it," she said.
But Mindy Hetrick is paying attention.
Her feeling for Ellicott City runs so deep that she recently moved there from the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington. Ms. Hetrick first came to Ellicott City as an antiques hunter and developed relationships with some of the storekeepers who kept a look out for the objects she collects, like miniature 19th-century oil paintings.
"Ellicott City isn't pristine or perfect; it's not homogenized," she said. "But it's the last bastion of a small, local-merchant town."

ANTIQUES MARKETS
Where the Old Things Are
ELLICOTT CITY isn't the only once-dying community that has found new life as a tourist destination for antiques buyers. Here are five other towns that have discovered that the road to success is often paved with hand-me-downs.

Benicia, Calif.
Although antiques towns tend to cluster in the East, Benicia is one of the most attractive in the West. Thirty-five miles northeast of San Francisco, on the East Bay, it has -- in addition to its cluster of antiques shops -- stores that sell everything from clocks to art glass. More information is at www.beniciamainstreet.org.

Brimfield, Mass.
One of the first of the destination towns, Brimfield is the place to go for New England antiques. As the lure of its three-times-a-year antiques shows grew, dealers stayed behind and shops took root. The outdoor shows (www.brimfield.com) are the largest of their kind, attracting about 5,000 dealers.

Cameron, N.C.
Cameron is an example of an antiques haven on a small scale. The town was the terminus of a rail line, and it prospered for a while in the 19th century. Dewberries were farmed, and turpentine was manufactured. But when the railroad was closed, and dewberries lost their cachet, the town suffered. Its dozen antiques shops are its lifeline, drawing customers who are staying nearby at Pinehurst for the golf or in Southern Pines for the horses. Offerings here include North Carolina pottery, stoneware, glass and enamelware. More information is at www.antiquesofcameron.com. 

Hudson, N.Y.
One of the most recent antiques success stories, it had the necessary prerequisites: proximity to a place with lots of potential customers (Manhattan a bit more than two hours away) and a depressed downtown with vacant storefronts (meaning cheap rents). Now the downtown's 60 shops (listed at hudson.hvnet.com) are bustling, offering everything from Biedermeier to Empire, textiles to porcelain.

Lambertville, N.J.
Now one of the foremost antiquing destinations in the country (just across a bridge from New Hope, Pa.), Lambertville was nothing more than another derelict American milltown until about 25 years ago, when its imposing train station was refurbished and turned into a restaurant, the Lambertville Station, which is still going strong. The town, on the banks of the Delaware River, is a center for everything from 18th- and 19th-century furniture to art pottery and vintage clothing and handbags (www.ladanj.com). ANNE GLUSKER

GUIDEBOOK
Victrolas, Fajitas and Bargain-Priced Desks

ELLICOTT City is 13 miles west of Baltimore and 40 miles northeast of Washington. Even if you plan to spend your time walking from store to store on Main Street, you will need a car to get there.

Shopping
The Antique Depot (3720 Maryland Avenue, 410-750-2674) is a busy co-op of 130 dealers and is the best of the town's three large antiques emporiums. The wares run the gamut from garage-sale detritus to the genuinely valuable -- from 1960's cartoon-character lunch boxes (up to $70) to early 20th-century Victrolas ($200 to $2,000). Open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday from 12:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Cottage Antiques (8181 Main Street, 410-465-1412) is much more orderly and refined, although a bit too packed, with Victorian dressers cheek by jowl with ornate candelabra. The real secret is upstairs in the so-called attic, where tags covered with ornate script alert you to various deals (some items are half price with another purchase; others are free). Open Monday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
On the other side of the Patapsco River is the minuscule community of Oella, so hardscrabble that it did not have a sewer system until 19 years ago. The old Oella Mill (840 Oella Avenue), with cavernous spaces and breathtaking river views, is home to a warren of antiques dealers, with merchandise filling every corner of every hallway. (Old-fashioned school desks that run $75 to $85 in Ellicott City can be bought in Oella for a third of that price.)
Home Anthology (in the Oella Mill, 410-465-0888), a 5,000-square-foot shop specializing in midcentury modern furniture, opened in October. Its Danish modern tables and Jetsons-style molded plastic chairs are far from standard Ellicott City fare. Open Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m. 

Where to Eat
Tersiguel's (8293 Main Street, 410-465-4004) is the town's "fancy" restaurant. The chef makes delicious pate and sausage. Expensive.
At La Palapa (8307 Main Street, 410-465-0070) the fresh, well-made fajitas and quesadillas are not the standard cheese-bathed glop that passes for Mexican food in most American towns. Inexpensive.
Sarah and Desmond (8198 Main Street, 410-465-9700) has good coffee, tempting pastries and healthy sandwiches ranging from egg salad to hummus. Inexpensive.

Where to Stay
The Wilderness Bed and Breakfast (2 Thistle Road, Catonsville; 410-744-0590) is just over the Patapsco River and only five minutes from the antiques shops on Main Street. The inn, a 22-room mansion dating to 1899, is set on two quiet acres and it offers three suites at $100 to $140, including breakfast and an afternoon tea. Open weekends only.

HEADLINE: U.S. and South Korea Try To Redefine Their Alliance 

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
As the United States embarks on a realignment of its global military bases, the shift will perhaps be felt most intensely here in South Korea, where American soldiers continue to play a central role even as South Koreans themselves are rethinking their relations with Americans.
 Unlike their counterparts in Japan, most of whom are relatively isolated in Okinawa, most of the 37,000 American troops here are still stationed, half a century after the end of the Korean War, in the country's two most high-profile locations: along the demilitarized zone with North Korea and in the heart of Seoul, the capital. 
 Under a Pentagon plan, the troops would be moved and consolidated in bases south of here. Both sides are emphasizing that the plan, put in motion as the North Korean nuclear threat remains unresolved, would not diminish America's capacity or commitment to defend South Korea. 
Citing advances in military technology and changes in the political environment, the South Korean foreign minister, Yoon Young Kwan, said in an interview, "If we consider those two changes, it is natural for us to try to make some kind of adjustment in military allocation of personnel and resources."
"The important issue is U.S. commitment, and I think that commitment is stronger than ever," he said.
Still, during a visit in November by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, the two sides did not decide on a timetable and failed to agree on plans to relocate the Yongsan military garrison in Seoul. What is more, the important subject of reducing the force size was not raised, nor was the topic of what this all meant for the United States-South Korea security alliance.
"Are Washington and Seoul truly committed to the alliance?" said Scott Snyder, a Korea expert in Seoul with the Asia Foundation, an American research institute. "It's the unspoken issue behind these talks over the U.S. troops. Is this the beginning of the reconfiguration of the alliance? Or is this the first step in the dismantling of the alliance?"
These moves are being considered against a changing backdrop here and in the region. South Korea's economic ties with China, now its leading trading partner, are growing rapidly. As a budding rival to the United States for influence in Northeast Asia, China has assumed a new muscular diplomacy, most notably in the continuing six-nation talks to resolve the North Korean crisis.
Here, a new generation of South Korean leaders, backed by young voters, is more independent-minded and less beholden to the United States. This is the so-called 386 generation -- a reference to a computer chip and to those in their 30's, who went to college and fought in the pro-democracy movements in the 1980's and were born in the 1960's. They regard the United States less as the country that fought in the Korean War than as the country that backed past military dictators.
"The older Koreans tend to be more nervous about any changes in the U.S. troops here," said Kim Il Young, the author of "U.S. Forces in Korea" and a university professor. "The younger generation believes more in self-reliance and independence. It feels that in the long term, South Korea should strike a balance between the United States and China and adopt a more neutral position toward the United States."
In Seoul, the National Security Council's deputy director, Lee Jong Suk, 45, is said to embody many of the 386 generation's views. The council, unlike the more traditionally minded Foreign and Defense ministries, is said to have the greatest influence on President Roh Moo Hyun on foreign policy matters.
The differences in opinions, officials here say, were manifested most clearly in the discussion over sending troops to buttress the American-led forces in Iraq. Officials in the Foreign and Defense ministries were said to have pushed for several thousand combat and noncombat forces to be sent to Iraq, whereas the National Security Council argued for fewer. In the end, President Roh said he would send 3,000 troops, probably in April. 
Under the half-century-old alliance, American soldiers have acted as a "tripwire" along the border to deter an attack from North Korea. An attack from North Korea would have killed American soldiers and guaranteed American retaliation and involvement in the war. 
Under the new strategy, with troops concentrated toward the south, the American forces would be better able to survive an attack and -- given the existence of new long-range, precision weapons -- respond more effectively. The troops would also be able to move quickly to other countries in the region. 
Mr. Yoon, the foreign minister, said discussions would have to take place to reach a consensus on how to transform the alliance "from cold war to post-cold war."
"Even after we achieve that goal," Mr. Yoon said, "I think the alliance should remain important as a cornerstone on which we can build any kind of peaceful and stable international relationship among Northeast Asian countries."

HEADLINE: Bracing for the Blow 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I.B.M. has sent a holiday chill through its American employees with its plans to ship thousands of high-paying white-collar jobs overseas to lower-paid foreign workers.
 "People are upset andangry," said Arnie Marchetti, a 37-year-old computer technician at I.B.M.'s Southbury, Conn., office whose wife gave birth to their first child in August. 
 The company has not made any announcements, and the employees do not know who will be affected, or when. The uncertainty about whose jobs may be sent to India or China, the two main countries in the current plans, has raised workers' anxiety in some cases to an excruciating level. 
"I understand that this is a lightning rod issue in the industry," an I.B.M. spokesman told me this week. "It's a lightning rod issue to people in our company, I suppose. But I don't think anybody expects us to issue blanket statements to the work force about projections."
Referring to employees who may be affected by the plans, he said, "We deal with them as they need to know."
"Offshoring" and "outsourcing" are two of the favored euphemisms for shipping work overseas. I.B.M. prefers the term "global sourcing." Whatever you call it, the expansion of this practice from manufacturing to the higher-paying technical and white-collar levels is the latest big threat to employment in the U.S.
Years ago, when concern was being expressed about the shipment of factory jobs to places with slave wages, hideous working conditions and even prison labor, proponents said there was nothing to worry about. Exporting labor-intensive jobs would make U.S. companies more competitive, leading to increased growth and employment, and higher living standards. They advised U.S. workers to adjust, to become better educated and skillful enough to thrive in a new world of employment, where technology and the ability to process information were crucial components.
Well, the workers whose jobs are now threatened at I.B.M. and similar companies across the U.S. are well educated and absolute whizzes at processing information. But they are nevertheless in danger of following the well-trodden path of their factory brethren to lower-wage work, or the unemployment line.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that I.B.M. had told its managers to plan on moving as many as 4,730 jobs from the U.S. The I.B.M. spokesman told me he was sure that figure was too high, but added that no one had complained to The Journal about the number. He said he didn't know how many American jobs would be lost.
I.B.M. officials are skittish to the point of paranoia on this matter, which has powerful social and political implications. Pulling the plug on factory workers is one thing. A frontal assault on the livelihood of solidly middle-class Americans -- some of whom may be required to train the foreign workers who will replace them -- is something else.
James Sciales was the first of the company spokesmen to respond to my inquiries this week. He was reluctant to even tell me his name and nervously refused to answer any questions. Another spokesman was willing to talk but asked that I not refer to him by name.
In a recorded conference call reported by The Times last summer, a pair of I.B.M. officials told colleagues around the world that the company needed to accelerate its efforts to move white-collar jobs overseas. They acknowledged the danger of a political backlash, but said it was essential to step up the practice.
"Our competitors are doing it and we have to do it," said Tom Lynch, I.B.M.'s director for global employee relations.
The outsourcing of good jobs has been under way for years, and there is no dispute that the practice is speeding up. "Anything that is not nailed to the floor is being considered for outsourcing," said Thea Lee, the chief international economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Most of the millions of white-collar workers who could be affected by this phenomenon over the next several years are clueless as to what they can do about it. They do not have organized representation in the workplace. And government policies overwhelmingly favor the corporations. Like the employees at I.B.M. whose holiday cheer has been dampened by uncertainty, these hard-working men and women and their families have little protection against the powerful forces of the global economy.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Gives Airlines a Lifeline With Payments for Moving Troops 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
The Pentagon spent more than $1.2 billion this year to fly troops and supplies to Iraq on commercial aircraft, giving airlines a financial lifeline as they struggled with the weak economy, the emergence of SARS and travelers' reluctance to fly because of the war in Iraq.
 According to a military report that outlined the use of passenger and cargo airlines in the Iraq conflict, the government paid $636.2 million to 10 airlines that flew troops overseas during a 131-day emergency mobilization from February through June. It also paid $574 million to 14 cargo carriers to deliver equipment to Iraq and neighboring countries in that period. 
 The payments were made as part of the Pentagon's Civil Reserve Air Fleet program, in which airlines contract to transport troops and supplies on domestic and international flights in peacetime, and agree to participate in a mobilization during war. They must provide planes and crews for 30 days at a time, often with as little as 24 hours' notice. 
This was only the second time the government has used the program in wartime since President Harry S. Truman created it in 1951. The first time was a decade ago, when the Pentagon spent $1.35 billion, the equivalent of about $1.7 billion today, preparing to eject Iraq's army from Kuwait in the Persian Gulf war. That mobilization, which involved four times as many troops, lasted much longer -- 402 days -- and involved far more flights and aircraft.
All of the nation's major airlines, air delivery companies and cargo carriers joined in the recent mobilization, though the amount of business each handled varied widely. Two companies, World Airways and Omni Air International, transported both troops and cargo. While the emergency mobilization for Iraq is long over, airlines and cargo companies are still making regular flights, to rotate troops and provide fresh materiel.
In all, the airlines have flown nearly 500,000 troops to and from the war zone this year, while the cargo companies have carried more than 161,000 tons of equipment, the Pentagon report said. Including the money they earned during the buildup in Iraq, passenger airlines have been paid $1.2 billion in 2003 for moving soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines around the world, work they have done for years. Cargo carriers were paid $1.2 billion as well, and the Pentagon has budgeted similar amounts for the air fleet next year.
Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline consultant in Port Washington, N.Y., said the mobilization was a lifeline for the beleaguered industry. The Pentagon's business "couldn't have come at a better time," he said. "You had a not-yet-recovered economy, you had SARS going on and the war, which was very disruptive."
Dale J. Huegen, chief of the contract airlift division at the Pentagon's Air Mobility Command, which oversees the air fleet program, said in an interview last week that the timing was coincidental but lucky for both the Pentagon and the airlines. "Our tempo was going up and their tempo was going down," he said.
Most flights under the program were between military bases in the United States and Kuwait, according to the Pentagon's report, which was presented recently to carriers taking part in the air fleet program.
Passenger planes flew to Kuwait loaded with troops and their gear, but generally returned to the United States empty, with only airline crew members on board.
The cost of a typical flight between Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and Kuwait City was $379,965, according to the report. That was for a 13,546-mile, round-trip flight for a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 with 330 seats. The Pentagon paid the airlines 8.5 cents a seat for each mile flown, a spokesman said.
In some cases, that was better than the revenue per seat mile that the airlines collected on trans-Atlantic flights this year, which analysts said provided the best comparison with the revenue airlines received from the government.
The Air Transport Association, the airlines' trade group, said airlines brought in an average of 6.4 cents a seat mile in trans-Atlantic revenue during the first quarter, when travel was hurt the most by economic and war concerns. That improved to 8 cents in the second quarter, and averaged 8.52 cents in the third quarter, slightly more than what the Pentagon paid, the association said.
The passenger airline that handled the most business in the Iraq mobilization was ATA Airlines, formerly American Trans Air, which is best known in the United States as a low-fare airline that flies some international routes. It earned $123.2 million transporting troops to the Gulf, as well as more than $145 million for other work for the Pentagon in 2003, more than any other carrier. A spokeswoman for ATA, which is based in Indianapolis, said the airline was "honored" to participate in the military program, but declined to comment further.
The other airlines that received the most business during the Iraq conflict, in order of payments received, were World Airways, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines. Officials at each of those airlines declined to discuss the air fleet program on the record.
However, executives at several airlines, who would speak only if they were not named, said that while they valued the Pentagon's business, the industry as a whole would have fared much better without the disruption the war caused to the business climate and to the psyche of passengers.
Indeed, Mr. Mann, the consultant, said the airlines participate in the program under less than ideal circumstances. "You fly empty legs, you do fly in a war zone, and you have to have spare airplanes, because it's pretty disruptive to your normal commercial network," he said.
Airlines did encounter some unexpected problems. Initially, Pentagon planners anticipated that some flights would land in Turkey, which would have cut hundreds of miles off of each trip. But the Turkish government decided not to allow the Pentagon to use its bases, which meant the airlines could not use them either, said Merle L. Lyman, chief of the Defense Department's commercial airlift division.
Airlines also had to double the crew members on each flight because the planes had to leave immediately after dropping off troops, rather than stop overnight as might be the case for commercial flights. Airports were too dangerous to have the crews spend the night.
But doubling crews was easier said than done because the airlines laid off thousands of pilots and flight attendants in the last few years. Crew shortages caused some delays in troop movements last winter, Mr. Lyman said in an interview last week.
Despite such hitches, the close ties between the Pentagon and the airlines -- which have filled their cockpits with former military pilots for generations -- ultimately helped the Iraq mobilization proceed smoothly.
The relationships built during peacetime also help, said Mr. Lyman. "We have adapted to each other's environment," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 31, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Friday showing government payments to commercial airlines to transport troops and supplies during the first 131 days of the mobilization for the Iraq war misstated the amount that went to passenger and cargo airlines that were not among the top five contractors in each category. Other passenger lines were paid $202 million, not $123 million. Other cargo airlines were paid $143 million, not $123 million.

HEADLINE: Murder-Arson Spree Leaves 5 Dead in Schenectady Area 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE and JEFF WAGGONER; Sabrina Tavernise reported for this article from Manhattan and Jeff Waggoner from Schenectady.

DATELINE: SCHENECTADY, N.Y., Dec. 25 

 BODY:
A man went on a murder and arson spree early Thursday in two relatively affluent suburbs here, killing his girlfriend and three other people with a shotgun before turning it on himself, the police said.
 The man, who was not identified by the police, first killed his girlfriend at 3625 Albany Street in Niskayuna, a suburb outside Schenectady. He then set fire to the house. 
 It was still dark outside when the man then drove about half a mile to the Woodlawn neighborhood of Schenectady, to an apartment where relatives of his girlfriend were staying. He fatally shot two women and a man inside the apartment, set the apartment on fire and then killed himself, the police said.
The police did not identify any of his victims yesterday, though they said the spree seemed to be the result of a domestic dispute. 
"In law enforcement, it is not unusual to see holiday massacres, and when it happens, it is most likely a crime of passion," said Bob Carney, the Schenectady district attorney.
A neighbor near the apartment in Woodlawn said that the shooting began between 3:30 and 4 a.m., and that he saw the smoke soon after. Fire Department officials said they responded to calls at 5:15 and 5:35 a.m. 
"Before 4 o'clock I heard Fourth of July types of sounds, and about 4:30 or so I saw smoke coming from out of the apartment," said the neighbor, Fred Perillo, 53.
The three killings in Woodlawn increased the homicide count in Schenectady to 11 this year, up from 9 in 2002, the police said. The fourth, in neighboring Niskayuna, was the first killing this year in that town, the police there said.
The crime rate in Schenectady is rising as the region's economy declines. General Electric, a major employer in the area, has moved tens of thousands of jobs out of the city, and vacant storefronts dot its main street, State Street. This month Moody's Investors Service downgraded Schenectady's bond rating to the lowest grade in New York State.
Even so, the city has affluent pockets, including Woodlawn, a suburb in the southeast, and nearby Niskayuna, one of the state's wealthiest communities outside New York City. 
Mr. Perillo, an auto body shop owner who has lived in the Woodlawn neighborhood for 28 years, said such crimes are extremely rare there.
He said the Woodlawn apartment was occupied by a young couple in their 20's, but the police said all the dead appeared to be in their 30's or 40's. The third adult was apparently the couple's guest. The couple had children, according to Mr. Perillo.
"They were nice people," he said of his neighbors. "The girl worked at Kmart. I can't believe this would happen here."
Another neighbor, Bill Kaufmann, 45, a member of the Woodlawn neighborhood association, said the killings were a blow to the neighborhood's secure reputation. 
"This is going to spook some people," Mr. Kaufmann said.

U.S. Debating New Tests For Animals Used as Food
As the American beef industry struggles with its first case of mad cow disease, the Department of Agriculture is debating whether to do more tests and change the way meat from suspect animals is used, department officials say.
 The officials declined to say exactly what they would recommend but acknowledged that European and Japanese regulators screen millions of animals using tests that take only three hours -- fast enough to stop diseased carcasses from being cut up for food. American inspectors have tested fewer than 30,000 of the 300 million animals slaughtered over the last nine years, and they receive the results days or weeks later. Page A1. 

The $13 billion pet food industry expects heightened inspections and more paperwork, but few companies anticipate a catastrophe to their bottom lines as a result of the nation's first case of mad cow disease. A40.

The 360-acre agricultural laboratory in Weybridge, England, that is testing a specimen from a Washington cow for mad cow disease has had plenty of experience. In November 1986, researchers at the lab identified the first case of mad cow. Since then, mad cow has hit Britain harder than any other country. A40.

Pentagon Flies Commercial
The Pentagon spent more than $1.2 billion this year to fly troops and supplies to Iraq on commercial aircraft, aiding airlines as they were struggling with the weak economy, the emergence of SARS and the reluctance of travelers to fly because of the war in Iraq. A1.

S.E.C. Studying Biopure Actions
The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering taking action against Biopure in connection with disclosures it made regarding its main product, a blood substitute for use in transfusions. Biopure said it thinks the S.E.C. is concerned that the company had suggested its blood substitute was moving smoothly toward approval, only to then announce a significant delay. C2.

HEADLINE: Bush Advisers, With Eye on Dean, Formulate '04 Plans 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25 

 BODY:
President Bush's campaign has settled on a plan to run against Howard Dean that would portray him as reckless, angry and pessimistic, while framing the 2004 election as a referendum on the direction of the nation more than on the president himself, Mr. Bush's aides say.
 Some advisers to Mr. Bush, increasingly convinced that Dr. Dean will become their opponent next fall, are pushing to begin a drive to undercut him even before a Democratic nominee becomes clear. But others said the more likely plan would be to hold back until after the Democratic contest had effectively ended, probably no later than March. 
 As a Bush strategist put it, Dr. Dean's rivals are "doing a great job for us" with their increasingly tough attacks on him. 
"Voters don't normally vote for an angry, pessimistic person to be president of the country," Matthew Dowd, a senior Bush adviser, said as he pressed the anti-Dean theme this week in an interview at Mr. Bush's re-election campaign headquarters. "They want somebody, even if times are not great, to be forward looking and optimistic."
As the second part of a two-part strategy, Mr. Bush's aides said, the president will set out upbeat themes and policy ideas, starting with the State of the Union address on Jan. 20. That would be part of a drive to buttress what polls show is a growing feeling among voters that the country is on the right track. The goal, Mr. Bush's advisers said, is to make the election more about the nation's success in confronting great challenges than about Mr. Bush personally.
By depersonalizing the election -- at least when it comes to Mr. Bush -- the White House is seeking to counter Democratic efforts to play to sharp anti-Bush sentiment among Democrats. Dr. Dean, a former governor of Vermont, has repeatedly said that the key to victory next year is heavy turnout among Democrats alienated by Mr. Bush.
Dr. Dean's advisers rejected the Bush campaign's characterization of their candidate's appeal. They said Dr. Dean had laid out a criticism of Mr. Bush's record and an agenda for how he would manage the nation.
Told of Mr. Bush's strategy, Dr. Dean's campaign manager, Joe Trippi, said he was skeptical that it would work.
"That's the only shot they have, to depolarize the race," Mr. Trippi said. "If the race is a referendum on Bush, that's going to be very polarizing.
"We got to where we are because the Democratic field underestimated us, and the longer the Bush team underestimates us, the better it is for us. Our opponents have been mimicking these attacks that the Bush folks said they are going to use against us for a while now. And where have we gone? From zero to 31 percent in the latest ABC poll."
Mr. Bush's advisers said they had studied the re-election campaigns of Ronald Reagan in 1984 and Bill Clinton in 1996, which were built around the idea of bolstering the nation's sense of hope as a way of lifting the incumbent's prospects. The advisers cited as a model the sunny "Morning in America" advertisements that were a foundation for Mr. Reagan's 1984 campaign.
"It is difficult for Democrats if the country's direction continues to go positive, both on the economy and on the war on terrorism," Mr. Dowd said. "Because their rationale for a campaign has been wrong track or pessimistic -- making people feel bad about what's going on today instead of making people feel good about what's going on today."
Several Democrats said they were worried that a prolonged assault on Dr. Dean from Democrats and Republicans -- most recently with the controversy over his remark that the United States was no safer after the capture of Saddam Hussein -- could pose a problem if he won the nomination. Dr. Dean has been attacked with increasing ferocity by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
Mr. Bush's campaign aides left little doubt that if Dr. Dean captured the nomination, those Democratic criticisms would be put to service in Republican television advertisements next year, a tactic that would fit with the White House's general goal of keeping Mr. Bush personally above the partisan fray.
In discussing what they described as preliminary strategic decisions, Mr. Bush's advisers said they were prepared to adjust to any changes in what has already proved to be a most unusual presidential election campaign. Although they said that most of their planning was now based on the supposition that Dr. Dean would win the nomination, Mr. Bush's campaign officials said they did not consider that certain.
The president's political team, led by Karl Rove, his senior adviser, is working on policy initiatives that would help build support among specific blocs of voters. For the so-called investor class, the team is planning a push for private investment accounts in Social Security and expanded tax-free savings accounts. Mr. Bush is also developing an immigration proposal, expected to be announced early next year, that would make it easier for workers from Latin America to move to the United States legally. That step could help Mr. Bush appeal to Hispanics, a fast-growing segment of the electorate and one that Mr. Bush and Mr. Rove have worked hard to win over.
Given the nation's close partisan division and the president's status as the embodiment of one side of that divide, his advisers said that one key to victory was to depolarize the electorate as much as possible and draw more support than the other side from the middle. They said Mr. Bush was in a stronger position than Dr. Dean to do that.
"The country has been, for a number of years, politically polarized," Mr. Bush's campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, said. "We have a demonstrated ability to simultaneously mobilize our base and also attract the support of ticket splitters and swing voters, so we can reach across that divide a little bit. So far, none of the Democrats appear to be doing that."
Republicans outside the Bush camp argued that it made sense for the White House to seek to take the spotlight off Mr. Bush and shine it on Dr. Dean.
"Make it a referendum on Dean -- is he ready for prime time?" said Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant who worked for Senator John McCain's presidential campaign in 2000.
Gary L. Bauer, a conservative who ran for president in 2000, said: "The opponent does not have the values of the American people -- and I'm assuming Dean will be the nominee. Dean is so positioning himself as the angry left-wing candidate that if nominated he's going to take whole sections of the country and make them impossible to win for the Democratic Party."
But Mr. Bush, some of his own strategists and advisers said, has a long way to go if he wants to avoid being portrayed as a divisive figure who motivates Democrats to vote against him. As a result, the White House is considering using the State of the Union address to propose a big new national goal that would not be partisan or ideological and would help rally the country behind Mr. Bush's leadership, an outside adviser to the administration said. The possibilities floated by the White House include a major initiative for the space program or an ambitious health care goal like increasing life expectancies.
"They want to have the president talk about an important national goal that is big and a unifying theme," the adviser said.

HEADLINE: Pinching Pennies and Amassing Millions 

BYLINE:  By GLEN JUSTICE

 BODY:
It was the Republican social event of the season at the elegant Arizona Biltmore hotel in Phoenix. But many guests who paid $2,000 each to honor the president of the United States say they hardly felt like V.I.P.'s. 
 While President Bush pulled in nearly $2 million for his campaign, more than 800 supporters were left to roam the cavernous ballroom searching for food and amenities. What they found were sparsely decorated tables, a few lonely trays of salmon skewers and, for many, nowhere to sit. 
 "That's it for two grand?" John Trainer, a developer from Phoenix, laughingly asked a waiter when he saw the salmon satays at the event, on Nov. 25.
That is it, particularly now that the Supreme Court has upheld a new campaign finance law that makes it harder to raise political contributions. Mr. Bush's frugality, which is nothing new, means that his money will go further, a strategy that Republicans and Democrats alike can adopt.
"Supporters of our campaign expect us to be penny-wise," Scott Stanzel, a Bush spokesman, said. "That's why we serve things like corn dogs and not caviar."
Mr. Bush managed to hold his spending rate to about 17 percent through the third quarter, Federal Election Commission figures show.
The low spending is a combination of Mr. Bush's frugality and the benefits of incumbency, which allow him to travel the country and speak frequently while spending a minimum of campaign money. He also has no primary opponent.
Most of the nine candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination spent at a rate that exceeded 50 percent in that period.
No candidate is counting on the amount of support available in years past, when the national political parties could collect unlimited soft money checks from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. The new law banned soft money, which accounted for about $500 million in the 2002 elections, or about 40 percent of party budgets.
When soft money disappeared, so did many of the lavish campaign events, like intimate gatherings at expensive restaurants and balls attended by thousands.
Gail Whiting, who attended the Phoenix fund-raiser, said she wished she had a place to sit. But she defended the Bush campaign's cost-cutting. "I want themoney to go to the candidates," Ms. Whiting said. "At some of these lavish events, I feel like the ugly American."
Mr. Trainer also approved of the sparse conditions, saying: "People can get a lot better food for a lot less money. They're not here for the food."
One reason President Bush has been so successful at amassing money for his campaign is that he is known for minimalist events. But in its goal of collecting at least $170 million for the race next year, the Bush operation's drive to keep down costs is attracting attention.
"If money is king in politics, then Bush is the crown prince," said Joe McLean, who raises money for Democratic candidates and causes. "They believe in taking it home with them."
In Pittsburgh this month, guests had a buffet of salads, sandwiches and pasta. The event raised at least $850,000. In Baltimore, they stood as they ate roast beef sandwiches, soup and something called Martini Mash -- a mixture of three different colored mashed potatoes served in blue-stemmed cocktail glasses. The event took in about $1 million.
As a candidate in 1999, Mr. Bush rolled out burgers and hot dogs to a Washington crowd and asked guests to eat while standing. The event raised at least $1 million. He repeated the tactic last June when he began fund-raising for the 2004 race, kicking off with burgers, dogs and nachos at the Washington Hilton. It prompted jokes about $2,000 hamburgers, and it raised about $3.5 million.
This dressed-down approach "sort of stuck with him," said Rick Davis, who managed Senator John McCain's presidential campaign in 2000. "His crew is loath to spend anything to raise money."
Jim Simmons, who was a co-chairman of the Phoenix event, said many donors were tired of more elaborate productions.
"The people there are upper-income types who go to a lot of dinners," Mr. Simmons said. "I don't think it makes much difference to them."
What they obviously do like are the appearances by President Bush, however brief. He seldom speaks long, but the crowds seem to love the presidential trappings, even if his remarks sound familiar: an opening joke, recognition of local and Congressional officials and comments on issues like terrorism, the economy or Medicare.
Democrats, too, are trying to keep the events simple. Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said his organization had made major cost-cutting efforts, including scaling back fund-raisers.
Now the committee favors receptions over sit-down meals as a way to save.
"We can't afford to do it any other way," he said.
Professional fund-raisers say these cutbacks have added an element of realism to events.
"They're fund-raisers, they're not parties," Mr. McLean said. "As a fund-raiser, I don't care about the centerpiece or the linens. I want a check. They are there to support the candidate and make sure they have the resources they need."
Most of the time, Republicans and Democrats agree with Mr. McLean. But every once in a while they like to kick up their heels with more elaborate parties in places like the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills or the National Building Museum in Washington. And next year's political conventions, which can still accept soft money, are expected to have their share of extravagance, fund-raisers say.
Even President Bush attends a lavish affair now and again. Late last month, he spoke at a fund-raising lunch at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, which is known for its faux Italian canals and gondola rides. The even raised $1.2 million.
The menu featured an appetizer of "buffalo mozzarella and yellow beefsteak tomatoes layered with prosciutto and fire-roasted bell peppers," with "sweet basil-infused olive oil." The main course was "grilled Black Angus fillet with Ferrari-Carano cabernet shiitake reduction."
And the guests? They got to eat sitting down.

HEADLINE: The Farmland Bubble 

 BODY:
The family farm. Few institutions are more central -- iconic, even -- to America's self-image. The words themselves conjure up Norman Rockwell and a shared national heritage that extols self-reliance and the conquest of the frontier. 
 Politics tends to exploit easily romanticized icons, and the family farm has not been spared. It has been used by special interests to justify policies that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars for subsidies that do little to aid real small farmers. It has been hijacked as an excuse to betray America's free-market values and hurt developing countries. 
 Poor cotton farmers in places as remote as Burkina Faso know much more about our agricultural policies than most Americans do, and they express confusion about the United States government's stated commitment to small farmers. In reality, the farms that benefit most are on an industrial scale. American small farmers are victims of federal agricultural policies, just like the African cotton growers, who cannot compete against the American product. American cotton -- thanks to subsidies -- often sells for less than it costs to grow.
The real small farmers' opportunities are limited by high land costs. The stream of subsidy dollars flowing from the federal Treasury -- about $20 billion last year -- has a way of turning arable acres into welfare tickets. That's why in 2001, despite low commodity prices and an ongoing exodus from rural America, farmland values in places like Iowa were hitting all-time highs. Subsidies inflate the price of land by an estimated 25 percent. 
According to an Environmental Working Group analysis of federal data, the subsidies of the past eight years were equivalent to a fifth of the total value (land and buildings) of all the farms in the nation's 100 most-subsidized counties.
That flood of federal money can create a real estate bubble even in places where the death rate is exceeding the birth rate. One of the reasons American farmers feel that they are constantly struggling to break even is the amount they have to pay to buy or rent overpriced farm land in parts of the country where the prices of virtually everything else are among the cheapest in the nation. Roughly half of the nation's agricultural land is rented out, and subsidies disproportionately benefit landlords rather than the actual farmers. The fact that federal policy is making it harder for younger farmers to buy land is one reason that three Midwestern Republican senators, Chuck Hagel, Richard Lugar and Charles Grassley, broke ranks with the once-monolithic farm lobby to vote against the 2002 farm bill.
This year's recovery in commodity prices is a reminder of the fact that world markets still offer many sectors within American agriculture an opportunity to thrive without subsidies. For farmers and communities unable to succeed over time, the government can set up a far more modest rural aid program -- one that encourages economic development in ailing towns and land conservation -- without distorting global food trade. What Uncle Sam cannot do is reverse the technology-driven concentration in agriculture. The number of farms in the United States has declined from nearly six million a half-century ago to some two million today, and we now grow a lot more food on fewer acres. 
Many of those large-scale farms are still family ventures, run by people with a commitment to solid rural values. They deserve respect -- they just don't deserve $20 billion in subsidies.

HEADLINE: The Big Lie About the Little Pill 

BYLINE:  By Joshua M. Zeitz; Joshua M. Zeitz, a lecturer in history at Cambridge University, is writing a book about flappers and American culture in the 1920's.

 BODY:
The recent recommendation by two advisory committees that the Food and Drug Administration should legalize over-the-counter access to the morning-after pill seems likely to intensify the culture wars that have dominated public and political discourse over the years.
 Opponents of the emergency contraceptive, known as Plan B, say they are concerned that among other things, widening access to the morning-after pill will encourage sexual promiscuity, particularly among young people. It was this apprehension that led Dr. W. David Hager of the University of Kentucky to join three other committee members in voting against the recommendation. Dr. Hager said he worried that Plan B was no less revolutionary than the birth control pill, which he claims ushered in "a new day and age for the expression of sexuality among young people." 
 Dr. Hager's argument is a common one. Legalized by the F.D.A. in 1960, "the pill" has been widely described as starting a revolution in sexuality and morals. But that is based on a misunderstanding of the history of America's sexual revolution and the pill's role in it. 
Before 1960, the story goes, the natural constraints of human biology held Americans to strict standards of sexual discipline; after 1960, and after the pill, Americans threw off the shackles (or, depending on one's political perspective, the civilizing influence) of sexual propriety. Ever since, we've been either slouching toward Gomorrah or, as Clare Boothe Luce once famously announced, living in an age when the "modern woman is at last free as a man is free, to dispose of her own body, to earn her living, to pursue the improvement of her mind, to try a successful career."
That's a lot of power for one little pill. In truth, this narrative is flawed. Though the pill surely made contraception easier, and while it gave women more power and responsibility in family planning, it hardly created a sexual revolution. American sexual habits had been changing long before the pill found its way onto the market. Early sex surveys revealed that about half of all women who came of age in the 1920's admitted to engaging in premarital sex (defined as coitus), a figure that held steady for women in later decades.
Americans were also practicing birth control long before the pill. As early as 1938 a poll commissioned by The Ladies' Home Journal found that roughly four of every five women approved of using birth control. Just over two decades later, on the eve of the pill's legalization, 80 percent of white women and 60 percent of nonwhite women reported practicing some form of family planning.
Even the heightened sexual permissiveness of the 1960's can't be attributed to the pill. Throughout the better part of the decade doctors generally prescribed the first oral contraceptive, Enovid, only for married women, who made up the drug's largest market share in its early years. As late as 1971 only 15 percent of unmarried women age 15 to 19 used the pill. Even in recent times, only about 23 percent of women age 15 to 24 report using it. 
The pill, then, did not create America's sexual revolution as much as it accelerated it. And that revolution had been a long time in the making.
Over the course of the 19th century the average number of children born to married couples dropped to about four from about seven. Americans probably weren't having less sex. Instead, couples -- particularly those in the growing middle class, whose families no longer required legions of children to work on the farm -- were practicing birth control. They were coming to view sex as an activity that wasn't merely procreative, but also central to pleasurable and loving marriages.
In the early 20th century many Americans began experimenting with sex outside of matrimony -- partly because they could. By the 1920's a majority of Americans lived in urban areas where they enjoyed greater anonymity and social freedom. Meanwhile, a growing leisure culture provided a host of places -- from dance halls to movie theaters -- where men and women could meet.
At the same time, as an educated work force became increasingly important to the vitality of America's advanced economy, more young people (75 percent by the 1920's) attended high school, creating a new heterosocial peer culture.
In the early 20th century more young women also entered the work force, where they came into increased contact with men and enjoyed a limited amount of financial and social freedom that could translate into a loosening of sexual mores. This was particularly the case in the early 1940's, when millions of women (and exempted men) mobilized for war production, and 16 million of their husbands and boyfriends enlisted in the armed services. The resulting demographic and social upheaval created an explosion of sexual freedom.
Finally, the ever-rising influence of consumerism and advertising after 1900 chipped away at the Victorian-era culture of asceticism and self-denial, in effect legitimating the pursuit of pleasure. In a world where Americans were encouraged to "find a road of happiness the day you buy a Buick," other activities that made people happy -- like sex -- seemed less taboo than in prior years.
Though many young women from the 1920's onward engaged in premarital sex, they probably did so with the intention of marrying their partners. The revolution in morals was tame by later standards. Nevertheless, women and men were steadily redefining the boundaries of romance and sex long before the pill appeared.
The history of America's encounter with the pill helps inform today's debate over Plan B. Oral contraception was a vital development in women's reproductive rights and health, but it didn't cause a revolution in morals and behavior any more than Plan B is likely to sexualize a nation of young people who are already sexually active. Surveys suggest that more than 75 percent of young people have sex before they turn 20, yet only about one-fifth of sexually active high school girls use the pill.
None of this minimizes the importance of either the birth control pill or Plan B. Technology has always been an important catalyst of historical change. But America's sexual revolution was a long, complicated phenomenon. No pharmacist can stuff it into a bottle. Cultural critics shouldn't try to do so, either.

HEADLINE: As Face of Poor Changes, So Do Food Baskets 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
For years, public and nonprofit food assistance programs have been reporting a sharp rise in the number of working families using their services. But now, as working families are becoming as common visitors as the indigent elderly at the city's soup kitchens and food pantries, many program officials say an ambitious shift is under way in how food for the needy is delivered.
 The conventional answer of a box full of donated canned fruit, rice and beans, and the odd piece of eggplant is being supplemented, and in some cases replaced with new options: complete premade meals for takeout, for example, or frozen family-size portions of chili and spaghetti sauce. 
 Driving the shift in strategy, experts and providers say, is a familiar social and economic phenomenon: the growing numbers of working poor turning up at the soup kitchens and pantries, in most cases single mothers with children, are so busy juggling jobs, commuting and child care that they have little time to cook the food they are given. "The face of poverty is a working woman with two children," said Robert Egger, the founder of D.C. Central Kitchen and an advocate for rethinking what goes into a charity food basket. The options most of the nation's poor have, he says, are to stand in line for a meal at a soup kitchen or to go to a local church to pick up a box of groceries assembled from donations.
Mr. Egger is running pilot projects with the United States Department of Agriculture and American Food Services Associates to create programs that would provide meals for families to pick up at high schools and colleges. A project that provides bag lunches to working mothers is already in operation.
Right now, few food pantries in the city could offer such women that convenience, but that is changing. Community Food Resources Center, which operates a soup kitchen and food pantry on West 116th street, just received a grant to buy an industrial-size flash freezer. The group hopes to expand food production at its soup kitchen and freeze some 440 meals daily that it will either give to families at its food pantry or deliver to other food providers across the city, according to Hiram Bonner, the center's director of programs.
Already the center serves "takeout" to 27 families a night. That is, it packages whatever it is serving at its soup kitchen so that families can take the meals with them. Last Friday, Romonia Singleton picked up catfish in a spice rub, with white rice, and carrots with dill. When she dropped by at 5 p.m., it was already wrapped and in a bag waiting with two boxes of vacuum-packed milk for her children.
Ms. Singleton, who lives in the Bronx and also works there part time as a prep cook for the Bronx Zoo, nevertheless travels to Manhattan every day to pick up her children, Ceasar, 9, and Cquila, 6, from school. She calls the takeout program, which is one block from the school, "a lifesaver."
Frozen and prepared meals might sound fanciful, but some providers argue that they are the most efficient use of the products they get. City Harvest, an affiliate of Second Harvest, is New York's largest food rescue operation. It "rescues" unused food from restaurants and caterers as well as surplus crops from local farmers, and delivers them to soup kitchens and food pantries.
But Julia Erikson, City's Harvest's executive director, said more options were needed. "We are exploring a partnership with cooking schools to process excess produce into frozen vegetables, microwaveable stuff, or even complete meals, like frozen meals for working poor," she said.
It is a technique, she said, that is already being used in other cities. "In Nashville," she added, "they do a cook and chill operation to take rescued stuff and reprocess it into chili and stews. The next step is to make it into family-size."
While ready-to-go meals for poor families is the most ambitious of the goals being pursued by the food groups, it is not likely to be commonly available soon. More minor adaptations are already in use. For example, soup pantries have extended hours, and are increasingly likely to let a mother shop, supermarket-style, for what goes into the food basket. Suppliers are also trying to do a better job of thinking about whole meals. 
"What we are hearing is 'please don't give me spaghetti without spaghetti sauce,' " said Margarette C. Purvis, vice president for programs and services at Food Bank for New York City, which delivers food to almost all of the city's pantries and kitchens. 
To many, the changes in poverty food programs are long overdue and reflect the fact that what was once considered an emergency response has become an institutionalized part of how society cares for the poor. But to some, the expanding and diversifying needs only reflect a government failure to address larger poverty questions. Ellen Vollinger, legal director at the Food Research and Action Center, a research and advocacy group based in Washington, said, "I don't think we should be debating prepared food versus the nonprepared food; it is the total allotment that is the problem."
Ms. Vollinger asserts that government-issued food stamp allotments are so low that working families cannot feed themselves even eating cheap staples like beans. The average food stamp grant to a family of four is under $215 a month.
In any case, the city's emergency food distributors are reporting a growing demand. In its 2003 survey of the city's more than 1,000 food pantries and 254 soup kitchens, New York City Coalition Against Hunger found that demand for meals was up by nearly 50 percent since 2001, and as a result providers felt pressed to turn people away or shorten hours.
Rita Marie Trucios, director of social programs at St. John's Bread and Life in Brooklyn, the largest soup kitchen in Brooklyn, said,"We certainly have been thinking about how to better serve the community, but the problem is budget constraints and staffing." Bread and Life, like other nonprofit groups, relies heavily on volunteers to staff the kitchens and manage the food pantries, and cannot easily expand to tackle more food preparation. 
She applauded concepts like bag lunches for working poor and frozen meals but added, "We can all come up with innovative ideas but it comes down to the space and the facilitates to do it."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a shift in strategies for feeding the poor as a result of growth in the number of working families seeking assistance misstated the name of a group that operates a soup kitchen and food pantry in Harlem. It is the Community Food Resource Center, not Resources Center.

Curatorial Culture
In all the hype over Apple Computer's online music store, one fascinating new feature included in the latest version was strangely overlooked: the celebrity playlist. The digital age version of the venerable mix tape, playlists have been a central selling point of the MP3 music revolution, since creating a brand-new mix of your favorite tunes is now as easy as dragging files into a folder on your desktop. Apple's new Celebrity Playlist area in its store features collections of music assembled -- with liner notes -- by famous musicians: Sting, Ben Folds, Wynton Marsalis and many others.
What's potentially revolutionary here is the ability to buy a compilation of music handpicked by another individual, as opposed to the official compilations released by record labels. No doubt Apple will soon offer a feature that enables ordinary music fans to create public playlists engineered around every imaginable theme (the post-breakup collection, the happy Nick Drake songs) and then sell those compilations via the online store. Historically, the world of commercial music has been divided between musicians and listeners, but there's long been a mostly unrewarded group in the middle: people with great taste in music -- the ones who made that brilliant mix for you in college that you're still listening to. They're curators not creators, brilliant at assembling new combinations of songs rather than generating them from scratch.
 Steven Johnson, author of the forthcoming "Mind Wide Open: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life."

Legacy Admissions
Senator Ted Kennedy has introduced legislation to force colleges to disclose the number of places awarded to children of alumni. The initiative has been hailed as a blow for meritocracy against inherited privilege, and also as a blow against racism, since most beneficiaries of legacy admissions are white. Many people want to abolish legacies altogether, but while that sounds like the principled thing to do, our moral commitment to meritocracy should not require us to ignore the human side of institutions. 
A recent editorial in The New York Observer stated that while most colleges reserve about 12 percent of their places for legacies, they typically raise 90 percent of their outside funds from alumni, much of which goes into scholarships. Abolishing such preferences therefore threatens to diminish the quality of higher education while sharply raising its cost. That would hurt the same minority and lower-income students whom reformers like Senator Kennedy are trying to help.
While legacy preferences have mainly benefited whites, it seems unfair to deny minorities the opportunity to pass on social capital to their children just when they have managed to obtain it. After all, institutionalized nepotism has often been the means by which excluded groups have lifted themselves out of poverty.
 Adam Bellow, executive editor at large for Doubleday and author of "In Praise of Nepotism."

Thomas Jefferson
Recently, Thomas Jefferson has been viciously maligned in ways normally reserved only for modern American presidents and liberals. Jefferson-bashing historians criticize Thomas Jefferson for having a secret affair with a slave, slight his authorship of the Declaration of Independence, compare him badly with John Adams (who mistrusted democracy and signed the Alien and Sedition Acts) and call Jefferson the forerunner of Pol Pot. A prominent new book disparages him as a callous pro-slavery politician, and celebrates, as the anti-Jefferson, one Timothy Pickering -- a raving antidemocratic plotter with a dubious record on slavery.
Eventually, critics will catch up with these writers' distortions and basic factual errors. Historians will retrieve Abraham Lincoln's judgment that "the principles of Jefferson are the definitions and axioms of free society."
 Sean Wilentz, professor of history at Princeton University.

Link Between Money And Happiness
In conferences around the globe this year, psychologists reported that measures of human happiness scarcely change when national income grows. Citing this finding, many social critics now insist that income growth no longer promotes well-being. 
Experience suggests otherwise. 
Years ago, when I was a graduate student with two children in diapers, my wife called in distress to report that our 10-year-old clothes dryer had died. That evening I scanned the classified ads, made numerous calls and the next day drove out to inspect several machines. After haggling with the owner of a five-year-old Kenmore, I wrote a check we could barely cover. I drove a friend's truck across town to pick it up, then drove 25 miles to take the old machine to the dump. 
Four days and numerous hardware store visits later, we again had a working dryer. 
I now earn many times what I did then. Recently my wife called to say that another dryer had died. "Call Werninck's," I suggested. When I got home that evening, the old machine was gone and a new one already up and running. Money doesn't guarantee happiness. But having enough can make life a lot less stressful.
 Robert H. Frank, professor of economics at Cornell University and author of the forthcoming "What Price the Moral High Ground? Ethical Dilemmas in Competitive Environments."

Hip-Hop Politics
Countless local hip-hop activist groups around the country are on the cutting edge of grass-roots activism and politics that matter most to the hip-hop generation. Organizations like the San Francisco-based Ella Baker Center for Human Rights; the 21st Century Leadership Movement, based in Selma, Ala.; and the Hip-Hop Political Action Committee in Chicago have been in the trenches laying the groundwork for organizing the hip-hop generation into a concrete voting bloc. Four signs point to their growing influence: Active Element Foundation's publication of the "Future 500," which documents grass-roots youth activists nationwide; presidential candidates arming themselves with hip-hop to reach out to young voters; the much-discussed National Hip-Hop Political Convention in the works for June 2004; and the often-overnight platinum sales of hip-hop CD's that, once channeled into votes, will mean the end of politics as usual.
 Bakari Kitwana, author of "The Hip-Hop Generation: Young Blacks and the Crisis in African American Culture."

Leisure
We are tethered to our e-mail, day and night. We are rarely out of cellphone range. Long working hours extend into evenings and weekends. Most of us feel lucky to love our work, but we put few limits on it. Less fortunate Americans labor long days to compensate for laid-off co-workers or simply to pay the bills. Studies reveal that Americans do an average of 350 hours (the equivalent of almost nine 40-hour weeks) more work each year than Europeans, and two-thirds fail to sleep eight hours a night. Stress-induced illnesses are rampant. Even when we're not working, we "work out" or watch reality TV. We have turned our homework- and activity-burdened older children and ourselves into workaholics, multitasking 24/7. What are we trying to prove? 
 Lizabeth Cohen, professor of history at Harvard University and author of "A Consumers' Republic: The Politics of Mass Consumption in Postwar America."

Public Transportation
Four of the best ideas in the area of public transportation are the E-Z Pass, the Eurostar Chunnel train, the congestion charge for city drivers, and the London taxi. Unfortunately, the only American one is still underutilized.
 Elaine Showalter, professor of English emerita, Princeton University.

Status
What people really seem to want most is a better place in the pecking order. Status would appear to be a sad but fundamental legacy of our evolutionary origins. While it's a shame people care so much about an invisible and potentially destructive prize, there is one wonderful thing about status. It can be manufactured at low cost. The genius of America has always been the presence of unlimited distinct tracks to success. An ambitious person might become an executive or a garage inventor or a fitness guru. The benefit is that having endless overlaid pecking orders reduces the sting of being left out of any particular pecking order. When executives insist on making thousands of times more money than workers in order to feel rewarded, the peculiar American social contract is undermined. Both domestically and internationally, we're collectively trending toward mass humiliation of opponents. Why not try to make as many reasonable people as happy as possible when it costs so little?
 Jaron Lanier, a computer scientist and composer and virtual-reality pioneer.

The Women's Movement
Despite pandemic phobia about the word "feminist," a movement as multifaceted as a jewel is reflected in ubiquitous (shoestring-budgeted) services for abused women; increased attention to the complexity of sexism and its interactions with race, class and sexual orientation; and the energy of young Third Wave feminists. Feminists in the 1970's hardly dared to dream that principles like equal pay and recognition of poverty and elder abuse as problems especially affecting women would be taken as givens, where formerly they were dismissed as signs of paranoid, man-hating women.
 Paula J. Caplan, Ph.D., author of 12 books about mental health and social issues, including "They Say You're Crazy: How the World's Most Powerful Psychiatrists Decide Who's Normal."

Honesty
To say that honesty is a virtue often underrated in political life is, I realize, like pointing out that the sun rises in the east. But never have the dangers, costs and consequences of concealing or distorting the truth seemed quite so alarming as they have this past year. 
The demand for truthful answers to the most essential questions (Did our administration really believe that Iraq was harboring weapons of mass destruction? Will the new prescription-drug plan actually benefit the elderly?) is more and more often dismissed as "partisan" or, worse, "unpatriotic."
Forthrightness and integrity are being made to seem naive and weak, the moral province of losers, pointless scruples inconsistent with the more manly attributes required to wage war on terror. But what could be more terrifying than the prospect of a society that no longer has the desire, the will, the energy or the ability to distinguish between the truth and the spin that our leaders would prefer us to believe?
 Francine Prose, novelist, and the author of "The Lives of the Muses."

HEADLINE: MAD COW DISEASE IN THE UNITED STATES: THE MARKET; 
Many Stocks Linked to Beef Continue Fall

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
The discovery of mad cow disease in the United States continued to roil the cattle markets and the beef industry yesterday as the prices of live cattle and stock in meat processors were pummeled for a second day. 
 On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures for delivery in February fell 3 cents, to 86.175 cents a pound, even after the normal limit of 1.5 cents a pound was doubled for the day because of the crisis. 
 Stock in Tyson Foods Inc., the largest meat processor in the nation, fell 31 cents, to $12.59 a share, after falling $1.08, or 8 percent, on Wednesday. Smithfield Foods Inc. and the Hormel Foods Corporation each fell by about 1 percent. 
Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, said it might cut the debt ratings of companies that process beef and of restaurants that feature beef because of the uncertainty about how consumers will react.
Some restaurant chains, notably the McDonald's Corporation and Wendy's International, posted modest gains, reversing setbacks on Wednesday when the initial reaction to the mad cow scare swept the markets. 
But the price of live cattle remained under pressure as countries around the world banned imports of cattle from the United States. Analysts said the United States had been on pace to export more than $3.5 billion worth of beef this year, 10 percent of the nation's production.
Faced with the uncertainty and the exchange's limit on daily changes in price, traders in the futures market were unable to determine the price, which fell the 3-cent limit as soon as trading began, essentially putting a halt to trade, because there were no buyers.
The exchange raised the limit to 3 cents for yesterday's session because the price fell the normal 1.5 cent limit on Wednesday and will expand the limit again, to 5 cents a pound, for Monday's session. 
Gregg Doud, chief economist with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association in Denver, said prices in the market for options on cattle futures, where prices have fewer restrictions, indicated that the price might level off at about 75 cents a pound.
Mr. Doud said one trade was reported on the cash market in Kansas on Friday, with live cattle selling for 78 cents a pound, down from an average of 92.62 cents a pound before the mad cow news emerged.
"I am hard-pressed to think of the last time this market has done anything like this," Mr. Doud said. "And it's because we've lost our export market. We've lost at least 90 percent of a $3.5 billion export market this week."
Chuck Levitt, senior livestock analyst for the Alaron Trading Corporation in Chicago, noted that the Canadian beef industry was still reeling from the discovery of an infected cow in April.
"We are seeing an agricultural tragedy unfold as we speak," Mr. Levitt said. "How much equity will be lost by the American beef producer, I can't tell you. But chances are it won't be millions, it will be billions of dollars." 
Keith Collins, chief economist with the Department of Agriculture, said the price might return to levels of a year ago, or about 72 cents a pound, which would be tolerable considering that the past year has been a good one.
"So the price declines the producers are likely going to face, while in fact will cause them some financial difficulty, will probably bring prices back to a level that they've been in the past year or so," Mr. Collins said.

HEADLINE: Tongass Travesty 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has pulled another thread from the intricate legal tapestry shielding the national forests from excessive logging. On Tuesday, it announced that the Tongass National Forest in Alaska would be denied protections provided by the so-called roadless rule, a federal regulation prohibiting the building of roads -- and by definition most commercial activity -- on 58.5 million acres of national forests. 
 The administration presents the new policy as a necessary tonic for southeast Alaska's depressed economy, and as a necessary response to a state lawsuit that it says it could never have won. The reality is otherwise. This is essentially a holiday gift to Senator Ted Stevens and Gov. Frank Murkowski, both of whom have lobbied for the resumption of the clear-cutting that has already stripped the nation's only temperate rain forest of a half million acres of old-growth trees. 
 The announcement came wrapped in the same deceptive packaging that has camouflaged much of this administration's forest policy. The most egregious example was the Forest Service's disingenuous assertion that the new policy would allow logging on only 300,000 acres of the Tongass, or about 3 percent of the 9.6 million roadless acres that are earmarked for protection.
Though that is technically true, the actual ecological impact would be far greater. For one thing, those 300,000 acres include many of the forest's oldest trees and most valuable watersheds, as well as an extraordinary collection of wildlife. It is no exaggeration to say that these acres constitute the forest's biological heart. And because these acres are not all in one place, but are distributed among 50 different logging projects, the new roads required to reach them will inevitably violate even more of the forest.
The administration's action is prelude to what is most likely to be an even broader assault on the roadless rule, which has been challenged in the courts by timber interests and six other states where logging is big business. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the rule; the 10th Circuit is reviewing a lower court's decision rejecting the rule. But rather than wait for a resolution, the administration has indicated that it will move administratively to give individual governors the right to ignore the rule. That would seem to pre-empt the judicial process. It would also give a handful of state officials power over federal lands, which belong to all Americans.

HEADLINE: $1.2 Million Of 9/11 Aid Is Returned 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
A major program to help small businesses in Lower Manhattan recover from the Sept. 11 terrorist attack has taken back $1.2 million in erroneous payments it made to 66 companies, according to the state agency administering the program.
 The agency, the Empire State Development Corporation, said the money was recovered from businesses that were found to have been overpaid, in some cases because financial information they submitted did not hold up in audits, though their applications were not necessarily fraudulent. 
 The program, the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program, was set up swiftly to help as many businesses as possible and to keep the downtown economy afloat.
The program distributed federally financed grants totaling $558 million to 14,215 businesses, according to its most recent figures, so the money recovered is a small fraction of its outlay. 
State and federal officials are still conducting audits of the grants under a Congressional directive to assure that the money was soundly spent, so more money may be taken back. A federal audit of a sample of the grants suggested that about 1 percent of the $558 million, about $5 million, might have been overpaid. 
Empire State Development said the erroneous payments had been minimal and understandable given the speed with which the program had sought to give money to the businesses in need. 
Kevin S. Corbett, the chief operating officer, said in an interview last week that the 66 repayments were out of "about 70 companies we've contacted" to return all or part of their grants. He declined to identify the companies, citing what he called privacy reasons, but they are known to include at least one financial firm and one food shop. "Some cases involved figures they gave us that on auditing didn't match up," he said. 
He said that where fraud was suspected, the cases were referred for investigation to the inspector general's office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the federal agency that provided the funds. 
A spokesman for Empire State said earlier that at least a half-dozen cases involving a total of about $300,000 in payments had been referred.
 At least one case (not among the half-dozen) has resulted in convictions. In October, two men, Alexander D. Koltovskoy and Vincent M. Pizzi III, who operated an executive search company, were convicted of swindling nearly $65,000 from the grant program, along with more than $275,000 from other programs providing Sept. 11-related relief. They are awaiting sentencing, in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
 Under the grant program, businesses from 14th Street to the Battery with fewer than 500 employees could apply for aid. The amount a business received depended on its proximity to ground zero, its revenue in the fiscal year immediately before Sept. 11, 2001, and its economic losses related to Sept. 11 that were not reimbursed by insurance.
 The grants averaged around $40,000. Firms in the financial industry received an average of about $70,000; stores and restaurants averaged $20,000.
 Empire State Development last week clarified another aspect of the program, a provision that applied to businesses that had ceased operating after the attack but that had received grants in anticipation of reopening.
 The agency had told applicants that an owner of a suspended business had to certify that it would reopen in New York City within a year of receiving the grant "in order to avoid repayment." 
 An undetermined number of businesses that were given grants under the provision have not reopened, though it is a year or more since they received the money, and leaders of Lower Manhattan business groups say some probably will never be able to reopen.
 But Mr. Corbett, the chief operating officer, said that business owners who did not reopen after a year would not necessarily have to pay back the grant money.
 "We are reviewing case by case," he said. "If the company or business in good faith was not able to resume or stay in business" in the city, he said, it is not likely it will be asked to repay. "If they got a grant and moved to New Jersey, that's different," he said. "If somebody acted on a fraudulent basis, that's different."
One business owner said recently that he had been unable to open on his old site, in part because his landlord had refused to extend his lease, and he did not have the money -- or the prospect of success -- to reopen elsewhere, despite his $50,000 grant. He said he would be hard-pressed to repay were he asked to.
 "It's gone," he said, speaking on condition that he and his old business not be identified. He and his family have been "basically living off that money and the insurance," he said.
 Mr. Corbett said that companies that were operating when they received grant money but then went out of business just had to be open when they got the grants, "even if they went bust one day after," provided, he added, that no fraud had been involved.
 But Kevin Gersh, the owner of a private school that closed in June 2002, two months after receiving an $8,500 grant, said he was recently told by a representative of Mr. Corbett's agency that he would have to return that money and a $3,400 payment he received early this year.
 Mr. Gersh said that attendance and revenue at his TriBeCa Montessori Academy on Harrison Street, eight blocks north of ground zero, had plunged after Sept. 11. He said that he had gone into debt to keep the school open until June 2002, and did not now have the resources to reopen it. In fact, he said, the school is in bankruptcy proceedings. He said he had not been formally asked to repay the money, and the state agency said the school's case was under review.
 The inspector general's office in the Department of Housing and Urban Development said in its most recent report on the program, in September, that it had reviewed a sample of 308 grants totaling just over $30 million and had found that a total of $243,000 -- close to 1 percent -- had been wrongly paid to three companies. The report did not identify the companies, but the errors involved an overpayment to one, a duplicate payment to another and a payment the auditors said the third was ineligible for.
Mr. Corbett told the federal auditors that the program's administration "has been excellent" and that its "goals of helping as many businesses as possible in the shortest amount of time have been met," with minimal deficiencies.
The federal auditors also found a fourth error -- a $14 underpayment to a company.

HEADLINE: Free Trade Accord at Age 10: The Growing Pains Are Clear 

BYLINE:  This article was reported by Elizabeth Becker, Clifford Krauss and Tim Weiner and was written by Mr. Weiner.; Elizabeth Becker reported for this article from Goshen, Ind., Clifford Krauss from Durham, Ont., and Tim Weiner from Ciudad Acuna, Mexico.

 BODY:
The North American Free Trade Agreement took hold 10 years ago, after a bruising, arm-twisting debate. Today it is more than ever a politically charged symbol of the promises and perils of free trade.
 The accord, known as Nafta, brought under one canopy three hugely different economies: the wealthy United States, middle-class Canada and striving Mexico. The disparities made Nafta the boldest gamble ever on the proposition that free trade could benefit all. 
 Leaders promised the accord would create millions of good jobs, curb illegal immigration and raise living standards "from the Yukon to the Yucatan." A decade later, the verdict, even among Nafta's strongest supporters, is that for those goals free trade by itself is not enough. 
Nafta's effects cannot be isolated from the broader changes in a globalizing economy. But many economists and political analysts say that while the accord stimulated trade and overall growth, it also brought jarring dislocations. For better or worse -- or both -- Nafta transformed the continent's economic landscape with startling speed. 
Gary Hufbauer, a senior analyst at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research group that supports free trade, said the gains for the United States -- lower priced consumer goods and increased corporate earnings -- are large compared to the losses.
"However, the gains are so thinly spread across the country that people don't thank Nafta when they buy a mango or inexpensive auto parts," he said.
The pain, he said, is concentrated in places like the Midwest, where manufacturing jobs have been lost to Mexico and Canada, and now to China. "Nafta-related job loss and lower income may be small, but the echo is very large because of all the other jobs lost to globalization," he said. "Nafta is the symbol for all of that pain."
The debate over Nafta continues to shape the future of free trade, even as more nations line up for its presumed benefits, like the four Central American countries that reached their own accord with the United States last week. 
But even that agreement is likely to face agonizing debate in Congress during an election year as Nafta's wrenching changes provide a rallying point for opponents who say it was too much too fast and paid too little attention to the impact on workers. 
With the national consensus on free trade fraying and the loss of jobs looming as a campaign issue, it is doubtful whether any Democratic candidate or President Bush will stand unapologetically behind deeper trade liberalization in the coming year. 
But for Nafta's supporters, the accord, which lowered or eliminated tariffs on everything from agricultural goods to auto parts, still left all three nations better off than they would have been without it.
"It has definitely created export-related job growth," said Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico. As the Democratic whip, he helped pushed through passage of Nafta in the House. 
"On the whole Nafta's been a plus, but still, with a lot of alarmingly bad follow-up on commitments made on the border," he said. Promises to protect workers' rights and the environment have "failed alarmingly." So have pledges to close the economic gap between the United States and Mexico.
"The whole idea that Nafta would create jobs on the Mexican side and thus deter immigration has just been dead wrong," he said. "That was oversold." 
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States Trade Representative, says Nafta achieved its objective of increasing trade, especially doubling American agricultural exports to Mexico. Though the United States' trade deficit with Canada and Mexico grew nine-fold to nearly $90 billion, total trade among the three nations grew by 109 percent. 
"Nafta has been pulling American goods and grains into Mexico, benefiting consumers and supporting quality U.S. jobs here at home," he said, referring to rising pay for manufacturing jobs. That 14.4 percent boost still lagged behind the overall increase in household incomes. 
For retail giants like Wal-Mart, government-subsidized American agricultural businesses and America's biggest makers of automobiles and automobile parts, borderless trade meant bigger profits for themselves and their stockholders.
But the benefits of stable prices and rising 401(k)'s are largely invisible compared with the blight of a shuttered factory. The consumers of the United States or Mexico or Canada are also each nation's workers, farmers and small town residents, and Nafta left many with lower consumer costs at the expense of their old way of life.
In Canada, where Nafta helped shape a more competitive economy, those growing pains were cushioned by a strong social safety net. Not so in Mexico and the United States. 
"We're the losers," said Bonnie Long, one of at least half a million American manufacturing workers who lost their jobs due to Nafta, despite the surge in trade. "We lost our health care, our living wages. The winners are the corporate executives who don't even live here and can locate their factories wherever they find the cheapest labor."

Goshen, Ind.
Social Tensions And Vanishing Jobs
Indiana, like the rest of the United States, has enjoyed a growth in exports under Nafta. But Goshen is also like thousands of towns across the nation that have seen jobs and health benefits disappear with the accord. 
What is also disappearing is a way of life in Goshen, home to 30,000 people and the seat of Elkhart County in northern Indiana. The town once lived by making things. It was the "widget capital" of the United States, says its mayor, Allan Kauffman.
"Nafta has not had a positive impact," he explained. "Goshen makes widgets. It has always made widgets. And any company that makes widgets that are easy to transport -- those are gone or are going to go."
Half of Elkhart County depends on manufacturing. Once dozens of locally owned factories across the state churned out parts for all sorts of products, electronics, pharmaceuticals, furniture, pianos and especially for the automotive industry.
Even before Nafta those jobs were facing growing pressure from emerging low-wage competitors abroad. Since Nafta took hold, hundreds more jobs have gone south to Mexico, transplanted by big corporations that bought out local firms. Chinese competition is intensifying the losses.
"We've traded high-skill jobs for low-skill jobs, and the trend has worsened over the last four years," said Bill Johnson. He sold his family's business, Goshen Rubber Company to a multinational corporation, Parker Hannifin, in 2000.
James Cartwright, a Parker Hannifin spokesman, said the company, like many others, moved jobs to Mexico because "we do what is best to serve our customers and our stockholders."
As a consumer or investor, Ms. Long, 46, like other Americans, might feel those benefits. But they mean little to her without the job she lost, after 21 years, when Parker Hannifin made its move.
"If it wasn't for my dad," who has helped her get by, "I would be one unemployment check away from being homeless," she said.
That pain and frustration is widely shared.
Chester F. Dobis, speaker pro tem of the Indiana House of Representatives, held four meetings this year around the state to gauge feelings toward free trade. Mr. Dobis, a Democrat from Merrillville, said he had thought the only problems would be in his own district, a steel-producing region.
"Boy, was I wrong," he said. "These trade pacts have had a devastating effect on every part of the state. The companies deserted Indiana for Mexico a couple of years ago and now they're heading for China."
Few manufacturers have been able to resist the seemingly tidal pull of globalization that includes Nafta. One is Gerald A. Trolz, a local hero because he would not sell or relocate Goshen Stamping, his small hardware manufacturing firm, even after his main customer moved to Mexico and half his sales went with it. 
He said the only reason he has been able to keep his firm in Goshen is that he owns it: he does not answer to stockholders. "The experts don't see what's happening here, on the shop floor, so it's easy for them to say that Nafta was good or bad," Mr. Trolz said. "Until this levels out, it is just plain havoc." 
The increasing competition from cheap labor abroad has deepened a decades-old trend toward depressed wages, as has another unexpected impact of Nafta -- the arrival here of hundreds of Mexican migrants looking for work. 
Mayor Kauffman says the federal government "could have done something to stop this influx of migrants that has pushed down our wages," especially as it embraced the banner of free trade.
The town's Hispanic population has grown at least four-fold under Nafta. Social tensions grew, too. The large Mennonite and Amish communities here have tried hard to ease the strains, especially after the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan rallied against the Mexicans, many of whom work illegally. 
The Mexicans are also willing to work for less -- sometimes as little as $2 an hour under the table at restaurants. Such wages are still a step up for many Mexicans displaced in the continental churn of workers that Nafta has set in motion. 
"Our area back home was very poor," said Trina Cervantes, who arrived two years ago from Guadalajara with her two sons, following her husband, now a legal resident after seven years on a Goshen assembly line. "It took my husband three months to earn what he earns here in one week."
For residents like Ms. Long, there is little elation that Nafta has made Goshen a better place to work for Mexicans, while their own jobs have eroded. "The way the Goshen economy is now," she said, "we all feel it's Nafta coming around to bite us in the behind."

Ciudad Acuna, Mexico
A Fleeting Boom And Disillusionment
One of the promises of Nafta was that it would close the great gaps in wages and living standards between the United States and Mexico and keep Mexicans working on their side of the border.
Nowadays in Mexico, "When you argue that free trade benefits poor people," said Luis de la Calle, a chief Nafta negotiator for Mexico, "no one believes you." A strong supporter of the accord, Mr. de la Calle, an economist, nonetheless believes Nafta's benefits for Mexico are dwindling as manufacturing moves to countries where wages are even lower, particularly China. 
Some Mexican companies successfully exploited the new American market, especially those allied with American corporations, like big tomato growers that sell to companies like Del Monte, or food processors that turn American pigs into bacon.
But by every measurable standard, the gap between rich and poor in Mexico widened. Unemployment is up and real wages, eroded by a collapse of the peso in 1995, are flat or down for many millions of workers. 
Nafta created jobs, but not fast enough to keep pace with rising competition from China, or with a labor force that swelled with Mexican farmers displaced by subsidized American imports. 
Millions of Mexican workers crossed into the United States. A million more moved north to the border looking for work, in a movement comparable to the migration of Americans from the rural South to Northern cities like Chicago and Detroit in the first half of the 20th century. For Mexico, the change happened in a decade.
Many ended up in the trade-driven assembly lines known as maquiladoras, most of which stand in hard-bitten border towns like Ciudad Juarez and Ciudad Acuna. The maquiladoras produced $78 billion in exports during 2002, nearly two-thirds of that sum from American parts assembled in Mexico and re-exported to the United States.
"The promises made about how life would be were not real," said Etelvina Vazquez, 43, an assembly-line worker in an Alcoa auto-supplies plant. She is one of 27,000 people who moved to Ciudad Acuna from the southern state of Veracruz alone, according to the city's maquiladora owners' association. 
After five years, Ms. Vazquez takes home $45 for a 48-hour week, after deductions for the costs of her government-built house. Though her income is higher than it was back home, what she has left after paying the bills is about the same. "Life is different," she said, "but just as hard."
Many of these maquiladora jobs are now disappearing, as the one relative advantage Mexico once had -- cheap labor -- erodes in an expanding global marketplace. Of the 700,000 new maquiladora jobs generated in Nafta's first seven years, 300,000 have been eliminated since 2000. 
Inside and outside the maquiladoras, "all the jobs gained in manufacturing thanks to Nafta have vanished," said Edgar Amador, an economist in Mexico City. "Ten years after, there is no conclusive evidence that real wages have increased because of Nafta."
To Angelica Morales, a maquiladora worker transplanted to Ciudad Acuna from Monclova, four hours south, the reason is clear enough. "There are no independent unions," she said. "Workers have no say over what happens to them." 
Such arguments do not persuade Cuauhtemoc Hernandez, 31, who represents the city's Maquiladora Association -- 34 assembly-line plants, all but two owned by American companies, employing 32,000 Mexican workers. The benefits for American business -- cheap labor, high productivity, generous tax breaks -- flow throughout the city, he says. 
"The growth of Acuna was fast, fast, fast," he said -- so fast that the city has a severe lack of housing, hospitals and schools. 
"Everybody says the local situation -- unpaved streets, no workers' health institutions, no housing that workers deserve -- is the maquiladoras' fault," Mr. Hernandez said. "Even some government authorities say, 'No more maquiladoras.' What is our answer? Our answer is: 'You cannot stop progress.' "

Durham, Ont.
Industries Forced To Adapt or Die
Canada was far better situated than Mexico to benefit from free trade. It has a well-educated middle class. Ninety percent of Canadians live within 100 miles of the border. They enjoy liberal unemployment benefits and universal health insurance.
"Of course, you've got some pain that has to be endured," said Jean Chretien, who stepped down this month as Canada's prime minister.
Progress proved wrenching for Canada, as well. It had a separate 1988 free-trade accord with the United States, five years before Nafta. Those years were a cold shower for Canada: from 1989 to 1991, 450,000 manufacturing jobs, roughly one in five, were lost.
Some survivors came out stronger. Nafta's proponents point to a future where the promises of free trade may yet be fulfilled.
In the small Ontario manufacturing town of Durham, the managers of the Durham Furniture factory got a phone call from Toronto on Feb. 10, 1992. Their parent company, Strathearn House Group, had gone bankrupt. All 150 employees were summoned to the cafeteria to hear the news: their 93-year-old plant would soon close. 
"The entire town was like a wake," recalled Lloyd Love, now vice president for manufacturing. 
Then the managers found financing to reopen the plant as a stand-alone company called Durham Furniture. Under the direction of an American marketing specialist named John Scarsella, now president and chief executive, Durham remade itself, investing more than $15 million in new technology and aiming for American customers. 
Durham's sales rose eight-fold since 1994 to over $75 million this year. Eighty percent of that goes to the United States. From 100 employees in 1993, the company now has 800 workers, a sales office in Canfield, Ohio, and a showroom in High Point, N.C.
"The border is seamless for us," Mr. Scarsella said. "We went from a Canadian company with a 30 million population market to a 300 million market. We do not treat the border as a border."
David Hanna, executive vice president of the Ontario Furniture Manufacturing Association, said perhaps half a dozen company members were driven out of business by Nafta, which let American giants like Ethan Allen flood the Canadian market. Ontario's premier furniture manufacturers have lost about half of the roughly 7,200 workers they had a decade ago, he said. 
"Once barriers went down Canadian industry was very exposed," said Perrin Beatty, president of the Manufacturers and Exporters Association and a cabinet minister in the government that negotiated the agreement. "It meant a psychological shift of gears. You either adapted or you died."
Today Canada's businesses are far more export-oriented than a generation ago. They created 500,000 jobs last year, even as they, too, feel growing Chinese competition. Exports to the United States more than doubled and now represent more than a third of Canada's economy. Several sectors -- communications equipment, chemicals, oil and gas services, aircraft manufacturing and electronics -- are growing fast.
But in Canada, as in Europe, the social safety net eased that transformation. The European Union handled free trade differently. It has allowed the free movement of workers, not just capital. It protected wage standards. It closed the gap between a richer country like Germany and a poorer one like Greece with money and technology. European governments, not employers, provide health care and pensions.
"It is easier when people don't have to worry about the social safety networks and can accept a connection between improving competition and economic growth," said Pascal Lamy, Europe's top trade minister and a staunch free trader. When Americans are thrown out of work because of a fundamental shift caused by new global trade rules, he said, they risk losing everything.

A8) Chart: "Goods and Jobs; America's Mixed Picture"Nafta opened the U.S. market to a flood of Canadian goods and provided low-wage workers for the assembly of American goods at plants in Mexico near the border. The promise of Nafta, according to politicians, was high-wage jobs for American workers and employment in Mexico that would keep its citizens working at home. Instead, studies found Nafta had little effect on job gains in the U.S., and Mexicans continued to move north.

HEADLINE: MAD COW DISEASE IN THE UNITED STATES: THE OVERVIEW; 
Tracing History Of Infected Cow May Take Time

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
Federal authorities said on Friday that it could take weeks or months to trace where a dairy cow in Washington State with the nation's first case of mad cow disease was born -- and that investigators might not succeed at all.
 Finding the birthplace and the "birth herd" of the diseased Holstein dairy cow, which was slaughtered on Dec. 9, are crucial to determine whether other cattle may have also contracted mad cow disease. The disease, a degenerative brain ailment known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, is believed to take at least four years to incubate. 
 Since the diseased cow was 4 1/2 years old, investigators say they believe it was probably infected by eating contaminated feed at a young age -- feed that could have also been eaten by other calves. 
A delay or failure to find the birth herd would probably intensify the already growing number of calls for a national system to track cattle. But as a practical matter, regardless of whether the Holstein's origin is found, federal officials will also come under heavy pressure to increase other regulation and testing.
Regulators will face demands, for example, to eliminate all brain and spinal material from adult cattle from the human food supply. Other demands are sure to include mandatory testing of brain cells from slaughtered cattle that have shown signs of nervous conditions or, as was the case with the cow in Washington, were unable to stand.
"If we're lucky, we could know something within a matter of a day or two," said Dr. Ron DeHaven, the chief veterinarian of the Department of Agriculture, in a conference call with reporters on Friday. But, he added: "It might not be a matter of days. It could be a matter of weeks or months, and there's always that possibility that because of lack of records we might not be able to absolutely determine that at all."
The authorities said a second herd of cows in Washington that includes one offspring of the diseased Holstein was quarantined on Wednesday. That herd, in Sunnyside, includes about 400 bull calves. The herd that contained the diseased cow and its only other living calf had already been quarantined in Mabton, Wash., at the Sunny Dene ranch, officials say. The authorities emphasized it was unlikely that the sickness had been passed down to the Holstein's calves, as the disease is thought to be transmitted by consuming contaminated feed.
Cattle prices continued to plunge on Friday as traders worried that fears about contaminated meat, which can cause a fatal disease in humans, would sharply decrease demand for beef. Futures contracts for delivery of live cattle in February fell the maximum one-day amount, 3 cents per pound, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, closing at 86.175 cents per pound.
Fears of sharply lower demand have been fueled by moves by top importers, including Japan and South Korea, to block shipments of American beef. About 10 percent of beef produced in the United States, worth more than $3 billion, is exported annually.
Agriculture Department officials will fly to Japan on Saturday to try to reassure officials there about the beef supply. Japan buys about one-third of American exports of beef, veal and other beef products, worth $1 billion in 2002. Losing the Japanese market is "a significant drop," said Keith Collins, the chief economist of the Agriculture Department.
The White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, speaking aboard Air Force One en route to Crawford, Tex., said it was "kind of early to determine the economic impact." Seeking to assuage the public's fear, he said President Bush "has eaten beef in the last couple of days."
Given what is known about how mad cow disease is transmitted, if the diseased cow was born in the United States, it is possible its initial owner failed to follow federal rules put into place in 1997 forbidding the use of proteins derived from processed cattle as feed for cows.
"Far and away, the most likely means of spread of the disease is by an animal consuming protein that came from an animal that is infected with the disease," Dr. DeHaven said. "The birth premises," he added, is "most likely where the exposure occurred." 
Asked whether the diseased cow came from Canada, where a case of mad cow disease was diagnosed in May, Dr. DeHaven said it was "premature for us to speculate." He said it was possible the cow had been on a dairy farm near Mabton or a nearby livestock market. "But from there, the epidemiological investigation becomes a tangled web of different possibilities," he said, that include Canada, Washington or other states.
From records on the diseased cow's dairy farm, investigators can tell it was purchased in October 2001. But they cannot tell yet whether it came from a livestock market or from a dairy "finishing farm" where female calves are prepared to become milk cows. The owner bought more than 100 dairy cows that month from a finishing farm, officials said.
In the fragmented dairy industry, calves born to dairy cows are often sold to finishing farms, where they are weaned and brought up on grain until they are about 2 years old, when they are impregnated and ready to calve and be milked. Then they are sold to a dairy farm. A bull calf may go to a different kind of finishing farm, where it may be raised for stud or fattened for slaughter.
Agriculture Department officials say the difficulty in tracking the diseased cow's past demonstrates how much the country needs a national system for tracking animals from birth to slaughter, as there is in New Zealand and some other countries. Currently, some animals in Western states are given numbered ear tags when they are inoculated against brucellosis, and some states have laws that require that a cow's brand be recorded whenever it is sold. But these are not considered efficient ways of tracking cattle. 
"This will speed the momentum for a national identification system," said Dr. Will Hueston, a professor of public health and veterinary medicine at the University of Minnesota and an expert in mad cow disease. 
Dr. Valerie E. Ragan, the deputy chief veterinarian for the Agriculture Department, said the agency had a team of 100 people from the federal government, the states and industry working to create a national tracking system. Federal officials, she said, envision having cattle fitted with electronic ear tags that have a visible number on the outside as well as a chip on the inside that can be read either with a hand-held scanner or as the animal passes through a large detector.
Even if the Washington State animal's birth herd is found, it is not necessarily going to be possible to figure out what the calf ate that led to its infection, said Dr. Stephen Sundlof of the Food and Drug Administration, who joined Dr. DeHaven on the news conference on Friday.
"Think yourself what you might have eaten four and a half years ago," he said. "That's not the kind of thing people keep really accurate records on."

HEADLINE: Sales Results for the Holiday Trickle In and Trickle Up 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
As sales results began to trickle in yesterday, it became clear that this year's holiday season was only ho-hum for most retailers, far from the one bursting with consumer cheer they had once hoped for.
 But it was at least an improvement from last year's holiday season, which was called the most disappointing in a decade. Estimates of the overall gain this year ranged from 3.5 percent to 5.7 percent yesterday, with experts still holding fast to their projections of a month ago. 
 Instead of "disastrous" and "dismal," the words used to describe last year's holiday season, analysts and retailers used words like "normal" and "solid" this year -- with several adding "boring." In September, merchants had hoped for double-digit growth. 
But as the season wound up -- most do not count the holidays ending until Dec. 31 -- there were some flip-flops on estimates for individual retailers.
Few this fall, for instance, could have guessed that Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer, would stumble, heading for the low end of its forecast with a modest 3 percent to 5 percent gain in December -- in part because of a turnaround in the luxury goods market. High-end retailers like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue reported strong sales coming into the holidays.
Yesterday, shoppers, starved by the lack of across-the-board discounting at major retailers before Christmas, packed stores advertising early-bird specials. At Saks, a chain not known for discounts, the doors opened at 8 a.m. to welcome shoppers who had lined up for marked-down merchandise lowered by an additional 40 percent. 
By 11 a.m., Kimiko Takioka, 21, and her mother, Noriko Takioka, 51, who were shopping on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, were already clutching three big red Saks bags, which contained, among other things, three pairs of Ferragamo shoes. "They were $350, $400 for all of them," said Kimiko Takioka, an au pair in Philadelphia. "In Tokyo, they are $600 a pair."
"Yes, yes, bargains," added her mother, who was visiting the United States for the first time.
At the flagship Macy's store in Herald Square, crowds fingered everything from cappuccino makers to T-shirts, much of it marked down 50 percent.
The retail winners, some of them surprising, that emerged yesterday included Sharper Image; Chico's, which markets clothing with a bit of pizazz to baby-boomer women; and Amazon.com. Chico's and Sharper Image raised their earnings estimates.
Partly because snowstorms blanketed much of the Northeast during two valuable shopping weekends, consumers turned more to the Internet and to catalog sellers like L.L. Bean for their gifts. One analyst said L.L. Bean and Lands' End, the catalog merchant owned by Sears, Roebuck, both set records in the five days before Christmas -- as did QVC, a cable television shopping show owned by Liberty Media -- but no one was available at the companies to confirm that yesterday.
As for online sales, the National Retail Federation predicted yesterday that they would increase to $95.6 billion for the full year from $75.7 billion in 2002, giving the category 5 percent to 7 percent of total retail spending. Last year, online apparel sales were 28 percent higher than they were in 2001; this year, they were 54 percent higher than in 2002, according to the group.
The federation, based in Washington, defended its estimate for a 5.7 percent overall increase, which has been criticized by some analysts as too generous. The federation's estimate includes sales through the last week of December, which some others do not, said Ellen Tolley, a spokeswoman.
"It also includes the Internet, small independent stores and stores that might not report comp-store sales," she said, referring to the industry yardstick that compares this year's sales to last year's in stores open at least a year.
Yesterday, the NPD Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y., repeated its forecast for 3.5 percent growth. Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm, is also holding at 3.5 percent -- partly because prices of electronic equipment like flat-panel televisions and CD players have come down so much from last year.
"Three and a half percent this year would have translated to 5 to 6 percentage growth at last year's prices," said Philip Kowalczyk, a managing director at Kurt Salmon. Mr. Kowalczyk added that even the apparel merchants charged less for similar items than last year, trying to avoid excess inventory.
Representatives from both NPD and Kurt Salmon said their estimates of 3.5 percent growth were based on the same guidelines as the federation's.
Everyone will have to wait to know whose estimate was closer, at least until the first week of January, when the major retailers announce their December sales results.
Mike Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers, predicted yesterday that this weekend could bring a retail resurgence -- particularly if the weather is good. "Look for a second wave," he said.

U.S. Races to Trace Roots Of Diseased Dairy Cow
Federal authorities said that it could take weeks or months to trace where a dairy cow in Washington State with the nation's first case of mad cow disease was born.
 Finding the birthplace and the so-called birth herd of the diseased Holstein dairy cow, which was slaughtered Dec. 9, are crucial to determining whether other animals may have also contracted mad cow disease. The disease, a degenerative brain ailment, is thought to take at least four years to incubate. Page A1. 

The discovery of mad cow disease continued to roil the cattle markets and the beef industry as the prices of live cattle and stock in meat processors were pummeled for a second day. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures for delivery in February fell 3 cents, to 86.175 cents a pound, after the normal limit of 1.5 cents a pound was doubled for the day because of the crisis. A14.

The emergence of a case of mad cow disease in the United States has created an unparalleled opportunity for Brazil and Argentina, two of the main competitors of the United States in the booming international beef export market, to capture new foreign customers. A14.

HEADLINE: Some Doctors Letting Patients Skip Co-Payments 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
For years, health plans have sought to control medical costs by negotiating fees with a group of preferred doctors and requiring patients to pay extra for going outside the network. But some doctors and clinics -- eager to help hard-pressed patients or calculating that it can benefit their business -- have begun to foil the cost-control efforts by waiving those extra charges.
 The move by these providers to dispense with collecting what are known as coinsurance payments comes as employers and insurers try to discourage overuse of health care by making patients pay more costs from their own pockets. But those efforts -- and the squeeze on doctors as health plans shrink payments for in-network care -- are generating resistance, experts say. 
 Health plan members are "going out of network for surprisingly expensive medical services," said Tom Farley, who audits managed care plans across the country for the Towers Perrin consulting firm. That behavior suggests "some sort of tacit agreement between the provider and the patient to not bill for some of those out-of-pocket expenses," he said.
Dr. Michael O. Fleming, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said that doctors' efforts to find ways around the insurers' cost-control strategies are "a reaction to the ratcheting down of managed care fees."
Doctors are waiving coinsurance payments for several reasons, analysts say: to recruit patients who would otherwise go to doctors on a health plan's preferred list; to help people struggling with the cost of care, and to reduce their own costs for processing insurance paperwork and dunning patients who are slow to pay.
These doctors can afford to pass up the payments because the out-of-network fees they collect from insurers often are higher than those they would collect as members of a health plan's network.
Dr. Herbert Dardik, chief of vascular surgery at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in New Jersey, scorns collecting co-payments. "I look at it as a demeaning process," he said. "I tell my secretary upfront, if there's any issue, just forget it." 
While most doctors still work within managed care networks, waiving patients' payments appears to be most prevalent in the Northeast, South Florida, the West Coast and the upper Midwest -- "areas that are saturated with managed care," Dr. Fleming said.
In 2003, more than half of workers faced co-payments of 30 percent or more of the fees charged for visits to out-of-network doctors, according to a September report by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The average out-of-pocket costs, including co-payments and other charges, for employees of large companies doubled in the last five years, to $2,126, and are expected to jump another 22 percent next year, Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm, reported recently.
From the health plans' perspective, moves by providers to waive the payments are "exactly what managed care plans are supposed to protect against," Mr. Farley said. "The physicians can go back to practicing without constraints," he said, for example ordering more tests and procedures.
For out-of-network care, doctors at the Alliance Surgical Group in Morristown, N.J., ask patients to pay any deductible owed under terms of their health plan, a sum that can be as much as several thousand dollars, according to Dr. David Ward, a member of the group. But they do not press for payment if a patient cannot pay a follow-up bill for 20 percent or 30 percent coinsurance. "The deductible could be the whole bill," Dr. Ward said. He does general surgery and specializes in bariatric procedures for people who are obese.
Not surprisingly, patients are pleased. "I was amazed that these doctors do not come after the patient demanding the uncovered costs," said Lauren Dasylva, one of Dr. Ward's patients, in a statement she posted on a patient support Web site. "I think that is a testimony to why they do this surgery, I am convinced that they have a heart." 
But patients who choose an out-of-network plan run the risk of paying more than if they selected one of their health plan's preferred providers, said Randy Kammer, a vice president of Florida Blue Cross and Blue Shield. "There is no obligation for an out-of-network physician not to balance bill," she said, using the term for collecting charges in excess of those approved by the health plan.
Regularly waiving co-insurance payments or co-pays -- the $10 or $20 payments many plans impose for office visits -- is against the rules in the government Medicare and Medicaid programs. A few states -- Colorado, Georgia, Nevada, South Dakota and Texas -- also prohibit the practice for patients covered by commercial insurance, according to Dennis M. Barry, a Washington lawyer who studies health care reimbursement issues.
Colorado and Georgia also forbid advertising the waivers to attract business. A handful of states have banned the waiver of co-payments and deductibles by dentists and chiropractors. And Ohio prohibits routine waivers of co-payments, but not deductibles, by physicians, pharmacists, psychologists, physical therapists, nurses and optometrists, according to a survey published last month by Mr. Barry and Lori Mihalich.
Waiving payments for indigent patients or to placate those who have complaints about their treatment "should not pose legal issues," however, they said.
A policy statement by the American Medical Association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs says that "physicians should forgive or waive the co-payment" if it would pose "a barrier to needed care because of financial hardship." The statement warns, though, that "routine forgiveness or waiver of co-payments may constitute fraud under state and federal law."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Indexes Post Gains, but Meat Companies Are Hit Again

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks finished higher on Wall Street yesterday as investors picked up bargains in an abbreviated post-Christmas session. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced for a fifth consecutive week.
 Despite the over all market gains, stocks of companies that process or sell meat took a further beating on news of the nation's first case of mad cow disease. 
 The Dow industrials rose 19.48 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 10,324.67. It was up 0.5 percent for the week. 
Broader stock indicators also gained. The S.&P. 500 index advanced 1.85 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,095.89, for a gain of 0.7 percent for the week. The Nasdaq composite index was up 3.91 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,973.14 and was up 1.1 percent for the week.
Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee, said the advance appeared to be the continuation of a "Santa Claus rally" that had bolstered stocks in recent days. "Wednesday's news about mad cow disease had kind of taken the wind out of the sails," he said, noting that most of the selling Wednesday was in companies that process or sell beef and beef products.
"The market today is bouncing back from that," he said, "though volume is really light so you don't want to read alot into it."
Investors responded to reports from retailers that Christmas sales were up modestly. Wal-Mart Stores rose 8 cents, to $52.52, after it said last-minute holiday sales were good, although not good enough to lift sales growth at stores open more than a year above the low end of its projected range of 3 percent to 5 percent. 
Sharper Image rose $2.42, to $32.39. The company, the San Francisco-based specialty retailer, raised its fourth-quarter earnings estimates. 
Amazon.com, the online seller, reported its best holiday season ever, and its shares advanced 15 cents, to $53.47.
Confirmation that a Holstein cow in Washington State had the deadly mad cow disease continued to depress the stocks of companies in the meat industry, which suffered widespread losses on Wednesday. But restaurant shares staged a bit of a recovery.
Jack Caffrey, vice president and an equity strategist for J.P. Morgan Private Bank, said investors were making a distinction between processors, which may face higher testing and distribution costs for beef in the near term, and restaurants, which typically have diversified menus. "You can go to Wendy's for the chicken, the salad and other things, too," Mr. Caffrey said.
He said that he expected to see "more differentiation of results."
While processors may be the first to face higher costs in dealing with mad cow fallout, those costs eventually could be passed on and affect the profits of restaurants and food retailers. Tyson Foods fell 31 cents, to $12.59, after Morgan Stanley cut its investment rating to equal weight from overweight and cut its profits outlook. 
ConAgra Foods dropped 12 cents, to $26.01, while Smithfield Foods was down 24 cents at $21.91. 
McDonald's, a Dow index component hit hard in Wednesday selling, opened down but later rose, gaining 13 cents on the day and closing at $24.09. Wendy's International rose 20 cents, to $37.99.
Companies that specialize in meat purification processes gained. Bio-Rad Laboratories of Hercules, Calif., which sells diagnostic instruments was up $2.33, or nearly 4 percent, to $62.15. Bio-Rad is the leading provider of tests for mad cow disease worldwide.
Shares in Biopure of Cambridge, Mass., fell 39 cents, to $2.43, after the company, which is the developer of an artificial blood product, said it expected civil charges against it by the Securities and Exchange Commission over disclosure of its communications with drug regulators.
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note jumped 9/32, to a price of 10025/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 4.15 percent from 4.19 percent Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 9/32, to 106. The bond's yield fell to 4.97 percent from 5 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: 2003's Most Overrated and Underrated Ideas; 
Omnipresent Overachievers . . .

BYLINE:  Emily Eakin and Felicia R. Lee compiled the responses. 

 BODY:
At the end of each year, Arts & Ideas asks a handful of writers, scholars and other opinionated people to identify the year's most underrated and overrated ideas.
 Contributors may choose any subject they please, from designer chocolate to extreme makeovers, but most pick Big Concepts like religion, money or politics. 
 If you find yourself outraged by the suggestion that monotheism is overrated or baffled by the possibility that hip-hop politics is underrated, please send your own candidates to ideas@nytimes.com.
Emily Eakin and Felicia R. Lee compiled the responses.

Beauty
An essential component of beauty is being undermined and will soon be practically eliminated, and that is scarcity. Botox is to cosmetics what cut-and-paste software is to music production. Whatever was precious five minutes ago becomes overbearingly omnipresent five minutes from now. The quest for beauty coupled with technological proficiency undermines the relative value of each beautiful invention. Find beauty in nature, but when it comes to culture, it's time to forget beauty. It will soon be nothing more than another word for nostalgia.
 Jaron Lanier, a computer scientist, composer and virtual-reality pioneer.

Repeal of the Estate Tax
We pay taxes only because the alternative is worse: no taxes, no government; no government, no army. Among our myriad taxes, none is as efficient and painless as the estate tax. It's like a lawyer's contingency fee: injured parties who couldn't otherwise afford legal access can try to recover damages because lawyers are willing to forgo their fees unless they win. Similarly, the estate tax lets us
finance valuable public services with a surcharge that kicks in only if we end up among the wealthiest 1 percent. It also permits lower income-tax rates, encouraging effort and investment. It stimulates charitable giving, reducing the need for tax-financed public services. And a tax levied after death is surely less unpleasant than one collected from the living.
But if the estate tax is so great, why do 70 percent of surveyed voters favor the Bush administration's efforts to repeal it permanently? Perhaps this tax would fare better if pollsters began with a question like this: "If the estate tax were repealed, which other taxes should be increased, or which government services should be eliminated, to make up for the lost revenue?"
 Robert H. Frank, professor of economics at Cornell University and author of the forthcoming book "What Price the Moral High Ground?"

Monotheism
In their most extreme forms, monotheistic religions are deeply intolerant. If there is only one right way of doing things, every other way is wrong. If we are good, others are evil. By contrast, the ancient Greeks and Romans welcomed new gods into their pantheon and worshiped them alongside the old. They had no crusades or jihads. The Roman authorities threw Christians to the lions because they mistook the early Christians' intolerance for seditiousness. They did not seek to kill them because they rejected the Christians' God.
 Mary Lefkowitz, author of "Greek Gods, Human Lives: What We Can Learn From Myths."

Rapper Beefs
Long an aspect of hip-hop, battles between M.C.'s this year took on a marketing twist, as record labels and artists consciously tried to cash in on hip-hop drama. Beef was repackaged and sold to hip-hop consumers both in the form of a film bearing the name as well as in more transparent ways. The face-off between Ja Rule and 50 Cent culminated with an MTV lovefest featuring Ja Rule and Louis Farrakhan (with a conspicuously absent 50 Cent) on the eve of Ja Rule's album release. The enigmatic rapper Benzino, a k a Raymond Scott, who this year emerged as co-founder of the hip-hop bible The Source, kept alive a yearlong war of words with the white rapper Eminem by accusing him of stealing sales from black rappers. Unfortunately for reporters frantically in search of that special hip-hop moment to rival the East Coast-West Coast war of the 1990's, the beefs of 2003 came up short.
 Bakari Kitwana, author of "The Hip-Hop Generation: Young Blacks and the Crisis in African American Culture."

Public Intellectuals
Intellectuals and professors who write for a general audience are always valuable, but the idea of the "public intellectual" as a specific role is now well past its sell-by date. Being a public intellectual has degenerated from a calling to a career. Aspiring public intellectuals can now get a Ph.D. to prepare them for this academic market niche, and some enterprising professors have already added the term "public intellectual" to Web sites. In theory, the public intellectual could address any subject, even -- imagine! -- teaching and higher education; but public intellectual purists reserve the title for social critics who take an exclusively oppositional stance to political policies in general, and American foreign policy in particular. The public intellectuals' lack of accountability -- no bucks stop at their desks -- and their remoteness from the world of difficult, flawed, risky but necessary decision-making (the "tenured gadfly," as Richard Posner says in his updated "Public Intellectuals," is an oxymoron), makes their critical posture seem self-indulgent despite its virtue. Anybody can complain, blog and find fault; the real intellectual might try to solve problems.
 Elaine Showalter, professor of English emerita at Princeton University.

America
What Americans overrate most is -- America. They imagine that they live in the most democratic nation on earth, but in the United States, to a far greater extent than in many other democracies, electorates are shamelessly gerrymandered, the voting system squeezes out minor parties, Wyoming has as many senators as California, and money gives the rich a wildly disproportionate share of power and influence.
Americans think they are the freest people on earth, but the president keeps American citizens in detention for nearly two years without even allowing them to talk to a lawyer, let alone putting them on trial. And no one in America has the freedom of the Dutch to choose how they die, should they become incurably ill.
Americans also favor "American pre-eminence" -- the Hobbesian view that the United States ought to rule the world, simply because it has the military muscle to do so.
 Peter Singer, professor of bioethics at Princeton University.

Straussianism
Last spring it suddenly became fashionable to assign blame (or, if you prefer, credit) for the Iraq invasion to the University of Chicago political theorist Leo Strauss. A bevy of articles explicated Strauss ideas (often inaccurately) and traced his influence among neoconservative policymakers -- including Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, a former student of his, who was deemed (again inaccurately) the architect of the invasion. 
In fact, Strauss wasn't mainly concerned with geopolitics; his cult following stemmed from his frankly elitist brand of conservatism, which prized the study of classical philosophy and what he called an esoteric tradition of writing and teaching. More important, the major movers behind the war were not intellectuals but thoroughgoing political animals named Donald H. Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney and George W. Bush. 
 David Greenberg, author of "Nixon's Shadow: The History of an Image."

Capitalism
When Sitting Bull toured with Buffalo Bill's Wild West circus, he gave his earnings to the street urchins he met, appalled that a society that could produce such wealth could permit such poverty. He commented that white men were good at production but bad at distribution, a criticism of capitalism that's still trenchant. In the wealthiest society the world has ever seen, education, health care and housing are deteriorating into speculative commodities out of reach for many, and the "economic recovery" -- of what? for whom? -- is jobless. Capitalism and democracy are sometimes equated, but you only have to look at the Bush administration, with its passion for unfettered corporate privilege and loathing for civil liberties and public participation, to get over that fairy tale. Happily, it's not overrated everywhere; Latin Americans are looking for more humane models, from Argentines' surviving the collapse of their model neoliberal economy by creating community alternatives to Bolivians' ousting a president who tried to sell off the nation's natural gas, to the landless people's movement in Brazil. 
 Rebecca Solnit, author of "River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West."

Psychology
Psychologists and psychiatrists can do wonderful things. But these days you would think that there is no such thing as normal, thanks to the hand-in-glove working of the drug and insurance companies with the American Psychiatric Association, which publishes the handbook of 374 "mental illnesses." If you are still grieving a loved one's death two months later, you fit the category of "major depressive disorder." Insurance companies want you quickly fixed, drug companies have a pill for every occasion, and friends and family are too overworked to provide the irreplaceable support for grief that is present in other countries. We are damaging the nature of friendship, teaching people that they need experts to treat them for everything.
 Paula J. Caplan, Ph.D., author of 12 books about mental health and social issues, including "They Say You're Crazy: How the World's Most Powerful Psychiatrists Decide Who's Normal."

Metaphors
Metaphors have become the verbal equivalent of grade inflation. You are a goddess! Everyone is a hero! (Thanks to Joseph Campbell for that one). Gods were immortal, ageless and powerful; heroes were extraordinary. No ancient person would have made that mistake. There was only one Hercules.
 Mary Lefkowitz, author of "Greek Gods, Human Lives."

HEADLINE: Undaunted by Polls, Faithful Keep Edwards Banner Aloft 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: PORTSMOUTH, N.H., Dec. 23 

 BODY:
Their candidate's gray minivan had just departed. The "Edwards for President" yard signs that nobody wanted were restacked on the dirty linoleum floor of the former shoe repair shop turned campaign office.
 An hour earlier, the small cluster of people in Portsmouth who feel passionately that Senator John Edwards should be the next president was euphoric. They listened to him speak at the packed Friendly Toast restaurant, applauding his positions on health care and jobs. Now, as they sat on the office's tattered puce couch and peeled campaign stickers off sweaters, their high was tinged with forlornness. Polls indicate that if the New Hampshire primary were held this month, Mr. Edwards would get at most 7 percent of the vote, putting him fourth. 
 "Seeing him today helped because it recaptures the feeling I had when I first saw him," said Connie Williams, a retired psychotherapist who is writing letters and making calls. "But it is discouraging. If he could only come across as more forceful, I think he'd have a chance." 
Nine candidates are in the crowded Democratic field, and behind each underdog candidate is a band of these devoted supporters who provide the fuel that keeps the campaign process going. They lick envelopes, organize rallies and harass neighbors to come out and vote. It is a mostly thankless task, carried out by idealists and optimists who take heart if they convert a single supporter in an afternoon of knocking on doors.
Here in Portsmouth, a core crew of about a dozen Edwards supporters vowed to march on despite polls showing their candidate in the middle of the pack, far behind Howard Dean, and garnering only 4 percent to 6 percent in national surveys. But his workers were hopeful that the unexpectedly large crowd of 150 at the Friendly Toast indicated that there were still many undecided votes to be had.
Luke Shulman, 18 and a freshman at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., is spending his winter break at home to work in Mr. Edwards's office here. He keeps a picture of himself with Mr. Edwards on top of his computer -- he has sent it to all of his friends -- and said it kept him going when he was feeling low. "Absolutely, this gets discouraging, we are not blind to the polls," said Mr. Shulman, whose enthusiasm for the senator is nearly palpable. "I think it shows that we have to work harder. I mean, people are looking for hope and vision. And I see that in John Edwards."
Despite the long odds, there is clearly a love affair between John Edwards and these supporters, a mysterious chemistry, and their passion cannot transfer elsewhere. 
"This is a cause, not a job, and that is why I'm 1,000 miles from my girlfriend -- there's no other candidate who I'd do this for," said Paul Dunn, a former investment banker in Illinois who moved here to be Mr. Edwards's local coordinator. "This is not a horse race, about who's first and who's second. It's about issues like kids needing health care. It's about a belief that elections matter and that John Edwards can do this job better than anyone else.
Despite their convictions, all of the Edwards volunteers in Portsmouth said they would vote for another Democrat if someone else won the party's nomination. "The first priority is defeating George Bush, and I could switch my vote if there was a front-runner," said Ms. Williams, the retired psychotherapist. "But I've never been politically active before and don't think I could work for anyone else, and that's a real quandary."
One of the die-hards is Francis A. Ford, a court clerk in Worcester County, Mass., who took the day off this week and drove 100 miles to Portsmouth to hold up an "Edwards for President" placard on the sidewalk outside the Friendly Toast's front door. 
"I know how this is a critical ingredient, holding up a sign, talking to people, and it is frequently overlooked when manpower is short," said Mr. Ford, impeccably dressed in a suit and tie and lifting his sign high.
It was his fourth visit to New Hampshire. He believes that Mr. Edwards can unite the country and that his economic recovery programcan return some of the nearly three million jobs lost during the Bush administration. But while campaign workers for the leading candidates are encouraged by cheering crowds, Mr. Ford must be content with little gestures.
"Today, when I held up my sign, there were a few people who gave me the thumbs up or tooted their horn," he said hopefully. "That's new, and I think people are just starting to tune in. I think the momentum's growing."
Mr. Edwards, 50, a moderate Democrat from North Carolina, has the kind of profile that should put him in good stead with the backbone of the Democratic Party. A lawyer before he became a senator five years ago, the youthful, telegenic candidate comes from a working-class background, his father having worked in a mill. 
Mr. Edwards voted for the resolution to invade Iraq but against the president's request for money to occupy and rebuild Afghanistan and Iraq because he felt the Bush administration's goals were unclear. His platform is filled with carefully articulated programs to assist middle-class workers, including a plan that would provide health care for every child, a financial package that would allow every qualified teenager to attend college and economic incentives to draw back jobs that have gone overseas. 
To supporters, it is an exasperating mystery that he has not fared better. Does he come across as too young? Too inexperienced in national politics?
Once when Mr. Edwards spoke in New Hampshire, Allan Lurvey, a psychologist and an enthusiastic campaign worker, invited 12 friends to attend. Only one became a supporter. "They just didn't see what I saw," Dr. Lurvey said with a shrug.
Elissa and Tim Stone, who are holding a party for Mr. Edwards next week, are serious about Democratic politics and defeating President Bush. They "looked at the strengths and weaknesses of all the candidates" and chose Mr. Edwards, both because they thought that as a Southerner he was eminently electable and because they liked his ideas. 
"I think if people gave him a close look they would like what they saw," said Mr. Stone, who like his wife is an environmental consultant. "But, when I say to my mother in Long Island that we are hearing John Edwards and she replies, 'Who?' well, that's pretty tough to hear." 
Working for the underdog is not the domain of pragmatists but of people obsessed with ideas. 
Mr. Shulman, the Tufts freshman, said he was drawn to the candidate's policies, but also to his character. 
Mr. Shulman makes calls, hands out fliers and -- though he hates it -- canvasses door to door. He was recently buoyed when he knocked on a door and found an enthusiastic supporter. That is not the norm. Perhaps it is such moments of hope that have convinced Mr. Shulman that support in his hometown is growing for Mr. Edwards. He said that each time he had volunteered in the office recently, undecided voters had come in to find out more. 
It is the kind of work that gives underdogs a chance.
"People like us, our job is to fight like hell for our candidates," said Mr. Dunn, the former banker. "Look, I will work for a year, and then people will go into a booth and make their decision in 30 seconds. My job is to make sure they know about Senator Edwards."

HEADLINE: China Removes Tariffs on 5 Kinds of Steel 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
China, the world's largest steel consumer, removed import tariffs on five types of steel products Friday, three weeks after President Bush ended American tariffs on steel. 
 The Chinese tariffs, of as much as 23 percent, were imposed on some types of hot- and cold-rolled steel, stainless steel and other steel products in November last year after the United States imposed its own tariffs in March 2002, to protect steel makers like U.S. Steel and Nucor. Mr. 
Bush lifted the tariffs on Dec. 4 after they were declared illegal by the World Trade Organization. 
 In Tokyo, shares of JFE Holdings, Nippon Steel and other Japanese steel makers surged on optimism that China's decision would help them increase sales in China, the world's fastest-growing steel market. 
In the United States, shares of U.S. Steel, AK Steel and Nucor also rose after the tariffs were removed. 
"It's good news that the China market has been opened," said Kaoru Yamakawa, a spokesman at Sumitomo Metal Industries, Japan's third-largest steel maker. "In the long run, this tendency will be welcomed by all steel making companies."
Rising demand for steel in China, which consumes about a quarter of the world's production, has caused shortages of almost all steel products and has led to higher prices, the China Steel Corporation of Taiwan said last month. China's government has forecast that the economy will expand by about 8.5 percent this year, further raising steel demand in the country.
"China has greatly contributed to gains this year among some of the raw material stocks and that's going to continue into next year," said Kikuo Osone, who helps manage $7.1 billion at Fukoku Capital Management in Tokyo. Japan's steel makers are the world's biggest exporters of steel.

HEADLINE: As Tribe Plans Hotel for Casino, Niagara Falls Weighs Effects 

BYLINE:  By STACEY STOWE

 BODY:
After opening a casino in downtown Niagara Falls, N.Y., the Seneca Indian tribe will begin construction next spring of a $140 million hotel -- the tallest building in the city skyline -- as part of the gambling complex. 
 The hotel is to stand 26 floors high and have 600 rooms, including those reserved for high rollers, and a full-service spa. A top-floor lounge will have a view of the falls and of the Niagara Gorge. Construction should be completed in 16 months, said Mickey Brown, president and chief executive of Seneca Niagara Casino. 
 Luring tourists from Ontario, where the Rainbow Falls are more picturesque, to the New York side has never been easy. The Canadians poured money and attention into developing their natural wonder into an attraction, including opening a government-backed casino in 1996. Efforts to promote tourism on the New York side, however, have been rather wan, said Byron W. Brown, a state senator whose district includes Niagara Falls.
So far, the 88,000-square-foot Seneca Niagara Casino, which opened last year, has not inspired a building frenzy in the city, where a chemical and manufacturing industry once thrived. In the 1950's, as many as 100,000 people lived here. Today, the population is about 55,950, said Cynthia Baxter, the city clerk. About 700 of them work at the casino.
The state is expected to receive $40 million based on casino slot machine revenue. Under an agreement between the Seneca Nation and New York State, the state will receive 18 percent of the casino slot revenue from Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming Corporation, which operates the casino. The state is expected to allot the city of Niagara Falls 25 percent of that share or $10 million. The question is how the money will be spent and when it will arrive. A seven-member commission that includes the mayor and three members of the State Legislature, including Senator Brown, one of two nonvoting members, will decide how the money is apportioned.
But some elected officials and business owners are concerned that the new project could hurt downtown businesses and might not help revive its flagging property tax base.
Vince V. Anello, who will become mayor in January, said the city's casino allotment should be used to compensate for property tax revenue lost when the tribe built downtown; the 55-acre parcel owned by the Seneca Nation is exempt from taxes. The city's tax base has been declining for the past 30 years, he said. When he takes office, just $250,000 will be available to pay city expenses until property tax payments are collected. He noted that other commission members have said that all of the money should be spent on downtown redevelopment.
Mr. Anello, who said he was happy to have the casino and hotel downtown, noted that downtown businesses are somewhat in the shadow of the casino, which has its own bar and restaurant, and soon, a hotel.
"The people in Niagara Falls have been struggling for years," said Mr. Anello, who has lived here since 1956. "The casino was supposed to be the light at the end of the tunnel for downtown development." 
But Mr. Brown said those concerns were outside the scope of his casino, which he said brought five million people to Niagara Falls this year.
"We're not a social service agency," said Mr. Brown, who was president of Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut from 1992 to 1997. "I think we've made our contribution. It's up to them to work on private sector development."
Asked about another construction project on the horizon for the city, a state-financed $17 million conference center, Mr. Anello said flatly, "Another nonrevenue-producing project.

AMERICA WEST ANNOUNCES PLANS TO EXPAND WORK FORCE

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 America West Airlines said yesterday that it planned to hire more than 1,000, expanding its work force for the first time since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as part of a plan to increase the number of passengers carried next year by 10 percent. 
The hiring will increase the number of employees 7.7 percent from 13,000, said Janice Monaghan, a spokeswoman. America West also said that it would be adding four leased planes to its fleet. The airline, the nation's eighth largest, increased passenger traffic 7.3 percent in the first 11 months of 2003, joining low-fare airlines like Southwest Airlines in increasing business. America West shares rose 19 cents, to $11.62.

 THE TRUE AND OUTSTANDING ADVENTURES OF
THE HUNT SISTERS
By Elisabeth Robinson.
327 pp. Boston:
Little, Brown & Company. $23.95.
 Olivia Hunt has been working on her suicide note -- her fourth attempt, since she's having trouble getting the tone right. But in truth, Olivia's whole life feels like a rough draft. At 33, she's a Hollywood discard: unemployed, homeless (in a stylish, house-sitting sense), recently dumped and stalled on her pet project, producing a film version of "Don Quixote." 
Then her younger sister, Maddie, gets leukemia, and Olivia's life lurches forward. Panicked by the bad news, Olivia struggles to fix everything at once: her family, her love life, her movie. By turns pleading, bitter, resigned, romantic and businesslike, she shoots off a series of letters from the road, willing her world into order. It's a hopeless project, and an admirable one. Even in grief, Olivia's got a producer's instinct: the desire to micromanage the universe, to force something great out of the chaos.
A novel about Hollywood and cancer seems doomed to bathos, especially given that this epistolary narrative springs from the author's own life. (Elisabeth Robinson helped produce "Braveheart," and she nursed her own sick sister. What's more, like Olivia, she once worked on an adaptation of "Don Quixote" that she hoped would star John Cleese and Robin Williams.) And there are moments when "The Hunt Sisters" can feel uncomfortably like a big-screen tear-jerker, alternating streaks of sap and cynicism. But like the breakout sentimental best seller "The Lovely Bones," "The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters" is finally wryly effective, capturing the momentum of family sorrow, the ways in which people can care for each other without ever quite coming to terms.
Part of this is due to Olivia herself, who makes an appealingly flawed protagonist: she is sharply compassionate but also self-pitying and impatient, the sister everyone resents for having "gone Hollywood." She's critical of Los Angeles yet full of its values, using industry connections to get her sister a call from Bruce Springsteen. Olivia's worst critics each have a point: her married friend Tina, who wearies of Olivia's relationship melodrama; her corporate nemesis Josh, who accuses her of having "a superiority and an inferiority complex." But like Carrie Bradshaw in "Sex and the City," Olivia is lovable for her contradictions -- her generosity tinged by guilt, her intimacy-impaired romanticism and her peculiar amalgam of artistic dreaminess and pointy-elbowed careerism.
For anyone curious about Hollywood machinations, Robinson provides plenty of dish: there are weasel producers, macho screenwriters, dates with a thinly (which is to say not at all) disguised Steve Martin. On the set of "Don Quixote," Olivia fends off studio demands for a happy ending and a closing song by J.Lo. But unlike her hero, she's no raw idealist. Wooing Robin Williams ("a beaver in a sweatshirt and jeans") for the role of Sancho Panza, Olivia finagles with the best of them: "Robin can think it's about Rice Krispies," she reasons, "as long as he makes the movie."
But if these Hollywood outtakes are often scathingly funny, it's Maddie's medical struggle that dominates the story. Olivia flies back and forth endlessly, berating doctors and cajoling them, trying to be the good, responsible, affectionate sister she sometimes fears she has forgotten how to be. Such scenes of family desperation can feel at once wrenching and manipulative; perhaps there's no way to write about a serious illness without moments of "E.R."-style melodrama, and, however heartfelt, Olivia's musings on the meaning of life can feel familiar. But Robinson overcomes these obstacles with her gift for the small details: the "blue freckles" of injection bruises, the horror of watching one's sister become "a wild, frightened, hairless cat." 
And Maddie herself is no plaster saint. In her letters, Olivia struggles to capture her sister's persnickety individuality, her peculiar mix of party girl, Midwestern homemaker and critical idealist. Even in illness, Maddie urges Olivia on and needles her all at once, providing a cranky counterpoint to her sister's tendency to stew. "Just don't be gloomy or snotty," she warns Olivia. "Nobody likes that." In both her movie and her life, Olivia struggles to provide her sister and herself with an ideal ending -- a perfect moment that will satisfy everyone. But, finally, this book is a paean to the compromises made out of love: Olivia may be an unreliable narrator, but as a storyteller she comes through in the clutch.

HEADLINE: THE LIVES THEY LIVED; 
Birth of a Vacation

BYLINE:  By Walter Kirn; Walter Kirn, a frequent contributor to the magazine, is the author, most recently, of "Up in the Air," a novel.

 BODY:
Kemmons Wilson b. 1912
In hard-boiled novels of the 30's and 40's, the American highway is a sinister place lined with greasy spoons and fleabag tourist camps and populated by felons and fornicators whose original sin, it's suggested, is transience. The coffee cups in the cheap diners are smeared with lipstick, the bedsheets of the dimly lighted motels soiled by illicit embraces between strangers, and the truckers, traveling salesmen and painted ladies who make the road their home trail an odor of moral degradation. The atmosphere is blacktop noir, and carnality and corruption rule.
 Making this gloomy setting safe for families -- families on vacation, in station wagons, bound for Yellowstone or Yosemite -- was the personal mission of Kemmons Wilson. In 1951, while driving his brood from his home in Memphis to Washington, Wilson was offended and disgusted by the gritty accommodations along the way. He took the problem personally, but he set about solving it publicly -- by founding and then running Holiday Inn, the iconic chain of wholesome roadside lodgings that took its name, appropriately enough, from a Bing Crosby movie. 
 Like Walt Disney, who tamed the county fair and came up with the sanitized amusement park, and Ray Kroc of McDonald's, who standardized the burger joint, Wilson was a can-do visionary of the everyday. Such hygienic reformers were common at midcentury, and their love of clean surfaces and predictability re-engineered our landscape and our culture in a manner that highbrow social critics found ominous and middle-class moms and dads found liberating. As homogeneity triumphed over seediness and the shadows gave way to a uniform fluorescence, America's children were finally free to play in places they formerly didn't dare set foot in, and at prices their parents could afford. Men like Wilson, it might even be said, helped invent the postwar families they sought to serve by building them a stage.
The Holiday Inn was a brilliant social technology, changing human behavior on a large scale without coercion or manipulation. The notion that families could pile into a car with coolers and coloring books and atlases and drive a thousand miles across the country, not in some "Grapes of Wrath"-style forced migration but simply to have fun, only made sense with Wilson's guarantee of certain amenities along the way: swimming pools, child-friendly restaurants, bedbugless mattresses and so on. So what if the places had no soul? Soul is a luxury of the well rested, and grouchy, exhausted travelers can't afford it, especially when they're traveling with kids.
The long-distance car vacation was born, a peculiar family ritual whose manifold consequences are unknowable. Still, it's interesting to speculate. The baby boomers and their parents who were the hotel chain's first generation of customers aged into people whose willingness to move -- from city to city, state to state and opportunity to opportunity -- was an engine of major demographic change. By the millions they abandoned the chilly North and crowded into the air-conditioned South. In droves they set out under cloudy Eastern skies bound for clear and sunny California. The prospect of relocation didn't frighten them -- perhaps because Wilson's bright, antiseptic inns had taught them the unconscious lesson that wherever one goes one can land in the same place and count on similar comforts. Staying in Holiday Inns had proved to them that regional differences needn't be a factor in the geographical pursuit of happiness.
Wilson may have flattened the cultural landscape, but he also widened its horizons. His ice machines, spotless bathrooms and smiling clerks made wanderlust safe and economical and helped reinforce an abiding appetite, especially among the young, for self-discovery along the road. He blazed a great trail for suburban pioneers, the Davy Crockett of the Interstates.

The Plays And Players Of the Year

BYLINE:  By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
 1. VANESSA REDGRAVE, 'LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT' -- As the morphine-addicted mother in Eugene O'Neill's masterpiece, she went way out on a limb and took us all with her.

2. DONNA MURPHY, 'WONDERFUL TOWN' -- Absolute blissful perfection.

3. KEVIN KLINE, 'HENRY IV' -- With his fine-grained portrait of Falstaff in the superb Lincoln Center Theater revival, he found far more than ham in Shakespeare's porcine hedonist.

4. BERNADETTE PETERS, 'GYPSY' -- Redefining both a classic character (Mama Rose) and her own adorable image, she gave the gutsiest musical performance of the year.

5. TONYA PINKINS, 'CAROLINE, OR CHANGE' -- As a Southern maid in 1963 in this musical economics lesson from Tony Kushner and Jeanine Tesori, she finds a dazzling ferocity in self-repression.

6. EDDIE IZZARD, 'A DAY IN THE DEATH OF JOE EGG' -- The year's No. 1 crossover performance by a cross-dresser. Mr. Izzard, who wore fishnet stockings for "Sexie," his scintillating one-man show, proved himself equally at home in trousers as the attention-hungry schoolteacher in the revival of Peter Nichols's wrenching drama.

7. NED BEATTY, 'CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF' -- Let others debate his offstage etiquette. As Tennessee Williams's Big Daddy, he is a life-affirming expert in bad manners.

8. KRISTIN CHENOWETH, 'WICKED' -- Her skill, sparkle and high-sheen soprano gave depth and contours to the year's most superficial heroine, Glinda the Good Witch.

9. HUGH JACKMAN, 'THE BOY FROM OZ' -- As the singer Peter Allen in this bathetic bio-musical, he drew blood from papier-mache and confirmed his status as a serious musical star.

10. DENIS O'HARE, 'TAKE ME OUT' -- As an accountant in love with baseball in Richard Greenberg's Tony-winning play, this actor's actor infected even nonsports fans with his character's galloping enthusiasm.

11. AIDAN GILLEN, 'THE CARETAKER' -- Making his Broadway debut in the smallest role in this lukewarm revival, he demonstrated that silence in Pinterland is worth a thousand spoken threats and snatched the show from his more famous co-stars (Patrick Stewart, Kyle MacLachlan).

12. MELANIE GRIFFITH, 'CHICAGO' -- Taking over the role of the narcissistic Roxie Hart, she proved you don't have to be able to sing or dance to dominate a musical. Let's just hope this isn't a trend.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Fairfield County; 
In a Clouded Market, Is the Economy a Silver Lining?

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
COMMERCIAL real estate brokers in lower Fairfield County, looking back on a disappointing 2003, are divided between those who foresee a brighter new year and those who doubt there will be much short-term improvement. Vacancy rates remain high, rents are down and a succession of corporate relocations have hurt the market. 
 While optimism is rising on reports of a recovering economy, "there isn't a whole host of robust proof," said Ed Tonnessen, executive vice president at Albert B. Ashforth Inc. "It's circumstantial, in people's bones." 
 Asking rents for first-class space are beginning to move above $70 a square foot a year in Central Greenwich, he noted, but have slumped to the high $20's and low $30's from $40 peaks in Stamford. "There is not enough activity to raise all boats," he said, "although companies are more willing to make commitments now than they were a year ago.' 
Stamford's position as the commercial hub of the state, with a downtown remade into an entertainment center, is being increasingly threatened by traffic gridlock and the high cost of living, said Dean J. Shapiro, senior managing director of CB Richard Ellis. 
Big out-of-state companies are going to Westchester, not Fairfield, he said. "Twenty years ago we saw corporate migration from the city to Fairfield," he said. "Now the market is different. We don't see corporations moving lock, stock and barrel, but only moving portions of their operations."
"Clearly, there is a push eastward," Mr. Shapiro said, to Trumbull and Shelton, where rents are lower, employees can find affordable housing and commuting is less frustrating.
Scott Landis, head of the Landis Group, which owns 400 Atlantic Street in Stamford, has 195,000 square feet for sublease as a result of the 10-year lease that American Express took in the building after the Sept. 11 attack. It subsequently vacated most of the space by October 2002 to return to Manhattan. The 510,000-square-foot building has six tenants, he said, including American Express, UBS, International Paper's global headquarters and the United States headquarters of Abbey National Treasury Services.
Unlike Stamford, Mr. Shapiro said, "Greenwich avoids being impacted because it fills space quickly." But even Greenwich now seems less immune to economic vagaries.
"IN the last two or three weeks, the Greenwich market has done a 180-degree turnaround," said John Goodkind, managing principal at the Greenwich office of Newmark & Company Real Estate. On top of a third-quarter vacancy rate of 11.1 percent, he said, more than half a million square feet of space have returned to the market in the fourth quarter.
Unilever, the consumer products company, will leave 126,000 square feet in three Greenwich buildings and consolidate in Trumbull; A.I.G. at Greenwich Plaza is consolidating in Wilton: Quebecor World (USA) is moving from The Mill; FactSet Data Systems and other tenants are moving out of Greenwich Plaza, Greenwich Office Park, 1 Fawcett Place and 165 Mason Street, leaving spaces of 20,000 to 66,000 square feet. 
Andor Asset Management, a hedge fund adviser, never moved into 146,000 square feet it leased last year at the Greenwich American Center and wants to sublet. The sprawling landscaped former American Can headquarters was a pioneer corporate campus. But the company moved out in the mid 1980's, and in the early 1990's the site was adapted for use by multiple tenants. 
On the upside, the center gained a 123,074-square-foot lease by the Amaranth Group, and Ziff Brothers Investments has leased 61,177 square feet at 55 Railroad Avenue.
In Norwalk, Gibbs College and Tauck Tours have taken a total of 117,115 square feet at the handsomely restored Norden Building, and GE Commercial Finance took 221,000 square feet at Merritt 7. The 1.2 million-square-foot former Union Carbide headquarters in Danbury reduced its vacant space to 329,000 square feet by leasing 229,000 square feet to Boehringer Engleheim Pharmaceuticals.
Like the Greenwich American Center, the building that Unilever will leave at 33 Benedict Place in Greenwich is a piece of the town's history. Built in the early 70's to be fully occupied by Chesebrough Pond's, it was a harbinger of the corporate exodus from New York. In 1986, Unilever purchased Chesebrough and its 233,575-square-foot building for $3.1 billion. The building will be marketed in the first quarter of 2004.
Unilever has broken ground for a 72,000-square-foot, $20 million addition to a similar-sized building it owns in the Trumbull Industrial Park, where it has several other sites. Eventually, it will employ some 1,500 workers, about one-third coming from its New Jersey and Greenwich locations. They will occupy a total of 403,000 square feet of Unilever space, according to Katherine Beyer, public relations manager for Unilever United States in New York. 
Leasing activity is concentrated almost entirely within Fairfield County and its existing buildings produced a variety of third-quarter statistics. 
Greenwich's available space was put at 16 percent by Grubb & Ellis, or 652,900 square feet out of a total of 4.08 million square feet, not including the recent rash of fourth-quarter vacancies. Average asking rentals were $48 a square foot annually. CB Richard Ellis's figures showed a rise in vacancies from 9.7 percent last year to a third-quarter rate of 15.5 percent this year, with rents around $42. 
CB Richard Ellis puts Stamford's vacancy rate at 16.3 percent, up from 16.1 percent in the second quarter. Stamford has a total of 16.9 million square feet of office space, with asking rents averaging $28.59. Third-quarter figures from Grubb & Ellis show a 20.8 percent vacancy rate, with 2.8 million square feet available as direct or sublet space out of a total of 12.75 million square feet, with rents at $34.48. 
"It's a difficult time for Stamford," said Kim Mowers, senior vice president at Grubb & Ellis, "in that availability is increasing in all its markets -- the central business district, and North and South Stamford. There doesn't seem to be job growth now or maybe not until a year or two out. One good thing is the pressure downward on rents and total landlord packages, giving businesses an opportunity to reduce their real estate costs." 
The vacancy rate in Norwalk, according to Grubb & Ellis, was 27.4 percent, with 1.3 million square feet available out of 4.7 million square feet, while CB Richard Ellis put Norwalk vacancies at 22 percent, up from 18.6 percent in the second quarter, on a total of 5.4 million square feet. Rents range from $25 to $30. 
Norwalk is now regarded as the third most desirable location after Greenwich and Stamford, its status best illustrated by Diageo, the global wine and liquor company, which is leaving Stamford to establish its American headquarters at Merritt on the River in Norwalk when its 275,000-square-foot building is completed next year. 
While leasing is stagnant, buildings for sale remain attractive to investors, said Jeffrey Dunne, vice chairman at CB Richard Ellis. "People continue to want to invest in real estate given the alternative, even though the stock market has been doing quite well," he said. 
Mr. Dunne's Connecticut deals this year included State House Square, an 845,000-square-foot building in downtown Hartford that the Aetna Insurance Company sold to the Harbor Group of Norfolk, Va., for $66 million. It is 92 percent leased.
"There is a lot of interest in Hartford," Mr. Dunne said. "This was the city's biggest deal in 20 years and by someone who never invested a nickel there before. The larger the deal, the more it attracts out-of-state capital."
NEW YORK-BASED George Comfort, a first-time buyer in Fairfield County, bought High Ridge Office Park in Stamford for $85 million. Cadbury-Schweppes, a longtime resident of the park, is moving to Rye Brook as part of a company consolidation in the spring. Early next year Mr. Dunne will be selling Osprey House, an 85,000-square-foot consortium-owned building at 1 Weaver Street in Greenwich. J.W.M. Partners, Omnicom and Blyth Industries are its principal tenants. 
In Greenwich, the sale of 80 Field Point Road, a 30,000-square-foot building designed by Philip Johnson, this month brought $19.8 million, or $600 a square foot. Peter Brant, head of Brant-Allen Industries of Greenwich, was the seller, and the Mannheim Group of Germany the buyer. Tenants include a variety of financial companies and a branch of the law firm of Robinson & Cole, based in Hartford. 
FOR more than a decade, Equity Office of Chicago has been the largest commercial property owner in Stamford, with 1.8 million square feet in seven of the city's most prestigious buildings: 177 Broad Street, 300 Atlantic Street, the offices at Canterbury Green and 1, 2, 3 and 4 Stamford Place.
"That's 30 percent of the market," said Thomas Bakke, regional vice president for Equity. "Year-end leasing is 10 percent off normal."
But, he added, "We're bullish on Stamford and we'd like to expand there, but there's not a lot of trading going on." Mr. Bakke described the climate as improving. "Remember," he said, "office is a lagging business behind the economy."

HEADLINE: THEATER: THE LOWS; 
Iffy Scores and a Shortage of Lust

 BODY:
 Ben Brantley and Bruce Weber saw innumerable productions last year, some of which they were eager to forget. In conversation, they recalled the worst of the lot.

BRANTLEY -- There was a lot of blood spilled this season -- not so much by the critics as by the productions themselves. It wasn't a boring season. There was a lot of energy, a lot of it misplaced, a lot of it diffuse. But there was something kind of fascinating about the spectacle. I was occasionally appalled, but I can't say I was ever bored.

WEBER -- It certainly seemed to be the busiest fall in years.

BRANTLEY -- Which says something about dubiously flush economic times. It's been a year that tested star power and its consequences at the box office: who's a star and who's not.

WEBER -- Antonio Banderas "Nine" is and John Stamos is not.

BRANTLEY -- Right.

WEBER -- The other thing -- and I think this has to do with the economic times -- is that there were a number of productions that showed up on Broadway that seemed to me to be quite cynical----

BRANTLEY -- I agree.

WEBER -- Put there to establish a pedigree that could then be taken out on the road, or taking advantage of an inexpensive production to try to make a quick killing. The Polly Bergen-Mark Hamill show "Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks" had no business even being in New York. It was community theater fare. I do not believe that producers are so blind as to say, "We have a Broadway-quality play." I think they very cynically say, "Put it up on Broadway and we can sell it on the road and call it the Broadway smash."

BRANTLEY -- In an odd way I found "The Retreat From Moscow" a cynical proposition. It is a minor domestic drama that doesn't say much but is encrusted with a lot of poetic quotations that make it seem more literary than it is. It's capitalizing on that Anglophile audience. And, yes, it does have the wonderful Eileen Atkins, but even she didn't hold my attention.
And what about the current impulse that a show isn't legit unless you move it to Broadway? An honorable kind of defeat -- if you can put it that way -- is "Anna in the Tropics." It would have been much better in a more intimate production in a smaller theater not on Broadway. Instead, the actors are lined up across the stage in order to fill the space and project it. You made a good case for seeing "I Am My Own Wife" again, now that it has moved to Broadway, but I think I'd still rather see it in a smaller house.

WEBER -- I've got to say the proscenium did wonders for it.

BRANTLEY -- I never thought "Avenue Q" would transfer as nicely as it did. It didn't get lost in the John Golden and the puppets, in fact, are not bigger. It was a big year for puppets.

WEBER -- What does that say about the state of the American theater?

BRANTLEY -- Blame Julie Taymor.

WEBER -- One of the most frightening things about theater today is that there is almost no contemporary music on Broadway.

BRANTLEY -- "Wicked."

WEBER -- But "Wicked" is a mediocre score from a composer who is still writing in the same style as he was in the 70's. People have been saying this for a long time, but there isn't any contemporary show music, or at least there's very little that makes it to the stage.

BRANTLEY -- It's almost all pastiche. That's the fascination about contemporary music now. Tony Kushner's healthy dose of medicine, "Caroline, or Change," has a very sophisticated score by Jeanine Tesori. It reflects patterns of thought; it's very disjunctive. You hear klezmer, Motown, Mozart -- it's basically a collage. There are strains of "Porgy and Bess" and Samuel Barber's "Knoxville: Summer of 1915."
In Jeanine Tesori's case, she's not just coasting on audience memories and associations. Her work is also about how received music shapes our world and perceptions. The problem is it's not emotionally compelling because it deliberately keeps averting itself by shifting gears. There's something very brave about it, as I think there is about the show. But you leave not humming anything because nothing is sustained long enough. 

WEBER -- The last original score that we had of any note was "Urinetown."

BRANTLEY -- I liked the score for "Avenue Q."

WEBER -- That's fair enough.

BRANTLEY -- Of the new musicals that opened this year, the only ones that made much of an impression on me for their scores are "Avenue Q" and "Caroline, or Change." "Caroline," I think, is pitched at a much older audience -- it's for guilty liberals of a certain age. But "Avenue Q" is very smart in pitching itself to an audience that is under 40 and grew up to "Sesame Street." I think one of the composers said something like, the songs from "Sesame Street" were our musicals when we were growing up and these are the tunes that stick in our heads. The show was very canny in addressing that.

WEBER -- I agree about the score. And I think that's precisely what Broadway needs -- some kind of musical freshness. You walk down the street and you see Jerome Kern and Boy George and Peter Allen. And you think, "What year is this?" Music and musicals are what sells Broadway today, and yet what's being sold is really old-fashioned. There is enough composing talent out there, and a number of shows are in the pipeline. But we'll have to see if any new music can actually find a home on Broadway or whether in the future it will be jukebox musicals featuring the songs of John Lennon and Elvis.

BRANTLEY -- If you go back and look: Jerome Kern played with operetta, Stephen Sondheim recycled a lot. In fact, we should pay a moment of tribute to Stephen Sondheim and "Bounce," which was, for me, probably the biggest disappointment of the year. Yet stack it up next to "The Boy From Oz" and it's a masterpiece. But it just never ignited. And for all that work from someone who is truly the god of the American musical----

WEBER -- Although it's not one of Sondheim's towering scores, it's quite a good score.

BRANTLEY -- It's a decent score. There just was no energy in the telling of it.

WEBER -- It's as though they never found the story they wanted to tell.

BRANTLEY -- I guess you can't call it the young generation anymore, but we did have two musicals from authors in the same generation as Jeanine Tesori: Michael John LaChiusa's "Little Fish" and Ricky Ian Gordon's "My Life With Albertine." Both of which were very ruminative scores and somehow didn't translate into real theatrical oomph. "My Life With Albertine" was just misconceived. It was reaching too high. "Little Fish" was engaging on its own terms, but it never made an impact somehow. It was a short story essentially, and adapted from a short story.

WEBER -- Another thing missing on Broadway is genuine sex appeal. Aside from Jimmy Smits and Daphne Rubin-Vega in "Anna in the Tropics," I can't think of any other hot couples. I just went to "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and was disappointed. I would gladly watch Ashley Judd walk around in a slip any time, but she is not the picture of a smoldering, frustrated wife. And her co-star, Jason Patric, seems to go into a stupor whenever she's in the room. I went to "The Boy From Oz," having had everybody tell me that Hugh Jackman is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I saw a guy working his tail off, and I appreciated the performance, but he didn't do it for me.

BRANTLEY -- What impressed me most about Jackman's performance -- and I really hate the theater of dead celebrities as a general rule, where people do the most thorough impersonation they can -- is that without impersonating, he got a lot of what Allen projected on the stage: the loose shoulders, the gait and the idea of cruising the audience, which Allen would do. Peter Allen would have liked to look like Hugh Jackman -- in his dreams, of course. Nonetheless, Jackman made himself less attractive. To see him in the concert version of "Carousel" or in "Oklahoma!," he's a very virile Rodgers and Hammerstein hero. So it was a pretty interesting transformation.
In terms of transformations, John Patrick Shanley's "Dirty Story" -- the best topical play I saw Off Broadway -- was an ingenious way of dealing with something usually brought up in more conventional terms, like point-counterpoint debate. He presents the debate, but in such demonically subversive terms, you don't know what's going on until the end of the first act. And then it's as if you've been introduced to Israel and Palestine as the dysfunctional couple next door. It was very smart. But people didn't go see it.
"Omnium Gatherum" was a mess but I thought it worked because it was a mess -- it reflected the scramble of thoughts----

WEBER -- I'm still amazed at the people who were venomous about that play. I thought it was full of energy. All of us have had these conversations or worked them out in our heads -- and the play allowed us to see them in front of us in an instructive way. I'm disappointed that the show didn't find an audience.
BRANTLEY -- But the truly topical plays didn't. Most of what worked this year were charismatic performances in productions that didn't begin to measure up to them. So when you see a completely integrated ensemble, as in the revival of Lanford Wilson's "Fifth of July" by the Signature Theater Company or the current "Henry IV" by Lincoln Center Theater, the performers all give off so much energy -- they connect. They may not be at Kevin Kline's and Michael Hayden's level, but you feel they are in the same play. For me, honestly, that's so much better than any Shakespeare in the Park I've seen since George C. Wolfe's "Tempest." And you just think: this can be achieved. I saw a lot of good Shakespeare last summer in London. But this "Henry IV" was more compelling than even Nicholas Hytner's "Henry V."

WEBER -- I was very interested in the two David Edgar plays "Continental Divide" in Ashland, Ore. Just the whole idea of a British writer's take on American politics was absorbing. It was like watching election returns.

BRANTLEY -- That's a good way of putting it.

WEBER -- I don't think anyone is going to do it in New York.

BRANTLEY -- Not unless you've got Jim Carrey or Tom Hanks.
The most emotionally engaging Sept. 11 play I saw was "Make Love," in which Karen Finley presented herself as both Liza Minnelli and the spirit of New York. It wasn't an impersonation at all. She had 12 or so other men and women dressed up as Liza Minnelli on the stage. But it was a sense of New York City as a dancing lady who just kept getting knocked down and then getting up again. It had moments of real poetry almost in spite of itself, which wound up being very touching. 

WEBER -- I was disappointed in Boy George "Taboo" , who really can't sing anymore.

BRANTLEY -- But his was the only performance that got what was sinister about that world.

WEBER -- We did have Jackie Mason also.

BRANTLEY -- Yes, we did.

WEBER -- How does one say this? He exceeded? He under-ceeded?

BRANTLEY -- Transcended disappointment into its own category?

WEBER -- Thank you.

HEADLINE: Rezoning, and Redefining, Park Slope 

BYLINE:  By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
TEN years ago, when Karen Brenner first moved to Park Slope, she settled in a rented one-bedroom floor-through on Third Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. In 2001 she moved again. She bought a two-bedroom apartment in a newly built 36-unit condominium called Park Slope Estates on Second Street between Fifth and Fourth Avenues. 
 To outsiders that might not seem like a big change. Geographically, it isn't. But Park Slope residents long believed that housing down the slope from Fifth Avenue was much less desirable than housing on the more easterly blocks off Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Avenues as far as Prospect Park West at the park itself. Fifth Avenue was dismal as a commercial street, and it was a psychological boundary from the standpoint of housing value. 
 In the last three years or so, this has changed. 
"Fifth Avenue is becoming the new trendy street, like Smith Street in Carroll Gardens," said Ms. Brenner, a television editor in her 30's. "In 1991 you wouldn't go there at night to find a hamburger. Now you can get a full meal any time of day."
You can also find new housing on the side streets, as Ms. Brenner did. For the striking phenomenon in Park Slope, especially though not exclusively between Fifth Avenue and Fourth Avenue, is the presence of new construction on large midblock parcels of the Lower Slope. 
Most of the buildings recently completed or in construction are on land that was formerly vacant or else occupied by commercial buildings.
Over the last year buyers have been paying about $335 to $440 a square foot for new apartments throughout Park Slope, based on 36 closings, said Peggy D. Aguayo of the firm of Aguayo & Huebener. Based on 43 sales now under contract, prices have risen to $368 to $535 a square foot, she said. Last month, for example, a buyer paid $369,985, or $406 a square foot, for a 910-square-foot two-bedroom two-bath condominium under construction on Sackett Street. Occupancy is to start in the spring.
Now a rezoning adopted in April has set in motion plans for new 12-story buildings along Fourth Avenue. The rezoning encompasses most of the blockfronts from Warren to 15th Street, on both sides of the street, excluding those with significant commercial or industrial activity. The rezoning also adjusts regulations between Fourth Avenue and Prospect Park West to assure the preservation of low-rise buildings. (Details of the rezoning, Page 7.)
"This was a perfect opportunity to balance preservation with growth," said Amanda Burden, chairwoman of the City Planning Commission. "We were beginning to see some sore-thumb buildings, while Fourth Avenue could accommodate apartment-house construction." Contextual rezoning was adopted for northern Park Slope blocks in 1992, but the new rezoning extends the concept to a far larger area.
The city councilmen from Park Slope -- David Yassky and Bill de Blasio -- expressed satisfaction about the new zoning in general but disappointment in its failure to require builders to provide a certain amount of moderate-income housing in exchange for the right to build taller structures on Fourth Avenue. "We're concerned about the need to maintain economic integration," Mr. Yassky said.
Mr. de Blasio noted that the Bloomberg administration had agreed to make funds available to create 133 units of moderate-income housing within the new zoning district in the next five years.
As broadly defined by brokers marketing real estate there, Park Slope runs all the way from Flatbush Avenue on the north to the Prospect Park Expressway on the south, and from Prospect Park and Prospect Park West to Fourth Avenue on the east. The April rezoning actually goes as far as Third Avenue on some blocks, and only to 15th Street on the south.
While census tracts do not precisely coincide with these boundaries, the area had an approximate population of 62,200 in 2000, and there were 29,800 housing units. Over 20 years, the population has declined but the number of housing units has increased. The 1980 census showed a population of 65,200 and 29,000 housing units. 
The population decline reflects the influx of younger people replacing older households, bringing a drop in average household size. "There's been an influx of a lot of singles and people living with roommates," said Joseph Salvo, director of the population division of the Department of City Planning.
Concurrently, the new arrivals have raised the proportion of college graduates in Park Slope. They were 60 percent of the people over the age of 25 in 2000, census figures show. In 1990 they were 49.5 percent.
HISTORICALLY, the most desirable blocks, with the highest housing prices, have been along the park and on the park-bounded side streets from President Street perhaps as far as Sixth Street, brokers say. Typical sales prices last year for one- and two-family homes ranged from $1.3 million to $2 million, and occasionally more. The Park Slope Historic District overlaps some blocks of this area and extends beyond it to the north and east.
The slope of Park Slope descends gradually from northeast to southwest, leading to the terminology North Slope (from Flatbush Avenue to Union Street), Center Slope (from the south side of Union Street to Fifth or Sixth Streets) and South Slope beyond that. Residents of the southeastern part of the slope, near Prospect Park Southwest, know it as Windsor Terrace.
"Originally, everything south of Ninth Street was just 'South Brooklyn,' " said Billy Stephens, senior vice president in the Brooklyn office of the Corcoran Group. "In the mid-70's Park Slope went as far as 15th Street. As time went on, the whole South Slope became 'Park Slope.' "
Prices for existing housing in Park Slope typically diminish farther down the slope and farther from the park. Most houses have at least one rental. Resales prices for two-families distant from the park in the South Slope, for example, would probably be in a range of $700,000 to $800,000, brokers say. A two-bedroom floor-through condominium in the Center Slope between Sixth Avenue and Seventh Avenue might sell in the range of $550,000 to $650,000.
Native Brooklynites would be surprised to hear any of the blocks below Fifth Avenue defined as Park Slope at all. But the name seemed justified to Jean Miele, a landscape photographer who grew up in Park Slope and now lives in the Park Slope Estates condominium on Second Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues.
Mr. Miele and his wife, Carol Guasti, were living the Chelsea section of Manhattan when they decided to move. Now they and their daughter, Cally, 12, live in an 1,800-square-foot duplex. "We needed more space and we're close to a great middle school -- M.S. 51," said Mr. Miele, who is president of his condominium's board. 
The man whose development work has been primarily responsible for expanding the concept of Park Slope to reach Fourth Avenue is Isaac Katan, the developer of Park Slope Estates. Either on its own or in partnerships, Katan Developers has put into construction 260 apartments in the area, mainly on side streets in attached four-story elevator buildings with eight units each. And Katan is in the design phase for about 400 more. 
"We cultivated the edge of the neighborhood at a time when nobody wanted to move there," Mr. Katan said. New projects now in construction or design on or near Fourth Avenue will have a sales value of about $350 million, he said, and will transform parts of Fourth Avenue into "the Park Avenue of Brooklyn." 
Park Slope Estates, with 38 condominium apartments in six buildings, was the first project of its kind in the area. Mr. Katan's partners in the project were Boymelgreen Developers of Brooklyn, which did the construction, and the Fatato family, prior owners of the land. Bricolage Designs of Borough Park was the architect of record, and Ken Yesmont of Manhattan was the design architect.
Other projects in construction for occupancy next year are City View Gardens, 46 units in five buildings on Second and Third Streets, plus 75 rental apartments in a 12-story building bordering Fourth Avenue; Park Slope Terrace, with 38 condominiums in a five-story elevator building on Sackett Street; and Park Slope Gardens, 30 condominiumsin three five-story elevator buildings on Second and Third Streets. Two unnamed projects - on Dean Street, between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, and on Bergen Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues - will have a total of 36 condominiums in three four- and five-story elevator buildings.
"We will have 225 condominiums to sell in the spring," Mr. Katan said.
The sales agent for this inventory is Aguayo & Huebener Realty Group. In 65 sales of new housing for the Katan group and other builders in the last two years, Ms. Aguayo said, 40 to 50 percent of the buyers have come from outside Park Slope. 
"Most are couples with a child already or planning a family," she said. The local schools have a high reputation among buyers, she said.
Katan partnerships are designing 10 additional developments on or near Fourth Avenue, Mr. Katan said. They will produce close to 600 housing units. Six of them will have frontages on Fourth Avenue, with residential entrances on a side street, and some will have 100 apartments or more. As the new zoning provides, the typical Fourth Avenue building will rise in a street wall of 80 or 85 feet -- eight floors -- and then set back for a four-story element. It is too early to report the precise sites, Mr. Katan said.
Mr. Yesmont, the design architect for most of the low-rise projects, said he tried to fulfill the goal of transporting Park Slope charm to the area with the use of copper mansard roofs, limestone arches at the entrances, smaller arches at the parapet level where the roof starts, and curved railings on the outdoor terraces.
"The colors of brick reflect the colors of surrounding buildings," Mr. Yesmont said. 
Bricolage Designs of Borough Park has been the architect of record for many of the current projects in Park Slope and elsewhere in Brooklyn. Henry Radusky, the principal in the firm, said that over the next 12 to 18 months the eight that are recently completed or in construction by developers other than Mr. Katan would bring 200 new housing units to the market. 
Several of these projects are single buildings that are higher than would be allowed under the April rezoning. For example, there is a seven-story two-building project on the southeast corner of Fourth Avenue and President Street, nearing completion, that would be two stories too high in its President Street element, but conforming along Fourth Avenue if it had been designed under the new zoning rules. The builder is Zoriano Inc. of Brooklyn.
Another builder is the Goldmedal Group, in which Mendel Goldshmid is a principal. Goldmedal is in midconstruction on a five-story 30-unit condominium on 15th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, with occupancy expected next summer. There will be three entrances to three connected elevator buildings. It will have a landscaped backyard of 4,000 square feet. 
At 101 Prospect Park Southwest, a new 15-unit six-story building shaped like the Flatiron Building in Manhattan, caused local controversy as a view blocker before construction. Nearing completion, the condominiums sold out at an average price of $400 a square foot, the developer, Manny Reiner, said. 
NOT all has gone smoothly in the new construction. At Park Slope Estates on Second Street, Mr. Miele, the president of the condominium association, spoke of excessive delay in fixing roof leaks that have been persistent for more than a year. "It's been a struggle, and it's still not quite complete," he said.
The builders, meanwhile, are trying to attract buyers from Manhattan. Representative of these buyers in recent weeks were Lara Eshkenazi and James Matheson, a couple who were living in cramped space on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. They have gone into contract on a two-bedroom three-bath apartment with 1,500 square feet of space on Sackett Street, for occupancy early next year. Its price is $590,000.
"We couldn't get the same space for that money in Manhattan," said Ms. Eshkenazi, a lawyer who works downtown. "And we have friends who settled in the neighborhood. They love it."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
New Luxury Hotels Lead A Revival in Miami

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
MINIMALIST chic may have been the prevailing formula among the boutique hotels that thrived in South Beach in the 1990's, but the latest trend, fueled by a growing number of business travelers jetting in from this country and Latin America, is unabashed luxury.
 Mandarin Oriental, Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton all opened their first properties here in the last three years, and more top-shelf hotels are due in the coming months. Most were in the works well before the 2001 terrorist attacks hobbled South Florida's tourism trade, and while the industry has yet to recover fully, tourism officials are touting the new crop of luxury hotels as proof of Miami's rising stature as not just a beach resort, but a cosmopolitan center. 
 In particular, the officials say, the increasingly upscale lodging choices on and around Brickell Avenue, the heart of Miami's financial district, demonstrate the city's popularity as an international business destination. 
 The luxury hotels are opening as Miami is trying mightily to revitalize its long-blighted downtown. A $344 million performing arts center is rising on Biscayne Boulevard, with a 2,400-seat opera house and a 2,200-seat concert hall, scheduled to open in 2006. And voters have approved a proposal to build new homes for the Miami Museum of Science and the Miami Art Museum in a waterfront park that will abut a planned luxury condominium complex called Ten Museum Park. 
 Eight new hotels have opened in the Greater Miami area since September 2001, of which three -- the Ritz-Carlton in Coconut Grove, the Four Seasons, and the Trump Ocean Grande Resort Hotel in Sunny Isles -- are in the luxury category. 
 David Whitaker, senior vice president for marketing and tourism at the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, said that while the number of international visitors to Miami was nowhere near what it had been before the terrorist attacks, overall tourism was slowly climbing. 
 According to statistics from Smith Travel Research, hotel occupancy in Miami-Dade County through the first nine months of 2003 was 64 percent, compared with 66 percent for the same period in 2001, and 62.2 percent for all of last year. The average room rate for the first 10 months of 2003 was $107.30 compared with $110.20 in 2001 and $103.99 last year. 
 "We still have a ways to go," Mr. Whitaker said, "but we are narrowing the gap while absorbing a whole new category of properties." 
 Mr. Whitaker also said that luxury hotels were generally better suited to weathering the storm of a bad economy than lower-priced hotels because the huge, hardy companies that own them can continue to pour in resources. 
 Mandarin Oriental, the Japanese chain, was a pioneer of the luxury trend here when it opened a 329-room hotel on Brickell Key, a residential island adjacent to the downtown business district, in November 2000. Two new Ritz-Carltons followed: a 450-room hotel, spa and meeting center on Key Biscayne in July 2001, and a 115-room branch, also with spa and meeting space, in Coconut Grove last year.
 Another Ritz-Carlton was to open last Wednesday in South Beach, in a 1950's Art Moderne building that once housed the DiLido Hotel. The oceanfront hotel's 375 rooms are designed to resemble staterooms on a luxury yacht, and artwork by Joan Miro, among others, will decorate the lobby, pool area and 13,000-square-foot spa. 
 The Four Seasons Hotel Miami, with 221 rooms, 14,210 square feet of meeting space and a 45,000-square-foot spa, opened in a 70-story tower downtown on Brickell Avenue in October.
 Like several luxury hotels still on the drawing board, the Four Seasons is in a building that also offers condominiums for sale. That configuration, tourism officials say, makes such properties more palatable to investors wary of a glut of luxury hotel rooms. Similar properties include a 203-room Conrad Hilton -- only the second in this country -- scheduled to open in the spring in a 36-story residential building on Brickell Avenue, and the Setai, owned by General Hotel Management of Singapore, expected to open late next year in South Beach.
 Further down the road, two luxury hotels are planned for Watson Island, an artificial island connecting Miami and South Beach, until now largely a thoroughfare. The developers, Flagstone Properties, are trying to differentiate their properties by stressing that their plans include a marina for large yachts, a shopping and dining complex, a maritime museum, a spa and gardens. 
 Mr. Whitaker said that while he and other tourism officials worried that there would not be sufficient demand for the spate of luxury hotels, experience has proved them wrong. 
 "We are back in an era of big opulence again," he said, "and competition is the best way for improvement and reinvestment to take place."
 Sure enough, 50's-era resort properties like the Eden Roc and the Fontainebleau Hilton, the luxury hotels of their day in Miami Beach, have made or are making extensive renovations. The Eden Roc added a lavish spa and a climbing wall, while the Fontainebleau put in a 7,000-square-foot water park and is adding condominiums and luxury suites.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Cape Town

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES; MICHAEL WINES is chief of the Johannesburg bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
 The Portuguese navigator Bartholomeu Dias, on a mission from King Joao II to find a way around the southern tip of Africa, discovered the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, and for the next 400 years, most people save sailors and South Africans pretty much forgot about it. But in the last five years that has begun to change: well-heeled Germans, British and Italians are snapping up land on sheer promontories and pristine beachfronts along the 30-mile finger of Cape territory, and its hub, Cape Town, has sprouted luxury hotels and classy shops like Whack-a-Mole games sprout moles. Unavoidable, for the world is rediscovering South Africa now that apartheid has been gone for a decade. But too bad, in a way: before long, this loveliest of African cities will be a genuine Riviera, with all that implies. 
 Already, the town crawls with film stars and their crews, drawn by the jaw-dropping scenery, California way of life and low production costs. Traffic along trendy Camps Bay, nicknamed the Riviera, is constant, and there are too many Ferraris for the average person's comfort. 
 Because the rich-poor gap here is so yawning, one should be sensibly vigilant against crime -- mostly pickpockets and purse-snatchers, though violence also has risen sharply since apartheid's end. 
 On the other hand, Cape Town is bustling, never a bad thing in a nation where unemployment exceeds 40 percent. And this city, so long ostracized by the outside world, retains an almost mystical blend of European high style and African high culture. In art, crafts, architecture and lifestyle, it is a hybrid that even an invasion of chain stores, beautiful people and fusion cuisine has failed to overwhelm. Yet. 

Events
 It's summer here, which is to say that the Cape is rife with outdoor music festivals, generally in spectacular settings with great South African wine and food. On the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, the Standard Bank Jazzathon showcases South African talent in 40 afternoon and evening performances from Jan. 8 to 11; Jan. 9 is an all-women performers day. Admission is free; the crowds are huge. Information: www.jazzathon.co.za. 
 Far more bucolic and intimate is the Savanna Up-the-Creek Music Festival, (27-21) 671-4360, www.upthecreek.mweb.co.za, a parade of music, live comedy and art exhibitions Feb. 6 to 8 on the banks of the Breede River near Swellendam, down the Cape two and a half hours by car from downtown. The organizers bill it as an upscale festival for postgraduate adults, meaning one needs a tent to stay all three days, but the camping facilities are clean and pleasant. The crowd is small, about 750 people. One can eschew the tent and attend on Saturday, from noon to midnight. Tickets are $55, at 6.5 South African rand to $1, by phone or Computicket, www.computicket.com. 
 Then there is festival luxe: the Spier Summer Arts Festival, (27-21) 809-1177, www.spier.co.za, at the Village at Spier, a 155-room hotel and country estate near Stellenbosch, a 30-minute drive east of Cape Town. Stellenbosch, South Africa's second-oldest town, is a museum piece by itself. The festival's late-summer fare, staged by the South African Opera Company Dimpho Di Kopane, ranges from the sublime ("The Beggar's Opera," intermittently from Feb. 12 to 25) to the ridiculous ("The Rocky Horror Show," Jan. 31 through Feb. 28). One night at the Spier for two, with dinner, breakfast, show tickets and a free bottle of wine, is $98 a person by phone at the hotel or through www.computicket.com. 
 Oenophiles can drop by Cape Town's main Holiday Inn, downtown at Strand and Adderly Streets, on Feb. 24 for a wine-tasting prequel to the internationally famous Nederburg Wine Auction, in April. Tickets, $10, include snacks and a chance to sample vintages bound for the auction block and can be reserved through www.computicket.com.
 The Iziko-SA National Gallery, (27-21) 467-4660, www.museums.org.za/iziko/izihome, Government Avenue, Gardens, houses South Africa's national art collection, an impressive assemblage of works reflecting the nation's tumultuous history. Through January, the museum draws on the collection for "Coexistence," an exhibition of professional artists' and rural craftsmen's interpretations of South African life. Through Feb. 4 is "AIDS in South Africa," a joint exhibition with Wellesley College featuring artists' views of the pandemic. Closed Mondays; 75 cents.

Sightseeing
 Cape Town is an adventurer's paradise: hikers and rock climbers abound in the mountains rimming the city, and parasailers soar in the thermals off Lion's Head, the peak overlooking Camps Bay. Scuba divers can explore shipwrecks or, if nervy enough, even arrange caged encounters with sharks. The adrenalin-challenged can take the daily cable car to the 3,560-foot top of Table Mountain (touristy, sure, but breathtaking). Tickets are, in summer, $16 round trip at the station on Tafelberg Road; call ahead, (27-21) 424-8181, or visit www.tablemountain.net, to ensure that the blustery weather allows the trip. A drive south to the Cape of Good Hope takes travelers past picturesque cliffside villages, vineyards and often-wild scenery. 
 Robben Island, (27-21) 413-4200, www.robben-island.org.za, the 2.2-square-mile home of the maximum-security prison where Nelson Mandela spent 27 years before gaining freedom and leading South Africa to democratic rule, is now a World Heritage Site. The island and its prison are open daily to visitors, who arrive by half-hour ferry (it leaves from the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront); a museum and interactive exhibits place the island and its grisly history in context. Booking should be made at least three days in advance, $23. 
 More broadly, visitors can revisit South Africans' trek from slavery to oppression to liberty by taking the Footsteps to Freedom walking tour, 5 Church Square, (27-21) 465-2032, www.footstepstofreedom.co.za. The three-hour guided tour passes through a former slave market, the moving District Six Museum memorializing the bulldozing of the homes of 66,000 Cape Town nonwhites in the 1970's, and the broad square where Mr. Mandela, newly released from prison, addressed thousands of celebrators in February 1990. Group tours, booked at the Cape Town Visitor Information Center, (27-21) 426-4260, are $15. 

Where to Stay
 One place popular with the Hollywood set -- film crews, not stars -- is Victoria Junction, corner of Somerset and Ebeneezer Roads, (27-21) 418-1234, fax (27-21) 418-5678; www.proteahotels.com/victoriajunction. In the city's bohemian Green Point neighborhood not far from downtown, it is modeled after Manhattan lofts, with lots of glass blocks, exposed brick and stainless steel. The 172 rooms are meticulously kept and artfully designed, if somewhat cramped. The ground-floor restaurant is superb, and reasonable. Standard double, $192.
 The Cape Castle Hotel, 3 Main Road, (27-21) 439-1016, fax (27-21) 439-1019, www.proteahotels.com/capecastle, has 68 pleasant if spartan rooms with kitchen facilities. Some have a separate anteroom with a foldout sofa. Waterfront attractions are across a broad and busy street, but a crossing is nearby. Like all Protea hotels, it's tidy and well-run. A double is $144.
 Budget: The Cape Town Lodge is on downtown's edge, 101 Buitengracht Street, (27-21) 422-0030, fax (27-21) 422-0090; www.capetownlodge.co.za. A onetime technical college, it has been dramatically renovated. The 114 rooms are often oddly shaped and appointed, but huge, well-kept and comfortable with simple modern furnishings. A small rooftop pool is shared with a clutch of upper-floor private lofts. A standard double is about $140; specials are often posted on a sign outside. 
 The 208 rooms at City Lodge, (27-21) 419-9450, fax (27-21) 419-0460, www.citylodge.co.za, Dock and Alfred Roads, directly across from the waterfront and near downtown, are appointed with tasteful furnishings; in a few rooms a bathroom wall slides down, allowing bathers to watch TV in the main room. There is no room service, and the dining room, while offering a full breakfast, skimps on other meals. The pool is the size of a pool table, but the price -- $122 for a double -- is right, and drops Friday through Sunday to $90. 
Luxury: The Table Bay Hotel, Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, (27-21) 406-5000, fax (27-21) 406-5767, has 329 rooms in a seven-year-old Victorian reincarnation fronting the Atlantic on Cape Town's colorful harbor. All polished wood and butter-yellow decor, the hotel abounds with thoughtful touches, from internationalized electrical outlets to a combination personal fax and laptop printer that doubles as a hotel message center in each room. There is no room without a view, and the sight of Table Mountain from the glass-walled Conservatory bar is splendid. A double costs $415, and looks it. 
 Considerably more laid-back, but also plush, is the new 182-room Radisson Hotel Waterfront, Beach Road, Granger Bay, (27-21) 418-5729, fax (27-21) 418-5717, a four-story, Mediterranean-white affair directly on the ocean breakwater perhaps a half-mile from the Table Bay. Airy and bright, with canvas-roofed atria throughout, the hotel has a California feel; it's a frequent stop for film stars. Guests can watch dolphins and the occasional whale at the outdoor oceanfront cafe. Families will want the two-bedroom suites, with kitchenettes and spacious living rooms with fold-out sofas. Doubles, $345. 

Where to Eat
 The guard and his metal-detecting wand at Balducci's, www.balduccis.co.za, Victoria Wharf lower level, (27-21) 421-6002, are off-putting, but inside, the ostrich fillet, crayfish, blackened kingclip and duck confit are elegantly served in a sophisticated-casual atmosphere of cherry furniture and artsy photos of nudes. Dinner for two, with wine, $40. 
 Mama Africa, 178 Long Street, (27-21) 424-8634, has wildly painted furniture and an imposing chandelier constructed of Coke bottles. The food is eye-catching, too. Try the smoked kudu and avocado salad, grilled butternut squash, vegetable samoosas (stuffed Indian pastry) and potjiekos, a wild-game stew. There's an African band evening. The neighborhood is a bit dicey at night, so reserve a return taxi. Dinner and wine for two is $40. 
 Riviera, Second Floor Promenade, Victoria Road, Camps Bay, (27-21) 438-7333, serves Mediterranean fare on a second-story overhang with a view of trendy Camps Bay beach and its beautiful-people sunbathers. The Moroccan spiced chicken salad is good; there are hot and cold tapas, paella and Lebanese char-grilled chicken, too. Dinner for two with wine starts at about $45. 
 La Med, (27-21) 438-5600, Glen Country Club, Victoria Road, Clifton, is a restaurant and club in a young-at-heart beach enclave perched on a peninsula about four miles southwest of downtown. Inventive pizzas (bacon, brie and avocado, for example) and the usual burgers, calamari and salads highlight a limited menu. Dinner for two with wine is about $23. Open daily.
 Theo's, 163 Beach Road, Mouille Point, (27-21) 439-3494, serves above-average burgers, steak rolls and game like ostrich and grilled crocodile here and at two other locations. Dinner and wine for two, $30.

Elizabeth Weber, Daniel Handwerker

 BODY:
Elizabeth Anna Weber and Daniel Abraham Handwerker are to be married today in East Rockaway, N.Y. Rabbi Stuart L. Kelman is to officiate at the Hewlett-East Rockaway Jewish Center.
 The couple are doctoral students at the University of California, she in economics at the Berkeley campus and he in bioengineering at Berkeley and San Francisco. 
 The bride, 27, worked in 2000 and 2001 as a research assistant at the Council of Economic Advisers in Washington. She graduated from Swarthmore College. She is a daughter of Jane Weber and Dr. Jonathan Weber of Nashua, N.H. Her father is a senior electro-optical engineer in Nashua in the information and electronic warfare systems group of BAE Systems, the British military and aerospace equipment maker. Her mother is a social studies curriculum specialist for the Nashua school district. 
The bridegroom, 25, graduated from Johns Hopkins University. He is a son of Dr. Sara Handwerker and Dr. David Handwerker of Baldwin, N.Y. His mother is a staff physician at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, specializing in high-risk pregnancies. His father is an obstetrician and gynecologist at Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn.
Ms. Weber and Mr. Handwerker met in August 2001 at a Sabbath dinner for graduate students at Berkeley and became friends. "By November, we were e-mailing each other dozens of articles from the Web site of a newspaper we both liked," Ms. Weber said. So in tune were they, Mr. Handwerker said, that often "we sent each other the same article simultaneously." 
Then they discovered they tied their shoelaces the same way. "I still routinely tie my shoes with a double loop," Ms. Weber said, adding that her mother always made fun of her for it. "I've never met anyone else who does it like that."
"It was then," Mr. Handwerker said with a laugh, "that we decided ours was a match made in heaven."

HEADLINE: Investing; 
How Internet Banks Have Inched Ahead on Rates

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIMELMAN

 BODY:
RICHARD REINMAN, a retiree in Albuquerque, knows what investment experts mean when they say, "Cash is trash." He has watched in recent years as falling interest rates have eroded the returns that he and his wife, Marilyn, receive from the cash in their investment portfolio.
 But while many investors are resigned to getting 0.7 percent or 1 percent a year on a money market fund tied to a brokerage account, Mr. Reinman, 74, went shopping for a better rate. And he found it not at a brokerage firm or a mutual fund house, but at a "branchless" commercial bank that does business over the phone and the Internet. 
 Mr. Reinman and his wife are now receiving 2.2 percent a year on close to $100,000 in money market deposits at the Bank of Internet USA, a bank in Del Mar, Calif., with a single, 6,000-square-foot office and only 20 employees. 
 "This is paying me three times what I might make on a typical money market mutual fund," he said, adding that the investment is also insured through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "That's a world of difference."
 Some financial advisers contend that it is hardly worth the effort to build a relationship with one more financial institution just to eke out an extra percent or so a year in returns. But others beg to differ. With inflation running at close to 2 percent, investors who can earn that much on their cash are at least keeping up with the cost of living.
 "That's a difference worth the added effort, " said Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at BankRate.com in North Palm Beach, Fla.
 Michael Karstens, a certified financial planner in Omaha, agreed, saying that the added returns justified the effort for all but relatively small accounts. "If you have $100,000 invested in a money market fund and you are earning only 0.75 percent a year, you will be making $750," he said. "If you are earning 2.2 percent, you are making $2,200 a year. That's a $1,450 difference before income tax." 
 By contrast, an investor with only $20,000 or $30,000 in short-term money might question the need to shop for better rates, said Lewis M. Wallensky, a financial planner in Los Angeles. If investors are receiving no more than $200 or $300 a year of additional income for their effort, he said, they might just forgo some luxury expense to make up for it.
 But for those who feel that the extra return makes the effort worthwhile, commercial banks are a good place to start. Once scorned for not keeping up with money market mutual funds in their returns, certain banks now offer the best rates. 
 This year through Dec. 19, a net $435 billion has flowed into bank money market and savings accounts, raising total assets to $3.2 trillion, according to BanxQuote.com in Scarsdale, N.Y. By contrast, there has been a net outflow of $111 billion from retail money market mutual funds, reducing their total assets to $817 billion.
 NOT surprisingly, some of the most competitive banks are also beating their rivals in the rates they pay on certificates of deposit. Unlike money market deposits, which can be liquidated at any time, money in C.D.'s cannot be withdrawn without penalty for, say, one, three or five years. 
 But because the best one-year C.D.'s pay only slightly more than the best money market rates, investors see little value in them. There has been an outflow of $86.2 billion from consumer C.D.'s in the past year, lowering total assets to $808 billion as of Dec. 19, according to BanxQuote.
 The average money market return at commercial banks and mutual fund companies is similar -- about a half-percent a year -- but the best bank rates are higher than the best rates offered by fund companies. 
 That difference can be explained by the economic forces that shape these rival industries. Money market funds run by mutual fund houses and large securities firms invest in similar short-term securities, including Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and commercial paper issued by companies. So there is not much they can do to increase interest rates for customers, other than lower or waive management fees.
 "These money market funds are all fishing from the same investment pond," said Mr. McBride, the financial analyst, "so most of the disparity in returns is attributed to different management expense ratios rather than the investment performance." 
 By contrast, banks rely on deposits for the money they lend. So certain banks in need of added deposits may be willing to raise the rates for them if they expect to lend at higher rates. "Some banks simply want your deposits more than others do," says Norbert Mehl, the president of the Banx Corporation, the operator of BanxQuote. 
 Traditionally, banks in small communities have often offered some of the highest rates on money market deposits and C.D.'s, to try to keep up with loan demand. But the emergence of the Internet has led to the rise of branchless banks, which benefit from low overhead to offer better rates on deposits, also backed by the F.D.I.C. 
 Indeed, the three banks that now advertise the best rates are not found on neighborhood streets, according to Bankrate.com. They are the Bank of Internet USA, Virtual Bank and National InterBank. 
 The Internet banks do not tend to lower their rates abruptly, Mr. McBride said. "The institutions that are competitive tend to be competitive over time." BankRate rewards banks that keep rates high with a "top tier award."
 Some small traditional banks are willing to offer better rates to local depositors than those advertised on the Web. "These deals are hard to track on a national basis because they are often offered in the local market and they tend to come and go," Mr. Mehl of Banx said. 
 For example, Mr. Karstens, the Omaha financial planner, learned from one client that the Exchange Bank, a small community bank in Gibbon, Neb., was paying close to 3 percent a year for money market deposits. "I called them and asked if I could send additional money from customers who weren't clients at their bank already," he said. The bank said he could, but it lowered the rate later in the year. 
 Pat Meyer, an assistant vice president at Exchange Bank, confirmed that it was offering consumer money market rates ranging from 2.6 percent to 2.9 percent in June. "But we got the deposits we needed," she said, "so we lowered the rate."
 TO attract customers, some banks are willing to do more than just raise rates. Daniel Dektar, chief investment officer at Smith Breeden Associates, a money manager in Chapel Hill, N.C., specializing in fixed-income investments, found that out when he checked local banks to learn their C.D. rates. His goal was to find good investments for his workers, family members and friends -- not his clients, who have little use for bank C.D.'s. 
 Not only did he find rates that were better than the national averages, but he also discovered that some banks were willing to improve the terms to make the C.D.'s more attractive when rates rise. The Federal Reserve, which held short-term rates steady at its last meeting, is expected to begin raising them soon. 
 Mr. Dektar learned that two local North Carolina banks were willing to reset the interest rate once if rates rose during the life of the investment. Another bank would charge only three months' interest as a penalty if an investor liquidated the investment.
 "Both of these types of C.D.'s have features that limit your opportunity cost should rates rise, while starting out with higher income," Mr. Dektar said. 
 But Mr. Mehl contends that most investors should stick with simpler deposit products they can compare easily, not ones laden with too many bells and whistles.
 "It's better to find a straightforward product that is paying a good rate," he said.

Those Year-End Bonuses Aren't Always Green

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
JESSICA VARGA received no year-end bonus check this year. Not a share of stock or even a gift check from her employer, DVC Worldwide, a marketing firm in Morristown, N.J. Yet Ms. Varga, an assistant account executive who has never received a bonus, does not seem to mind: she was given her very first office -- in fact, a coveted corner one.
 She won the use of an office for all of 2004 as a prize at DVC's year-end party, held at a hotel in nearby Madison. Ms. Varga, 23, participated in a drawing to reward the company's less-senior staff. Each employee received 10 raffle tickets to place in various boxes for prizes like dinner certificates, a dedicated spot in the front row of the company's parking lot or the corner office. 
 Ms. Varga put all her tickets in the "corner office" box, and after her name was pulled out as the winner, the crowd cheered loudly. "I figured it would take me 10 years to get an office," said Ms. Varga, who has been with DVC for only 18 months. "It was the last thing I expected to be rewarded with." 
 Sue Furlong, president and chief operating officer of DVC, said that some executives continued to receive annual cash bonuses this year but that the noncash awards for everyone else had been extremely popular. "They're something that you can't buy," she said. "They're pretty meaningful."
 They are also far less expensive to give than cash or other forms of financial compensation. 
 Many other companies, large and small, seem to agree. They have been doling out far less in cash bonuses this year, at least for their rank-and-file employees, according to compensation experts. 
 "When it comes to end-of-year bonuses, cash is no longer king," said Laura Sejen, national practice director for strategic awards at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, the human resources consulting firm.
 About one-third of companies planned to give holiday bonuses this year anyway -- about the same fraction as in 2002 -- but fewer companies were giving them in cash, according to a study of 435 American companies conducted in November by Hewitt Associates, another human resources consulting firm. 
 Only 28 percent planned to give cash this year, compared with 39 percent last year. The remainder were giving mainly gift certificates or food products -- hams, turkeys and, yes, fruitcakes -- the survey found. A majority of the companies in the survey budgeted less than 1 percent of payroll expenses for these awards.
 Noncash awards are not given just around the holidays. In a recent study by Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 72 percent of the corporate executives surveyed indicated that they give noncash awards to employees all year.
 More employers, meanwhile, are replacing standard bonuses with pay-for-performance plans in which a worker's total compensation is tied to performance or revenue goals. Nearly 80 percent of companies have these plans in place for some of their employees, up from around 50 percent in 1991, according to Hewitt Associates.
 Ken Bosch, a Hewitt consultant, said that these awards could better help employees "focus on the key drivers of the business."
 "The primary criticism companies have with holiday bonuses is that there tends to be a loose link between someone's performance and the fact that they got a ham," he said. Pay-for-performance plans, he said, "avoid the entitlement mentality that exists with holiday rewards." 
 With performance-related plans, "workers aren't saying, 'It's holiday time, where's my reward?' no matter how well or how poorly they performed," he said.
 Ms. Sejen of Watson Wyatt says the move away from cash began as the economy began to sour more than three years ago. Companies that were struggling to meet earnings expectations started experimenting with less expensive awards, like theater tickets, dinner certificates or gift cards, for employees who were not executives. A rising unemployment rate also meant that fewer employers had to shower big bonuses on workers to keep them.
 Now, even with the economy improving, these companies are finding that "they're getting more bang for their buck" with noncash awards, Ms. Sejen said. 
 Such awards can backfire, however, if they are used as a replacement for large cash bonuses. 
 "If you're accustomed to getting a $5,000 bonus and you're now getting a $25 gift certificate, you're going to think your company is a little bit chintzy," said Carroll Lachnit, editor of Workforce Management, a human resources publication.
 Many companies, of course, continue to give hefty cash bonuses to their senior executives. And the financial services industry also continues to give out mounds of cash. 
 According to Alan G. Hevesi, the New York State comptroller, Wall Street firms alone will pay $10.7 billion in bonuses in 2003, up from $8.6 billion in 2002. 
 But Ms. Lachnit says that companies in many other industries have been eager to change an employee mind-set that annual bonuses should be a guaranteed part of their compensation. "People just factor the money in as part of their annual salary expectations," she said. 
 Rewards like gift certificates, she said, are often viewed differently by employees, "because they're usually something that someone wouldn't spend on themselves."
 "So they're seen as more special," she added.
 RICK JOHNSON, president of Quantum Media, a software development company in San Diego, says he rewards his 25 employees at the end of the year by letting them select merchandise through a barter organization of which his company is a member. Mr. Johnson says he gives each employee an amount they can spend, usually from $500 to $2,000, and has them select gifts from a catalog, such as leather coats or mountain bikes.
 "When you give people cash, they spend it on an insurance bill or a doctor bill and then forget about it," he said. "This is much more exciting."
 Dr. Chris Kammer, president and owner of the Center for Cosmetic Dentistry in Madison, Wis., is also banking that the holiday reward for his employees this year will generate some excitement.
 Dr. Kammer says he previously gave employees $50 checks at the company's annual potluck holiday party. "It became sort of expected," he said. 
 At this year's party, Dr. Kammer had a surprise for his staff of 25. When the employees finished eating, he asked them to wait a few minutes. Then two stretch limousines, driven by chauffeurs in Santa outfits, pulled up to the curb outside the company. The staff was invited to climb into the limos and drink Champagne, eat bonbons and sing along to a holiday CD that Dr. Kammer himself had burned.
 The employees were whisked to a local mall, where he presented each of them with a $100 bill and gave them an hour to spend it all. Whatever money they didn't spend in that time, they had to return.
 While the main reward was still money, Dr. Kammer said he believed that the experience surrounding it would be more fondly remembered than the cash of years past. 
 "The money alone was drab," he said. "This is something they're never going to forget."

N.F.L. Ownership, on the Installment Plan

BYLINE:  By GREGORY JORDAN

 BODY:
ART MODELL, owner of the Baltimore Ravens, often refers to the owners of competing teams in the National Football League as partners. Now, Mr. Modell is at a turning point in a partnership that has been crucial for his team. 
 At the end of the football season, Mr. Modell will hand over control of the Ravens, which he has owned since 1961 when they were the Cleveland Browns, to Stephen Bisciotti, the founder of Allegis Group, a recruiting and staffing company in Hanover, Md. 
 The two men have structured the transition as a lengthy collaboration that is unusual in professional sports -- and hardly more common in other businesses.
 The sale of the team was born of financial necessity. Mr. Modell took on debt in the 1990's for repairs to the antiquated Cleveland Municipal Stadium and for other business expenses. In addition, he had to buy out the share of a former partner, Alfred Lerner. Shortly before the sale to Mr. Bisciotti, Mr. Modell had to take on $185 million in debt, a sum so large he needed league approval.
 The impending management change is on track to be much smoother. Mr. Modell, who bought the team for $4.6 million in 1961, handpicked Mr. Bisciotti to buy the team from among several potential suitors in 2000. Mr. Bisciotti then paid $275 million for 49 percent of the team and will pay an additional $325 million after this season for the remainder. 
 The four-year transition has been an apprenticeship of sorts for Mr. Bisciotti, 43, who has spent the time learning about professional sports management from Mr. Modell and his son David, the team's president. After Art Modell, 78, hands over control of the team, he will stay on as a consultant with an office next to the new owner's.
 The arrangement has been fruitful from the start. The Ravens won their first Super Bowl in January 2001. And during the transition, Mr. Bisciotti has gained access to other team owners and has begun developing relationships with them. "Steve was a success in business but knew little about the operation of a professional sports team," said Ron Shapiro, a Baltimore sports agent. "Art realized he could tap Steve's business skills, and Steve recognized an opportunity to learn the sports business and tap Art's decades of experience in football."
 Mr. Modell said he and Mr. Bisciotti had planned the changeover to benefit the team as well.
 "We staged this transaction to give Steve a chance to learn this business and to give the franchise a less abrupt change," Mr. Modell said. "And we developed new financial strength. It was a novel way to do it, but Steve paid a very handsome price even with this slow buy-in period built in." 
 During the transition, Mr. Bisciotti said, he has focused on learning about league governance and economic matters from Art Modell and about team marketing and finance from David. The new owner has also adopted the Modell buzzword.
 "Art helped build this league with partners," Mr. Bisciotti said. "The new breed of owners are successful at business, but few admit we are coming into an entirely new business. You almost never acquire a company so different from your own, so you don't come into the N.F.L. with a lot of knowledge. I like to think I recognized this and gained that knowledge from Art."
 A LENGTHY ownership transition carries both benefits and risks, said Mitchell H. Ziets, president and chief executive of the sports investment bank MZ Sports. 
 "The good thing about that structure is it allows the new owner to have a very orderly transition, to learn the personnel and the potential problems in a direct way," he said. "But the exiting owner could start cutting long-term deals that put a new owner in a situation where his hands are tied." That has not happened with the Ravens, Mr. Ziets said, because Mr. Modell and Mr. Bisciotti have worked so closely on all aspects of the team's business.
 But by extending the official change in leadership, the two men may have also prolonged the ill will that surrounded the team's move from Cleveland in 1996, said Kenneth Shropshire, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
 Cleveland fans, who had loyally followed the Browns, felt betrayed by the decision to leave, even if the move was to a city that itself had been abandoned by its longtime franchise, the Colts. They later used that anger to lobby the league to locate a new franchise in Cleveland in 1999 under the Browns name.
 Sports business experts say that the Modell-Bisciotti transition is a rare one because a new owner seldom acknowledges needing a period of apprenticeship. A team tends to be handed down within a family or sold to very wealthy individuals who want immediate control. 
 And there is also a substantial record of owners battling for control of teams. The football teams owned under partnerships that had to be dissolved because of bitter disputes include the Miami Dolphins in the 1960's, and later the Oakland Raiders and the Minnesota Vikings. 
 This pattern makes the collaborative approach to the Ravens' sale and ownership transition stand out, sports business experts say. 
 Mr. Modell's management approach with his staff is also collaborative, particularly for the world of sports. He has usually promoted from within the organization and has chosen minority candidates for prominent positions. 
 Ozzie Newsome, a former Cleveland Browns tight end who is now the team's general manager, said Mr. Modell's management style stood out. "Art runs a franchise with a deep commitment to its people," said Mr. Newsome, who in 2002 became the first black general manager in the N.F.L. "His approach to personnel management is reflected in the long tenure of so many people at all levels around here."
 Mr. Bisciotti said he would keep Mr. Modell's management team. "There has been less turnover in Art's organization than any team I know of," Mr. Bisciotti said. "You look at most sports executives and they have three or four teams on their resume. I spent the last four years learning from people I want to keep. I knew within a year of buying the business I wasn't going to have any turnover."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Year-End Is Crucial For Alcohol Sales, Too

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
TIME for a little holiday libation? 
 Like their retailing cousins, the companies that make beer, wine and liquor rely on healthy fourth-quarter sales for a good chunk of their annual profits. 
 Last year, alcohol sales in the United States totaled $137.5 billion, according to Impact Databank. Beer has had a tough year in 2003, but wine and spirits sales are up. 
 Bryan Spillane, a beverage analyst at Banc of America Securities, took some time last week to talk about the industry, and whether the stocks are overpriced. 
 Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Is there a lot of seasonality to sales of beer, wine and spirits?

A. The fourth quarter is important for wine and spirits sales, because there are more parties and they are also given as gifts. The end of the year is probably about as important to them as the fourth quarter is to the retailers.

Q. Nevertheless, isn't it fair to say that demand for these products is fairly inelastic?

A. Yes, it is fairly inelastic. When the economy is good or improving, you tend to have more trading up to better brands.
 This year, we have seen the return of the luxury consumer, and volume growth has accelerated from 2 percent to 3 percent in spirits like whiskeys and vodkas.

Q. Have wine sales been helped by reports that wine drinking is good for your heart?

A. On a volume basis, the wine industry will grow 6 percent this year, after growing at a 3 percent rate over the previous two to three years. The idea that a glass of wine is healthy is part of the appeal.
 Also, to a 50-year-old baby boomer looking for more luxury items, wine fits the bill. So there is a good demographic opportunity. And since you still have relatively low per capita consumption among younger people, there is an opportunity for growth.

Q. Americans spend more money on beer -- $67 billion last year -- than on either wine or spirits. But 2003 hasn't been a good year for the brewers, has it?

A. This year the beer industry, including imports, will probably see volumes decline by about 1 percent. Over the last five years, it has grown at about a 1 percent rate.
 Unfavorable weather over the first half of the year is at least part of the reason why it has been a tough year. Also, I think some beer drinkers may have migrated to spirits. And a slowdown in bar and restaurant traffic didn't help. 
 But I expect you will see some improvement in beer industry volumes in 2004. Some of that is due to easy year-over-year comparisons. 
 Over the last couple of months we have liked Anheuser-Busch. It's a stock that has lagged the market. When the beer industry stagnates, Anheuser does, too, irrespective of its own performance. But it has 50 percent of the beer market.

Q. A lot of these stocks have done well this year. Constellation Brands, for instance, is up more than 30 percent. Brown-Forman is up more than 40 percent. Is it realistic to think that they can continue to outperform?

A. It really depends on the stock.
We like Diageo, which is up more than 20 percent this year but is still relatively undervalued. 
 This is a company whose brands include Johnnie Walker whiskeys, Smirnoff vodka, Jose Cuervo tequila and Tanqueray gin. 
 Over the course of the last five years they have made a lot of acquisitions that forced a lot of change. When they came out of it as a spirits company, they set pretty high sales and earnings targets. The missed their numbers a couple of times in the second half of 2002 and the first half of this year. 
 I don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong with the company. They are just at the beginning of being able to leverage their market share in the U.S., which is the biggest of any spirits company. This is a company that can pretty consistently deliver 10 percent earnings-per-share growth and operating income growth of 6 percent to 7 percent. It also has a dividend yield of about 3.6 percent.

Q. Do you like any of the others?

A. Constellation Brands, which brews Corona beer, has an Australian vineyard and two California vineyards and makes Fleischmann's vodka, among other brands, is a stock we like.
 The stock is trading at about 11.5 times next year's earnings, so it is still reasonably priced. The key with this stock is Banrock Station, the Australian vineyard. Australian wines are growing at a 50 percent clip in the U.S. right now. 
 Brown-Forman Corporation is a great company. Jack Daniel's, which they make, is a great brand in terms of pricing power. And it is a very shareholder-friendly company. Over the course of 2003, they did a share repurchase, announced plans to split the stock and have increased the dividend. 
 You should think of these stocks as being like most other big, consumer staples companies. Over time, the real concern is not if they are going to generate cash, but how they are going to spend it.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 4, 2004

 CORRECTION:
The Market Insight column last Sunday, about investing in makers of alcoholic beverages, misidentified the brewer of Corona beer. It is Grupo Modelo of Mexico. (Constellation Brands is the parent of Barton Beers, which distributes Corona in the western United States.)

Old Cars Can Become Good Deeds

BYLINE:  By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHEN the auto dealer told me that he would give me only $5,000 as a trade-in on my 1997 minivan, I made two decisions. One, I was going to keep my old, but perfectly sound, van and not take the new all-wheel-drive version I had come to the showroom to buy. And, two, I would eventually give the van to charity instead of accepting the dealer's low offer.
 Donating an old vehicle to a charity has long been a popular option. The charity makes money by reselling the car, and the owners get a tax break and the satisfaction that they're doing some good. Many charities accept old vehicles. The Polly Klaas Foundation and the California Council of the Blind say they receive most of their income this way. 
 Just last month, the National Automobile Dealers Association announced a donation program that lets owners choose a charity from a list of 200 (www.nadaguides.com or 800792-2095). The dealers work with the Vehicle Donation Processing Center in Monrovia, Calif., which runs the donation programs for these groups. 
 The American Cancer Society runs its own donation program (888227-5500 or www.cancer.org). The group says it receives about 18,000 cars a year, raising about $5 million. Richard Riehl, vice president of the society's vehicle donation program, says that as of now, it usually doesn't accept cars from 1987 or earlier. The Vehicle Donation Processing Center says it generally will not take nonrunning domestic cars that are more than 15 years old.
 "This is a fund-raising exercise, so we only want cars that we believe will have a net profit," said Harvard E. Palmer Jr., vice president of the processing center. 
 Many of the organizations make donating incredibly easy. They mail the paperwork to the owner, who signs over the title and mails everything back. Usually within days, a tow-truck operator calls to make an appointment to haul the car away.
 Dianna L. Shattuck, 39, a veterinarian from Stamford, Conn., said she needed a total of only about 15 minutes for the phone calls and paperwork to donate a 1992 Oldsmobile to the cancer society this year. Mary Bettinson, 52, a marketing consultant from Costa Mesa, Calif., said her 1994 Thunderbird was gone 12 days after she started the donation process last month through the dealers association.
 The hardest part is coming up with the fair market value for the Internal Revenue Service. The agency makes it clear that checking a used-car pricing guide is only the first step. You must adjust the value depending on the car's condition, mileage and options. (Check with car dealers or repair shops.) The I.R.S. also requires an appraisal if the car is valued at more than $5,000. And keep in mind that the General Accounting Office released a report this month on car donations, noting that the amounts that donors claimed as deductions were often much higher than what the charities received for the cars. So changes may be coming.
 The dealers association helps assign value on its Web site. It said that my vehicle should sell for about $8,000 because it has low mileage, but I'm sure it's worth less because the body is dented and scraped. It is an ugly van, but it runs great.
 That prompted another thought: Instead of giving my van to a charity that probably won't get its full value, why not give it to a group that can actually use it? I would have to find that group and do the paperwork myself, but the satisfaction would be greater. And the tax deduction wouldn't be any less.
 So I called the Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County in Stamford, which picks up food in my neighborhood. Kate Lombardo, the executive director, said that she would love to have the van but was concerned about insurance costs. "Moving another vehicle in would take us over budget," she said.
 I also called my church, First Presbyterian in Stamford. My pastor, the Rev. Blair Moffett, was also hesitant."The downside is you take on a car that you need to insure and to repair," he said. "It's not a freebie."
 I WAS becoming discouraged. But then he said that if someone in the congregation desperately needed a car and couldn't afford one, the church could pass it on. The Good News Garage (877-448-3288 or www.goodnewsgarage.com), a car donation plan run by Lutheran Social Services of New England, has a program like that. The group usually doesn't resell the cars but it gives them to people who need them for work. 
 Frankly, the idea of getting the van to someone who could actually use it is attractive to me. And if I donated it to my church, there might be another financial benefit.
 I asked my pastor if I could subtract the van's value from my annual pledge. "I would hope not," he said, sounding surprised.
 Hey, I was just asking.

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB; 
Thanks, Boss. Next Time, Make It a Lump of Coal.

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

 BODY:
The holidays are a time for giving. Nobody ever said that choosing an appropriate gift is easy, but sometimes holidays in the workplace seem to lack a generous spirit.
 As some people put it, "What goes around comes around." But let Norma Tavis of Vancouver, Wash., tell her own story. 
 "I was a legal secretary my entire working life, mostly in Lower Manhattan," she writes. "I was able to take dictation, person to person, for hours at a time without discomfort, and then transcribe my notes, without error. I was good!
 "One year, one of my employers gave me $10 as a Christmas bonus. I was so insulted that I purchased a gift certificate for that amount and gave it to him." 
 Mrs. Tavis knew whom she was dealing with. "That was Scrooge in person," she writes.
 Not long afterward, she quit. 
 Once upon a time, with college and the Navy behind him, Sanford Teller of New York, now the owner of a public relations business, was eager to begin his career in that field.
 "I landed what appeared to be a promising job in New York with a recently formed trade association established to promote West German cameras and optical equipment in the American market," he writes. "Until I joined the staff, it had been a two-person operation, run by an executive and his secretary. Now there were three of us sharing one large, open space.
 "My boss was very formal, in his appearance as well as his demeanor. Always wore a bow tie and almost never took off his suit jacket."
 He also says that while he and the secretary had always addressed each other by their first names, his boss insisted on being addressed with the title "Mr."
 "And each time he planned a trip to the association's headquarters in Cologne, he called it 'a state visit,"' he says.
 Mr. Teller had been working there 10 months, when, on the last workday before Christmas, the boss asked him to stay late because he had something he wanted to say to him.
 Visions of sugarplums danced in Mr. Teller's head. "Having been highly complimented on my performance on many occasions, and knowing that the association had presented several industry reporters with gifts ranging from Leica cameras to fine leather briefcases, I eagerly anticipated going home with a great Christmas gift," he says.
 Mr. Teller says the boss praised his work, then smiled and said, "You've been here almost a year, and you've become a valuable member of my team, Sandy."
 From now on, he said the boss told him, he could call him by just his first name.
 And that was Mr. Teller's Christmas gift.
 Nevertheless, it was better than what Dick Villari received. "I can't say that I ever received a gift that I didn't appreciate, but I did receive a Christmastime phone call that required a lot of thought," he writes from Buffalo, where he is a consultant for a health insurance company. 
 "I had been with a previous employer as the chief executive of a division for six months when my secretary, who was also new to the company, received a phone call from the division president's secretary."
 Her message, he says, was this: The president's policy was that he was to receive a Christmas gift from each person, like Mr. Villari, who reported to him directly, and that each of those gifts should cost about $100.
 Mr. Villari checked with several of his peers. Yes, it was true, they said. This was the president's policy, and it had been his policy for as long as they had been with the company.
 Mr. Villari writes: "I asked what would happen if someone did not give him a gift." He was told that no one knew, because no one had been either brave enough or dumb enough to refuse.
 "So I bought him a suitable gift," Mr. Villari says.
 In return, he received a thank-you card.
 But no gift.
 Is no gift at all worse than a thoughtless, inappropriate gift?
 Consider the case of Tessa Craib-Cox, now the director of development at the Theater School at DePaul University in Chicago. "I was working in retail for a cutting-edge design company that had built its business and reputation on creative and focused customer service," she writes. "I still have the schedule somewhere to prove that I did not have a single day off from Thanksgiving to the New Year.
 "My husband had very recently and painfully recognized his alcoholism and gone through treatment. We were struggling to survive financially, put the family together again and make many adjustments to create a new and different way of life."
 The company where Mrs. Craib-Cox was working as a store manager 20 years ago was then a relatively small concern, and the upheaval in her life had not gone unnoticed.
 Right before Christmas, when the holiday gifts were distributed, Ms. Craib-Cox was given a willow basket. Inside, in gratitude for all the extra hours of holiday merchandising she had contributed, were six bottles of wine. "My gut reaction was, of course, horror, and not the expected rapture," she writes. "Even worse, I was made by superiors to feel really guilty at my lack of appropriate appreciation."
 Not long afterward, Mrs. Craib-Cox found a new job. "The family survived, and the episode now seems sadly inept rather than malicious," she writes. She still has the willow basket to remind her to be attentive to signs that it is time to move on.
 A few years ago, when Dorothy T. Wass of Topsfield, Mass., was working as a teaching aide at aregional junior high school, she and other members of the staff were presented with a Christmas gift of poinsettias. But they came with a condition.
 "We were to return the plants in time for the annual Christmas concert," Mrs. Wass writes. "They were to be used as decorations for the stage during the performance. 
 "We were able to retrieve the plants after the concert, but we decided that we would have a little fun with our gifts."
 The months passed, and now it was June, a time for the end-of-the-school-year party for the faculty and staff, when one attendee is singled out for a tongue-and-cheek award named for the hind end of a horse.
 The recipient was the principal. The award was the dead poinsettias.
 Mrs. Wass writes, "I must say that he accepted his gifts very graciously."

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
Interpreter for Toyota's Growth

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
AS Washington lobbyist for the Toyota Motor Corporation, James R. Olson spent years developing relationships on Capitol Hill and in the White House. But in 1995, he thought that his political world had come to an end. That May, Mr. Olson watched in dismay as the Clinton administration threatened to place a 100 percent tariff on sales of Japanese luxury cars in the United States, part of a trade war with Japan over American companies gaining access to its market.
 The dispute was resolved a month later, but not before Mr. Olson vowed to expand Toyota's leverage in the United States. He figured that the Japanese company's clout would be much greater if it had factories in more than just one state: Kentucky. 
 Toyota now has five American plants -- in Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia -- and one under construction in Texas. When Mr. Olson retired this month after 18 years as Toyota's field general in the American political and economic wars, he was pretty confident that the automaker was finally safe from Detroit's protectionist volleys. 
 "We've got 35,000 employees and $14 billion invested" in dealerships, development centers and factories across the United States, said Mr. Olson, 62, who joined Toyota in 1985, after working for the Ford Motor Company.
 In an interview, Mr. Olson said the political environment had changed greatly during his tenure: "What are you going to do, blow up our plants? We have countless political allies that like Toyota and would be willing to stand up for us." 
 "We're too embedded here now" to be threatened by protectionism, he concluded.
 Toyota, whose biggest market is the United States, has said that its intent was to build vehicles close to its customers. But Mr. Olson bluntly acknowledged another factor. "There is a business reason, but there is also a political reason," he said.
 He defends his willingness to leverage Toyota's economic capital by pointing to the tactics of Detroit companies, longtime powerhouses on the Washington scene. "The Big Three have used government affairs as an offensive weapon for years," he said. "They know how to use their political networks and do so superbly." 
 Such forthrightness has made Mr. Olson one of the most visible and controversial figures in the American automobile industry in the last two decades. He is fond of pink dress shirts and navy pinstriped suits, has a cackling laugh that can be heard a block away and has a gutsy pragmatism about the automotive game.
 Mr. Olson and his wife, Mary Ann, who have a grown son, Cameron, divide their time between New York and a sprawling post-and-beam house, which Mr. Olson helped design, in North Carolina.
He expects to remain a consultant to Toyota, where he was an interpreter of American ways for a succession of Japanese executives who were initially skittish about having too large a profile in the United States. One who listened most closely was Toyota's chairman, Shoichiro Toyoda, an architect of its American expansion plans. Mr. Olson met Mr. Toyoda in November 1985, when the diminutive Mr. Toyoda traveled to inaugurate Toyota's plant in Georgetown, Ky. 
 Mr. Olson, much taller, feared that a regular-sized American lectern might make Mr. Toyoda seem even shorter. So he called friends at a parts supplier and ordered a motorized lectern that could be adjusted for height. Arriving for the ceremony, Mr. Olson discovered that Mr. Toyoda's assistants had set the lectern for his height, then taped the controls shut. While Mr. Toyoda and the lectern were in harmony, the shortened stand made Mr. Olson look like Quasimodo by comparison, he recalled, laughing.
 Always concerned about appearances, Mr. Olson regularly conducted market research to gauge how Americans felt about buying cars from a Japanese company.
 The latest surveys, taken this fall, showed that 75 percent of Americans did not consider a company's nationality in choosing a car, Mr. Olson said. That is up from 63 percent just after the September 2001 terrorist attacks. And it is 15 percentage points higher than equivalent surveys showed in 1992, which Mr. Olson considers a turning point for foreign auto companies in the United States.
 Public opinion, as measured by the surveys, began to shift in the wake of the 1992 trip to Japan by the first President George Bush, accompanied by Chrysler's former chief executive, Lee A. Iacocca, and other Detroit automobile executives, he said.
 Mr. Olson speculated that American consumers were disillusioned by seeing Mr. Bush, who famously fell ill at a banquet, lobby the Japanese government on Detroit's behalf. "That really backfired on the Big Three," Mr. Olson said.
 But as one of the first Americans to join a Japanese company, Mr. Olson has felt Detroit's bite. On the day he resigned from Ford's public relations department, he said, he was given an hour to pack his things and was escorted out of Ford's headquarters by security workers. With one exception, none of his co-workers said farewell. 
 "The only person who had the class to say goodbye was Edsel," Mr. Olson said, referring to Edsel B. Ford II, a company director and Henry Ford's great-grandson.
 MR. OLSON said he never regretted switching sides. Even in his 18 years at Ford, its engineers recognized the quality of Toyota's cars and its manufacturing expertise, he said. Detroit's bosses were a different story. 
 "I sometimes think top management may have underestimated us," Mr. Olson said.
 Not anymore. In August, Toyota outsold the Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, in cars and trucks, not including the Mercedes luxury brand, in the United States, though Chrysler has surpassed it narrowly each month since. Toyota, meanwhile, passed Ford in global sales for the third quarter, to become the world's second-largest auto company, behind General Motors. 
 Toyota's chief executive, Fujio Cho, is pushing the company to capture 15 percent of the global market by 2010, similar to what G.M. has now.
 Mr. Olson, however, is not underestimating Detroit's ability to rally. "I've seen the Big Three time and time again come back from the brink of death," he said. "If they hit a lot of doubles, triples and home runs, they could bounce right back."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Weak Dollar Has Put U.S. Assets On Sale

BYLINE:  By DANIEL GROSS; Daniel Gross writes the Moneybox column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
IF currencies were basketball teams, the dollar could be this year's version of the New York Knicks, who have lost about two-thirds of their games this season. With each passing week, the once-mighty franchise slips further in a league increasingly populated by European andAsian talent. 
 In 2003, the American dollar has fallen about 19 percent against the euro, and around 10 percent against the British pound. And the dollar has not fared much better against other currencies of major trading partners like Japan and Canada. 
 Bond market analysts worry that a weak dollar and low interest rates will encourage foreign investors -- particularly Asian and European investors who finance so much of our government debt -- to invest elsewhere. 
 That would be disastrous. With the overall trade deficit widening, securities are among the most significant American exports.
 But selling government bonds is just one of many ways we repatriate capital. The dollars we send into temporary exile come home in the wallets of British tourists at Disney World, or through stock purchases by European pension funds. Dollars also return when Japanese golfers buy villas in Hawaii or when German companies snap up American competitors. And with the dollar significantly weakened, all these assets are effectively on sale.
 Some indicators point to an increase in cross-border investment of late. For 2003, European companies announced acquisitions of American companies worth $13 billion, compared with $44 billion in 2002, according to Thomson First Call. But nearly 40 percent of the year's total -- or $5.1 billion -- came in the fourth quarter, more than double the pace of the third quarter. 
 Many deals have occurred this month. Henkel, the German consumer products company, agreed to buy the Dial Corporation for $2.9 billion, and announced last week that it was buying the hair care company Advanced Research Laboratories for an undisclosed price. Also last week, a federal bankruptcy court judge approved the sale of assets of Rouge Industries to the Russian steel maker Severstal. 
 Rebecca McCaughrin, an economist at Morgan Stanley, suggests that these deals are a harbinger for 2004.
 "We've seen domestic mergers and acquisitions activity rise, and that generally leads to spillover in cross-border deals," Ms. McCaughrin said. 
 The strength of foreign currencies is also having a salutary impact on tourism. Now that the euro goes much farther at the Venetian resort in Las Vegas than it does in Venice, European tourists, who account for 45 percent of all overseas arrivals and spent about $22 billion in 2002, are returning to the United States. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that there were 2 percent more visitors from Western Europe in September than in September 2002. There were 5 percent more visitors from Britain, 13 percent more from Italy and 15 percent more from Spain. For 2004, the Commerce Department projects a 6 percent increase in visitors from Europe. 
 "The weak dollar couldn't have come at a better time," said Andrea Stokes, director of marketing and international research at the Travel Industry Association of America, a trade group in Washington. 
 IT makes sense that tourists would flock to areas where their domestic currency packs the greatest punch. But when it travels around the globe, money does not always behave so rationally. 
 When the dollar falls, foreigners might be expected to dump fixed-income assets like bonds and buy stocks -- especially now that stock markets are strengthening. But in the third quarter, according to the Securities Industry Association, foreigners bought $155.9 billion worth of American bonds while selling $2.6 billion in American equities. Over all, foreign acquisitions of American securities in the first nine months of 2003 totaled $539.9 billion, just short of the record $547.5 billion for all of 2002. In other words, as the dollar skidded, cash flowed into American markets at a healthy rate this year. 
 But the stream of foreign investments was counterintuitively channeled into safe government bonds, not stocks.
 What gives? Perhaps European shoppers simply aren't as accustomed to discount shopping as we are. What's more, when it comes to buying stocks, European investors, who piled into American stocks at the height of the market, have proved to be lousy market timers. 
 "They've pared back their stock investment very significantly in the past two years, and they haven't returned to the market," Ms. McCaughrin of Morgan Stanley said. "They largely missed out on the rally of the past six months."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
Want to Pump New Life Into a Fund? Change Its Name

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of CBS MarketWatch. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
INVESTORS apparently pay much attention to mutual funds' names. Funds that change names often receive a significant increase in inflows, even when they have not altered their investment strategies.
 Though this behavior appears irrational, it is widespread, according to a recent study conducted by three finance professors, Michael J. Cooper and P.Raghavendra Rau, both of Purdue University, and Huseyin Gulen of Virginia Tech. They examined 296 stock mutual funds in the United States that changed their names from April 1994 to July 2001 by adding or deleting the words "value," "growth," "small" or "large." The professors' study is online at papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract--id=423989. 
 The researchers found that the bulk of these funds changed their names either to remove any association with a lagging investment style or to create an association with a strong style. In the late 1990's, for example, most changes involved eliminating the words "small cap" and "value" or adding the words "large cap" and "growth."
 The researchers found that these funds had a significant increase in new investments after the name changes. Using a complex statistical technique, they estimated how much the funds' net assets would have grown in one year without the name changes. On average, the funds' actual total assets were 22 percent greater than the estimates a year after the name changes.
 The average fund in the study had $299 million in net assets when it changed its name. The findings mean that one year later, the average fund had $65 million more assets than if it would have had by keeping its old name. Across all 296 funds in the sample, that translates into a total shift of more than $19 billion.
 The increased inflows do not necessarily mean that investors were responding to name changes alone. Some funds might have altered their investment strategies at the same time they changed their names, so investors might have been reacting to those new strategies, too.
 But while some renamed funds did change their investment approaches, the researchers found that many others did not. And the assets of both types grew at similar rates after the name changes.
 The researchers also looked at the possible role of advertising but found further evidence that investors were reacting primarily to the name changes alone. Though funds that increased their ad budgets had higher inflows, so did funds that did not increase their advertising, as well as those with no advertising budget at all. 
 Of course, if funds improved their performance after the name changes, they could argue that the changes were more than cosmetic. But the researchers found just the opposite, on average. They compared each fund with a control group of funds that owned similar stocks, as indicated by factors like market capitalization and the ratio of price to book value. They found that the average renamed fund lagged behind its control group by 2.3 percent over the year after its name change.
 The new study shows that many investors are choosing mutual funds based on factors having nothing to do with the funds' actual performance or strategies. Professor Cooper says he believes that investors would be better served by using objective criteria like past performance, turnover rates and expenses in deciding among funds.
 IN January 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that prohibits mutual funds from using misleading names. The rule was adopted six months before the end of the period analyzed by the researchers, so the study sheds little light on whether the rule will be effective in reducing the number of funds that make purely cosmetic name changes.
 But the researchers doubt that it will. They note that the S.E.C.'s new rule puts no restrictions on funds' use of the words "growth" and "value." Further, funds whose names include "small cap" or "large cap" are restricted in the kind of stocks they own only if they have defined such terms themselves. If they have not, the new S.E.C. rule leaves them free to use those terms in any way they wish.

So, There May Be Jobs After All

BYLINE:  By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
 So your child goes off to college, you hover at the doorway of her room for a year or two, then finally, stealthily, move in some books, the extra computer, perhaps an easy chair. Then -- surprise! -- four years later she moves right back in. 
"Sorry, Dad, no jobs." And farewell empty nest. 
 Not to worry, says Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm. Yes, many jobs are taking a fast freighter to China, but the aging of the baby boomers -- yes, you with the creaky knees -- will help set off "a surge in job creation next year," says John A. Challenger, the firm's chief executive. Some jobs, like financial planner and physical therapist, simply can't be exported. Thats the theory, anyway. HUBERT B. HERRING

HEADLINE: Where U.S. Translates As Freedom 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Maureen Dowd is on vacation.

DATELINE: WARSAW 

 BODY:
I found the cure.
 I found the cure to anti-Americanism: Come to Poland. 
 After two years of traveling almost exclusively to Western Europe and the Middle East, Poland feels like a geopolitical spa. I visited here for just three days and got two years of anti-American bruises massaged out of me. Get this: people here actually tell you they like America -- without whispering. What has gotten into these people? Have all their subscriptions to Le Monde Diplomatique expired? Haven't they gotten the word from Berlin and Paris? No, they haven't. In fact, Poland is the antidote to European anti-Americanism. Poland is to France what Advil is to a pain in the neck. Or as Michael Mandelbaum, the Johns Hopkins foreign affairs specialist, remarked after visiting Poland: "Poland is the most pro-American country in the world -- including the United States." 
What's this all about? It starts with history and geography. There's nothing like living between Germany and Russia -- which at different times have trampled Poland off the map -- to make Poles the biggest advocates of a permanent U.S. military presence in Europe. Said Ewa Swiderska, 25, a Warsaw University student: "We are the small kid in school who is really happy to have the big guy be his friend -- it's a nice feeling."
Indeed, all the history and geography that Western European youth have forgotten, having grown up in a postmodern European Union, are still central to Polish consciousness -- well after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. "We still remember many things," said Jan Miroslaw, 22, also a Warsaw University student. "We are more eager to cooperate with America rather than just say 'no.' The West Europeans just don't remember many things -- like the wars. They live too-comfortable lives."
No wonder then when young Poles think of America, they think of the word "freedom." They think of generations of U.S. presidents railing against their communist oppressors. There is a huge message in this bottle. In the Arab world, because of a long history of U.S. support for Arab autocrats, who kept their people down but their oil flowing to us, America was a synonym for hypocrisy. In Poland, where we have consistently trumpeted freedom, America means freedom. We need to remember that. We are what we stand for.
Poland's becoming a member of the E.U. will give the U.S. an important friend within that body -- a counterweight to those E.U. forces that would like to use anti-Americanism as the glue to bind the expanding alliance and that would like to see the E.U. forge its identity as the great Uncola to America's Coca-Cola.
But as powerful as Poland's bond to America is these days, we dare not take it for granted. Poland has some 2,400 troops in Iraq. That's the good news. The bad news is that roughly 75 percent of Poles oppose their deployment. Polish officials will tell you Poland sent troops to Iraq to help keep the Americans in Europe. But the public doesn't make such connections, and most people don't understand what their boys are doing there or what Poland is getting out of it. (How about a few extra visas for Poles?) If the U.S. ends up in a mess in Iraq, so will Poland. Many "old" Europeans will then laugh at Warsaw, and that would be highly corrosive for Polish-U.S. relations.
At the same time, once Poland is fully ensconced in the E.U., its young people will grow up in that postmodern E.U. nirvana, where anti-Americanism is in the drinking water. Sadly, many education and public diplomacy programs the U.S. directed at Eastern Europe after the fall of communism have been cut or redirected to the Muslim world. Bad timing.
There is now a competition between the United States of America and the United States of Europe for the next generation of Poles -- who don't all have their parents' emotional ties to the U.S. -- "and the U.S. is losing this competition," says a Polish foreign policy expert, Grzegorz Kostrzewa-Zorbas. "The new generation in Poland likes American pop culture, but it has less contact with American high culture -- like education. It is so much easier for young Poles to go to university in Germany or France."
Given Poland's geography and history, there's a limit to how far it will drift from America. Poland will never be France. But we shouldn't assume it will remain the Poland of 1989 forever, either, and if it doesn't, that could have real consequences for America's standing in Europe.

HEADLINE: Our Towns; 
On Farm of Pampered Cows, Couple Cringes at the Mention of Mad Ones

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LEZIN JONES

DATELINE: LAFAYETTE, N.J. 

 BODY:
ANY doubt about who is really in charge at Ken and Julie Bechtold's dairy farm along a rustic ribbon of road is dispelled at the stockade fence out front. There, outside a weathered barn, a yellow sign urges visitors to yield with a simple message: "Moo Cow Xing."
 "You have a happy cow, you get good cheese," Mrs. Bechtold said Friday, explaining the care -- she unapologetically calls it pampering -- lavished on the 20 or so "moo cows" here who have lived their entire lives in something of a cattle-based bubble. "We have what's called a closed herd. All our cows were born here on this farm. We've never brought cows in. When you do, your disease level goes up, you don't know where that cow came from, how it was treated." 
 The answers to those kinds of questions became all the more important last week when agriculture officials announced that a dairy cow from a farm near Seattle had tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. It was the nation's first reported case of the disease, which can be fatal to people who eat infected beef.
As beef exporters grappled with a widening ban on United States meat, and as agriculture and public health officials tried to determine how the Washington State Holstein contracted the illness, farmers like the Bechtolds wait and hang on every report.
"I heard on CNN they've quarantined more cows," Mrs. Bechtold said, referring to the isolation of thousands of cows under way at two Washington farms. "I hope they can retrace where this cow came from."
The Bechtolds said they had no reason to fear for the health of their cows. Besides being far from the Washington case, the Bechtolds said the closed-herd upbringing of their cows provided another layer of insulation. "We're lucky in that respect," Mr. Bechtold said.
But even as they brush aside fear for themselves, the Bechtolds wonder about the effects of the disease's discovery on their fellow farmers and on the future of agriculture in general and farming in the region in particular.
"This is going to hurt a lot of people," Mr. Bechtold said, standing near an old barrel-shaped butter churn while his wife arranged wrapped wedges of Colby and cheddar cheeses that they sell out of the barn on their 140-acre farm. "You really wonder about the financial impact."
Already, Mr. Bechtold said, in a quarter-century or so of milking cows and making cheese, he has watched the number of fellow farmers dwindle. While thousands of dairy farms once dotted the state, he said, now there are slightly more than a hundred.
"It's kind of sad to see the farms disappearing," he said. "It's discouraging what's been happening to some farms. Especially in New Jersey."
Part of the change can be attributed to the spread of development across the state. Part can be traced to the changing economic forces that have been at play for years on farms in New Jersey and across the nation.
"It's not easy doing business here," he said. "The taxes -- believe me, we're not in this for the money."
And it is with an emphasis on the economical that the Bechtolds run their place, called Stoney Croft Farm. The cheeses that the couple produce are as well known for their high quality as for their low cost, with customers regularly driving to the farm in Sussex County, about 20 miles from New Jersey's northernmost point.
THE cows -- of the Jersey breed, of course -- meander about the farm between sunup and sundown milkings and chew cud at the edge of a fence, with yellow ID tags affixed to their ears. Walking across a muddy, haystrewn path on Friday, Mrs. Bechtold seemed to dote on the animals as she would on her three children.
"They all have names," she said, referring to the cows (her children do, too: Jennifer, Kenny and Kate).
Partly to keep costs down and partly out of respect for tradition, the Bechtolds have largely done without modern farming equipment. "My oldest tractor is a 1948," Mr. Bechtold said. "My new one is a 1978."
Besides the cheeses they produce, the Bechtolds have a small garden where they grow vegetables for themselves.
As Mrs. Bechtold sees it, "We figured we've got the manure, why not use it?"

HEADLINE: Two-Front Battle in Puerto Rico: Crime and Apathy 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R. 

 BODY:
It was a long autumn for Nestor Muniz, and the winter, he guesses, will be longer still. A stray bullet killed his daughter Nicole as she drove past a housing project here one August night, a month before her 17th birthday.
 She was among more than 750 people killed this year in Puerto Rico, a small island (only twice the size of Rhode Island) with a homicide rate more than three times the United States average. More murders per capita take place here than in any American state, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 Since Nicole's death,which was widely covered by the news media here, Mr. Muniz has made lowering crime on the island his mission. He has organized a march with other relatives of murder victims, lobbied politicians and worked to inspire a collective sense of responsibility among Puerto Ricans -- the most crucial step, he says, toward abating the problem. 
"It's going to take a big, big change," Mr. Muniz said, taking a break at the furniture shop he manages in San Juan, where 1.5 million of the island's nearly 4 million residents live and where most of the island's violent deaths take place. "People here have been like, 'If it didn't happen to me, I don't care.' " 
Nicole's killing commanded more attention than most because of its randomness, but the outpouring of concern did not slow the homicide rate, which the police attribute largely to the drug trade. Three superintendents of the Puerto Rico Police Department have quit in two years; the latest, Victor Rivera Gonzalez, is leaving Jan. 6. In an interview, he said that even a last-minute offer to raise his $107,000 salary by $20,000 did not sway him.
Superintendent Rivera said the root problem was insufficient staffing: Puerto Rico has 21,000 police officers, and by his reckoning, the force should grow by at least 4,000. He said he envied New York City's police force, but in fact the ratio there is about the same: 40,000 officers for a population of 8 million.
As of Dec. 14, New York had 569 murders this year, according to the New York police. Puerto Rico had 752 by Dec. 17. Last year there were 774 murders on the island, up from 744 in 2001, the F.B.I. said. 
The island's major newspapers keep a running tab of the deaths, with graphic articles about shootings, stabbings and carjackings almost daily. This month alone, there have been articles about a quadruple homicide outside a San Juan disco and the shooting death of a nursery school teacher in Juncos who was hunted down in her home by a gang seeking revenge on her brother. 
After Nicole's death, Superintendent Rivera announced a new war on street crime that doubled police patrols from 4 p.m. Friday to 4 a.m. Monday, sent frequent helicopter patrols over known drug-dealing areas and dispatched K-9 units to sniff out guns at nightclubs, where many shootings have taken place.
The police have also tried to reduce an estimated 1,500 drug puntos, or distribution spots, with frequent raids, Superintendent Rivera said. And the department has shortened the initial training time for recruits, to get them on the streets faster.
Because of its 270 miles of coastline, much of it isolated, and its location between South America and the United States, Puerto Rico has long been a way station for shipments of cocaine and marijuana. About 75 percent of the drugs move on to Miami, New York and other points north, Superintendent Rivera said.
Young men peddle the drugs that remain here, often in the housing projects of San Juan, he said. The competition among dealers is fierce and often fatal. 
Murders of drug dealers and their associates are by far the most common kind, which leads some Puerto Ricans to play down the problem.
"It's not a good idea to be on the street or in the discotheque at 3 or 4 in the morning," said Freddy Van, a cabdriver in San Juan. "But if you go early or don't go at all, you don't have a problem." 
Superintendent Rivera says he wants a law requiring bars and nightclubs to close at 2 a.m. A Puerto Rican legislator proposed such a bill after the quadruple murder outside the disco, but the island's powerful tourism industry is fighting it. 
Another proposed law would increase penalties for killings by stray gunfire, which are on the rise. But some legislators said creating laws would not help, pointing to a strict gun-control law passed in 2000 that they said had done nothing to diminish a huge illegal gun trade. 
"We have enough laws on the books," said Iris Miriam Ruiz, a minority leader in the Puerto Rico House of Representatives. "We need to enforce the existing laws better and deal with the economic problems of Puerto Rico." 
Ms. Ruiz said it would also help to find a police superintendent who would stay on the job, because the department was "a difficult bureaucracy" and new superintendents needed time to win the loyalty of the force. Ms. Ruiz, like other members of the minority political party, the New Progressive Party, said Gov. Sila Calderon was too soft on crime and Puerto Rico needed a return to mano dura, or strong hand tactics.
Ms. Calderon's predecessor, Pedro Rosello, used that approach in his two terms in the 1990's, when the murder rate dropped after the number reached a high of 995 in 1994. Now Mr. Rosello is running for governor again and promising to bring back mano dura, an approach that involved, among other things, having the National Guard swoop down on housing projects.
Like Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's anticrime tactics in New York, Mr. Rosello's drew complaints of civil rights violations. 
Superintendent Rivera said that the news media had exaggerated the crime problem and that most categories of crime, including robbery, rape, aggravated assault and car theft, were down this year. He said it would be hard to adopt New York's intensive crime-fighting tactics without sharply raising police salaries, which he said start at about $21,300. In New York, the entry-level police salary is $34,500.
One point on which Superintendent Rivera and his critics agree is that Puerto Rico's bail laws need overhauling. The island's Constitution does not allow judges to deny bail and gives them wide discretion in setting it, so many accused killers go free while awaiting trial.
In one high-profile case, a man accused of killing a teenage trumpet player turned out to have been out on bail after being charged in another killing months earlier.
Mr. Muniz said that bail reform would help but that the biggest change had to be in the apathetic attitude he says has engulfed the island.
When a convoy of police vehicles descended on a drug punto in the Vista Hermosa housing project one recent Friday night, a crowd that had gathered for an outdoor party watched impassively as the police arrested a teenage boy and an older man, seizing bags of crack cocaine and marijuana from their pockets. 
A woman in a Santa Claus hat had been selling rolling papers at a table on the sidewalk and seemed to barely notice the disruption.
Mr. Muniz, who said he was never involved in politics or crime fighting before Nicole's death, said that his best consciousness-raising effort to date had been a march on Oct. 5, Nicole's 17th birthday. As many as 1,000 relatives of murder victims participated, he said, many carrying photos of their dead.
Next year, billboards will go up around San Juan with a picture of Nicole, who had hoped to study fashion design at Boston University, and a line from an essay she wrote shortly before her death: "I only wish that violence comes to an end." Mr. Muniz hopes people will notice.

HEADLINE: Despite Warnings, Industry Resisted Safeguards 

BYLINE:  This article is by Christopher Drew, Elizabeth Becker and Sandra Blakeslee.

 BODY:
During a House debate last summer over a possible ban on using sick and injured cows for meat, Representative Gary L. Ackerman, a Democrat from New York, held up a photo of a crippled cow and cautioned that such "downer animals" carried the highest risk for mad cow disease.
 But Representative Charles W. Stenholm, a powerful Texas Democrat and a rancher, countered that the government's screening program was tight enough to prevent any problems. 
 "The picture the gentleman is showing, that sick animal, will never find its way into the food chain," Mr. Stenholmsaid. "Period."
But now that a downer cow has the first confirmed case of mad cow disease in the United States, critics are assailing the beef industry and federal regulators for not taking greater precautions since the disease exploded overseas in the mid-1980's. 
Though some scientists had long warned that mad cow disease would eventually appear in the United States, cattle owners and meatpackers repeatedly resisted calls for a more substantial program to test for the disease, and the Agriculture Department went along with them. Congress came close three times to banning the sale of meat from downer cows -- ones that are too sick or hurt to amble into slaughterhouses -- only to see the industry's allies block each of the bills at the last moment. And proposals for systems to track which farms produced sickened cattle -- now required in Europe, Canada and Japan -- also languished for years here.
"This is one of these times when unrealistic optimism triumphed over responsibility to the public," said Carol Tucker Foreman, a consumer advocate who ran the Agriculture Department's food-safety programs in the Carter administration.
If a number of countries stick with hastily announced plans to ban American beef, she added, "I think the damage to the American meat industry costs infinitely more than anything U.S. cattlemen would have had to pay to do this thing right."
Each year at least 200,000 cattle -- and perhaps many more -- are downers, and some of these animals could have mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which can destroy an animal's brain and central nervous system and lead to similar ailments in humans who eat diseased meat.
That is only a small fraction of the 104 million cattle in the United States and the 35 million slaughtered each year, suggesting that the industry may have taken a disproportionate risk in continuing to sell meat from the downers.
Government officials and packinghouse executives are now rethinking their positions and promising at least to consider many of the proposed changes they once rejected. They still say it did not make sense to do more earlier, given how expensive it would have been to guard against a disease that was not yet visible.
Many industry and government officials say they also believe that the disease and the damage from it can be contained, and that view was bolstered yesterday by the news that the Holstein cow that had the disease in Washington State was imported from Canada. The cow, which was slaughtered on Dec. 9, had not shown any signs of mad cow disease, but was considered a downer because it had been injured in giving birth to a large calf. The first North American case of mad cow disease was discovered last May in a downer cow in Wanham, Alberta. 
"We're looking at what Europe is doing, what Canada is doing," Alisa Harrison, the press secretary for Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman, said in an interview Friday. "Yes, we're looking at the whole system, we're looking at all options."
But a close look at how the crisis developed also reveals broader problems that could complicate efforts to restore consumer confidence and to ensure that no other tainted meat enters the food supply.
The nation's meat inspection system has undergone sweeping changes, with the government shifting much of the responsibility for safety to meat companies. 
Beef production has also become increasingly concentrated and industrialized. Many packing plants now use advanced systems to extract more meat close to the animals' bones and spinal cords, increasing the chances that possibly risky tissue from their central nervous systems could end up in hamburgers and other processed meat.
And some scientists question whether government officials, even now, appreciate the full extent of the dangers. In some ways, the Agriculture Department still "believes its own propaganda," said Dr. Stanley Prusiner, a Nobel Prize-winning neurologist at the University of California in San Francisco and an authority on these types of diseases.
In Britain, more than 4.5 million animals have been killed since the disease was discovered in 1986. A related brain-wasting disease has killed 137 people, mostly in Britain.
The United States banned imports of live British cattle, and in 1997, the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees what animals eat, drafted a regulation: no more feeding bits of cows and other ruminants back to cows.
But critics say the regulation leaves glaring loopholes. Rendered cattle can be fed to pigs and chickens, which can then be fed back to cows. Cow blood, which cannot be guaranteed free of disease, is widely fed to calves as a "milk replacer." Deer that may be infected with disease can be rendered into cattle feed. Enforcement of the regulation, they say, has been lax.
Dr. Stephen Sundlof, an F.D.A. veterinarian, said that "with any new rule there is a period of time that compliance is not 100 percent -- and then it gets better." 
But Dr. Prusiner said the cow, whether born in the United States or Canada, "probably didn't get sick by eating anything."
He said regulators in both countries believed that mad cow illness was akin to a viral disease that "comes from the outside" and can be stopped by putting animals into quarantine. But given his suspicions that mad cow disease is endemic in both countries in low levels, it is more likely that the one or both cows had a spontaneous homegrown form of the disease and not the British version. He also said that using cow blood as a milk replacer is "a really stupid idea."
Food-safety experts said that slaughter and meatpacking procedures also may have to change.
Several major restaurant chains -- including McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King -- have long refused to serve meat from downer animals to avoid health problems.
But powerful lobbies representing big ranchers and dairy farmers have stopped efforts in Congress in each of the last three years to prohibit slaughtering these animals for meat sold elsewhere.
Chandler Keyes, the Washington lobbyist for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said that because some downer animals merely have injuries like broken legs, his group would continue to resist efforts to declare all downer animals unfit for human consumption. That is a decision, he said, that is best left to federal veterinarians who inspect cows as they enter the nation's slaughterhouses.
But trusting federal veterinarians to find mad cow disease may be a mistake, an inspector at a Midwest meatpacking firm said. The inspector said that in his two years overseeing the killing of 600 downer cows, the veterinarian at his plant tested the central nervous tissue of only one of the animals. "All we tested downer cows for was antibiotic residue," said the inspector, who insisted on anonymity to protect his job.
Wayne Pacelle, the chief lobbyist for the Humane Society of the United States, said the economic devastation wrought by the nation's first confirmed case of mad cow disease was already changing the minds of some politicians who previously had been unmoved by arguments about public health and animal husbandry.
"Now the public realizes there is no firewall between B.S.E. and the American consumer," Mr. Pacelle said. 
Last year, the Agriculture Department tested processed products from plants that use advanced meat recovery systems, which are meant to strip the last bits of meat from close to an animal's bone and spinal column, and found that 35 percent of the meat tested positive for central nervous system tissue.
Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group, said the Agriculture Department still considered the presence of such tissue in meat to be more a labeling than a safety issue. Felicia Nestor, the food safety director at the Government Accountability Project, another advocacy group, added that given the possible dangers of eating such tissues, "it's just unacceptable that the American public should be put in this position." 
Computerized systems for tracing food have also grown overseas. Outbreaks can be blocked early if an animal's history can be quickly obtained.
After waging their own battles with mad cow disease, Europe, Canada and Japan instituted government-regulated mandatory systems to trace animals from their birth to the grocery. They also require extensive testing of cattle herds, not the small risk assessment used in the United States that tests 20,000 to 30,000 cows or about 0.03 percent of the herds.
The United States does not require or have such records. But Agriculture Department officials said they would now speed up a project to create a national database for tracing animals. The system would be voluntary; farmers and ranchers could decide whether to register their animals in the data bank.
"At some point this could become mandatory," Ms. Harrison said.
In an industrialized agriculture system like the United States, where animals can be shipped thousands of miles in the course of being birthed, fed, slaughtered and packaged, the possibility of an uncontrolled outbreak has increased exponentially, the officials say.
"We need to be able to instantaneously track the history of a sick animal," said Mr. Stenholm, the Texas lawmaker, who also said he was ready to work on ways to keep sick animals out of the food system.
Dr. Prusiner and others say the only hope is better testing. Neither the United States nor Canada has ever carried out surveillance efforts beyond testing small numbers of downer cows, based on the notion that if mad cow disease were to appear, it would most likely show up in older animals showing signs of illness. By contrast, Western European countries tested 10 million cows last year, and Japan tested each of the 1.2 million cows it slaughtered.
Some experts say advances in the tests making them cheaper and quicker to conduct could make it easier to expand their use here and provide an answer to the crisis.
Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut and cochairwoman of the House Food Safety Caucus, said, "In this new age, where most cattle in the United States don't eat grass in open pastures, where they're crammed into feedlots most of their lives, and where we don't know where our meat comes from, I think it's time we take our safety precautions into the modern era."

Still Making Deals At a Different Table
 Years back, Theodore W. Kheel helped settle so many big and bitter labor disputes in New York and around the country that he was widely regarded as the maestro of mediation. 
 These days, he still uses his talent for bringing people together, though for ends other than soothing passions at the bargaining table. 
Mr. Kheel, a lawyer who specialized in seeking consensus in union-management wars, was most often spotlighted as a mediator and union adviser in the 1960's and 70's, when he helped settle transit and newspaper strikes in New York as well as labor clashes in the railroad, airline and waterfront industries nationally.
In the 1980's, Mr. Kheel, then in his 70's, was called on to help in fewer conflicts. Old friends among union leaders died or retired, he lacked the same ties with their successors, and he and Edward I. Koch, the mayor, had an antagonistic relationship.
But phasing out of labor strife did not mean a slower life. "I'm as active now as I ever was," Mr. Kheel, now 89, said by phone from the office of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, the law firm in Manhattan with which he is affiliated. 
He has long been involved in environmental protection campaigns and groups, including Earth Pledge, a nonprofit group he founded in 1991. 
He represented the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude in negotiations that led to the city's approval last January of their proposal to decorate Central Park's walkways for two weeks in February 2005 with gates topped by translucent saffron-colored fabric. Profits from selling products based on the project will go entirely to environmental and arts causes.
On the business side, Mr. Kheel is chairman of Grupo Punta Cana, a company that has turned a 30-square-mile stretch of coastal jungle in the Dominican Republic into a tourist and vacation-home resort. 
The company sponsors a foundation for environmental research in the area, which is consistent with the outlook Mr. Kheel expressed. "We want both to protect the environment and encourage economic development," he said, ever the mediator.

In Brooklyn, a Name Is Looking for a Home
Whither BoCoCa?
TriBeCa has stuck, a 1970's name for a Lower Manhattan area thought of as a triangle below Canal Street. So too SoHo, 1960's coinage for an area south of Houston Street. NoLIta (north of Little Italy) and Dumbo in Brooklyn (down under the Manhattan Bridge overpass), both of more recent vintage, seem to have a foothold. Not so LoBro, minted in the 80's for a stretch of Lower Broadway in Manhattan but not much heard today.
BoCoCa is an umbrella coinage for three adjacent Brooklyn areas, Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. Christopher Branstetter, a Web site designer, says he and Sandra Paez, who owns a women's clothing shop called Frida's Closet on increasingly trendy Smith Street running through Carroll Gardens and Boerum Hill, came up with BoCoCa three years ago for a local shopping guide.
Travel and other magazines and NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors' bureau, have cited the name.
On and around Smith Street last week, of six local residents stopped at random, four knew of BoCoCa but said they considered themselves residents of Carroll Gardens, while two said they had never heard of BoCoCa. It is safe to say there is a way to go before we know whether BoCoCa will catch on or be a no go like LoBro.

 BODY:
Long Island First
 Frank Tracy Jr.'s motive was simple. He wanted Long Islanders to know that they lived in a special place. 
 "Frank had this vision that we needed an organization that would raise awareness about all the riches we have on Long Island," said Brian R. McCaffrey, president of Promote Long Island, the not-for-profit organization that Mr. Tracy founded a decade ago. 
 A tireless cheerleader who earned the nicknames Mr. Long Island and Mayor of Long Island, Mr. Tracy never stopped pushing his mission statement: "To foster and promote public awareness and appreciation of Long Island, particularly the benefits of living on Long Island and Long Island's parks, beaches, cultural, educational, recreational and tourist activities," it began. He also championed the regional economy and activities designed to rally Long Island spirit and pride.
 In spite of objections from the post office, Mr. Tracy lobbied local businesses to put Long Island, or at least the abbreviation, L.I., in their addresses -- as in Melville, L.I. N.Y., where he lived. 
 "We just aren't a suburb of New York," Mr. McCaffrey said. "We are Long Island."
 The son of a military man, Mr. Tracy graduated from Sewanhaka High School but spent much of his youth moving from military base to military base before his family finally settled in Floral Park. 
 "His biggest thing was he wanted to have the rest of the United States and world to know about Long Island," said Yolanka Tracy, his wife of 46 years. "He was for Long Island." 
 Mr. Tracy had a home improvement company, Long Island Cnstrctn Inc., when in the late 1980's he started attending meetings of different Long Island organizations like the Hauppauge Industrial Association looking for people to support his cause. 
 "He was quite unstoppable," said Stephanie Tracy, one of his five children. 
 Mr. Tracy networked endlessly, setting up Promote Long Island kiosks at local events, handing out free I Love Long Island pins when someone joined his organization. His car was covered in Promote Long Island stickers and even his license plate revealed his loyalty: Lng Ilnd. 
 Mr. Tracy died on Jan. 9 of lung disease. He was 69.

A Trailblazer in Blue
 When Thomas S. Gulotta, then the Nassau county executive, told William Willett that he was going to recommend him as the next police commissioner in Nassau County, Mr. Willett struggled to fight back tears. 
 "He said to me, 'I never thought I'd be police commissioner,"' Mr. Gulotta said, recalling that moment in 2000. "'You made a dream of a lifetime for me and for my family come true."'
 Mr. Gulotta said that Mr. Willett, the county's first African-American police commissioner, was the consummate professional law enforcement officer.
 "He earned the respect of the members of the department as well as the residents of the community," Mr. Gulotta said. "He treated everyone with dignity and respect and with fairness. He knew law enforcement and the operation of the Nassau County Police Department inside and out, as thoroughly as anyone could." 
 The Police Benevolent Association president, Gary DelaRaba, said Mr. Willett had compassion for police officers. "He knew what cops went through on the street," Mr. DelaRaba said. "He instilled a pride into the police officer. It wasn't about having the job. It was about doing the job." 
 Mr. Willett was born in Glen Cove and lived in Westbury. When he joined the police department in 1953 after serving in the Navy during the Korean War, there were only 18 blacks in the department. 
 He never planned to be a police officer, said Floretta Willett, his wife for 47 years. He took the civil service test because he couldn't find another job and joined the police force as a patrolman. 
 Mr. Willett once recalled that the first accident he responded to as a rookie took place when a white driver noticed him standing on a street corner with a gun. Startled, the driver backed her car into the one behind her. 
 He spent evenings studying for career advancement exams that propelled him through the ranks. "He knew he had to be 110 percent," Mrs. Willett said. 
 He became the first black patrol supervisor and the first black precinct commander. He was first deputy commissioner for seven years before being named commissioner of a department with a $520 million budget. He served as commissioner only 14 months before reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70.
 Mrs. Willett said that her husband's father, Marston, would tease him, saying, "How are you going to be a police officer? They don't take people with flat feet."
 Years later, she said, her husband would respond, "See, Pop, those flat feet brought me a long way." 
 Mr. Willett died on April 12 of lung cancer. He was 71.

An Oyster Bay Guardian
 Dorothy Horton McGee was more than the historian for the Town of Oyster Bay. With her wide-brimmed hats and the parasol she carried on hot, sunny days, she seemed to become part of the very history she wrote and recorded. 
 "Ms. McGee was someone who went well beyond keeping records and telling you on what date something happened," said John Venditto, the town supervisor. "She made the history of this town relevant to today."
 Ms. McGee, who took on the historian's job in 1982 for $1,500 a year, had a North Shore patrician's genteel, guarded manners and regal bearing. But she knew her stuff, and didn't hesitate to speak out. When a group approached Mr. Venditto and asked the town to accept the wooden sailing vessel Regina Maris, the supervisor figured it was worthwhile but deferred to Ms. McGee's judgment. 
 "Ms. McGee in her inimitable style let us all have it," Mr. Venditto recalled. "She pointed out the folly of the town getting involved in an undertaking of this vessel."
 Some time later, the city of Glen Cove agreed to park the ship along its waterfront. It sank at the dock, becoming a political and governmental quagmire. 
 "She had done her homework and understood the problems," Mr. Venditto said. "She did not want to see anything adverse happening to the town."
 Michael Spinelli, an architect, worked with Ms. McGee on the town Landmarks Preservation Commission, which she helped found and had headed since 1990, landmarking 40 buildings. 
 "If a notable person lived there or a significant historical event took place or if the building had architectural significance, Dorothy would speak to all three," Mr. Spinelli said. He recalled that she pulled out photographs of Theodore Roosevelt speaking to residents from the back of a train in her effort have the Oyster Bay railroad station landmarked. 
 Ms. McGee was the historian for Matinecock and, during the 1950's, an assistant historian for Roslyn. She wrote books about the signers of the Declaration of Independence, the framers of the Constitution, Herbert Hoover and Alexander Hamilton, and edited the first three editions of "Landmarks of Long Island," a guide for the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities, where she was a trustee. 
 She also was director of the Raynham Hall Museum, the spy house that belonged to the Townsend family in Oyster Bay. But the story Ms. McGee told in the book, "Sally Townsend: Patriot" (1952, Dodd, Mead) about the uncovering of the Benedict Arnold plot to betray West Point, raised eyebrows. "It's not a version accepted by Long Island historians, but it made a very good story," said Richard Evers, the Hicksville library historian. 
 Ms. McGee, who lived in Locust Valley, died on Oct. 12. She was 89. 

A Star in the Firmament
 George Plimpton, the literary journalist, editor of The Paris Review, amateur athlete and patrician about town, was the author of more than 30 books and a cameo actor in multiple movies. But on the East End of Long Island, Mr. Plimpton was best known for his penchant for pyrotechnics.
 For boaters anchored in Three Mile Harbor and thousands of spectators on shore, Mr. Plimpton was the voice of the Boys and Girls Harbor fireworks fund-raiser held on Bastille Day for nearly three decades. 
 "The Boys Harbor party celebration was synonymous with George Plimpton," said Felix Grucci Jr., the fireworks impresario and former congressman. "George had a deep passion and a love for fireworks. He always referred to them as the eighth wonder of the world."
 On his way to the South Fork where he summered, Mr. Plimpton often stopped by the Grucci fireworks factory in Bellport, where he struck up a friendship with Felix Grucci Sr. On one of his early trips, Mr. Grucci gave him a care package of sparklers, spinning wheels and Roman candles. That Fourth of July, Mr. Plimpton lit them in his East Hampton backyard.
 After the fireworks got Mr. Plimpton into trouble with the local police, he looked around for a new venue. Tony Duke, a longtime friend, asked Mr. Plimpton if he could do the fireworks as a benefit at Boys and Girls Harbor, a 30-acre summer camp on the East End for disadvantaged youth. 
 "George turned the tables," Mr. Duke recalled. "He said to me, 'I had been wishing that you, particularly with Boys Harbor, would come along and ask me to do the fireworks. Would you do me the great honor?' He made me feel I was doing him a favor and it was just the opposite." 
 That first year the fireworks show, put on with the Gruccis, raised $10,000. Last summer's 27th event brought in more than half a million dollars, Mr. Duke said, figuring that Mr. Plimpton raised $5 million to $7 million for the camp. 
 Mr. Grucci said, "The creativity that George had and the ability that George had to portray this passion that he had for the youth, for the community, for the East End and for fireworks, he rolled that all into one to create this magical and mystical night." 
 Mr. Plimpton died on Sept. 26. He was 76.

In Her Own Right
 The Nobel prize-winning author John Steinbeck wrote "The Winter of Our Discontent" and "Travels With Charley" in the waterfront studio of the Sag Harbor bungalow he shared with his wife, Elaine, until his death in 1968. But it was at Sag Harbor's Bay Street Theater that Elaine Steinbeck found her own spotlight. 
 Theater had been her passion since childhood. In the 1940's, she was one of the trailblazing women who worked as stage managers with "Oklahoma!" on Broadway and the national tour of "Othello" with Paul Robeson. But after she married Steinbeck in 1950 -- her first marriage to the actor Zachary Scott ended in divorce -- she backed away from show business. 
 When the Bay Street Theater opened in 1992, Mrs. Steinbeck's interest was aroused. Sybil Christopher, the co-artistic director and one of the founders of Bay Street, recalled being advised to contact Mrs. Steinbeck. 
 "We said, 'We don't know her,"' Ms. Christopher said. But while the theater staff was out to lunch one day, Mrs. Steinbeck dropped off a letter thanking them for starting the theater, promising to help and including "a really big check," Ms. Christopher said.
 They met the next day. 
 "She was phenomenal; she just understood," Ms. Christopher said. "She was always supportive. From Bay Street's point of view, she was such a treasure." 
 With Mrs. Steinbeck's help, the theater took off. She joined the board of directors and came to all the opening nights, readings and children's theater productions. In 1998, the main stage was officially named the Elaine Steinbeck Stage at Bay Street Theater with a gala salute that included the playwrights Terrence McNally and Edward Albee and the actor Gary Sinise. Bruce Springsteen sang "Oh, What a Beautiful Morning." 
 Mrs. Steinbeck donated her husband's first-edition books to the theater's benefit auctions. She also was co-chairwoman of the annual book and author fair at Southampton College of Long Island University. The event, named for her husband, raises scholarship funds for the school's writing program and helps maintain the John Steinbeck writer's room on campus. 
 "I want theater in my life till the day I die," she once said. "I think my friendship with the Bay Street means that I will."
 Mrs. Steinbeck died on April 27. She was 88. 

Working With Light
 Thirty-four synagogues, churches and libraries on Long Island are bathed in the light that passes through stained-glass windows created by Paul Wood. A prolific artist who ran an art school for adults out of his Port Washington studio for more than half a century, Mr. Wood used bits of glass to recreate biblical scenes and create a sense of spirituality. He also adorned the houses of worship with tapestries and mosaics. 
 "Great art comes from simple things done exquisitely well," Mr. Wood was known to say. Some of his stained-glass windows grace Young Israel of West Hempstead and Young Israel of Long Beach. His mosaics are installed at his own church, Our Lady of Fatima in Manorhaven, and at the public library in Port Washington, where he long headed the local art council. In 1996, he designed the sanctuary at Temple Emanuel in Great Neck. It also houses a permanent exhibition of his work, including watercolors and oils that are musings on the themes of family, faith and love. 
 Mr. Wood was a portrait painter when he joined Albert Wood and Five Sons, his father's Port Washington furniture and architectural business, which specialized in church interiors. While his brothers carved altars and doors, Paul Wood designed stained glass. When church work dwindled, he concentrated on synagogues. 
 Mr. Wood died on Aug. 24 of Parkinson's disease. He was 81.

In Honor of Athletes
 In the late 1980's, a handful of guys tossed around the concept of a Long Island Sports Hall of Fame. Nassau County had its own small display at the Nassau Coliseum. So Arthur Figliozzi, along with Guy (Butch) Dellacave and Jack Foley, decided to create a Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame. 
 In 1990, it began inducting local athletes, sportswriters, coaches, sports administrators and special Olympians. Among those honored that first year were the baseball player Carl Yastrzemski and the football player Boomer Esiason.
 Mr. Figliozzi, a Commack resident, was superintendent of the Wyandanch school district for about 14 years, then led the Eastport school district until he retired in 1988. But he earned his 1997 induction into his own hall of fame after a 30-year career as a basketball coach, referee and rules official.
 "When there would be a problem, whether it was with the officials' association or the Hall of Fame, he was able to get people together, to get them to work together," Mr. Foley recalled. "He was a team builder."
 Mr. Figliozzi remained the Hall of Fame's president until last December. His dedication paid off. With $750,000 raised to build a museum, library, sports research and educational center, the conversion of a former bank building on South Ocean Avenue in Patchogue are scheduled to begin shortly, said Edward J. Morris, the Hall of Fame's executive director. The museum is scheduled to be open by next summer. 
 Mr. Figliozzi died on Jan. 31 of an aneuryism. He was 75.

A Medical Love Affair
 When there was a thunderstorm and the lights went out at Michael Maffetone's Setauket home, the first thing the former director and chief executive officer of Stony Brook University Hospital did was open the front door and make sure the lights at his hospital, visible through the trees, were still on. 
 "He felt that the hospital belonged to him," said Dawn Maffetone, his widow, recalling how she teased him about his inability to delegate. "Everything about it he felt reflected on him."
 He grew up in Bethpage and earned a doctorate of arts in medical technology from Catholic University in Washington. He started his career at the Community Hospital of Glen Cove and Syosset Hospital, then worked in Baltimore and Chicago before coming to Stony Brook in 1994. Wearing his sunglasses and signature fedoras -- black or brown in winter depending on his suit, straw with changing hatbands that matched his tie in summer -- Dr. Maffetone went to work placing the hospital among the top teaching hospitals in the nation. 
 He made it the first in the United States to voluntarily extend maternity length-of-stay, allowing regular maternity patients to stay two days and women who had had Caesarian sections to spend four days.
 "He knew what he was doing was right," Mrs. Maffetone said, adding that it was later mandated that health insurance had to pay for that length of stay. "He said, 'I'm doing it."' 
 Dr. Shirley Strum Kenny, president of Stony Brook University, said: "He was bright, energetic, witty, creative, and determined to make our hospital the best. He made us laugh, but he made us think too. He cared deeply about people and worked hard to make sure that everyone who came to the hospital had not only the best of medical care but also the sense of caring that people need when they are sick or injured."
 Dr. Maffetone helped bring the Carol M. Baldwin Breast Cancer Research Fund Inc. to the university and served as its president. The fund raised more than $1 million earmarked for breast cancer research at the hospital. 
 He died of a degenerative nerve disease on Jan. 19. He was 52. 

A Fighter for Hofstra
 A big-hearted entrepreneur, Allan Tod Gittleson directed his philanthropy toward Hofstra University. Mr. Gittleson, who was known as Tod, was a trustee and chairman of the board at Hofstra for 30 years. 
 "Hofstra's success is in large part due to his generosity and his leadership," said Stuart Rabinowitz, Hofstra's president.
 In 1987, Mr. Gittleson, the son of a coal miner, set up a distinguished academic scholarship with millions of his own money, offering full tuition for four years. Additionally, he supported university programs for minorities and the disabled. He also helped found the Hofstra School of Law.
 "His goal was to make it the finest university on Long Island and make sure that anybody who was worthy was able to come to it whether they had the money or not," said Maurice Deane, who served with Mr. Gittleson on the board and is also a former chairman.
 Mr. Gittleson's involvement was also hands on. He founded the Hofstra Health Dome, a $1.2 million fitness center that heralded the university's entry into the field of preventive sports medicine and was a departure from traditional curriculum. The center, which he ran as chief executive officer from 1981 to 1997, tailored fitness programs to individual need, stress testing and weight loss through behavior modification, and would help people develop a healthy lifestyle and stick with it. 
 "It takes a rare person," Mr. Gittleson said at the time, "to sustain the discipline to keep fit without structure and supervision." The profits from the fitness center went back into scholarship funds. 
 In the greenhouse of his Old Westbury home, Mr. Gittleson loved to fiddle with new varieties of plants. He always donated his best pumpkin to the fitness center, recalled a daughter, June Gittleson. Friends and neighbors were always invited to share in the garden's surplus bounty. 
 Mr. Gittleson died of Alzheimer's on Aug. 12. He was 86.

Breast Cancer Warrior
 Statuesque and vivacious, Diane Sackett Nannery was always the leader of the women in the rolling support group known as the "Breast Cancer Victory Train," an annual two-hour Long Island Rail Road ride from Penn Station in Manhattan to Port Jefferson. During one such journey to a breast cancer pep rally at John T. Mather Hospital, one of many events that Ms. Nannery organized as a breast cancer activist, hundreds of survivors and women who were still battling breast cancer traded war stories. Every day, Ms. Nannery told them, was a victory. 
 "I've always been a strong person," Ms. Nannery said in an interview during the 1998 ride. "I'm not a better person, because I was a nice person without breast cancer. I didn't need breast cancer to be a better person. But I'm different." 
 When Ms. Nannery, a postal worker, learned she had breast cancer in 1993, she immersed herself in learning about the disease and became one of the Island's most outspoken breast cancer activists. 
 "I feel like I've found my mission in life," she once said. 
 She launched a successful campaign for the nation's first breast cancer stamp, started the first Postal Workers Breast Cancer Coalition and helped create a check-off box on New York State tax returns for contributions to breast cancer research. 
 "She focused like a laser beam not only on researching the disease and its treatments, but also on putting into motion trailblazing initiatives that she thought, accurately, would benefit untold numbers of women," said Joan Swirsky, who wrote the book "Coping With Lymphedema" with Ms. Nannery. 
 When Ms. Nannery began crusading for the stamp in 1994, her request to the United States Postal Service was denied 27 times over 17 months. She persisted and the 32-cent stamp was issued in 1996. 
 "I had to do something, and I chose this," she said at the time. "The Postal Service is in a unique position to use stamps as public service announcements. They are a great awareness tool." 
 Even as she underwent chemotherapy treatments, Ms. Nannery reached out to other breast cancer patients, holding their hands and accompanying them to the hospital. She gave powerful and influential speeches on lymphedema to such institutions as the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society. But when her activism led her to appear in television ads in Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's 1998 campaign, she was criticized for endorsing a political candidate. 
 "None of us as individuals have the power to get the money we need," she said. "But we do have the power to raise our voices to elect officials who will help our cause. I wish breast cancer wasn't political, but the reality is, it is." 
 Ms. Nannery died of breast cancer on Nov. 19. She was 51.

Helping Rockville Centre
 When William Harry Lister, known as Harry, successfully ran for mayor of the village of Rockville Centre on the independent home rule party ticket in 1945, his platform was giving the village government back to the people. Elected time and again, he did more than that as mayor for 22 years. The secret to his success in creating a vibrant downtown was parking lots.
 "During his early years he condemned a lot of property and bought a lot of property for the village in the business district and built parking lots behind the stores," said Eugene J. Murray, the current mayor. "If he hadn't done that we wouldn't have a business district today." 
 For much of his tenure Mr. Lister ran the village from his Buick dealership. As the village grew, he expanded its power plant and water system, drawing on his training as an engineer.
 "As a result the Rockville Centre area prospered in those days and today it is still growing strong," Mr. Murray said. 
 Mr. Lister turned a marshy area into baseball fields, now Lister Park, and oversaw a 15-block urban renewal project that used federal money to transform the western end of town into a vibrant commercial area with low-income housing.
 "That was a very old area of Rockville Centre and not known as one of the better areas, and now it's as nice as can be," said William Lister Jr., of Huntington Bay, one of his three children. 
 He modernized the police department, adding more officers and a fleet of motorcycles, and built the first village-owned headquarters for its volunteer firefighters. 
 Mr. Lister served as president of the New York State Conference of Mayors and led the state's Municipal Electric Utilities Association. During the A. Holly Patterson administration, he served as commissioner of welfare for Nassau County. Mr. Lister died on Oct. 10 at age 102.

A Mover at Adelphi
 Timothy W. Costello, then the president of Adelphi University, sat in his wood-paneled office on the Garden City campus one morning in 1983 and he explained why, after a decade of steady growth past the 11,000-student mark, the 7 percent plunge in Adelphi's enrollment was "probably the best thing that has happened to Adelphi in 15 years." 
 "In times of easy growth, colleges had grown fat and lazy," Dr. Costello said. "Now Adelphi is responding by sharpening its mission."
 Under Dr. Costello's leadership from 1972 to 1985, Adelphi established several new departments, launched its adult degree program, added the Gordon F. Derner Institute for Advanced Psychological Studies, expanded the Swirbul Library and built new facilities including the Olmsted Theater and a new home for the School of Social Work. 
 "He did everything in his power to make it flourish," said Harry Davies, now chairman of the art and art history department and the dean of Adelphi's College of Arts and Sciences under Dr. Costello. "He was a builder." 
 After World War II, Dr. Costello, a psychologist and the author of several books, taught psychology and management at New York University's Graduate School of Business Administration. He worked as New York City deputy mayor under Mayor John Lindsay before returning to academia at Adelphi. "He liked the idea of being able to have a broad impact on organizations," said Peter Costello, a communications professor at Adelphi and one of his six children. 
 Dr. Costello was credited with creating a collegial campus culture at Adelphi. Under his administration, the adult baccalaureate program was started, high school juniors and seniors were allowed to take Adelphi courses for college credit, and a program bringing guest scholars to the university was instituted. To attract the best and the brightest, he instituted a merit-based scholarship, reducing tuition by one-third to students in the top 10 percent of their high school class. 
 "Places like Harvard, Yale and Stanford get the cream of the crop, so they don't have to worry about the quality of their student body," Dr. Costello once said. "Adelphi is a fine institution, but it's not Harvard. If we want to attract good students, we need to let them know that we'll help them come here."
 Dr. Costello died on Oct. 20. He was 87.

Mr. Long Beach
 Ed Buscemi used to say that Long Beach was the jewel of the South Shore. A big guy with a big heart, Mr. Buscemi helped make it that way. During more than 50 years of community service, he kept watch over the oceanfront city as lifeguard, police commissioner, city council president and executive director of the Chamber of Commerce. 
 "He came to be known as Mr. Long Beach," said his son, Vincent, a Long Beach police lieutenant. 
 Mr. Buscemi was a member of the City Council for 13 years, including a two-year stint as president. Before that, he rose from patrolman through the ranks of the local police. After retiring, he worked full time as a volunteer doing public relations for the local chamber of commerce, helping grow it to one of the Island's largest. He was named the Long Beach chamber's Man of the Year for 2001.
 "He was always touting Long Beach to people who didn't know it," Vincent Buscemi said, recalling his father's pride in the city's renaissance in the 1980's after two decades of blight. "He wanted to impress on other people that Long Beach had changed." 
 Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg was Ed Buscemi's lifelong friend. "He was a champion for all the people in our city," Mr. Weisenberg said. "He was a people person who appreciated differences and saw differences within our community as the strength of our community and advocated for the diverse population that we have."
 Mr. Buscemi lobbied for the local senior citizen center, to fix the recreation hall, stem erosion on the beach and for bayfront development.
 "He thought he could make Long Beach a better place," Vincent Buscemi said. "He was very into proper planning and the proper use of space." Before running for the city council, Ed Buscemi, a former Marine, studied towards a master's degree in suburban planning at Adelphi University.
 Mr. Buscemi was born in the Bronx but summered in Long Beach as a child, moving full time in 1948 with his widowed mother. 
 Mr. Buscemi died on Feb. 13. He was 74.

Devoted to the Union
 When William H. Harrison, a union leader, ordered a nighttime shutdown of bus service in 1970, disrupting Nassau bus lines, the move worked. With the help of $60,000 from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, theft-proof exact-fare coin boxes were installed in the buses, making it unnecessary for drivers to carry change. 
 "When New York City installed the exact-fare system on its buses, we became sitting ducks," Mr. Harrison said at the time. After a driver was robbed and beaten in Inwood, he even followed the buses in his own car at night to make sure drivers on certain routes didn't get hurt. 
 "We've been knocked off six times since then, and we've had enough of it," Mr. Harrison said. "We want these dope addicts and thieves off our backs." Other private bus lines followed suit and soon passengers all over the county were depositing exact fare into a locked box when they boarded the bus. 
 Mr. Harrison's transportation career included being a mechanic and driver. But as president and business agent for Local 1061 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, he represented more than 1,000 bus drivers and mechanics in Nassau from 1968 to 1979. 
 "He was a strong union personality," said Robert Harrison, a son, recalling that his father succeeded even though he only had an eighth-grade education. "He was passionate about his men and his unions." 
 He usually got what he wanted. In 1972, Mr. Harrison took his drivers out on strike to protest plans by the Jerusalem Avenue Bus Lines to fire five drivers and drop two runs. The strike knocked out service for 3,500 daily riders. The following year, Mr. Harrison worked out a deal guaranteeing job security to drivers affected by the county's takeover of private bus lines. 
 When the union failed to win changes in a pension fund during a 1974 labor dispute, Mr. Harrison claimed the county's offer and timing were unacceptable. He told his drivers not to put in their customary overtime. 
 "This is no job action," Mr. Harrison said at the time. "This is only taking advantage of our God-given, union-won right to two days off." He later worked in labor relations for the New York City Transit Authority.
 Mr. Harrison was born and lived in Hempstead his entire life. He died on May 13 of cancer. He was 83.

A Caring Heart
 When Agnes and John Funk retired and moved to Flower Hill in 1970, two years after they married, they decided to devote their lives to charitable activities even if that meant giving away more than their $25,000 a year in investment income.
 "We were trying to show people by example you don't have to have money to give," said Mrs. Funk, now of Upper Brookville. "Give time. When you have money, you'll give."
 Last month, the Funks were honored by the Association of Fundraising Professionals' Long Island chapter as the outstanding philanthropists of the year. 
 John Funk delivered Meals on Wheels for 20 years. With his wife, he was involved with the National Center for Disability Services in Albertson, St. Mary's Children and Family Services in Syosset and St. Christopher-Ottilie Services for Children and Families in Sea Cliff. He was a trustee with the Children's Medical Fund at Schneider Children's Hospital and sponsored 12 children at about $5,000 each for heart surgery through the Gift of Life, an organization that brings needy children from around the world who need heart surgery to places like St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn. Mr. Funk often picked up the children when they arrived and brought them to his home. 
 The couple went to about 25 black-tie charity events a year. They bought tables, worked on committees and sold tons of raffles. After bidding $5,500 at a gala auction to conduct the Long Island Philharmonic, he wore a white tuxedo and tails for his debut. 
 "If it weren't for volunteers, there would be a lot of places folding," Mrs. Funk said. 
 He worked in management at United Parcel Service until he retired 35 years ago. In recent years, he helped raise Nicole, 7, the daughter of their former cleaning woman, and took care of a neighbor's son who was ill. 
 "He was always doing," Mrs. Funk said. "He was always helping. He never objected to anything." 
 Mr. Funk died on Sept. 10. He was 94.

Helping the Disabled
 Kathleen O'Callaghan Maul's dream was a Universal Access Center, a facility that took into account the needs of individuals with a wide variety of visual, hearing and mobility impairments and disabilities. Ms. Maul's vision included a new school, diagnostic and treatment clinics and a health and fitness center with accessible locker rooms, swimming pools and a gym. As the executive director of United Cerebral Palsy of Greater Suffolk, she turned that concept into plans for a two-story, 104,000-square-foot structure on 10 acres in Central Islip. Construction is scheduled to begin next year. 
 "As an agency everything that we are is due to her," said Stephen Friedman, who succeeded Ms. Maul as executive director of United Cerebral Palsy of Suffolk, one of the Island's largest not-for-profit organizations with about 1,000 employees serving more than 4,000 individuals each year. 
 Under Ms. Maul's leadership for the last 12 years, U.C.P.-Suffolk expanded to include a children's center, adult day programs and a diagnostic and treatment center with numerous clinics throughout Suffolk. It also built 23 family-style residences for people with disabilities and a 12-unit apartment complex in Central Islip for independently functioning individuals. 
 Ms. Maul was soft-spoken, but when she was advocating for individuals with disabilities, hers was a strong voice. One moment she was the business executive, the next she was on the floor hugging a child, Mr. Friedman recalled. 
 "Her heart was huge," Mr. Friedman recalled. "Whether it was children or adults, it didn't matter. It didn't matter what disability. For her everybody was the most important."
 George Maul, her husband of 28 years, said his wife's motto was "whatever it takes to get the job done," adding, "She ran the house and me the same way." 
 Ms. Maul, who lived in Huntington Station, was also a soccer mom who raced home on the first day of school each year to bake chocolate chip cookies for her children, Brehan, now 26, Meaghan, 22 and Katharine, 18. She loved to read and to go to the beach in Montauk and at Robert Moses State Park. 
 Ms. Maul died on April 5 of lung cancer. She was 52.

Backing Black Studies
 The abolitionist Frederick Douglass's words, "without struggle there is no progress," were at the core of William McAdoo's beliefs, said his wife, Joy Mahabir, of South Setauket. Dr. McAdoo was chairman of the Africana Studies department at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. 
 When he came to Stony Brook in 1978, Africana studies were a program, not a department. When black studies were being phased out at universities across the country in the 1990's, Dr. McAdoo mobilized faculty and students and bucked a trend.
 "He transformed it from a marginal program to a really good department," said Aaron W. Godfrey, a senior lecturer in the department of European languages at the university. "He was a guy who was in your face but always about the right thing. It wasn't about him. It was about racial justice. It was about people getting along with each other. It was about equity." Africana studies became a department in 1998. 
 The son of a Jewish mother and an African-American father who were labor organizers in Michigan, Dr. McAdoo was also a civil rights activist, writer and musician. In his quest for social justice, he was a bit of a curmudgeon, skilled at pricking peoples' consciences and saying exactly what he thought, regardless of whom he offended. In 2002, when Candace De Russy, a SUNY trustee, unsuccessfully tried to have African-American studies phased out, saying they had been incorporated into history departments and were "flabby, feel-good programs that carry an anti-American bias," Dr. McAdoo fought back. In letters to the editor and an article in Black Issues in Higher Education, Dr. McAdoo contended that to call such programs irrelevant was to disregard the history of the United States and the history of slavery and racism. 
 "Her statements are racist," Dr. McAdoo wrote at the time. "To say that most black studies programs are un-American smacks of McCarthyism, smacks of the whole fascist kinds of repression that took place in the 1950's in the U.S."
 During the civil rights movement, Dr. McAdoo composed and recorded an album of protest songs, "Bill McAdoo Sings," with Pete Seeger on the banjo. 
 After six years together, Dr. McAdoo married Dr. Mahabir last August. He died on Nov. 6 of leukemia at age 67.

How Much Is That Monkey in the Window?

BYLINE:  By JESSICA BRUDER

DATELINE: MOUNT HOLLY 

 BODY:
THREE of Mount Holly's monkeys went missing last month. 
 "Historic Mount Holly Monkey" was the first to go. The little fiberglass chimp covered in decoupaged photographs was supposed to raise people's holiday spirits, not their larcenous ones. But it disappeared, leaving residents baffled. 
 "We're not going to let anyone spoil our fun," said Lynne Lemyre, a community organizer who helped bring 14 monkey sculptures decorated by Burlington County artists to downtown streets here to help celebrate the new year. 
 In fact, two of the monkeys have been recovered and Ms. Lemyre has posted a reward of $200.40 for the return of the third. The amount of the bounty is reference to the New Year, as are the monkeys: according to the Chinese calendar, the Year of the Monkey begins on Jan. 22. 
 The monkey project was devised by Main Street Mount Holly, a downtown revitalization group powered by more than 100 volunteers that is fighting to restore an intimate neighborhood feel to downtown Mount Holly, in contrast with the wave of Wal-Marts, strip malls and asphalt lapping at the town's edge. Ms. Lemyre, who keeps a poster bearing the Japanese word "karoshi" -- meaning "death from overwork" - tacked above her desk in a tiny office downtown, is the group's executive director; she says she graduated to the organization's only paid position through "excessive volunteerism." 
 Main Street Mount Holly projects have included town festivals like Fire and Ice, an annual chili-cooking and ice-sculpting competition, along with efforts to retain local businesses and promote public art.
 The primate project began with an extensive search for a manufacturer who could supply 14 identical, unpainted monkey sculptures.
 "Out in Chicago, they had a mold that was particularly sensitive-looking, and sweet," Ms. Lemyre said. The figure, almost life-size at two and a half feet tall, had one drawback, though -- it wasn't quite a monkey. 
 "They're actually chimpanzees," Ms. Lemyre said conspiratorially. "They're primates." Close enough.
 When the chimps had been decorated by local artists, they were bolted to barrels that were in turn bolted to cement blocks intended to keep the barrels in place. 
 On Nov. 10, the monkey sculptures were installed on sidewalks in downtown Mount Holly. Within a few hours, "Historic Mount Holly Monkey" had vanished. "So Rousseau" and "Monkey Business" were the next to go. 
 For the volunteers of Main Street Mount Holly, the loss was frustrating. Each sculpture was an original piece, from the trompe d'oeil of "Brass Monkey" -- "he's not really brass, he's just painted to look brass," explained Ms. Lemyre -- to the Dadaism of "Chocolate Chimp," which was meant to resemble a large, monkey-shaped chocolate chip cookie. "Monkey Business," a sculpture in which Mount Holly's mayor, Donald Scattergood, saw a suggestion of his own likeness, was even dressed in a simian-sized business suit and spectacles.
 "Monkeys are touchable," said Irvane Spracklin, a retired social worker and a 40-year resident of Mount Holly who tried to make sense of the theft. "It's like taking home a stuffed animal, only this was a fiberglass animal." 
 She is the creator of "Historic Mount Holly Monkey," which she painstakingly covered in a decoupage of sepia-toned digital photographs depicting historic town landmarks. Of the three stolen sculptures, her monkey was the first to disappear and the only one that remains missing. 
 "I have no sympathy for those who stole them," Ms. Spracklin said, "but I understand why they would have wanted them. I got very fond of mine." Convinced that there was little hope of recovering the original, she recently completed a copy of "Historic Mount Holly Monkey." 
 To protect the remaining monkeys, Ms. Lemyre moved them to indoor display sites where they will remain until Jan. 24, when they will be auctioned off to benefit Main Street Mount Holly and the individual artists. The auction is planned as part of the Monkeys' Ball at Rancocas Valley Regional High School, which will feature the East River Ensemble from Chinatown in New York City performing traditional percussion and the dance of the Monkey King. 
 Though he is pleased that the remaining monkeys are secure, William Carrig, the public safety director of Mount Holly, says his detectives haven't abandoned their efforts to find "Historic Mount Holly Monkey." 
 And the town is pressing criminal charges against 22-year-old Brandon Bilyard, the man accused of taking "So Rousseau" and "Monkey Business." According to Mr. Carrig, Mr. Bilyard lives with his parents, who were taking boxes of Christmas ornaments down from the attic of their Pearl Street home on Nov. 28 when they came across the two monkeys.
 James Bilyard hauled both monkeys and his son down to the police station, Mr. Carrig said, adding that the town would prosecute because the primates were pricey. According to Ms. Lemyre, the monkeys have an estimated value of $650 apiece. "That's $1,300 worth of monkeys," she lamented.
 Brandon Bilyard has been charged with two counts of theft and criminal mischief. His trial date is pending. Mr. Carrig noted that, while Mr. Bilyard seemed "very remorseful," no one had been able to establish a motive for the theft. So on a recent December evening, a reporter paid a call to Mr. Bilyard to hear his side of the story.
 Standing outside on his family's porch in the winter chill, Mr. Bilyard seemed embarrassed and shy. Was he honestly the cause of Mount Holly's holiday headache? Did he take those monkeys?
"Yeah," Mr. Bilyard said. He hesitated and added, "I was just being a jerk." Then his mother emerged from the house. She shooed him back inside, slamming the door behind them.

A View of Outer Space? No, It's Just of Jersey City.

BYLINE:  By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

DATELINE: Jersey City 

 BODY:
VARGAS-SUAREZ UNIVERSAL'S matrix of lines and kaleidoscopic array of shapes at the Jersey City Museum is a monster. At 28 1/2 by 16 feet, it climbs up and around the staircase at the entrance to the museum. It is bold and intriguing, looming above you like some colossal ruin or a distant, mountainous urban sprawl. It reminded me of the view flying into La Paz, Bolivia. 
 In fact, the drawing, "Space Station: Jersey," presents a vision of Jersey City as urban space debris. The artist worked from satellite views of the city, images of the Hudson River waterfront and architectural plans of historic Jersey City buildings. He created the drawing freehand with permanent ink and then finished it with black latex paint. It took six weeks to complete. 
 If you try to link the title of the drawing to its specific imagery, there is a good chance you will blow a fuse in your head. Perhaps that is Mr. Vargas-Suarez's intention, to make us think for ourselves about what it means. My take is that it is a spectacularly eccentric project, the artist hoisting our eyes skyward to behold a quirky visual puzzle. It is just like looking at the stars.
 What I like about this drawing is the way it distills something sad, something alien about the ultra-urban American landscape. I often feel it in New Jersey, especially when motoring at night past acres of factories and warehouses. This is not a world for people, but for machines and automatons. 
 According to the press release, the drawing presents an exploration of the dynamics of urban space. Just how it does that is unclear, although the intersecting spears of light and profuse linear forms (moving over and into one another in constant, repeated movements) are meant to mimic flows of people and the constant growth and development of urban environments. Or so the press release says.
 Mr. Vargas-Suarez studied art history and astronomy, not studio art. No doubt his interest in astronomy accounts for the drawing's extra terrestrial setting. It might also account for the limited color scheme, with everything reduced to black or white, light or dark, positive or negative space.
 There is nothing beyond a perfunctory wall label to help viewers understand the drawing and explain why the museum chose it as its first semi-permanent installation. But its visual powers are lure enough.
 "Space Station: Jersey" is at the Jersey City Museum, 350 Montgomery Street, Jersey City, through August 2005. Information: (201)413-0303.

Ode to Commuting

BYLINE:  By ANDREA HONORE; Andrea Honore is an arts administrator at Johnson & Johnson and lives in Princeton.

 BODY:
I DRIVE to work alone in my car. This fact brings me into the blood brotherhood of New Jersey residents, as census figures show that three-quarters of us drive to work alone in our cars each day. The data also show that the average commute in New Jersey takes 30 minutes and is the third longest in the country. My commute, from Princeton to New Brunswick, takes 45 minutes, door to door. I wonder if other commuters in New Jersey, and throughout the nation, share the same mixture of affection and disgust for their commute that I have for mine. 
 In the mornings, particularly, I appreciate the buffer between home and work that is provided by my commute. It's a chance to savor my coffee and take in the change of seasons. Some days, it's the only chunk of time that I really have to myself. I always listen to the radio, and this is usually news on public radio. Owing to this radio habit, certain stretches of road have taken on the ability to unleash sudden but brief emotions related to September 11th, the recount in Florida or, more incongruously, Monica Lewinsky. But for the most part, my commute is a restful, thinking part of the day. I have scores of illegible notes scattered throughout the car, with the names of songs and recording artists, books and movies that I heard reviewed, and cryptic notes related to brilliant ideas that I tried to scribble down without taking my eyes off the road for too long. 
 When you drive the same route so often, certain landmarks take on a peculiar significance. There is a large dead tree along my route that is the favorite haunt of turkey vultures. I think this is because of the proximity of a quail farm that, in combination with a sudden sharp turn in the road, supplies a desirable yield of road-kill. Ten or twelve huge vultures will sit in this tree at one time, sometimes with their wings squared out to the sides. Around Halloween one year, I drove my children up to see it, but, of course, the tree was vulture-less. Thankfully, there is a habitually overdecorated house a bit farther along in my route (another landmark), and the fake hearse, tombstones and guillotine proved equally drive-worthy that day.
 Commuting is not all quiet meditation and autumn leaves drifting down upon the roadway, however. It is often quite dangerous. There have been the near misses when I almost didn't see the deer crossing, and angry fists brandished when I didn't push the light hard enough. Once I kind of fell asleep at the wheel and "came to," still driving, on a road I didn't recognize. There was also the time when a duck flew up from the side of the road and squished straight into my windshield. Swerving or even braking at that moment would have cost my life, instead of the duck's. Nonetheless, I cried most of the way to work and was terrorized by the sight of ducklings that I imagined as motherless for the next few weeks.
 Owing to the hundreds of hours that I have spent in my car listening to news radio, I am remarkably well informed about the negative impact of my commute on the larger world: the dangers of ozone layer destruction, the political ramifications of our reliance on fossil fuels and the effects of automotive pollution on both weather patterns and long-term health.
 The quality, availability and cost of public transportation are partly to blame. The end points on my commute are unusually well connected. Still, it is both more time-consuming and more expensive for me to commute by train. The last time that I tried to take the train home, it was unaccountably delayed and spent a very irritable hour and half locating and riding a bus home down Route 27.
 For many of us in New Jersey, public transportation isn't even an option. There are tens of thousands of desks just in the 18 miles between Princeton and New Brunswick that are completely inaccessible by public transport. Small wonder that Route 1 was voted the worst road in New Jersey by drivers who responded to the "Keep New Jersey Moving" Web site poll. And most foreseeable development in the area affirms rather than punishes our reliance on cars. 
 Given the economic and environmental ramifications of my commute, in fact, it's too bad that it isn't more uncomfortable or more costly. We are all admittedly creatures of comfort and, like all objects in nature, keep to the path of least resistance. So as long as my car has heated seats, a coffee holder and decent radio reception, I will guiltily, but comfortably, maintain my status quo among New Jersey residents and drive at least 30 minutes to work, in a car, alone.

If Beauties Multiply, They'll Be Plain to See

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI

 BODY:
THE American fascination with self-improvement, inside and out, has been documented in many variations. But the ardor for physical and aesthetic enhancement was best captured this year by "Extreme Makeover," an ABC reality program. In it, middle-class Americans -- a police officer, a waitress, a local radio D.J. -- were transformed by plastic surgery, sometimes several procedures at a time, from plain Janes and Johns into coiffed, glossed movie-star lookalikes.
 Along with the approval of Botox for wrinkle reduction in 2002, the popular neurotoxin that has conquered wrinkles, the show drew attention to the increasingly popular notion that plastic surgery is not just for the vain or the wealthy. 
 If cosmetic plastic surgery is available to the average consumer -- thanks in part to lending agencies that specialize in financing cosmetic procedures -- and no longer bears the stigma of vanity, the question arises: Are we on our way to becoming a nation of the surgically enhanced? If looking beautiful becomes as easy as buying a car or a dress, will beauty -- or an imitation of it -- become so commonplace as to be meaningless?
 The American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery reports that the overall number of cosmetic procedures has increased 228 percent since 1997. The numbers are likely to rise as the population ages, prices drop, younger patients seek out surgery, technology and genetic engineering generate new techniques, and more doctors from various fields offer cosmetic surgical procedures. 
 Surgical procedures will inevitably become less expensive, said Dr. Lloyd M. Krieger, a plastic surgeon who also has an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago, in part because procedures that 10 years ago took place in a hospital operating room and required expensive overnight stays now take place in a doctor's office.
 And, like any consumer product, as it becomes more popular, the laws of economics dictate that the price will come down. "Usually that does not apply to health care, which is bound up with insurance issues, but in the case of cosmetic surgery, people are using their own money so the typical health-insurance restrictions don't apply," Dr. Krieger said. Consumers approach cosmetic surgery as a retail decision, "as if they were buying a cruise, a vacation, a car."
 For a while at least, the distance between those who can afford to maintain a youthful-looking appearance, increasingly a sign of privilege, and the merely plain, the unretouched have-nots, will likely widen.
 New technologies will soon be available to draw in well-off patients who might never have thought of cosmetic enhancement. Dr. Steven A. Teitelbaum, a plastic surgeon in Santa Monica, Calif., predicted that the next milestone would be the control of tissue formation, whether to reduce scarring or grow new tissues.
 When surgeons can selectively grow tissue in the breast, Dr. Teitelbaum said, patients may face less risk than if they, for example, receive breast implants, which can rupture and cause complications and must also be replaced every few years. "When we can control scarring we can do operations we don't even think of now because of the massive scar formation," he said.
 Surely, a backlash against the artificial beauties will erupt. Not a chance, Dr. Teitelbaum said. Surgical work, when well done, is now subtle. "Most people aren't getting those bad face lifts anymore, where the eyes, lips and cheeks are distorted," he said. "If everyone getting plastic surgery looked like that, there would be a backlash."
 The aesthetically altered future would surely flummox Darwin. One New York surgeon, Dr. Michelle Copeland, suggested that cosmetically altered couplings could create some surprises. Say a man with a big nose and receding chin has a nose job and a chin implant. With his new profile he manages to marry a beautiful woman, who, by the by, had already had her ears pinned back, her sleepy-looking eyes lifted and her thin lips augmented. Their child might well be a surprise package with the big nose, the Dumbo ears, receding chin, saggy lids and thin lips. 
 "Well, then the child will simply have to start doing all the things his or her parents did," Dr. Copeland said with a sigh. "I've already seen it happen."

What We Said And What We Meant, A to Z

BYLINE:  By TOM KUNTZ

 BODY:
IN a sense, we are what we speak. Good thing the English language, the world's largest at some 650,000 words and growing, is eminently adaptable to the way people change.
 This year, adapt it did -- quickly and often with wit -- to modern war, economic uncertainty, technological progress, social change, you name it. 
 Herewith, an alphabet soup of coinages that came on the radar screen in 2003. Many 
 appeared in this newspaper; others were noted on wordspy.com, a Web site by Paul McFedries, a Toronto writer and linguaphile. 
 Some words are not new but took on new meanings, while others simply attracted unusual attention or gained wider currency.
 A is for augments -- people with implants that increase sensory capacity, like hearing, or change appearance, like breast implants.
 B is for bling-bling, the hip-hop term for diamonds and other jangly ostentation -- a word now so common that, according to news reports this year, the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary were considering adding it to their next edition. B is also for blogosphere -- the realm of bloggers, those who maintain Web logs of frequently updated entries on particular topics.
 C is for celebreality -- a TV show format in which one or more celebrities participate in real-life situations. (Think Paris Hilton on "The Simple Life.")
 D is for dramality -- a television show or series with elements of both drama and reality programming. (As in "AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL, a Dramality Series to Determine The Nation's Next Supermodel," -- PRNewswire, Jan. 12, 2003.)
 E is for embed -- a journalist placed in a military unit during the American takeover of Iraq to cover its activities.
 F is for flash mob -- a large group of people who gather in one location, usually organized in advance via e-mail or cellphone, to perform some brief action and then quickly disperse. ("In Sao Paulo, Brazil, people took off their shoes and banged them on the street. In one of New York's six flash mobs, the crowd dutifully followed instructions to mimic bird calls in Central Park for 20 seconds." -- The Week in Review, Aug. 17.)
 G is for globesity -- the worldwide epidemic of obesity, a term coined by the World Health Organization in 2001 that this year became huge.
 H is for ham -- an ordinary e-mail message blocked because it includes one or more keywords common to spam, or unsolicited junk e-mail. (As in, "one person's spam is another person's 'ham,' hacker-speak for desirable e-mail." -- The Associated Press, Jan. 17, quoting a scientist.)
 I is for imperial overstretch -- the extension of an empire beyond its abilities. (As in: "Might Washington, like Rome, fall victim to imperial overstretch?" -- The Sunday Mail of London, Oct. 12.)
 J is for job-loss recovery -- a form of economic growth in which the total number of jobs in the economy decreases. Related to, but not to be confused with, a jobless recovery, which simply fails to create new jobs.
 K is for knee-mail -- religion's computer-age, tongue-in-cheek word for prayer, often seen on signs outside churches: God answers knee-mail.
 L is for latex -- one of numerous words that some would consider benign but that nevertheless sets off Internet pornography blockers.
 M is for masstige -- a term combining mass and prestige and describing consumer products that are comparatively low-priced with a prestigious brand name. M is also for metrosexual, an urban male who spends a great deal of time and money on his appearance (likely to engage in manscaping, the artful shaving and trimming of a man's body hair).
 N is for nicotini -- a nicotine-laced martini that some restaurants introduced after they were forced to ban smoking.
 O is for odortype -- the genetically determined smell unique to each person. Government scientists are studying odortype as a possible identification tool in the war on terror.
 P is for pococurante -- meaning indifferent, a word that Sai R. Gunturi of Dallas spelled correctly to win this year's Scripps-Howard National Spelling Bee.
 Q is for quirkyalone -- a person who enjoys being single and who'd rather wait for the right person to come along than date indiscriminately. Q is also for quagmire, an old word that some think now has new life in Iraq.
 R is for rumint (ROOM-int) -- intelligence based on rumors rather than facts, which some believe led to faulty conclusions about Iraqi weapons programs.
 S is for shock and awe -- a term used by the American military to describe its strategy in Iraq, unleashing swift and overwhelming force early in a conflict to defeat the enemy quickly. S is also for slog, to plod one's way perseveringly, especially against difficulty (perhaps when caught in a quagmire; see Q above). And spider hole, a term popularized during the Vietnam War, but now used to describe Saddam Hussein's last hiding place.
 T is for tell-some -- a memoir revealing private or sensitive information, but only up to a point. (As in "'Living History,' Hillary Clinton's political 'tell-some' book." -- The San Jose Mercury News, June 10.)
 U is for unilateral -- an independent journalist, a war correspondent covering the Iraq war who was not officially sanctioned by the military. (See E is for embed).
 V is for video pill -- a camera the size of a pill that, when ingested, transmits images from a person's stomach and intestinal tract.
 W is for Wal-Mart effect -- the economic impact of the retail chain, from forcing smaller competitors out of business and driving down wages to keeping goods cheap, inflation low and productivity high.
 X is for xenozoonosis (zee-noh-zoh-AWN-uh-sis) -- a disease transmitted from an animal to a human after the transplantation of an animal organ.
 Y is for yottabyte -- or a million trillion megabytes, a term likely to become more popular as online data and computer memories expand in coming years to fill that amount of storage space.
 Z is for zorbing -- a new sport much noted this year, from New Zealand. In zorbing, a person is strapped inside a large sphere, which is itself held inside a larger sphere by a cushion of air (the whole thing's called a zorb) and then rolled along the ground or, better yet, downhill.
 Which, it can only be hoped, is not where the English language is headed in 2004.

Questioning The Age Of Wal-Mart

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
WAL-MART, it seems, is the corporate Pied Piper of modern global capitalism, leading the way toward an economic future of admirable efficiency and low prices but also painful change for many workers and communities. And 2003 was the year the "Wal-Martization of the economy" really came into view. The retailing powerhouse toppled more rivals and became the target of lawsuits for unpaid overtime and a federal investigation into its use of poorly paid illegal immigrants as janitors. 
 The Wal-Mart formula extends far beyond the retail business. It has been a pioneer in using the tools of information technology to track every purchase, every shipment of supplies, every cost of doing business, minute by minute, around the world. If a Chinese factory can supply a toy for a few cents cheaper than a domestic plant, the business goes offshore in a heartbeat. 
 The spread of the Internet has brought the Wal-Mart model to all kinds of businesses, especially service jobs, like computer programming and back office work, that once seemed immune to foreign competition. The Indian programmer, paid one-fourth his American counterpart, is now just a mouse-click away. The fear of a swift migration of high-paid white-collar jobs abroad is stirring political concerns and protectionist sympathies in the United States.
 Has the economy been permanently prodded into some new shape, and what does it mean? 
 To critics, the global search for efficiency and low prices that Wal-Mart symbolizes -- squeezing domestic suppliers, offshore outsourcing and paying pinch-penny wages at home -- portends a grim future. They foresee growing wage gaps between the affluent and the working poor, as living standards for millions are sacrificed to market forces run amok. Friedrich von Hayek, they suggest, needs to be updated, and today his "road to serfdom" runs through Bentonville, Ark., Wal-Mart's hometown.
 If such pessimism becomes mainstream, the odds of a backlash rise. If protectionist or regulatory steps come, they will bejustified with much talk of creating a "level playing field" for domestic producers and local retailers, and to keep even more jobs from moving overseas. 
 A dissenting perspective comes from what might be called the Wal-Mart globalists. Wal-Mart, they say, is big, successful and an innovator. And innovation, they add, is always disruptive. Electricity, automobiles, personal computers and the Internet have all displaced workers, but also created new opportunities. The lesson of the American experience, they say, has been to bet on the benefits of that disruptive dynamism -- lower costs for consumers, higher productivity and more job creation than any other developed nation. 
 Still, the macroeconomic joy brings little comfort to the worker whose job is lost to the relentless evolution of global capitalism. Most workers find new jobs, but not always ones with comparable rewards. A study by the Institute for International Economics, examining manufacturing job losses from 1979 to 1999, found that a fourth of factory workers who were re-employed took pay cuts of 25 percent or more.
 Even some Wal-Mart globalists argue for some wage insurance to soften the blow of lost wages. How much would that cost? Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, estimates that paying workers half the money they lost in wages after they were laid off and took a lower-paying jobe, if limited to two years, would total $4 billion to $6 billion a year. "The only humane and economically sensible thing to do is ease the adjustment," Mr. Litan said.

HEADLINE: THE YEARS AHEAD: WAR; 
The Weak Will Try To Shift The Battle

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE American military has now fought two wars in two years, earning two dramatically swift battlefield victories that are already changing the face of future warfare.
 It seems clear that the American military will have few worries any time soon about rivals in technical proficiency and the reach of its power. So the next thing to expect is for the weak to change the way they struggle against it. 
 Thus, bands of guerrillas in Iraq have been trying to undermine the morale of the world's best-equipped combat units and the political will of the voters who sent them there. Terrorist groups are reported to have sought nuclear material for dirty bombs, or worse. Even some allies, feeling powerless and after America decided to go to war in Iraq with or without them, have found diplomatic and economic ways to thumb their noses at Washington. France, Germany and Russia have said, in effect: "You broke it, you bought it."
 While war itself remains an unpredictable enterprise, the American military this year proved it needs far smaller forces than ever before when it wants to reach around the globe and grab the throat of an adversary. In Iraq, as in Afghanistan the year before, it marched to the enemy's capital with a loss of life far below Pentagon projections.
 Nevertheless, victory in both Afghanistan and Iraq has been incomplete so far, and the Pentagon is looking at mistakes it might have made in the planning for postwar stabilization, to assure that in future conflicts it can secure the peace after winning the war.
 The march to Baghdad in particular exemplified the commanding American superiority in 21st-century warfare: swift, agile and decisive, employing overpowering technology to focus relentless violence all at once all across an enemy's territory.
 For example, in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, only 9 percent of the weapons dropped were precision-guided; in the war in Iraq this year,the figure reached 68 percent. And as the proportion of precision-guided munitions increased, the actual number of bombs dropped decreased, resulting in fewer unintended casualties and less damage to civilian buildings.
 In some ways, the technical superiority is a matter of complexity: no adversary can launch a radar-evading bomber from the safety of its own soil, refuel over an ocean, drop precision ordnance nearly a dozen time zones away, refuel again and return home without ever asking to land on foreign soil.
 In other ways, it is a matter of small devices. No adversary can yet challenge the American soldier's ownership of the night, although in this case the cheapness of electronics can pose a problem: Pentagon officials are concerned that over-the-counter light-enhancing goggles are whittling away at this monopoly.
 Meanwhile, innovation still counts. A new generation of surveillance methods -- pilotless aircraft, spy planes and satellites -- were used by only one side in Afghanistan and Iraq, feeding round-the-clock intelligence back through darkness, smoke and storms.
 The American advantage was not solely a matter of smart bombs, but also of smarter troops with better training and a higher level of commitment.
 Even so, adversaries committed to a low-technology guerrilla conflict and to "asymmetrical" terrorist attacks have proved remarkably stubborn and resilient.
 And the Bush administration, which espouses new strategies of pre-emption and "regime change," is also aware that it needs to give greater thought to what happens after military offensives are over and a regime has been changed.

Middlemen in the Low-Wage Economy

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
AFTER federal agents raided 60 Wal-Mart stores in October and found more than 200 illegal immigrants in the cleaning crews, the world's largest retailer was quick to defend itself from this enormous embarrassment. Wal-Mart's officers said they had no idea those workers were illegal, insisting they knew next to nothing about the workers from Mexico, Mongolia, Russia and elsewhere because they were employed by contractors. Nor did Wal-Mart know, its spokesmen said, that the contractors were cutting corners by not paying overtime or Social Security taxes or by flouting other labor laws, as the investigators claimed.
 Like Wal-Mart, thousands of American enterprises rely on labor contractors to help hold down costs, and those industries -- from New York apparel makers to California's vegetable growers -- have given similar "I had no idea" responses when their contractors have been accused of cutting corners. 
 But American companies are facing increasing legal challenges to hold them accountable for their contractors' practices. 
 Just this month, New York State settled with a supermarket chain to redress minimum-wage law violations involving a contractor's deliverymen; a lawsuit in California against three grocery chains over the treatment of late-night janitors survived a challenge; and a union sued a contractor used by United Parcel Service, accusing it of breaking numerous laws in its treatment of immigrant janitors.
 Critics of business-contractor ties insist that companies know exactly what they are getting when they hire outsiders to supply them with labor.
 "They're doing it for the same reason they've always done it, to save money," said Della Bahan, a lawyer who helped bring the suit against the California supermarket chains on behalf of hundreds of janitors from Mexico. "These companies are pretending they're not the employer. The contractor is willing to work people seven days a week, not pay payroll taxes, not pay workers-comp taxes. The companies don't want to do that themselves, but they're willing to look the other way when their contractors do it."
 Contracting out is steadily increasing, business experts say. Some supermarkets turn to outside contractors to help deliver groceries and run cash registers, as well as to clean floors. Many hotels use them to handle laundry, catering and housekeeping. Real estate companies rely on contractors for cleaning and security, while the forestry industry uses them to plant seedlings.
 Historians say labor contractors were first used in Philadelphia in the 19th century when builders needed more workers and turned to some enterprising Italian-Americans who knew where to find newly arrived countrymen. Those contractors, like the Mexican immigrants of today who are farm labor contractors in California and Florida, also used their language skills to manage their work crews. In the late 19th century, garment manufacturers often turned to smaller jobbers to help with production. The contractors often submitted low bids and then violated wage and other laws to squeeze costs, helping to create sweatshops.
 Today, using contractors makes sense, business strategists say, because it allows managers to concentrate on doing what they do best, instead of worrying about cleaning bathrooms. Companies frequently save money by using contractors, who often do not provide fringe benefits, like health insurance and pensions, that companies usually offer direct hires. And labor has difficulty unionizing contractors' employees because many are temporary hires, and legal disputes often develop over who their employer is.
 Probably the loudest complaints involve farm labor contractors, who are being used increasingly as illegal immigration has soared. Often, they provide dilapidated housing, do not pay overtime and make migrant workers pay for their tools and rides to work. Over the past three years, five contractors in Florida have been convicted of enslaving farm workers.
 Phillip Martin, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of California at Davis, said using contractors gives employers the ability to deny knowledge that people working for them were illegal immigrants or were not paid overtime. "Increasingly the purpose of contractors is to be risk absorbers," he said.
 But Jasper Hempel, executive vice president of the Western Growers Association, a group of 3,000 fruit and vegetable growers, said contractors were good for growers and workers alike. "A cherry crop is grown and harvested in a month's time, and artichokes and asparagus are grown in a very short period," he said. "There's no way a farmer of these crops can have a full-year work force. Farm labor contractors can provide farmers with workers for two weeks or two months, and by moving workers from farmer to farmer, these labor contractors can give workers fairly stable, year-round work."
 Still, problems are reported in many sectors. Some contractors trick immigrant workers into believing they are not covered by minimum-wage laws, telling these workers that they are independent contractors, not regular employees. A contractor working for a Manhattan grocery chain was accused of using this rationale to try to justify paying just $2 an hour to African immigrants who delivered groceries. The federal minimum is $5.15. Two weeks ago, the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, announced a $3.2 million settlement in which the chain, Gristede's, agreed to compensate the deliverymen for the contractor's minimum-wage and overtime violations. Gristede's had maintained it was not the employer and was thus not responsible for the violations.
 There is a growing effort to make companies responsible when their contractors skirt the law. A California law now makes apparel companies that use contractors joint employers. In Florida, farm worker advocates recently sought a law to make orange and tomato growers liable whenever labor contractors violated minimum-wage laws, but the growers blocked it.
 "A lot of these abuses are not going to happen if employers know that they're the people ultimately responsible," said Rob Williams, director of the Migrant Farm Workers Justice Project for Florida Legal Services.
 But Ralph DeLeon, a labor contractor who employs 450 citrus and avocado workers in California and Arizona, asserted that only a small fraction of contractors break the law. 
 "Unfortunately," he said, "the good labor contractor who complies with the law, you're never going to hear about."

HEADLINE: Legacies of Notable Lives 

 BODY:
IN lieu of flowers, many obituary notices say, the family requests . . .
 What follows may be a suggestion for a donation to a cause supported by the person who died: a college scholarship fund, a soup kitchen, a symphony, a shelter that saves abandoned pets. Or perhaps the family wants to direct contributions to an organization seeking a cure for the disease that caused the death. Then again, the money could go toward a more tangible monument: the planting of trees, land preserved for a park, a stained-glass glass window in a house of worship. 
 In every case, the impulse is the same: to remember the friend or family member who died and to remind those who survive why that life mattered. 
 Much the same impulse governs this annual collection of articles summing up the lives of notable Westchester County and Putnam County residents -- some already well known, all worth knowing. Lynne Ames researched and wrote the obituaries chosen for the year 2003.

Social Justice Personified
 Christopher Fairfield Edley met his wife, Zaida Coles Edley, when they were in the fifth grade. In their 52 years of marriage, Mrs. Edley saw more in her man than his public achievements, impressive as they were: president for 18 years of the United Negro College Fund, a prominent Harvard- trained civil rights lawyer, a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. 
 "He really did have an incredible dedication to doing good things," Mrs. Edley said. "It's an interesting thing to think about. Is this something you are born with, or is it nurtured by a caring environment? In my husband's case, I would surely say both."
 He was also a calculating charmer, at least when it came to winning the girl he wanted. "He was a friend of my brother," she said. "He later confessed it was his strategy to get close to my brother in order to get close to me."
 Mr. Edley grew up in Lynchburg, Va., where his divorced mother supported him and two other children by working on the housekeeping staff of a local college. During his high school years, he worked part-time to help with family expenses. 
 He and his wife attended Howard University in the District of Columbia. He then went to Harvard Law School, where, in the early 1950's, he was "one of less than a handful of blacks on the law school campus," according to his literature handed out at his memorial service in Shiloh Baptist Church in New Rochelle, where Mr. and Mrs. Edley lived. 
 After researching the demographics of American cities, Mr. Edley chose Philadelphia as a good starting place for a young African-American lawyer. He eventually became the appeals chief in the district attorney's office, then a partner in the firm Moore, Lightfoot & Edley. Later he worked for the United States Commission on Civil Rights, then in 1963 joined the Ford Foundation, becoming its first African-American program officer. 
 In 1973 Mr. Edley succeeded Vernon F. Jordan as president of the United Negro College Fund. This came a year after the Advertising Council, a public service organization, helped coin the phrase "A mind is a terrible thing to waste," which became the fund's durable signature. Mr. Edley built upon the slogan, mounting huge advertising campaigns and setting up a government affairs unit to lobby for the fund's member colleges and universities. In 1979, he started the fund's annual telethon with the singer Lou Rawls as the host, an event that has raised more than $100 million. 
 By 1991, when the fund's current president, William H. Gray III, succeeded him, Mr. Edley had overseen the flow of more than $550 million in direct aid to 41 private historically black colleges and universities, and the awarding of a thousand individual scholarships a year. 
 Although diabetes and heart problems forced his retirement from the fund at 63, Mr. Edley remained active in many causes. He was on dozens of public interest boards and commissions, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., and received honorary degrees from 16 colleges and universities .
 Mr. Edley died on May 5. He was 75.

Adventurous Storyteller
 Her friends knew how Bonnie Page lived: with flair, drama and creativity. But many others knew her because of the way she died, news that made headlines throughout the country.
 On May 16, Mrs. Page was attacked in the kitchen of her Cortlandt Manor home by a pit bull that she had recently adopted. The wounds to her face and head were so severe that she bled to death on the way to the hospital.
 Mrs. Page was born Bonnie Lou Barker in 1927 in Peekskill, where she lived most of her life. After graduating from Hendrick Hudson High School, she attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan. She appeared in Off Broadway plays and worked as a model.
 After a marriage that ended in divorce, she worked for AT&T and raised her two children. Faced with financially rough times, she stayed briefly at the local Y.W.C.A. By 1977, things had improved so much that she not only was living in her own apartment, but she had also become president of that Y.W.C.A.
 In her late 50's, she started working on a semiautobiographical account of her life, said Emily Hanlon, a professional writer and leader of a writing workshop in Ossining. 
 "She was one of the most wildly creative students I've ever had," Ms. Hanlon said. 
 "She was giving birth to creative thoughts all over the place. Much to her credit, she stuck with it and finally finished her novel. She was just at the point of beginning to rewrite when she died. She had become a truly good writer."
 The novel, loosely autobiographical, was about an actress, said Mrs. Page's daughter, Dr. B. Starr McMullen, chairman of the economics department at Oregon State University in Corvallis. The sense of artistic adventure mirrored her mother's spirit, Dr. McMullen said, adding, "She was very dramatic. she loved to tell a story." 
 After her mother's cremation, Ms. McMullen sent some of the ashes to Ms. Hanlon so the writing group could hold a memorial service. 
 "We were devastated," Ms. Hanlon said. "We planted a rose bush and put her ashes there."
 Mrs. Page died May 16. She was 76.

Entrepreneurial Father
 Plenty of shoppers know the name "Sau-Sea Shrimp Cocktails" and the product that goes with them: curved glass jars filled with tiny shrimp and tangy red sauce. 
 The man behind the brand was a longtime Greenburgh resident, Abraham Kaplan. He founded Sau-Sea Foods in Yonkers in 1948, after borrowing $1,500 from his brother Sidney and another $1,500 from a friend, Ernest Schoenbrun, who was his business partner. The two rented a tiny warehouse space on School Street in Yonkers and went to Fulton Street Fish Market to buy shrimp.
 After packaging their product, the partners took it to stores, suggesting a retail sales price of 50 cents.
 Success was virtually immediate. Sau-Sea shrimp cocktails were distributed nationwide out of the Yonkers building.
 Antonio Estadella, the husband of Mr. Kaplan's daughter Ronnie, became head of the company. Mr. Kaplan bought Mr. Schoenbrun's share in 1980. 
 In 1965, Sau-Sea moved to a plant at 1000 Saw Mill River Road. There it employed 70 people and processed 10 tons of shrimp a day. Then in 1993 it moved the bulk of its operations to South Carolina, which is home to many seafood processors.
 Administrative offices are now in Tarrytown. Sidney Kaplan, who worked for the company in its early years, recalled: "We deveined, cooked and put shrimp in jars, all by hand. Now that's all done by machinery." 
 Recalling the company's early days, and her father's generous, gregarious personality, Ronnie Estadella said: "He loved to entertain and to feed people. Of course, all our guests got shrimp. But the immediate family probably got the best deal of all. When the sauce was first made at the plant, it was really spicy, the horseradish was really fresh. Those were the shrimp cocktails he brought home to us -- the first ones of every batch, the ones that made your nasal passages sting and brought tears to your eyes."
 Mr. Kaplan died on May 2. He was 84.

Educator and Family Man
 Clayton L. Akin of Larchmont was the superintendent of Rye Neck Schools from 1974 to 1989. He viewed education as a mission, a moral obligation to young people, said his widow, Carol Bradshaw Akin, a teacher at the Hommocks School.
 But, she said, he was equally devoted to her and their children during their 27-year marriage.
 When they met -- in the First Church of Christ Scientist in Mamaroneck -- he was divorced, and 30 years her senior. But that proved no obstacle.
 "He was honest, he was brilliant; we started off as good, good friends and then the relationship grew," Mrs. Akin recalled.
 When he finally did propose, it was on Christmas afternoon. "He gave me this big, carefully wrapped box, and inside it was another beautifully wrapped box and inside that another and well, you can guess what was in the smallest one -- -- a diamond engagement ring." 
 His legacy in education was large and original. He decided to eliminate the position of principal in Rye Neck's elementary, middle, and high school, instituting instead teams of teachers who oversaw guidance of 8 to 10 students per team, and curriculum coordinators who oversaw instruction. The result, Mrs. Akin said, was more personalized learning. 
 "Clayton was a humanitarian," she said. "He was a good administrator but he sometimes called that end of it 'administrivia.' What he really loved was dealing with people."
 Mr. Akin died on April 27. He was 79.

Collector Extraordinaire
 John Boker of Scarsdale had the kind of resume that sounds like something out of the movies: C.I.A. intelligence officer and collector of rare stamps.
 "It was tough as a teenager having a professional interrogator for a father," his daughter, Pamela Boker of Armonk, said jokingly. "His style was understated, polite, nonchalant, but he never forgot a detail. He had this photographic memory. He could see someone once and remember everything about them."
 Mr. Boker, born in Manhattan, graduated from Yale in 1933. In World War II he was a private, then a major, and became fluent in German. During the war he also worked with British intelligence, recruiting double agents. Soon he attracted the attention of the United States Central Intelligence Agency. 
 After the war, when suddenly the Soviet Union went from the status of ally to cold war enemy, Mr. Boker was asked to cultivate Reinhard Gehlen, a Nazi spymaster who had been captured by the British. His subtle, courteous handling of Gehlen gained the German's trust, and he began sharing information about the Soviet Union that he said had been gathered by the Nazis. 
 "I've read letters from Gehlen telling my Dad he was the only one he trusted," Ms. Boker said. In 1990 Mr. Boker was named to the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.
 Stamps were her father's "other life," Ms. Boker said. He built his collection slowly and painstakingly, interested more in aesthetics than monetary value. Among his most prized specimens were a group of misprints: five-cent stamps that were accidentally printed as two-cent stamps. Other favorites included stamps that had been designed by a New Hampshire man who carved little pictures of people, animals and tools on wine corks, then transferred the artwork to government stamps.
 "I believe my father collected every one of that group" Ms. Boker said. "As in everything else, he was thorough and caring."
Mr. Boker died on April 12. He was 90.

Big Leaguer, Everywhere
 Jim Gordon changed hats many times: play-by-play broadcaster for the New York Giants football team, radio newscaster and chairman of the Putnam County legislature, among other political jobs. 
 "Jim focused on issues rather than political affiliations," said the Putnam County executive, Robert Bondi of Mr. Gordon's years on the Board of Legislators from 1989 to 1997. 
 Mr. Gordon, who lived in Putnam Valley, was probably best known politically for his tenacious role in securing a watershed agreement in 1995 that took two years to negotiate. The agreement stipulates that Putnam County would form a partnership with New York City to protect the quality of the water used by people in New York City, Westchester and Putnam. Another major political achievement was his work in helping defeat a proposed landfill in 1989. 
 Mr. Gordon began his career in 1955 at Madison Square Garden, where he broadcast New York Knicks games, New York Rangers games, and college sports. He later worked as a news director at WINS and WNEW radio stations, while still working as a freelance sportscaster.
 Although his work kept him busy and often on the road with teams, he also found time for volunteer firefighting with the Putnam County Fire Department. At the time of his death, he had logged hundreds of fire calls, very nearly reaching his goal of 1,000 calls.
 Mr. Gordon died on Feb. 17. He was 76.

Congeniality, on Bass
 Aaron Bell "never knew a stranger," his widow, DeLores, said. By that she meant that the tall, affable, jazz bass player made friends with just about everyone he met. "He'd meet someone and right away they were talking and telling each other things about their lives," she said. "We'd be on an airplane and by the end of the trip, Aaron knew the life story of the person next to him."
 Mr. Bell of Mount Vernon was also known for his versatility as a musician. He excelled at drums, piano and tuba before landing on bass, which became his trademark instrument. During World War II, he played with Navy bands. Later he was a bassist with the Andy Kirk Orchestra, Lester Young and Miles Davis. He also played for several years with the Duke Ellington Orchestra and in 1963 he conducted a 14-piece orchestra in the premiere of his composition "Memorial Suite for Duke" in a program at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Manhattan to commemorate Ellington's birth.
 His career also included performances on Broadway with Cy Coleman and Sammy Davis Jr.; composing and playing background music for films; leading his own group, the Aaron Bell Trio; being musical director for the La Mama Theater in Manhattan; and lecturing on jazz at colleges.
 Less than 24 hours before his death from lung cancer, Mr. Bell was wheeled into the dayroom of the hospice, and played piano. "After that," Mrs. Bell said, " after he got too tired to play, they took him back to his room, and soon after that, the priest was administering last rites."
 Mr. Bell died July 28. He was 82.

With People at Heart
 John E. Flynn was one of those people to whom the phrase "humble beginnings" applies perfectly. 
 "He had ahard life at first," his daughter, Joan Natoli, said. "He grew up in north Yonkers in a home with no indoor plumbing. They used an outhouse. To shower, they went to the local Y. His parents were immigrants from Ireland and from their experiences, and his own, he developed a feeling for people in trouble."
 That feeling eventually led Mr. Flynn to politics.
 A Republican, he was the mayor of Yonkers for three terms, beginning in 1961, and then a state senator, serving Yonkers, Greenburgh and parts of Mount Vernon and the North Bronx for 10 terms. 
 Before going into politics, Mr. Flynn went to New York University and Columbia University. Later, he worked at the Alexander Smith and Sons carpet company in Yonkers. 
 "He was always in motion, always busy, always trying to help people," she said. "He was even able to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade this year" about six months before his death. "I said, 'Dad, it will be too much for you' and he said, 'Oh no, I'm going to do it.' It was a cold day but he refused to wear a coat, and do you know what, it did not make him sick."
 One of Mr. Flynn's primary concerns was the welfare of the disabled and the elderly. He sponsored bills in the State Senate to provide for wheelchair ramps and other means of accessibility. He also "spoke, really talked and listened to" older people who were worried about living on fixed incomes in a county as costly as Westchester. One of the first housing developments for the elderly in Yonkers, Flynn Manor, was named for him. 
 He was also responsible for another first for the city. As mayor, he created its original youth board, which later became the Youth Services Agency. He also set up the city's Human Rights Commission. As state senator in 1975, he was able to procure enough state money so the financially beleaguered city could avoid default.
 Many people knew Mr. Flynn by his nickname, Chippie. Although he was a life-long Republican, he nonetheless played on a baseball team affiliated with the Yonkers Democrats -- the Chippewa Club. Thus, the nickhame. 
 Mr. Flynn died on Sept 23. He was 91.

Art as a Life's Work
 Even as he mourns, Leon Wolfe can joke about his second wife, Rita Rapaport. "She was the only WASP Jew I've ever known," he said. "Her parents were in real estate. She could, in fact trace her ancestry in America almost as far back to colonial times."
 But Ms. Rapaport (who had also been been married once before) defined herself not by her ancestry but by her art. Despite her very secular ancestry and upbringing, her painting and sculpture focused largely on the Holocaust, and the atrocities that defied all the usual questions of why and how it could have occurred.
 Perhaps one of her best-known pieces is "The Gates of Remembrance," a bronze sculpture on Martine Avenue in downtown White Plains that evokes the horror of the Holocaust. Of the 1968 sculpture, she wrote: "'The Gate of Remembrance':" two posts, blown by the wind, evoking fire, crematoria, the chimneys. Vav -- the sixth letter of the Hebrew alphabet for the six days of creation the six million dead.
 "And the gate itself -- a gate to heaven? The gate to hell" Or Yom Kippur's gate of forgiveness that closes at the end of the Holy Days? Do the gates come to freedom -- or close us in?"
 Mr. Wolfe, a native of Poland who was imprisoned in three concentration camps, met Ms. Rapaport when he was curator at the museum at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, whose exhibits often have Jewish themes. Ms. Rapaport visited the museum in 1986, and Mr. Wolfe, who is now 87, said: "Things just, how do you say, clicked between us." They married a year later.
 Ms. Rapaport died on Nov. 29. She was 85.

HEADLINE: The Smoking Ban: Clear Air, Murky Economics 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU; Ann Farmer contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
When New York City banned smoking in its bars and restaurants last March, opponents warned that the tough new law would drive away customers and devastate businesses. Supporters insisted that New Yorkers would quickly adjust.
 Nine months later, the impact is hardly so clear cut. An examination of government data, public polls, private surveys and interviews with customers, employees and owners of more than three dozen bars and restaurants around the city shows the law having an impact on some businesses, but certainly not on all. 
 Many bar owners and managers say the smoking ban has hurt business, eroding profits and, in some cases, forcing them to cut back hours or lay off workers. Others say they have seen virtually no effect. 
Some restaurants and bars say that business is fine -- even thriving, as the economy improves -- particularly in places where food is a main draw. Further, a vast majority of New Yorkers have said in recent polls that they are happy with the new law. One survey shows that many regular restaurantgoers see a smoke-free environment as an attraction.
That does not mean, though, that some city night spots are not hurt by the ban. Happy-hour sales on Friday nights at the Whiskey Ward on the Lower East Side have dropped to barely $100, from $600, a co-owner says, and regulars have disappeared along with the ashtrays. 
A co-owner of Patroon, a steakhouse in Midtown, says he no longer sees much of a cigar-puffing, after-dinner crowd. And in the meatpacking district, the owner of Hogs & Heifers, where Julia Roberts was once enticed to dance on the bar, says she is considering laying off four employees.
Then there are the many nuisances wrought by the smoking ban, which bar owners and bartenders say just makes it harder to scrape out a living in an already tough business.
"It's harder to keep track of everybody going in and out," said Chuck Zeilfelder, a bartender at Bourbon Street in Bayside, Queens, who opposes the ban. "It's common for people to leave money on the bar, and that becomes an issue -- how much they left. Also, people leave their drinks on the bar and go out. The drinks get thrown out, and then you have to buy them another round on the house."
It is unclear whether the complaints about the smoking ban are anything more than growing pains, as a city that prides itself on its night life adjusts to the far-reaching new law. Certainly, where the city goes from here is of great interest to other places around the world, like Ireland, Norway and Lexington, Ky., which are debating their own versions of the law.
The early evidence, however, is that many businesses are unharmed. In fact, though rumors swirl in an environment where every bit of news is trumpeted by the side it favors, a reporter could not verify that one bar, restaurant or club, of the more than 20,000 in the city, had closed solely because of the smoking ban.
In contrast, the owner-chef at Gotham Bar and Grill, Alfred Portale, says more people are dining at the pink granite bar, where the food is served on black lacquer trays. The bar at the Jazz Standard on East 27th Street remains packed every night, its owner says. And the line only grows longer outside McSorley's Old Ale House on East Seventh Street, the "wonderful saloon" chronicled by the writer Joseph Mitchell, though some patrons have grumbled that they miss having a Marlboro with their house ale.
"Believe it or not, it may be helping us because it's driving people to drink," said McSorley's owner, Matthew Maher.
The city's antismoking law was championed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who saw it as a health initiative to protect restaurant and bar workers from being exposed to secondhand smoke. In July, the state followed with an even tougher smoking ban.
Even if the city were to repeal its ban, the state's would remain in effect -- something that has not seemed to make much difference to the smokers and businesses who continue to blame the mayor for their woes and lobby to have the city's law amended.
The ban does not appear to have deterred businesses from opening in New York City. The New York State Liquor Authority, which issues licenses to establishments that serve alcohol, received 127 applications from city businesses last month, compared to 126 in November 2002. The number of licenses granted by the authority in that same period rose to 106 last month, from 75 the year before.
The city's Health Department, which enforces the smoking ban, has also analyzed monthly employment numbers and found no overall job loss in the food service and drinking industry. Critics have countered that such findings are politically motivated, and cannot show when establishments cut back shifts and absorb revenue losses. But many restaurants and bars refuse to divulge their finances, making it difficult to gauge the validity of their complaints.
Polls back the city's contention that New Yorkers have welcomed the ban. A New York Times poll in June showed that 56 percent of the 962 respondents said they approved of the smoking ban. A Quinnipiac University poll in October found that 62 percent supported the ban.
Tim Zagat, the publisher of restaurant guides, surveyed more than 29,000 of his volunteer reviewers this year and found that 96 percent said they would eat out as much, if not more, with the smoking ban. Only 4 percent said they would eat out less. "I don't care how you cut it," Mr. Zagat said. "I think it's long-term good for business."
The industry counters with its own surveys, some of which depend on voluntary responses. Pollsters say such surveys are deceptive because those most prone to complain are also most prone to respond. 
The city chapters of the New York State Restaurant Association mailed out a survey to more than 900 members and found that 88 of the 115 city businesses that responded said they had a decline in bar sales since the smoking ban, and 58 said they had a decline in food sales. In addition, 76 reported that their employees had an unfavorable reaction to the ban, while 18 reported a favorable reaction.
Similarly, an October study commissioned by the Vintners Federation of Ireland interviewed 300 bars and nightclubs in the New York region and found that 66 percent reported fewer customers since the smoking ban, while 15 percent reported more. In all, 78 percent said the impact of the ban on their businesses had been negative. 
"The nightclub and bar industry are the collateral damage in the admittedly noble fight to get people to stop smoking," said David Rabin, co-owner of Union Bar and Lotus in Manhattan and president of the New York Nightlife Association.
Sales representatives for wine and liquor companies say the impact has trickled down to them.
They say business has dropped between 20 percent and 40 percent since the smoking ban. Similarly, an association for operators of jukeboxes, pinball machines and other games says that revenues have fallen between 10 and 25 percent at bars and nightclubs in New York City. 
"If the people are outside smoking, they're not inside drinking, and they're not inside playing my machines," said Kenneth Goldberg, vice president of the Amusement Music Operators Association.
Indeed, a check by a reporter on two blocks of Bell Boulevard in Bayside and three blocks of Northern Boulevard in Little Neck, both thriving night life strips in Queens, showed some impact from the ban, but more in terms of subtle economic and social changes than closings and layoffs.
Owners and employees reported selling fewer drinks and losing customers before dessert. They complained of the need to watch over drinks and money left on the bar and seats left unoccupied by patrons heading out for a smoke. And bartenders said that tips were down, as were overall tabs, and that longtime customers were resorting to alternatives -- hotel rooms, private homes and parks -- to indulge their smoking and drinking.
But Danny Meyer, who owns a half-dozen restaurants and night spots in Manhattan, including Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern, said his businesses had seen no impact. He banned smoking in some of his restaurants in 1990, and they have grown more popular, he said.
Mr. Meyer said that he no longer had to worry about his waiters and customers coughing from the smoke or the nightly squabbles between smoking and nonsmoking tables. One of his best customers, Roger W. Straus, a publisher with Farrar Straus & Giroux, had complained when Mr. Meyer started his ban about being separated from his cigarettes, but later credited the restaurant with helping him to give up smoking, Mr. Meyer said. 
"New Yorkers will adapt to almost anything," Mr. Meyer said. "They're not going to quit going to great restaurants just because they can't smoke."
Many bars and nightclubs have adopted coping strategies, with varying degrees of success. At the popular China Club near Times Square, smokers are now directed to a 2,000-square-foot terrace. 
"It hasn't impacted us that much," said the owner, Danny Fried, of the ban. 
O'Neill's Bar and Restaurant in Midtown laid off three people in April and resorted to novelty events like trivia contests and election-night vigils for races in Ireland. Ciaran Staunton, the owner, says he sees his regulars pass by on the street, toting six-packs of beer to drink at home. 
Other bars and taverns, like Broadway Dive on the Upper West Side, are placing new emphasis on their food now that they are selling fewer drinks. Since the ban began, alcoholic beverage sales at the Broadway Dive have fallen about one-third, or between $1,500 and $2,000 a week, its owner said. 
Amy Sacco, owner of Lot 61 and Bungalow 8 in West Chelsea, said she had to hire an extra security guard just to make sure the smoking crowd outside does not become unruly. 
"It makes the job very unhappy," Ms. Sacco said. "Next thing you know, it's prohibition for cocktails. We're all responsible for policing it. It's such a drag."
"It's just a big headache in a job that had enough headaches to start with," she said.

HEADLINE: Legacies of Notable Lives; 
From Politicians to Teachers to Dedicated Members of a Community

 BODY:
IN lieu of flowers, many obituary notices say, "the family requests ..." 
 What follows may be a suggestion for a donation to a cause supported by the person who died: a college scholarship fund, a soup kitchen, a symphony, a shelter for abandoned pets. Or perhaps the family wants to direct contributions to an organization seeking a cure for a disease. Then again, the money could go toward a more tangible monument: the planting of trees, land preserved for a park, a stained-glass window in a house of worship. 
 In every case, the impulse is the same: to remember the friend or family member who died and to remind those who survive why that life mattered. 
Much the same impulse governs this annual collection of articles summing up the lives of notable Connecticut residents -- some already well known, all worth knowing. Dick Ahles researched and wrote the profiles chosen for the year 2003.

A Presence in Baseball
Joseph Buzas opened the 1945 baseball season at shortstop for the New York Yankees, but then the return from World War II of another Yankee shortstop named Phil Rizutto and a serious shoulder injury combined to end Mr. Buzas's big league career after only 30 games.
Although his time in the majors was brief, it was followed by a lifetime in the minor leagues as a manager and owner.
During a span of nearly 50 years, Mr. Buzas owned 60 minor league teams, including, the Boston Red Sox farm teams that played first in Bristol and then in New Britain. 
He was a successful owner in a difficult business, so successful that he was able to sell a Reading, Pa., franchise he had bought for $1 in 1977 for $1 million plus $1 a decade later. 
Mr. Buzas will long be remembered in Connecticut as the man who saved minor league baseball for New Britain when he refused to bow to pressure from the Red Sox to move his team to Springfield, Mass. Instead, he ended a 38-year association with Boston and turned the New Britain franchise into a farm team for the Minnesota Twins. 
Mr. Buzas had moved the team from Bristol to New Britain in 1983, the year the promising young pitcher Roger Clemens led the Class AA team to an Eastern League pennant. The team was popular in New Britain but by 1994, Dan Duquette, the Red Sox general manager, wanted to have a minor league team in western Massachusetts.
Mr. Buzas was tempted to move to the larger city deeper in Red Sox country but appeals by hundreds of New Britain fans persuaded him to keep the team in Connecticut, a decision he dramatically announced from home plate before a game. 
The Red Sox moved, but minor league baseball stayed in New Britain where it continues today as the New Britain Rock Cats.
Mr. Buzas sold the team in 2000 for $6.5 million. He had paid $250,000 for the franchise in 1956 when it was in Allentown, Pa.
Mr. Buzas died in Salt Lake City on March 20. He was 83. 

Fighter, Artist, Survivor
As a young man, Maurice Jean-Henri Ghnassia was a French Resistance fighter with the code name "Spartacus." Then he became the host of a jazz program on a radio station in Paris where he was known as "Mr. Blues." 
Later, he was a United Nations and Washington correspondent for several European publications, a novelist, a professor at the University of Hartford and the translator of eight volumes of "Peanuts" cartoons into French.
Mr. Ghnassia was a 20-year-old student at the Sorbonne when the Nazis occupied Paris in 1940. He helped organize a Resistance cell that harassed Nazi troops and French collaborators until its members were ambushed near a River Seine bridge. Mr. Ghnassia was facing execution when he escaped to the south of France. There, he was once again arrested and condemned to death for Resistance activities, and once again he escaped.
When France was liberated, Mr. Ghnassia joined a French paratroop unit that was attached to the U.S. 101st Airborne Division. 
In a 1989 interview, Mr. Ghnassia recalled: "I have been arrested. I have been condemned to death. Everything you can imagine in a movie happened to me. But it happened to many. I fought because I was angry. I fought for my friends."
Mr. Ghnassia resumed his studies after the war and as Mr. Blues he conducted radio interviews with celebrated jazz performers like Louis Armstrong, Bessie Smith and Billie Holliday. He moved to the United States in 1955 and for more than two decades was a journalist in New York and Washington, where he reported for a Paris radio station and several European newspapers and magazines, interviewing many of the 20th-century's most notable figures, among them Dwight D. Eisenhower, Adlai Stevenson, John F. Kennedy and Fidel Castro.
Mr. Ghnassia lived in New Hartford for a decade in the 1980's and 1990's before moving to Windsor. For several years, while writing novels and poetry and translating Charles Shultz's "Peanuts" comic strips into French, he was also an adjunct professor at the University of Hartford, teaching western civilization and French literature. 
Mr. Ghnassia died Jan. 4 at his retirement home in Cullowhee, N.C. He was 82. 

In Football, a 'Block of Granite'
Football took Harry Jacunski from New Britain High School to Fordham, to the Green Bay Packers, to Notre Dame, Harvard and Yale. 
Mr. Jacunski was an All-State center at New Britain High School in 1934 and good enough to be recruited by one of the era's great college football teams, Fordham, where he played with Vince Lombardi on the legendary defensive line known as "The Seven Blocks of Granite." The team, with Mr. Jacunski as an end, lost only two games in three seasons.
Mr. Jacunski would have ended his football career at Fordham but there were few jobs available for Depression-era college graduates and, after playing a College All-Star Game, he joined the Packers. He played six seasons at Green Bay and was a member of its National Football League champion teams in 1939 and 1944.
After his playing days ended, Mr. Jacunski became an assistant coach at Notre Dame and Harvard before joining the Yale coaching staff in 1947. He served under four head coaches at Yale: Herman Hickman, Jordan Olivar, John Pont and Carmine Cozza, coaching at various times, the ends, guards and centers and scouting opponents. 
In 1965, Mr. Jacunski became freshman coach. During 16 seasons, his teams had a record of 59-37-3 and he worked with nine players who went on to the National Football League, including Calvin Hill, Brian Dowling and Don Martin. He retired in 1980.
Mr. Jacunski died Feb. 20. He was 87. 

Broadway and Prime Time
Anne Burr McDermott made theatrical history in her 1941 Broadway debut when she became the first white actress to perform opposite a black leading man. 
The play was Orson Welles's production of Richard Wright's "Native Son" and Ms. McDermott's leading man was Canada Lee, according to her daughter Maggie McDermott.
Known professionally as Anne Burr, Ms. McDermott spent part of her childhood in Hartford where she attended the Oxford School, now known as Kingswood-Oxford. While working in New York and Hollywood, she spent many summers in Old Lyme and made the town her permanent home in 1986. 
Ms. McDermott appeared in many successful Broadway plays in the 1940's. She played opposite Ralph Bellamy in "Detective Story" and Richard Basehart in "The Hasty Heart." In the early 1950's, Ms. McDermott was one of dozens of actors, writers, directors and others blacklisted for a time following allegations of communist influence in the entertainment industry. 
After she was removed from the blacklist, Ms. McDermott became one of television's first soap opera stars, performing in "As the World Turns" on CBS from 1955 to 1959. She then moved to Hollywood with her husband, Tom McDermott, the producer of successful television shows like "Father Knows Best," "Wanted, Dead or Alive" and "The Big Valley." Ms. McDermott joined the actors Dick Powell, Charles Boyer and David Niven in the Four Star Television production company, which had as many as 11 shows playing in prime time during the 1960's.
Ms. McDermott was active politically, especially in the presidential campaigns of Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy. She was also involved with Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic, an educational service for those with reading disabilities.
Ms. McDermott died Feb. 1 at her home in Old Lyme. She was 84. 

A Reshaping of New Haven
No one in New Haven's 365-year history was mayor longer than Richard C. Lee, who served eight terms from 1954 to 1969. He was also, in the view of the Yale political scientist Douglas Rae, "the most important figure in New Haven's 20th century."
Dick Lee was born and raised in the city's working class Newhallville neighborhood. He never went to college but learned much about the city and its politics while working as a city hall reporter for the old New Haven Journal Courier and as an alderman and a director of the Yale News Bureau.
Elected in 1953 at age 37, Mr. Lee was the city's youngest mayor. He defeated a Republican incumbent to begin a string of consecutive Democratic victories in mayoral elections that has reached the 50-year mark. 
Joined by a staff of like-minded urban reformers and social services professionals like Edward Logue, a redevelopment director, and Mitchell Svirdoff, who headed the city's anti-poverty agency, Mr. Lee set out to change the face of New Haven by clearing its slums and revitalizing its downtown. His dream was to transform New Haven into a model city, a city without poverty. 
The dream was never realized but New Haven under Richard Lee "came closest to our dream of a slumless city," said Robert Weaver, the Federal Housing administrator. 
Mr. Lee replaced blocks of slum housing with new public housing and new schools. He razed three city blocks to make way for two major department stores and a downtown shopping mall and routed the new interstate highways so that they provided easy access to the downtown area.
To achieve all of this, the mayor worked closely with the Democratic administrations of Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. His efforts resulted in more than $430 million in federal funds being funneled to New Haven, along with millions more in foundation grants for social programs. New Haven's Community Progress Incorporated created many job training, education, housing and child care programs that would become the models for President Johnson's "War on Poverty" programs of the 1960's. 
Mr. Lee died Feb. 2 at age 86. He was buried in New Haven's historic Grove Street Cemetery, not far from the graves of some earlier New Haven luminaries, including Eli Whitney, Noah Webster and the city's first mayor and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Roger Sherman. 

Fond of Square Dancing
Ed Thrall liked square dancing so much that he built a dance hall on his land in East Windsor and started a 20-year fight with the town and the state for the right to hold dances there.
It was quite a dance hall, built with scrap materials that Mr. Thrall found in Hartford and surrounding towns. There was brownstone from the old Heublein Hotel, stones from the former Y.M.C.A. and posts from the demolished Chauncey Harris School. He built a dance floor of multicolored tiles salvaged from various places and cushioned the floor with used truck tires. 
"I worked like a goldurn jackass and built that building practically by myself," Mr. Thrall recalled in an interview five years ago.
The job took Mr. Thrall nearly 10 years and when the dance hall was finally finished in 1978, he was told he couldn't hold square dances because the property wasn't zoned for dance halls. Denied a certificate of occupancy from the state, Mr. Thrall held his square dances anyway, at least until the police arrived. 
Mr. Thrall refused to give in to the authorities and on several occasions he defended his hall and his dances with his shotgun, wearing a tri-cornered hat in the manner of the Minutemen. Then, by way of showing there were no truly hard feelings, Mr. Thrall's wife, Flicka, would arrange for a temporary truce and serve doughnuts to the police.
But there were also several arrests, angry courtroom confrontations and Mr. Thrall spent some time in jail, including six months after a 1995 standoff. Since he couldn't use the hall, Mr. Thrall refused to pay taxes on it and the town finally foreclosed after the unpaid tax bill reached $67,000. The land was auctioned off but when Mr. Thrall's neighbors declined to bid, the town bought the dance hall and 22 acres of Mr. Thrall's land.
Despite what the former police chief Thomas Laufer called "the foolish things" Mr. Thrall did, the town had a grudging respect for his grit and the townspeople concluded that the building should go back to the Thrall family. In 1998, a town meeting voted 115 to 11 to sell the dance hall to Mr. Thrall's daughter and her husband for $100,000. The motion to sell the building was made by Steven Knibloe, a police lieutenant Mr. Thrall once took a shot at during a dance hall siege, according to The Hartford Courant. 
Mr. Thrall died April 20. He was 84. 

Committed to Glastonbury
When Nat Sestero, a Glastonbury correspondent for The Hartford Times, joined the Navy and went to war in 1943, his wife, Norma, replaced him and kept the job for the next 22 years. 
As many of the young reporters assigned to Glastonbury by The Hartford Courant during those years would quickly discover, Norma Sestero was a formidable competitor who knew everyone and everything about her town. 
She won the loyalty of Glastonbury residents early in her career by writing and editing a monthly newsletter, "The Home Town News," which was sent to nearly 1,000 Glastonbury men and women serving in the armed forces all over the world in World War II. When they returned to their home town in 1946, the veterans honored Ms. Sestero at a victory celebration, and 46 years later, the veterans did it again, naming Ms. Sestero honorary marshal of the town's 1992 Veterans Day parade.
As a reporter, Ms. Sestero covered the town's transition from the traditional board of selectmen to the town manager form of government and she saw Glastonbury grow from 6,000 residents to 30,000. Ms. Sestero was involved in many town organizations, serving as a life member of the Glastonbury Historical Society and as a member of the Friends of the Welles-Turner Memorial Library and the libraries in East and South Glastonbury. She established a trust with the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving in 1988 for the benefit of the region's cultural, educational and health agencies. 
Although her husband, Nat, didn't get his Glastonbury job back after World War II, he did return to The Hartford Times and rose to managing editor. Ms. Sestero served as the official hostess for the national convention of the Associated Press Managing Editors when the meeting was held in Hartford in 1969.
Ms. Sestero died April 23 in Hartford Hospital. She was 92.

Legislator and Advocate
When Nancy Pilver first learned she had breast cancer eight years ago, she became an advocate for victims of the disease.
As legislative chairwoman for the Connecticut Breast Cancer Coalition, Ms. Pilver lobbied the Connecticut General Assembly to pass legislation that ended what were known as "drive-through mastectomies" at hospitals in the state.
Connecticut insurance companies must now pay for 48-hour hospital stays after mastectomies.
Ms. Pilver was involved in many other community groups in her home town of Manchester, including the Library Board, the Historical Society, the Center Congregational Church, the Manchester Hospital Women's Auxiliary and the Pride in Manchester Week Committee.
She was also active in the Republican Party, serving on the Town Committee and the Republican Women's Club.
Last year, she ran for state representative but was not successful and during the campaign, she discovered that the cancer that had twice gone into remission had returned. 
Ms. Pilver died May 10. She was 69. 

Pioneer for Space Program
Henry Clay Osborn III was a space pioneer who helped develop the fuel cells used on both the Apollo and Gemini missions as a Pratt & Whitney engineer. His contributions to the space program are recorded in the archives of the Air and Space Institute in Washington.
Mr. Osborn received engineering degrees from the University of Rhode Island and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and served as an Army officer during World War II before joining Pratt & Whitney.
He was a man with many interests. Although trained as an engineer, his love of history prompted him to pursue a master's degree in the subject at the University of Connecticut and he used his knowledge of history to collect and restore antiques. Also an avid horticulturist, Mr. Osborn was certified as a master gardener by the UConn Agricultural Extension Service and he was co-founder of the Connecticut Chapter of the Rhododendron Society. 
He lived in Hebron for 53 years and was chairman of the Hebron Republican Town Committee for 25 years. In addition, he served his town as chairman of the building committee for Rham High School.
Mr. Osborn died Jan. 22 in a fire in his historic home, which he had carefully restored over many years. He was 84. Mr. Osborn would have been pleased that his family asked those who wished to remember him to contribute to the Hebron Volunteer Fire Department to help restore its antique fire truck. 

Father Figure in Norwich
Dan O'Leary liked to help people.
As president of the Norwich-Quinnebaug Unit of the American Cancer Society and the fund-raising chairman of the statewide Cancer Society, he raised tens of thousands of dollars to fight the disease. He was also involved in raising funds for the Haitian Health Council, which provides poverty-stricken Haitians with medical and dental treatment.
Mr. O'Leary and his wife, Carolyn, helped relocate hundreds Laotian refugees from camps in Thailand to permanent homes in Connecticut. To the 500 men, women and children in the Laotian community in northeastern Connecticut, Mr. O'Leary was known as Papa. 
Mr. O'Leary died May 4 at his home in Danielson. He was 64. 

An Officer and Reporter
Albert Cotter enlisted in the army as a private in 1942 and retired as a major general in the Connecticut National Guard 34 years later. 
As a civilian, he was a newspaperman, first with the weekly Farmington Valley Herald and then with The Hartford Times, which he served as both city hall reporter and military editor from 1947 to 1963.
When the Connecticut-based 43rd Infantry Division was called to active duty during the Korean War, The Hartford Times assigned Mr. Cotter to cover the division for the two years it was attached to NATO in Germany.
Mr. Cotter, a graduate of Georgetown University, was an army sergeant in 1943 when he was sent to officer candidate school and commissioned a second lieutenant. He spent two years as a platoon leader and battery commander in the European theater and received the Soldier's Medal, the highest Army decoration for valor involving an act of heroism in a non-combat situation, for risking his life to save a member of his anti-aircraft battery in France in 1945. 
When he was discharged as a captain in 1946, Mr. Cotter joined the Connecticut-based 76th Infantry Army Reserve Division and later transferred to the Connecticut National Guard. During the administrations of Gov. Abraham Ribicoff and Gov. John Dempsey, he was the senior officer on the governor's military staff. He also commanded the Guard's officer candidate school at Camp Dempsey in Niantic in 1967. By the time he retired in 1976, he was a major general.
Mr. Cotter died March 8. He was 83. 

Dedicated to Teaching
Helen Ely Brill believed the most meaningful period of her life was the year she taught at the Manzanar War Relocation Center, a California internment camp in which the United States government confined Japanese Americans during World War II.
At Manzanar, she met a conscientious objector named Robert Brill, who was doing alternate military service as a firefighter in the mountains near the camp. 
Ms. Brill joined the Religious Society of Friends, more familiarly known as the Quakers, while in her 20's. She was a founder of the Buffalo, N.Y., meeting and held many local, regional and national positions with the Society. 
She and her husband also founded the Connecticut Chapter of the Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays.
Ms. Brill, a longtime history teacher at Enfield High School, died April 14 of an injury caused by a fall in her Bloomfield home that day. She was 88. Her family noted that her last day was a joy-filled one spent visiting the Peabody Museum in New Haven.

Columnist Called 'Pop'
John Weaver-Bey was known as Pop, an appropriate designation for the father of 8, grandfather of 19, great grandfather of 29 and great-great grandfather of 5.
But he was also a surrogate parent and mentor to many Hartford residents, including the city's first African-American mayor, Thirman Milner. Mr. Milner's father died when he was 12, and he said Mr. Weaver-Bey always referred to him as "son."
Mr. Weaver-Bey worked for many years as a carpenter and as an oil deliveryman, but he was widely known for the column he wrote for the last two decades in the Northend Agent's, a weekly newspaper serving Hartford's black community.
Mr. Milner said that Mr. Weaver-Bey could still read small news print without glasses in his 90's. Until he became ill early in 2003, he drove copy to the newspaper's printer in Willimantic.
John Allen, the Northend Agent's publisher, said Mr. Weaver-Bey also served as the small paper's office manager, sold ads and "he was our good will ambassador. We told him he had a job with the paper for life and he did."
Mr. Weaver-Bey died in his Hartford home July 4. He was 93. 

Political Longevity
No woman served longer in the Connecticut General Assembly than M. Adela Eads.
Dell Eads was a legislator for 24 years, four of them in the House and 20 in the Senate. She was also the first and only woman elected president pro tem of the Senate.
A Republican and a fiscal conservative, Ms. Eads held moderate to liberal views on many social issues. She was credited with playing a major role in the creation of the state's Office of Child Advocate and the passage of the Education Enhancement Act, which provided higher wages for the state's teachers in the 1980's. 
She supported abortion rights and voted against a ban on the procedure that its opponents call partial birth abortions in 1999. On that occasion, according to The Hartford Courant, she "chided her male colleagues on the Senate floor by asking them how many women had called to voice support for the abortion ban. 'This is the end of the 90's. Get with it,' Eads told the male senators."
Despite her occasional differences with the party, Ms. Eads had an otherwise solid Republican voting record and wasa recipient of the party's highest honor, the Prescott Bush Award, named for the late Connecticut United States senator who was father and grandfather to Republican presidents. Whenever she made a summertime announcement that she would seek another term, Ms. Eads would be honored at a fund-raiser at the home of Kent's most prominent resident Republican, Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state.
Though considered a quintessential Connecticut Yankee, Ms. Eads was born Mary Adela Diaz in Brooklyn, N.Y., to parents who spoke fluent Spanish and English. She moved to Kent in 1950 with her husband, Vernon Eads, with whom she worked as a partner in a family owned business that bought and sold used equipment. Mr. Eads died in 2001.
At the time of her death, The Lakeville Journal noted the "many remembrances throughout the Northwest Corner of the diminutive Eads," among them a building at the Torrington Branch of the University of Connecticut, the reading room at Housatonic Valley Regional High School and a red flowering maple on the lawn of Kent's town hall.
Ms. Eads died July 8. She was 83. 

Grande Dame of G.O.P.
The political rivals John G. Rowland and Lowell Weicker rarely agree on much, but they do share an admiration for Emma Lincoln.
To Governor Rowland, Ms. Lincoln was "not only a great Republican but a great contributor to all of her causes. She had an extroardinary life and we will miss her."
To Weicker, a former governor and former Republican, Ms. Lincoln was "one of the grande dames of the Republican Party."
That she was.
Ms. Lincoln was the longtime chairwoman of the New London Republican Town Committee and was a state central committeewoman.
"For some five decades she carried the Republican Party banner in New London with enthusiasm and pride," The Day of New London said. "That she did so in a city where Democrats held an overwhelming majority and regularly inflicted heavy casualties on G.O.P. candidates was a testament to her persistence, her ironclad belief in Republican principles and her love of politics."
Ms. Lincoln had another distinction. From 1944 to 1976, she owned and operated Lincoln Auto Body in New London. During that period, she operated an auto body repair shop, an unusual job for a woman. 
Ms. Lincoln died London June 10. She was 89.

A Model Citizen
You could tell the kind of citizen Olga Mele was by the awards she received. 
In 1977, she was given the Jefferson Award from the American Institute for Public Service in Washington for her community work in Hartford. 
Three years later, President Carter presented her with a Special Distinction Award at the White House and in 1985, Pope John Paul II awarded her the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice Medal for her outstanding contributions to her church and society.
Ms. Mele was born in Guayama, P.R., and moved to Hartford in 1941. For many years, she was a job counselor with Hartford's Community Renewal Team but her involvement in the Hartford community and especially its Hispanic neighborhoods went far beyond her job.
She assisted the elderly of the city through her participation as a member of the Larabee Foundation of the Commission on Aging and as a member of St. Peter's Church she took part in many of its outreach programs through the Ladies Auxiliary and Prayer Group.
Among the many other honors cited by Ms. Mele's family were the Marcus Garvey Award, the La Casa de Puerto Rico community service award and the Maria Sanchez Award for community service named for a legendary leader of Hartford's Puerto Rican community and the first Puerto Rican member of Hartford's Board of Education. Ms. Mele was a mentor to Ms. Sanchez.
Ms. Mele died July 20. She was 86. 

Politician and Music Lover
State Representative Anthony Tercyak was on the telephone, discussing President Bush's June 12 visit to New Britain, when he collapsed and died on June 11, The Hartford Courant reported. 
On his desk, Mr. Tercyak's family found a note he had just written to a former student, apologizing for missing the student's recent recital. Mr. Tercyak had been a music teacher and coordinator of the New Britain schools' Gifted and Talented Program before retiring and running for office. He promised to attend the student's next recital. 
Mr. Tercyak was elected to the state House of Representatives in 1994 and was serving his fifth term at the time of his death. According to his family, he was proud to have been the first Republican elected to the House from the heavily Democratic New Britain and proud of the Democratic and independent votes that returned him to office. He was highly regarded by both parties and the Democrats joked that he was an honorary member of their caucus.
Robert Ward, the leader of the Republican minority in the House, recalled that when Mr. Tercyak was first elected, he gave up his Wednesday night orchestra seats to the Metropolitan Opera so that he would not miss any evening sessions of the House.
Mr. Tercyak was born and raised in a largely Polish neighborhood in New Britain known as "The Hill" and was a lifelong member of the city's Holy Cross Church that has a predominantly Polish congregation.
"They used to call him the most popular man in town," said Mayor Lucian Pawlak. "He earned that title. He deeply loved his community."
Mr. Tercyak was 79 when he died. As expected, a Democrat was elected to succeed him. The Democrat is Mr. Tercyak's son Peter.

Stalwart of Education
Theodore Powell was one of the founders of Connecticut's community college system in the 1960's and an early chancellor of the colleges.
Mr. Powell lived in Manchester for many years and played a prominent role in the town's political life as a member of the Manchester board of directors and as deputy mayor.
"He was a voice of liberalism and had the courage to express his feelings, no matter the odds," said Ted Cummings, Manchester's Democratic town chairman who worked closely with Mr. Powell.
He persuaded Manchester leaders to establish the Manchester Community College in 1963 and received an honorary degree from the college in 2000. Andew McKirdy, who succeeded Mr. Powell as chancellor of the community college system, called Mr. Powell "a man who was deeply committed to the extension of educational opportunities to people who wouldn't otherwise have them. He could be extremely feisty in advancing his causes. That was part of the strength of his commitment." 
Eleanor Coltman, an associate of Mr. Powell in establishing the Manchester college, agreed with Mr. McKirdy's description of Mr. Powell's feistiness, saying that he had very strong opinions "but he was always very gentlemanly about it."
Mr. Powell, a combat veteran of World War II, was educated at Colgate University and received a master's degree in political science from Johns Hopkins University and a doctorate in public law and government from Columbia. He was the author of two books, "The Long Rescue," an account of a Navy arctic expedition in the 19th century, and "The School Bus Law," about a bitter battle in the Connecticut General Assembly in the 1950's over providing bus service to parochial school students.
Mr. Powell left Connecticut in 1968 to become a professor and then the president of Fenger-Southeast Community College in Chicago. He later taught at community colleges in New York. 
Mr. Powell died May 13 in California. He was 84. 

Painter of Presidents
Herbert Abrams painted portraits of presidents.
He also painted other famous people, like governors, a first lady, a general, an astronaut and a playwright. The presidents were George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter. The first lady was Barbara Bush. His three governors were from Connecticut: Thomas Meskill, Ella Grasso and Lowell Weicker. The general was William Westmoreland, the astronaut, Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin and the playwright, Arthur Miller.
Mr. Abrams wasn't always a painter of portraits. As a young artist fresh out of Norwich Art School, he painted camouflage for the United States Air Force during World War II. He also became a pilot and was the designer of aircraft insignia. Later, he taught art at the United States Military Academy at West Point.
After the war, Mr. Abrams studied at the Pratt Institute and Art Students League in New York. He wasn't an immediate success as an artist, once recalling that he considered himself fortunate to sell his paintings for as much as $35 from a park bench in Greenwich Village. But he did find success as a portrait artist, painting more than 400 portraits in a 40-year career.
Mr. Abrams's wife, Lois, who served as his public relations aide and scheduler, told The Hartford Courant that her husband insisted on getting to know each subject before beginning to paint. She said it was important to him to not be in awe of the people he painted and that they not worry "about the artist who was going to portray him or her for posterity." 
To prepare for the Carter portrait, Mr. Abrams went to church with the president and attended the Sunday school Mr. Carter conducted in his home town of Plains, Ga. With Mr. Bush, Mr. Abrams discussed mutually pleasant things like their interest in fly fishing and the Boston Red Sox. 
Both presidents and their families liked their portraits, Ms. Abrams said. Mr. Carter's mother, Miss Lillian Carter, had warned the artist that she wouldn't like the portrait "unless it's just like him." When she saw her son's likeness, she agreed it was just like him and said, "I do like it."
When the Bush portrait was unveiled in 1995, Mr. Bush looked at the painting of him standing in his office with his elbow resting on a globe and said, "I'm inclined to think it's pretty darned good."
Mr. Abrams, who lived in Warren for many years, died Aug. 29. He was 82.

Service as Prosecutor
Politics was in Jack Bailey's blood but he was never elected to anything other than Democratic town chairman of Colchester. Instead, he chose a career in public service as a prosecutor, an appointed office in Connecticut.
John Michael Bailey was the son of John Moran Bailey, one of the most powerful political leaders Connecticut has produced. As the only son of the longtime Democratic state chairman and national chairman in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, the younger Mr. Bailey for a time seemed likely to become involved in his father's profession. But his ambitions ran head on into those of another heir to a Connecticut political dynasty, Christopher Dodd, the son of the United States Senator Thomas Dodd. The two met in a Congressional primary in 1974 and Mr. Dodd won.
Mr. Bailey's older sister, Barbara Kennelly, did choose the family business, running successfully for secretary of the state and serving 17 years in Congress beforerunning for governor, and losing, in 1994.
When Jack Bailey died, Mr. Dodd, now Connecticut's senior senator, said, "He had a strong understanding of Connecticut's history because his family has been such an important part of that history."
Mr. Bailey served as a White House intern during the Johnson Administration and worked at the 1964 and 1968 Democratic conventions. After graduating from Ashland College and Catholic University's law school in 1972, he joined his father's Hartford law firm, Bailey and Wechsler. He left the firm after losing the Congressional nomination to become a prosecutor. After four years as an assistant state's attorney in Manchester, he became Hartford's state's attorney at age 35. 
Mr. Bailey was prosecutor in Hartford for 14 years before being promoted to chief state's attorney, a post he held until health problems forced him into early retirement in 2002. 
As chief state's attorney, Mr. Bailey went before the General Assembly several times seeking investigative subpoena power for his prosecutors. Without such power, Mr. Bailey argued, state prosecutors had to rely on federal prosecutors to conduct more serious and complex investigations. 
Mr. Bailey stepped down as chief state's attorney after he was told by doctors that he had progressive bulbar palsy, a rare disorder in which talking and swallowing become increasingly difficult. There is no known cause or cure for the disease, a variation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease. For the last year of his life, Mr. Bailey was unable to speak and he could not respond to the 2000 people who attended a tribute to him in Southington 11 months ago.
"For a man so engaging not to be able to speak for the last months of his life must have been excruciating," said Richard Palmer, the state Supreme Court Justice, who presided at the Southington dinner. "But he handled it with aplomb and communicated without speaking." 
Mr. Bailey died Sept. 23. He was 59. 

A Star and 'Local Girl'
Katharine Hepburn grew up in Hartford at 138 Hawthorne Street, near Mark Twain's home, and also at 201 Bloomfield Avenue in West Hartford.
But the Connecticut community in which Ms. Hepburn lived most of her long life was Fenwick, the borough within Old Saybrook at the mouth of the Connecticut River. Dr. Thomas Hepburn and his wife, Katharine, first brought their young family to the affluent shoreline enclave in 1913, when Katharine was 6.
"Mother and dad were perfect parents," Ms. Hepburn wrote in "Me," her 1991 autobiography. "They brought us up with a feeling of freedom. There were no rules. There were simply certain things which we did -- and certain things which we didn't do because they would hurt others."
Dr. Hepburn was a surgeon and an early advocate of informing the public about venereal disease and his wife was a crusader for women's suffrage and birth control.
"In Hartford," Ms. Hepburn would remember years later, "that made her a wicked woman. When I was a small child, we'd be out walking and we'd meet a neighbor on the street and my mother would say, 'good morning,' and the neighbor would look right through us as if nobody was there."
Ms. Hepburn attended Hartford's West Middle School and the private Oxford School and in 1924, she enrolled in Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia. She left college to pursue her legendary, 60-year career in Hollywood but in many ways, she never left Connecticut.
"Well, it's home to me," she wrote. "I've been stuck in the snow. I've lost a house in a hurricane. I've tennised, I've golfed. It's been fun. I've lived there and I'll be buried there."
The house lost in a hurricane was the first family home at Fenwick. Ms. Hepburn was visiting there before making the movie "The Philadelphia Story" when, on Sept. 21, 1938, the most ferocious hurricane to hit Connecticut in more than a century struck the coastline without warning. Ms. Hepburn, her mother, her brother Robert, a family friend and the cook fled from the house just minutes before it floated off its foundation and disappeared into Long Island Sound.
Dr. Hepburn would build a larger home to which Ms. Hepburn would retreat throughout her career. "I'm like the girl who never grew up, you see," she told an interviewer in 1989. "I just never really left home, so to speak. I always went back there almost every weekend of my life when I wasn't filming. I kept my life there, my roots."
To underscore her Connecticut roots, Ms. Hepburn left her autograph with those of other famous performers on a backstage wall in Hartford's Bushnell Auditorium. Under her name, she wrote, "local girl."
Ms. Hepburn died at her Fenwick home on June 29 and was buried in the family plot at the Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. She was 96. 

Dependable and Dedicated
The slogan on the five red tow trucks that Charles Matties operated out of his two West Hartford service stations was this: "Stuck -- Call Chuck."
Those words could have applied just as well to Mr. Matties's long service to West Hartford as a councilman, state representative and mayor because Mr. Matties, a Republican, was more concerned with solving community problems than with ideology or partisan politics. The town responded by electing him councilman nine times and to one term as mayor. He also served four terms in the Legislature. (Another measure of longevity: he operated Matties Service Stations on Park Road and Farmington Avenue in West Hartford for 48 years.) 
Senator Kevin Sullivan, president pro tem of the State Senate and a Democrat, defeated Mr. Matties for the seat he now holds in 1986. "He was not a partisan," Mr. Sullivan of his rival. "He was a good guy."
Mr. Matties died July 29 at the John Dempsey-UConn Medical Center in Farmington. He was 79.

Stickler for the Law
Clarence Jackson, a 24-year-old black man from Hamden, had made an expensive mistake. He had failed to redeem a winning $5.8 million dollar state lottery ticket within a year, as required by state law, turning it in three days late.
There was an outpouring of sympathy for the young man from every corner of the state. Among those moved by Mr. Jackson's plight were members of the House of Representatives, who voted to declare him the winner and award him the millions. It looked as if the State Senate would do the same, until Senator Alvin Penn said no.
Mr. Penn, known as a tireless and tenacious fighter for minority groups and the urban poor he represented in Bridgeport, wanted to go along with the House. But as chairman of the public safety committee, which oversees the lottery, Mr. Penn concluded that he could not bend the rules. He blocked a Senate vote, thereby depriving Mr. Jackson of the money.
"Don't they know I'd love to give this kid a check? I'd love to help the brother out," Senator Penn told his press secretary, Dan Tapper. "But it's not mine to give. My job is to make tough decisions. I'm sorry but that's my job." 
Mr. Penn also considered it his job to end racial profiling by police after his car was stopped by the police in Trumbull for no reason. Three years after the episode, both houses passed a law that prohibitspolice officers from pulling over minority drivers who are not breaking any law. He also introduced legislation strengthening the state's witness protection program after an 8-year-old Bridgeport boy and his mother were shot and killed to keep them from testifying at a murder trial.
Mr. Penn was first elected to the Senate in 1983. From the start, he was seen as a relentless, even stubborn champion of his city's poor but he was not always successful in his quest for jobs and other opportunities for his constituents. In 1995, he tried to get the General Assembly to allow the construction of a casino in Bridgeport. He saw a casino as an economic cure for many of the city's problems but suburban residents objected to the traffic a casino would bring to the already clogged Interstate 95. The casino bill was defeated.
Mr. Penn was being treated for pancreatic cancer when he was elected to his sixth term in 2002. He died Feb. 14 at age 54.

Judging With Wit and Intellect
After learning that he had bone marrow cancer six years ago at age 75, David Shea, a retired state Supreme Court Justice, took his wife, Rosemary, through the Canadian Rockies hiking by helicopter.
Maura Shea Crowley, his daughter, recalled how concerned the family was as her parents crossed ravines on swaying rope bridges and hiked for hours at an altitude of 14,000 feet but the vacation was a success.
Mr. Shea was on the state Supreme Court for 11 years, stepping down upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70 in 1992, but continuing to sit as a trial court referee until last December.
Judge Shea wrote that the majority opinion in a celebrated case involving a conflict between property rights and free speech when he and a court majority determined the Westfarms shopping mall in West Hartford was not the 20th-century equivalent of a town green.
The opinion denied the National Organization for Women the right to circulate petitions in the mall, saying the state constitution protected the free speech rights of individuals against government interference but the property rights of the shopping mall owners could not be denied by the petitioners.
Mr. Shea died July 22. He was 81. 

Banker and Negotiator
In January 1981, Alexander Vagliano and 11 other American bankers negotiated the release of frozen Iranian assets in American banks in exchange for the 53 hostages taken by a mob from the United States embassy. One of the freed hostages was Mr. Vagliano's cousin, Moorehead Kennedy, an economics and development officer at the embassy.
A native of Paris, Mr. Vagliano came to the United States in 1940 at age 13 and became a citizen five years later after serving in the United States Army. He was a graduate of Harvard College and a cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School. 
During the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, Mr. Vagliano was director of the Office of Capital Development and Finance for the Near East and South Asia in the Agency for International Development. He also had a long career as a banker with J.P. Morgan and Company.
Shortly after Mr. Vagliano helped negotiate the release of the hostages in 1981, he ended his career with J.P. Morgan and became a sheep farmer in Norfolk. 
He continued to pursue the interests he had developed in banking and government as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a founding trustee of the French-American Foundation, a trustee of the Institute for French Studies at New York University, a governor of the Atlantic Institute for International Affairs and a trustee of the Council for Excellence in Government.
Mr. Vagliano died Nov. 13. He was 76.

Judging Through the Ranks
Judge Joseph Dannehy began his judicial career as a police court judge in Willimantic in 1949 when Connecticut cities and towns had their own courts to deal with traffic violations and other minor crimes. He retired as a justice of the state Supreme Court nearly 40 years later.
According to The Hartford Courant, he is believed to have been the only judge to serve on all five levels of the state's court system, including two that no longer exist: the town courts and the circuit courts that replaced them. 
"No judge revered the law more than Judge Dannehy," said Austin McGuigan, a former Chief State's Attorney. "And no judge was more demanding of excellence in the pursuit of justice."
Mr. McGuigan worked with Judge Dannehy on a one-person grand jury investigation of a botched police investigation of a hit and run death in New London in the 1970's.
On Christmas Eve 1973, a New London teenager named Kevin Showalter was struck and killed by a hit and run driver and Judge Dannehy's investigation ultimately concluded that "more probably than not" the hit-and-run driver was Harvey Mallove, a prominent New London jeweler and a former mayor. The judge's investigation, the longest and most expensive in Connecticut history up to that time, was criticized by Mr. Mallove's supporters for naming the former mayor on evidence that was probable but not conclusive. 
Judge Dannehy defended his findings, but said that Mr. Mallove could not be prosecuted because the police had lost or destroyed important evidence.
Judge Dannehy wrote in the grand jury report, "After Dec. 25, the New London Police Department did nothing to solve the hit and run death of Kevin B. Showalter."
Judge Dannehy was a lifelong resident of Willimantic, and after attending Boston College and Cornell University Law School, he returned to his home where he practiced law and served as a police court prosecutor, a Willimantic city attorney and the Windham town attorney before becoming a town court judge. He was one of the first judges appointed to the Circuit Court after it was established in 1961 and moved on to Superior Court and the Court of Appeals before becoming a Supreme Court justice.
Judge Dannehy died Dec. 17. He was 86.

Charting High School Sports
Bohdan Kolinsky started writing about high school sports for The Wethersfield Post when he was in high school and he never stopped. He was covering the state high school football playoffs days before his death two weeks ago.
Bo Kolinsky was eight months out of Wethersfield High School when he got a job in The Hartford Courant sports department in 1973. He was named the director of high school sports coverage four years later and probably saw more high school games than anyone in the state in his 30 years at the paper. As the assistant sports editor for high school sports, he was responsible for covering more than 100 sports programs.
"High school athletics will miss him greatly," said Charlie Sharos, a retired basketball and soccer coach from South Windsor. "He was an advocate for high school sports events and wanted high school athletes and teams to get their due in the paper." 
Mr. Kolinsky was a past president of the Connecticut Sports Writers Alliance and in 1989 he received the organization's Art McGinley Award for meritorious service to Connecticut sports. He was then 35 and the award's youngest recipient. 
Mr. Kolinsky died of a heart attack Dec. 14. He was 49.

HEADLINE: Faster and More Furious, With Cash Back 

BYLINE:  By JAMES G. COBB

 BODY:
WHAT kind of year was 2003, automotively speaking?
 It was the year of the deal, with car sales propped up in a queasy economy by no-interest loans, no-money-down deals and generous rebates. 
 It was the year of the truck. Through November, light trucks -- including pickups, S.U.V.'s and minivans -- were handily outselling passenger cars once again. And consider this: last month, Porsche, a company built on fast sports cars, sold more trucks than automobiles. 
 It was the year of Toyota, which passed Ford in worldwide sales for six months this year to become, at least temporarily, the world's No. 2 automaker. 
 It was a year of horsepower, with several new cars -- including the Porsche Carrera GT and Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren -- offering 600-plus, and Volkswagen's Bugatti subsidiary claiming 987 for its ultraexclusive Veyron. (You may recall that just two years ago, the BMW M5 seemed outlandishly overpowered with just 400.) 
 It was the year of the Hummer, whose H2 had quasi-military street swagger as war sabers were being rattled. What's more, the celebrity most associated with all things Hummer moved into the governor's office in California, the state that has done the most to regulate, downscale and electrify the auto industry.
 It was a year of cars and sex. Buick moved to rename its new LaCrosse in Canada, after learning that the word is slang in Quebec for a sex act. Dodge generated controversy with a commercial for its enlarged Durango that featured men standing at urinals making double entendres about the size of an unidentified object. And, under pressure, Dodge backed off from its plan to sponsor the Lingerie Bowl, a cable TV event that was originally promoted as a football game between teams of female models in underwear.
 It was also, of course, a year of cars and trucks -- good, bad and sometimes ugly. Here are a dozen of the better efforts, in the admittedly subjective view of this writer:

AUDI A8L: Imagine this "Gremlins" sequel: electronic poltergeists inhabit the complex electronic systems of European luxury cars, tormenting owners with system failures and plaguing service managers with elusive bugs. This year, Audi offered a remedy with its MMI user interface, which restores a bit of intuitiveness to these overachiever dashboards. While there is no guarantee that the big Audi won't have troubles, too, at least the interface is easier to use. And beyond that, this $70,000 aluminum sedan is smooth and spacious.

CADILLAC SRX: Of all the auto divisions in Detroit, only Cadillac seems to have figured out what it stands for - quite a turnaround for a brand that until recently seemed ready for the old folks' home. The SRX sport wagon is a lively alternative to high-end imports. Yes, the price is steep, at $39,000 to nearly $60,000, but the SRX is, on balance, a credible first effort in an arena where G.M. had never dared to compete.

CADILLAC XLR: Bold, brash and unabashedly American, this Corvette-based luxury roadster is also fast, stylish and thoroughly original. FORD F-150: These are dire financial times for Ford, whose very survival may depend on the success of its new bread-and-butter pickup, which is also the nation's best-selling vehicle. Mission accomplished: the rock-solid 2004 F-150 melds big-city polish with Big Sky toughness to reclaim first place among full-size trucks.

FORD FOCUS PZEV: The Focus's initial promise was undone by quality and mechanical glitches. With those problems presumably behind it, the Focus family is again one of Ford's bright lights; the high-performance Focus SVT is one of the best cars ever to wear the blue oval. This year, Ford earned some green stripes by offering partial-zero-emission versions of the Focus nationwide, proof that environmentally friendlier cars can also be peppy and economical, at a cost barely higher than much more polluting versions.

INFINITI FX35/FX45: Suppose the Porsche Cayenne Turbo cost half as much and looked twice as good? It would be more like this pair of crossover speedwagons, which got a double dose of sport (sports car plus S.U.V.) at the expense of utility (the sleek roofline compromises cargo capacity). Yes, the ride can be harsh on those huge wheels, and the people who designed the unintuitive controls should be sent home in an Acura. But the FX's are highly entertaining, both to drive and to look at.

LEXUS RX330: While other sport utilities tried to outdo one another with menacing grilles and contrived body cladding, Lexus got in touch with its feminine side. The second-generation RX is plush and polished, with carlike manners, a silky ride and a high-heeled view of the road. While the RX is not exactly my cup of mocha frappucino, it seems to be just what what many suburbanites, especially women, are looking for.

MAZDA RX-8: After a period of austerity, Mazda is again turning out some of the best-driving cars around. For the reborn RX, it revamped the small but powerful rotary engine that it shares with no other company, matched to a crisp six-speed gearbox. Small rear doors and a usable back seat make this a slick sports car for the entire family.

NISSAN TITAN: This mammoth, in-your-face truck is Japan's first truly serious challenge to the Big Three's last remaining stronghold: the huge market for full-size pickups. With a powerful engine of modern design, Incredible Hulk nonstyling and ingenious touches (like adjustable cargo latches and a lockable outside storage drawer), the Titan demands respect. The truck isn't subtle, but it's too impressive to ignore.

RANGE ROVER: One of the best things under the Ford Motor umbrella is this British adoptee fathered by Germans. The latest Range Rover, developed in the brief period when BMW owned Land Rover, is an aristocratic redefinition of the definitive S.U.V. In a luxury utility segment full of pretenders, this is the real thing.

TOYOTA PRIUS: Some see this second-generation gas-electric hybrid as a paradigm of fuel efficiency. Others (especially the competition) see it as an overhyped pretender with complicated mechanical systems, unproven reliability and real-world mileage that falls far short of official estimates. The truth, no doubt, lies in between. The Prius's driving dynamics are inferior to other Toyotas' and its mileage isn't a lot better than that of some efficient gas-only cars. But the Prius is cleverly designed and shrewdly marketed, and it has Americans lining up to vote for the sorts of green vehicles that Detroit keeps promising but never delivers.

TOYOTA SIENNA: This cleverly redesigned minivan jumps over the Honda Odyssey for best-van honors, and along with the new, more stylish Nissan Quest, it may give a lift to this 20-year-old segment. One other thing: the Sienna makes a dandy New York City taxicab.

Other Cars of the Year
 Here are some reflections on other vehicles from the 2003 test fleet:

ACURA TSX: A plush version of the shorter foreign-market Honda Accord, the bland TSX does everything well. Sowell, in fact, that it's hard to remember having driven it.

BMW 530i: The old 5 Series was perhaps the best all-round sedan in the world, and the new version is every bit as exciting to drive. But like the 7 Series and the Z4 roadster, the new 5, with its electronic gadgets and flame-broiled styling, seems colder, more distant and less endearing.

BMW X3: The 325xi wagon, a terrific all-wheel-drive car, weighs 3,594 pounds. The new X3 sport utility is over 4,000, with a higher center of gravity. Is it any wonder that the X3 is slower, harsher and less pleasant?

CHEVROLET MALIBU: The good news is that G.M. seems to have finally made a serious commitment to the midsize family sedan, and the '04 Malibu is a big leap over its Hertz-special predecessor. But Chevy continues to aim too low with its yawn-inducing styling.

CHEVROLET SSR: I fell headlamps over tailgate in love with the original concept version of this roadster pickup, but the production version arrived at a porky 4,760 pounds and a hefty $42,000 -- a heavyweight date.

CHRYSLER CROSSFIRE: Aside from making use of available Mercedes components, what was the point of this ultraclaustrophobic, none-too-fun $35,000 coupe?

CHRYSLER PACIFICA: Overhyped and overpriced when introduced, this big wagon was supposed to be the next big thing. It isn't yet.

GMC ENVOY XUV: The retracting cargo roof is handy if you have a pet giraffe. With the test truck carrying a sticker of $45,390, I'd make him walk.

HONDA ELEMENT: If this box on wheels was supposed to appeal to young people, why do you mostly see old people driving them?

JAGUAR S-TYPE R: I find the S-Type more lovely as time goes by, and the high-performance R version is dressed in subtle but striking jewelry. Too bad the illusion vanishes when you start to drive and realize that this disconnected-feeling car is no competition to its poised rivals from BMW and Mercedes.

JAGUAR XJR: The new aluminum body is a crowd-pleaser, and the supercharged V-8 has jet-engine thrust. Still, I wish Jaguar had done a redesign that was a little less retro and a little more forward-looking.

LINCOLN AVIATOR: My test version of this overstuffed Explorer, with a sticker of $48,370, is a strong contender for the title of most overpriced test vehicle of 2003.

MITSUBISHI LANCER EVOLUTION: Driving this ferociously fun rally car was, along with time in the competitive Subaru WRX STi, one of the highlights of the year.

NISSAN MAXIMA: Nissan's respected flagship sedan found itself in an uncomfortable position, squeezed between a bigger, better Altima and its fancy Infiniti cousins. In trying to move upscale, the new Maxima comes off as just another, somewhat odd contender in the supercompetitive market for $30,000 sedans.

NISSAN PATHFINDER ARMADA: Since S.U.V.'s are now nearly as big as houses, why not make them look like three-bedroom Colonials? The side windows of this Brobdingnagian S.U.V. form a peak, inviting calls from aluminum-siding salesmen.

PONTIAC GRAND PRIX: Despite a mild redesign, this unrefined old-tech car feels two decades behind the times, with one of the poorest interiors I've seen in years.

PORSCHE CAYENNE TURBO: It is homely, it can cost nearly $100,000 and it requires a change of tires to go off road. It is closely related to the Volkswagen Touareg , which does nearly everything just as well for half the price. Coming soon: a V-6 version for the people who always lusted for a slow Porsche.

SAAB 9-3: Those who fear for Saab's future as part of G.M. have reason to fret. There will soon be Saab-arus and thinly disguised GMC S.U.V.'s in the lineup. The nice-driving 9-3 sedan preserves a bit of Saab appeal, but I spent my time in the car wondering where they got the flimsy, fragile plastic controls.

SATURN ION: A key difference between the "old" G.M. and the new one: nowadays, when the company rushes cars to market that aren't ready for prime time, it comes back to clean up its mistakes. Both the sad-sack Saturn Vue and Ion have received engineers' attention, and at least the new version of the Vue, with a Honda engine, is much improved.

SCION xB: What can you say, really, about a tiny youth-oriented box with a killer stereo that lets you choose interior lighting from a menu that includes "tangerine" and "amethyst"?

VOLKSWAGEN TOUAREG: The Touareg is a good, handsome and rather expensive S.U.V. that, like many others, is too bulky for its own good.

VOLVO XC90: The antirollover system is an innovation, but there is little else about this pricey S.U.V. that rises above the competition.

Tenant Advocacy Group Faces Eviction

BYLINE:  By Colin Moynihan; This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Fifteen years ago, when a nonprofit tenants advocacy group called Good Old Lower East Side set up shop in a storefront at 525 East Sixth Street, between Avenues A and B, the area was filled with rubble-strewn lots and derelict tenements. Arson was common, and sidewalk drug bazaars operated around the clock. 
 Today, however, as restaurants and boutiques have opened and as rents have risen to record levels, the landscape of the East Village has changed dramatically. And for a group called Good Old Lower East Side, which has existed since 1977 and is known locally as Goles, that transformation is turning out to be a big problem. The lease on the storefront expires at year's end, and the building's management agency has told the advocates that the $1,200 monthly rent for the storefront will at least double in the new year. Now the group that has sought to defend tenants from eviction for 26 years may itself be sent packing by a landlord. 
 The neighborhood may be gentrified, but that doesn't mean there is no longer a constituency for Goles, said Margaret Hughes, the group's executive director. "There are still people who need our help," Ms. Hughes said on a recent afternoon. "They aren't as visible as they used to be, but they're still here."
 Howard Cohen, the president of 14K Management, which began running the low-income co-op building at the end of 2001, said the increase was necessary. The co-op, he said, has only eight apartments and depends on income from the storefront to pay bills. "The building is not wealthy," he said. "They need a fair rental from the storefront."
 Ms. Hughes spoke about the group's history of organizing rent strikes, working with the police and residents to limit drug dealing, and helping persuade landlords to retain tenants who receive public assistance. But she also spoke about what had drawn her to the arduous and sometimes thankless role of tenant advocate.
 One of her earliest memories, she said, is of bathing in front of a coal-burning stove in Belfast, where her family moved from Brooklyn after her birth 40 years ago. She remembers marching in funeral processions that often turned into angry political demonstrations, Ms. Hughes said, and watching her father, a freelance television cameraman, film confrontations between mourners and riot police.
 "I grew up with a sense that everyone should have a voice," Ms. Hughes said. "And the best way to get justice was to be in the street, be visible and use that voice."
 In 1972, when Ms. Hughes was 9, her family moved back to New York City, and as she grew up she was convinced that she wanted to pursue work assisting the needy. She earned a bachelor's degree in literature from Fordham University and a master's degree in social work from Columbia. Along the way, she said, she counseled teenagers in a group home in Fresno, Calif., and taught high school in Kenya. But she also organized tenants in Manhattan and Brooklyn before joining Goles in 1998.
 At times, Ms. Hughes said, work in the nonprofit world has been wearing. "There are so many times you think that a battle simply can't be won." she said. Still, she could not help beaming as she described how in 1987, she and others lobbied successfully to prevent the razing of seven Upper East Side tenements that had cracks in their facades caused by construction work next door. She said she still remembered her sense of elation on learning that the buildings would remain standing.
 "When you win there's a feeling that people can overcome the system," she said. 
 GOLES staff members are still hoping for such an experience at 525 East Sixth Street. Ms. Hughes said she was talking to residents and to members of the co-op board about the possibility of staying. At the same time, she said, she was looking into new spaces. Goles has a thrift shop with four employees at the corner of Avenue B and East Third Street and a two-person office at Avenue B and East 10th Street for which they are given a break in the rent. But neither, she said, could accommodate the entire paid staff of 13. She added that the group, which is financed by grants and donations, was determined to somehow stay on the Lower East Side.
 "We will remain in this community and we will continue our services," Ms. Hughes said. "The trick will be figuring out how to do that and also pay the rent."

HEADLINE: The Plays And Players Of the Year

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:

BRUCE WEBER

1. THE CLASSICAL THEATER OF HARLEM Three adventurous productions this year put it on the map as a company to follow and relish. The standout was a raucous, audience-challenging revival of ''The Blacks,'' Jean Genets surreal take on race.

2. JEFFERSON MAYS The star of ''I Am My Own Wife,'' heretofore unknown, gave the tour-de-force performance of the year, a testament to an actors commitment to a role and a play.

3. 'THE BEARD OF AVON' Amy Freed's smart and witty treatment of the Shakespeare author-ship question was presented all over the country, before a fun-loving production directed by Doug Hughes opened at New York Theater Workshop. Another reminder that New York is not necessarily on the leading edge of American theater.

4. 'THE MOONLIGHT ROOM' This first play by Tristine Skyler is a rarity from a young writer in this age of shocking subject matter and episodic, film-fluenced scripts: it's a realistic drama with both intelligence and a crowd-pleasing heart. The subject, teenagers and their single parents, is neither sensational nor frivolous. A careful production by the Worth Street Theater Company (directed by Jeff Cohen) announced a promising talent.

5. FLOW In this flawed but fascinating one-man show about neighborhood storytellers in the Bronx (presented at the New York City Hip-Hop Theater Festival and later at New York Theater Workshop), Will Power gave a tantalizing glimpse of how hip-hop culture is likely to influence theater art and vice versa.

6. THE DAUGHTER-IN-LAW The Mint Theater Company, which is devoted to unearthing forgotten but worthy works, has had an uneven track record, but its production of this powerful early drama by D. H. Lawrence was proof that theater history is worth excavating.

7. 'HUMBLE BOY' Not Charlotte Jones's over-wrought homage to ''Hamlet,'' but Tim Hatley's magnificent set for it. Mr. Hatley created a wild garden, complete with long grasses, hillocks, wildflowers and pathways, that turned the underground stage at the Manhattan Theater Club into a thrilling terrarium, a reminder that in any production, any of the myriad collaborators may leave a brilliant mark.

8. JULIE WHITE In two irresistibly charming performances as a harried wife in Daniel Stern's wispy comedy ''Barbras Wedding,'' and as a harried single woman in Theresa Rebeck's one-woman show ''Bad Dates'' - Ms. White earned this year's award for the performer who out-shines her material.

9. RESIDENT THEATERS From the Alley Theater's side-by-side productions of Edward Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' and ''The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?'' in Houston, to the Old Globe's ''Julius Caesar'' in San Diego, to the coproduction by the Berkeley Rep and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival of David Edgar's two-play political opus, ''Continental Divide,'' to Arena Stage's compact ''South Pacific'' in Washington, D.C., the notable productions of the year stretched from coast to coast. A collective nod to the nonprofit theaters around the country that make quality theater virtually impossible to escape.

BEN BRANTLEY

1. VANESSA REDGRAVE, 'LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT' As the morphine-addicted mother in Eugene O'Neill's masterpiece, she went way out on a limb and took us all with her.

2. DONNA MURPHY, 'WONDERFUL TOWN' Absolute blissful perfection.

3. KEVIN KLINE, 'HENRY IV' With his fine-grained portrait of Falstaff in the superb Lincoln Center Theater revival, he found far more than ham in Shakespeare's porcine hedonist.

4. BERNADETTE PETERS, 'GYPSY' Redefining both a classic character (Mama Rose) and her own adorable image, she gave the gutsiest musical performance of the year.

5. TONYA PINKINS, 'CAROLINE, OR CHANGE' As a Southern maid in 1963 in this musical economics lesson from Tony Kushner and Jeanine Tesori, she finds a dazzling ferocity in self-repression.

6. EDDIE IZZARD, 'A DAY IN THE DEATH OF JOE EGG' The year's No. 1 crossover performance by a cross-dresser. Mr. Izzard, who wore fishnet stockings for ''Sexie,'' his scintillating one-man show, proved himself equally at home in trousers as the attention-hungry schoolteacher in the revival of Peter Nichols's wrenching drama.

7. NED BEATTY, 'CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF' Let others debate his offstage etiquette. As Tennessee Williams's Big Daddy, he is a life-affirming expert in bad manners.

8. KRISTIN CHENOWETH, WICKED Her skill, sparkle and high-sheen soprano gave depth and contours to the years most superficial heroine, Glinda the Good Witch.

9. HUGH JACKMAN, 'THE BOY FROM OZ' As the singer Peter Allen in this bathetic bio-musical, he drew blood from papier-mch and confirmed his status as a serious musical star.

10. DENIS O'HARE, 'TAKE ME OUT' As an accountant in love with baseball in Richard Greenberg's Tony-winning play, this actor's actor infected even nonsports fans with his character's galloping enthusiasm.

11. AIDAN GILLEN, 'THE CARETAKER' Making his Broadway debut in the smallest role in this lukewarm revival, he demonstrated that silence in Pinterland is worth a thousand spoken threats and snatched the show from his more famous co-stars (Patrick Stewart, Kyle MacLachlan).

12. MELANIE GRIFFITH, 'CHICAGO' Taking over the role of the narcissistic Roxie Hart, she proved you don't have to be able to sing or dance to dominate a musical. Let's just hope this isn't a trend.

HEADLINE: THE LIVES THEY LIVED; 
Crossing Class Lines

BYLINE:  By Diane McWhorter; Diane McWhorter is the author of "Carry Me Home."

 BODY:
 Ivan Allen Jr. b. 1911, Maynard H. Jackson Jr. b. 1938
The South can be a magical place, conjuring gracious illusions out of jagged reality. No Southern city has been better at performing sleights of image than Atlanta. The metropolis that finessed "Gone With the Wind" from slavery has also owned the modern South's most beguiling myth: the triumphal transition from segregation to integration. Only days apart last summer came the deaths of two protagonists of that redemption story. Ivan Allen Jr., who died at 92 on July 2, was the white savior, the noble aristocrat who steered the segregationists into the light as Atlanta's mayor during the darkest 1960's. Maynard H. Jackson Jr., who died nine days earlier at 65, was the black messiah, the great-grandson of slaves who fulfilled Allen's vision by becoming, in 1974, the urban South's first African-American mayor. (Incredibly, the nemesis in this drama, Lester Maddox, died at 87 two days after Jackson. The classic "cracker" demagogue, Maddox won the Georgia governor's office in 1967 after doing little more than waving a pistol at blacks hoping to eat at his famed Atlanta restaurant, the Pickrick. )
 Beneath these romantic archetypes of the civil rights era is an unsentimental story of class and money that is in its way no less heroic. Historically, the South's power elite encouraged racial friction between poor whites and blacks so that those have-nots wouldn't gang up on them. Atlanta's genius was to invert the race-baiting ruses that had safeguarded the Southern economy and pioneer a new gimmick of civic boosterism: racial harmony. Allen and Jackson were very much vehicles of the Chamber of Commerce's mission. But it was the thrilling ways in which they transcended their own bourgeois backgrounds that accounted for their success and exposed the shaded contradictions of class underneath the black-and-white surface. 
Allen's story -- that of the reconstructed white Southerner -- is a reconciliation narrative dear to the new New South creed of prosperity. A second-generation office-supply magnate, Allen broke with his Piedmont Driving Club peerage and stooped to politics. In 1961, he ran for mayor on a Realpolitik platform of racial moderation, beating Maddox to succeed the legendary William Hartsfield, who had put the money in harmony by fashioning Atlanta as "the City Too Busy to Hate." Beginning with his elocutionary switch from "nigra" to "knee-grow," Allen promoted integration just enough to enforce business climate mandated by home office of Coca-Cola. 
Atlanta's most famous son, Martin Luther King Jr., had to go across the state line to Birmingham to make his mark fighting segregation. After King's school-age marchers faced off against that city's fire hoses in 1963, President John F. Kennedy asked Allen to appear at hearings on his civil rights bill to abolish legalized racism. Withstanding a tongue-lashing from the segregationist -- at least publicly -- Senator Strom Thurmond (who died a week before Allen), the mayor of Atlanta became the first white elected official in the Deep South to testify against segregation, calling it "the stepchild of slavery." That trip to Washington clinched Allen's conversion from an opportunistic integrationist to a sincere one.
At the Piedmont Driving Club, no less, Allen hectored Atlanta's nabobs into bankrolling a biracial dinner to celebrate King's Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 and predicted witheringly that they would be "out of town or sick" on the appointed night. "Don't let it worry you, though," he told them. "The mayor will be there." By the time Allen escorted Coretta Scott King to the Atlanta airport to catch a plane to Memphis on the evening of April 4, 1968, it was the clear that beneath the gray silk suit beat a desegregated heart.
A few days later -- in a scene recounted in Gary Pomerantz's marvelous epic of Atlanta, "Where Peachtree Meets Sweet Auburn" -- Mayor Allen watched out of a window at city hall as Gov. Lester Maddox stood in front of the Capitol trying to hoist up the flag flying at half-staff in deference to the slain King. Allen then joined the marchers behind King's mule-drawn coffin. Among the mourners was another prince of Atlanta royalty, Maynard Jackson Jr.
Jackson was the fussed-over son of a prominent Baptist minister and a teacher with a Ph.D. in French from the University of Toulouse. His maternal grandfather was John Wesley Dobbs, a postal worker whose position as the grand master of Georgia's Negro Masons made him, prophetically, the city's unofficial "black mayor." Though grandiose with destiny (and with sheer heft as well), Jackson was a renegade, professing a contempt for "the vapid, jejune trappings of American middle-classness" somewhat undercut by his alligator boots. When Jackson ran for mayor in 1973, he was considered too pushy by Atlanta's go-along-get-along black leaders, who had also discouraged King from upsetting the racial status quo. 
The 35-year-old lawyer prevailed to become the self-advertised "youngest, fattest, blackest mayor in America." Jackson aggressively challenged white financial privilege, redistributing the wealth through that shrine to Atlanta's New South supremacy, the Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. The muscular affirmative action program he enacted to award contracts for the facility's $400 million expansion became a model nationwide. In 1982, the Peachtree mandarins failed to extend the departing mayor a partnership in one of the silk-stocking law offices. Jackson bided his time with a Chicago firm and reclaimed City Hall in 1990. Then he pushed Dixie's city on a hill to its highest mountaintop yet. Atlanta was selected the host of the 1996 Olympics.
Even from such heights, the New South is forever drawn back to old battles. When Lester Maddox died in June, Georgia's governor, Sonny Perdue -- elected on a pledge to rehabilitate the Confederate flag -- kept official flags lowered for three days. A racial skirmish ensued over the slighting of Jackson with only one half-staff day, and a black campaign to rename the airport after Jackson met white resistance. In the true Atlanta spirit, harmony was restored through the compromise "Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport," yet another nifty civic trick of integration and redemption.

A Year's Debacles, From Comic to Epic

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
AFTER three stormy years, the sun finally came out on Wall Street this year. But while investors savored rising stock prices, scandal continued to cast a long shadow over corporate America.
 Reports of corporate chicanery have come all too regularly since the discovery of arcane and esoteric accounting schemes at Enron more than two years ago. But this year, the misdeeds went distressingly mainstream, with revelations that some mutual fund managers were not satisfied with their enormous advisory fees and chose to pick their investors' pockets -- a breathtaking betrayal. 
 The top dramas of the year were mostly depressing, but occasional comic relief came from L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chairman of Tyco International, whose trial began in September on charges that he had looted the company. A highlight was the videotape of the birthday party that Mr. Kozlowski had in Sardinia for his wife; the event proved that no matter the price tag, tacky is tacky. 
 But Mr. Kozlowski was not the only star of 2003. Others who played prize-winning roles during the year should not be forgotten.
 And so it is time, again, to grant the Augustus Melmotte Memorial Prizes, named for the schemer at the heart of Anthony Trollope's brilliant Victorian novel, "The Way We Live Now." Mr. Melmotte, a financier who reached the heights of London society by standing on his wallet, crashed when he was discovered to be a swindler. 
 Following are this year's prizes and their winners:

THE DIOGENES AWARD -- To Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, who searches high and low for an honest man in the financial world, but finds so many of the other persuasion. Last year, he prosecuted Wall Street for duplicitous research; this year, he identified a mountain of mutual fund malfeasance. Detractors like to say that Mr. Spitzer is hunting down financial scoundrels only because the headlines will help him become governor of New York. But that begs a question: If this man can come up with blockbuster cases while he is holding down one big job and running for another, what are the other regulators' excuses for inaction?

THE PRIDE GOETH BEFORE A FALL AWARD -- To Matthew P. Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute, and Paul G. Haaga Jr., its chairman, who throughout the bear market had been congratulating the mutual fund industry they represent for being free of the scandals that tainted Wall Street. Of course, neither man has been implicated in the fund debacle. But just three months before the fund scandal erupted, Mr. Haaga said in a speech to the group's members: "Trust is the reason why our relationship with investors has not been broken by the bear market of the past three years. Our shareholders trust that their mutual funds are being managed with their best interests in mind." Whoops!

THE WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT? AWARD -- To Ralph Nader, for calling on the Federal Bureau of Investigation to include corporate crime statistics in its annual crime report.
 "Because the F.B.I. does not collect data on corporate crime," Mr. Nader wrote in a letter to John Ashcroft, the attorney general, last November, "both the American public and the law enforcement community lack good information on what has become a pressing national problem -- a corporate crime wave." Mr. Nader is right. Investors need a scorecard.

THE MEA CULPA IS ME AWARD -- To Philip J. Purcell, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, who had to apologize twice last year for his own or his firm's actions.
 The first apology came on May Day, when Mr. Purcell advised William H. Donaldson, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, that he had deep regret for public comments he made that played down Morgan Stanley's conduct in the Wall Street research scandal. The second was in November, as the firm settled a regulatory case in which its brokers had been promoting certain mutual funds over others to generate higher commissions but had failed to advise their clients of the extra fees. In a statement, Mr. Purcell said, "I regret that some of our sales and disclosure practices have been found inadequate." 
 Taking some pain out of his contrition was a handsome bit of remuneration Mr. Purcell received at the end of November. The firm awarded him restricted stock valued at $4.1 million, or 35 percent more than the restricted stock he received last year.

THE WILL THEY EVER GET IT? AWARD -- To Mr. Purcell's Morgan Stanley, which was fined $10,000 a day by an NASD arbitration panel for refusing to produce documents in a suit filed against it by an investor who bought its mutual funds. Because the arbitration is not yet final, it is unclear how much Morgan Stanley ultimately paid. And $10,000 a day is not even a rounding error to a firm of that size. But congratulations to the NASD panel for standing up to the stonewall.

THE BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR AWARD -- To Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. As its spokesman, Mr. Grasso did a superlative job promoting it as something as American as Mom and apple pie. But when his $140 million in pay came to light, a compensation package he had angled for, Mr. Grasso lost the thing he loved best: his job as casino greeter.

THE THAT'S MY STORY AND I'M STICKING TO IT AWARD -- To Silicon Valley executives who even now refuse to recognize that stock options are an employee cost and should be accounted for as such on company financial statements. New rules from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, requiring options to be deducted from a company's income, will go into effect in 2005, but technology types are still agitating against them.
 John F. Gifford, the chairman of Maxim Integrated Products, a maker of integrated circuits, spoke for the California contingent when he said last April: "The potential damaging long-term effect on our nation's economy and our lifestyle that would result from the forced expensing of stock options should be taken seriously." Who knew that high-tech executives' lifestyles had become a public policy issue?

THE BEST SECOND ACT AWARD -- To Henry Blodget, the former Internet analyst at Merrill Lynch who left Wall Street in 2001 and recently resurfaced as a reporter for Slate, covering the Martha Stewart trial. His debut was a brilliant piece, full of self-deprecation and sympathy for the embattled Ms. Stewart.

MOST TONE-DEAF EXECUTIVE AWARD -- To Donald J. Carty, the former chairman of AMR, parent of American Airlines. Last April, as American was negotiating significant wage and benefit concessions with its employees to keep it out of bankruptcy court, the company disclosed that it had recently given top executives lucrative retention bonuses and set aside $41 million to protect the pensions of 45 executives, including Mr. Carty, if the company filed for bankruptcy. Truly a let-them-eat-cake moment in corporate history.

HEADLINE: Mexico Adrift 

 BODY:
Ten years after entering into a North American Free Trade Agreement, and three years after putting an end to the asphyxiating seven-decade reign of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Mexico has yet to fully capitalize on these auspicious developments. The government's failure to deliver on high public expectations could unleash a reaction that would jeopardize the country's political and economic modernization.
 President Vicente Fox, at the midpoint of his six-year term, already looks like a lame duck. It would be hard to overstate the personal popularity and moral authority that Mr. Fox had upon assuming office. But he has failed to turn that into a governing mandate. That's partly because his party does not control a majority in the Congress, where the PRI retains the largest voting bloc. 
 Mr. Fox's administration has also suffered from self-inflicted wounds. Its clumsy approach to negotiating with Congress, the constant infighting within his cabinet, and even his wife's political activism have strengthened opponents who argue that there is more to be gained from obstructing Mr. Fox than there is in working with him.
The PRI, suffering from an identity crisis, is split between a faction that wants to work with Mr. Fox and a more traditionalist one. Many PRI lawmakers joined with the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party last weekend to once again deny Mr. Fox a long-overdue package of fiscal reforms. 
Mexico's tax receipts amount to the equivalent of only 12 percent of its gross domestic product -- a dangerously low amount by any standard -- and President Fox had been trying to overhaul the tax code to add to public resources. 
America's economic slowdown and the Bush administration's cold shoulder on immigration reform have added to Mr. Fox's woes. What makes his predicament tragic is that the country is in dire need of what he is peddling. The lack of government spending on education amounts to a costly failure to invest in the nation's human capital at a time when the country's competitiveness is eroding. This year, China is expected to surpass Mexico as the second-largest exporter to the United States. 
Nafta has been a boon for Mexico, though the benefits derived from access to the American market would be far greater if the country invested more in its people, strengthened its public institutions (the courts, for starters) and upgraded its transportation and energy sectors. 
The inefficient state-owned oil and electric industries -- public piggy banks in the absence of sufficient tax revenues -- are in desperate need of private investment, which President Fox would like to allow, but so-called dinosaurs within the PRI and the PRD opposition persist in mustering tired populist rhetoric to preserve the status quo. 
The real danger, if Mr. Fox doesn't find a way soon to break the current impasse, is that the opposition's message from the past will become a road map to the future.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: HOUSING; 
Below Market. River View. Many Rooms. Expected Term of Occupancy: Day-to-Day

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 27 

 BODY:
Below market is not an adequate phrase to describe this deluxe apartment on the east bank of the Tigris River. 
 Outfitted for a senior official in the government of Saddam Hussein, it has a river view with a balcony, floor-to-ceiling windows and a spiral staircase. 
 The rent is exactly zero dinars a month. 
At least that is what Sajeda Hassen Ali and her family pay. They began squatting here in May after the American-led forces ousted Mr. Hussein. The building's former residents, all government officials, had fled for their lives and a free-for-all had ensued for the plush quarters. 
Ms. Ali's son and her nephew stumbled across this place, and everything soon worked out for the impoverished family, or so they thought. The question is whether it will continue. 
Ms. Ali and her husband listen every day for an ominous knock on the door, for someone from the ruling authorities to walk up and tell them that the family has to move out because the government wants the building back. 
"Maybe they will take it and give it to government workers again," she said as she sat on the floor of her living room, patting small meat pastries called koba. She stared down at her 4-day-old daughter in a basket and added: "But I pray to God not to kick us out, not to leave us on the street. We have no place to go." 
Ms. Ali and the 1,800 or so squatters in this corner of Baghdad are living in a purgatory of their own making. Though they occupy what they consider permanent homes along a row of 23 apartment buildings on the Tigris near downtown Baghdad, many are worried that officials from the new government or the military will come knocking at their doors and evict them. 
Their fears seem justified: American military officials say that although they have allowed squatters to remain in public buildings throughout the city, the Iraqi transitional government that will take power on July 1 will almost certainly want the buildings back for their own use, or at least will want to charge rent. 
The population of Baghdad has boomed since the Americans took control in Iraq, with many rural migrants coming to seek jobs, causing a housing shortage, military officials said. 
Because the nationwide jobless rate is about 25 percent, many families cannot afford to pay rent. But what allows the squatters to move in is that most of the real estate in Baghdad was owned by Mr. Hussein's government, rather than by private companies or individuals. The old government is not around to protect the properties, and the new government is not in a position to take action. 
"The Iraqi government and the coalition forces are only establishing control of buildings that we have the ability to control," said Col. Paul L. Aswell, who oversees matters concerning Iraqi public property. "We can't kick out people just because they're not supposed to be there. Where am I going to put thousands of displaced people? You can't just throw them out on the streets." 
But the transitional government will probably try to sell much of the city's public property, since there is no need to hold on to it, Colonel Aswell said. It is likely that officials will assign private management companies those buildings it does not sell, or the officials may use them for work space or employee housing. 
How the transitional government will deal with the problem of squatters becoming homeless families is a daunting challenge. "It's an insurmountable problem," Colonel Aswell said. "There just isn't any place in Baghdad to send hundreds of families." 
No one has done a count, but Colonel Aswell said every inhabitable building that was empty after the invasion probably has squatters in it. The largest centers have well over a thousand people. The 23 buildings on the west bank of the Tigris, constructed with yellow clay bricks, make up one of those areas. 
Collectively called the Abi Nuwas project, named for the riverside street on which the three-story buildings sit, they were built in the 1980's to be one of the most progressive housing works in the country. 
A British company with Iraqi architects designed it for upper-middle-class residents and planned for the buildings to use solar energy, said Ghada Razzouqi al-Siliq, an assistant professor of architecture at Baghdad University. Mr. Hussein eventually rented the apartments for a nominal fee to the top administrators in his government. 
The buildings were looted after April 9, with windows broken and furniture stolen. Squatters rushed in and did what they could to renovate the housing. Professor Siliq said they felt they had a right to be there, to take their share of the country's wealth after being economically deprived for so long. 
Nada Khalif, 28, lives with her family next door to Ms. Ali. "When we moved in here," she said, "we saw how unfair the system was. The people living in this house, they were not educated, they did nothing for the country. They were just Baathists. But we're educated, we have degrees and we can help our country. We deserve to live in this apartment." 
Ms. Khalif was serving sweet tea to a visitor in her family's living room. The family had decorated the room with large potted plants, a plush green rug and Russian nesting dolls arranged on a wooden shelf beneath a TV and a VCR. The homey quality was typical of many of the eight units in this building. 
Soldiers have sprayed numbers on the front wall of every building. Ms. Ali and Ms. Khalif live in No. 31. Graffiti on the outer wall reads, "This building is inhabited," to deter other squatters or looters. At the rear, dozens of children play soccer in a small lot. 
Safi Abbas Khalif, Nada's father, said he had found this building after wandering around Baghdad for more than a week last May looking for a place to live. He had taken to the streets because the landlord of his old house was raising the rent $25, he said, and his only employed son, an army conscript, was killed by the American-led invasion forces. Mr. Khalif said he could not work because he was undergoing a series of operations for a brain illness. 
The original residents of the apartment, Iraqis loyal to Mr. Hussein, returned after three months in hiding, but let the 13 members of Mr. Khalif's family keep the apartment because they sympathized with the family's plight, Mr. Khalif said. 
"We hope the new government will be more merciful than Saddam's regime," Zaineb Khalif, the eldest daughter, said. "We have no place to go if we're kicked out. I have no land, no houses, nothing. I just have God." 
The Khalif family and the rest of the building's squatters are Shiite Muslims, generally much poorer than Sunni Arabs. The Sunnis were favored first by British colonialists in the early 20th century, then by Mr. Hussein, himself a Sunni from the north. Mr. Hussein's government persecuted the Shiites and Kurds, often torturing and killing large groups of them. 
One family with a Sunni father does live in the building and has done so for 12 years. They are from Tikrit, Mr. Hussein's hometown, and fled there during the invasion of Baghdad. They returned in May. 
Just as the American military has no policy for addressing the squatter issue, it also does not have a way of dealing with Baathist officials still living in residences given to them as gifts. Some of those quarters were forcibly taken from owners, who could try to get them back. "It'll be a very difficult property reconciliation process," Colonel Aswell said. 
In this building, most of the squatters shun the family from Tikrit. They warned a reporter not to approach the apartment. The mother of the household, Fatim Khadim, opened the door on the reporter's third try to see the family. 
She invited the visitor in. Over tea, this woman, who cried in despair the day Mr. Hussein was captured, talked about how the squatters had stolen the surrounding apartments. They deserve to be evicted, she said. 
"People betrayed each other," she said. "People didn't stand up for each other. They stole each other's things."

HEADLINE: Hard Times In Star Part Of the State Economy 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER

 BODY:
MERCK & COMPANY has long been the crown jewel of New Jersey's rich pharmaceutical industry. The company was the first to commercialize penicillin in the 1940's. In 1987, it introduced the breakthrough cholesterol drug Mevacor. A pioneer in H.I.V.-AIDS treatments, the company is workingon a promising vaccine to stop the killer that is ravaging Africa.
 Yet despite its proud past, Merck, the world's third-largest drug company, which has its headquarters in Whitehouse Station, now faces its own ills. 
 Merck's top-selling drug, Zocor, for cholesterol, is about to lose patent protection, which could wipe out a huge chunk of the $5.6 billion in sales that the medicine brings in, about a quarter of the company's total revenue. 
 At the same time, Merck has failed to come up with blockbuster new drugs to replace the revenue from Zocor, and has canceled two drugs for depression and diabetes that were in late-stage development. 
 In addition, the company's stock is in a slump and Merck is laying off 4,400 workers, or 7 percent of its global workforce, to save $250 million to $300 million a year.
 Merck is not the only New Jersey drug maker facing significant erosion to previously healthy sales growth. In addition, drug companies are battling image problems as political debate simmers over the cost of prescription drugs.
 "The pharmaceutical industry is running into more challenges now than at any time in my 30 years in the industry," said Fred Hassan, chief executive of Schering-Plough. 
 Schering-Plough, which is based in Kenilworth, is cutting employment costs by 10 percent through a combination of layoffs and an early-retirement package.
 Another giant in the pharmaceutical industry, Johnson & Johnson, recently laid off nearly 500 employees at a plant in North Brunswick and will shed more jobs by combining administrative work at subsidiaries in New Jersey.
 The retrenchment is all the more difficult because it comes after four years, from 1999 through 2002, when pharmaceutical employment in the state rose 17 percent. In 2003, for the first time in more than a decade, pharmaceutical employment in New Jersey appears to have remained flat at just over 69,000 people, according to the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey, a statewide industry trade group. 
 Besides internal problems like the dearth of new products to replace high-profit blockbusters, the drug industry finds itself in an unhappily prominent spot in political debates. Both members of Congress and candidates for president have seized on the issue of drug costs. 
 "Especially in the last two election cycles it has gotten caught in the cross-fire of politicians as a way to make themselves more visible," Mr. Hassan said. "It's a very negative climate."
 The health of the drug industry is vital to New Jersey, where it is the single largest manufacturing business. About $30 billion in pharmaceuticals were made here in 1997, the most recent census data available, for about a third of the state total of all manufactured goods.
 The industry contributes $22.7 billion to the state economy, including $6.8 billion in salaries, as well as charitable contributions of $45 million. The average salary in the industry was $80,439 in 2002, according to the HealthCare Institute.
 Drug companies based in New Jersey account for more than 40 percent of the industry's total global sales of $400 billion. World headquarters for nine major pharmaceutical companies are in New Jersey, and 11 others have based their North American operations in the state.
 "The decisions that manage the industry throughout the entire world are made here," said William Healey, executive vice president of the HealthCare Institute.

Still, a Lucrative Industry
 To be sure, the pharmaceutical industry is a long way from the critical list. It is among the world's most lucrative businesses, with a profit margin of 18.5 percent, according to FamiliesUSA, a patient advocacy group.
 Growth in sales, however, is slowing. The rate was 7 percent for the 12 months ended in September 2003, compared with 8 percent growth in 2002 and 12 percent in 2001, according to IMS Health, which tracks drug sales.
 In part, that is because patents are expiring on a number of big-selling products. When a drug loses patent protection it becomes open to generic competition, which typically drives the price of a product down by as much as 80 percent.
 "Patent expirations are having a greater impact than in years past because there is a trend to move to generics very quickly and aggressively, which is fueled by the overall managed-care juggernaut," said John Colaizzi, dean of the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy at Rutgers University. The 111-year-old school of pharmacy offers degree programs in medicinal chemistry, pharmaceutical science, pharmacology and toxicology.
 In addition, despite hopes within the drug industry that breakthroughs in gene research would result in an explosion of new therapies, few new drugs are in the pipeline. In 1996, federal regulators approved 53 new drugs, but in 2002 the number of approvals dropped to 17. In part, that is because some diseases are proving to be difficult to crack.
 "Some of the breakthroughs we've had in the past were taking advantage of what might be called low-hanging fruit," Mr. Colaizzi said. "Cancer is not a simple thing, like finding an antibiotic. We're making progress, but it's slow and extremely costly."
 In addition to internal problems, the industry faces pressure from consumers, insurers and politicians for its pricing policies.
 For years, the industry had fought against a Medicare drug benefit, fearing that it would result in price controls by giving the federal government massive buying power. But Raymond Gilmartin, the chief executive of Merck, said the industry was satisfied with provisions of the law that was signed by President Bush on Dec. 8.
 "Medicare will provide benefits based on choice and competition modeled after the private market, which is very supportive of pharmaceutical innovation and does not include price controls," Mr. Gilmartin said.

Part of the Political Debate
 Even with Medicare legislation completed, the industry is expected to remain a focus of electoral campaigns while more than 40 million Americans have no insurance coverage. 
"Issues around health care in general," Mr. Gilmartin said, "and the fact that we're still faced with the uninsured is likely to be part of the political debate."
 Another flashpoint is the issue of re-importation of drugs from Canada and other countries where they are cheaper largely because those nations have national healthcare programs that buy drugs in bulk at lower prices than they are sold for in the United States.
 "People look at the price in Canada and say, 'Why can't we have that too?"' Mr. Colaizzi of Rutgers said.
 "If that continues to grow in momentum," he said, "it's going to affect the economics of these pharmaceutical companies. Either they will have to raise prices in Canada or lower them in the United States. It seems to me one of those outcomes is going to have to happen at some point."
 Merck is an acute example of the problems confronting the entire industry.
 The company's biggest seller, Zocor, is expected to lose patent protection in 2006, and there is little to replace it in the near future. Since February Merck has scrapped four highly anticipated drugs because of concern that they would not win regulatory approval, even though they had made it into mid- to late-stage development.
 Merck is being punished, in part, for taking the high road, said Hemant Shah, an independent industry analyst at HKS & Company in Warren.
 He said that Merck had largely resisted a strategy embraced by other companies in which they slightly modify a rival company's breakthrough treatment and then market this so-called me-too drug.
 "Merck is a company that has never depended on gimmicks," Mr. Shah said.
 Mr. Gilmartin said that the ability to make easy profits on me-too drugs was eroding as health insurers, including managed-care companies, refuse to pay for drugs that do not add a significant benefit for patients.
 "The value of a true advance, a novel mechanism that really represents a different health outcome for the patient, has even greater value now and going forward than in the early 90's," he said.
 Merck has also resisted the industry trend toward mergers.
 Pfizer Inc. has grown to become the world's largest drug company, with sales of $32 billion in 2002, largely through acquisitions. Two of its largest purchases were Pharmacia and Warner Lambert, which both had extensive operations in New Jersey.
 "The consolidation in the industry is inevitable and Merck will almost certainly be a part of it," Mr. Shah said. "In the future you will see fewer companies in New Jersey than there are now."
 Mergers allow companies to increase profits by combining operations and cutting redundant employees and costs. A merger may also add promising drugs to an otherwise empty pipeline.
 Mr. Gilmartin said many of the mega-mergers had not been successful. He says Merck will remain independent.
 "Mergers create, at best, a short-term boost in your profits but at an expensive long-term cost that's not an appropriate," he said.
 Merck is, however, adopting one strategy that has been widespread in the industry. The company is speeding up the pace of alliances with other drug companies and smaller biotechnology companies to beef up its pipeline. 
 In 1999 the company had only 10 of these cooperative ventures. This year, Merck completed 40 deals and is actively reviewing 80 more.
 Mr. Gilmartin said the company was changing its strategy because the biotech industry had evolved and now provides new drug discovery tools to help Merck in its own development work.
 "There are more and more opportunities for external alliances," he said.
 In addition to large pharmaceutical companies, New Jersey is home to 120 biotechnology companies with revenue of $1 billion, up 53 percent since 2000, according to the Biotechnology Council of New Jersey. These companies employ nearly 8,000 workers in the state and are expected to hire, on average, 10 employees each in 2004, the council says.
 Merck's most visible alliance is reflected in its plan to sell a new cholesterol therapy combining Zocor with Zetia, from Schering-Plough. The two companies applied for F.D.A. approval of Zocor-Zetia in November and expect it to be on the market in late 2004 or early 2005.

Troubles at Schering-Plough
 Schering-Plough has suffered after the 2002 loss of patent protection on its $3 billion blockbuster, Claritin, the allergy medicine, which accounted for a third of the company's sales. 
 The company is also in a battle with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that it used anti-competitive practices to block generic versions of its K-Dur potassium-chloride supplement.
 Earlier this month, Schering-Plough announced an early retirement package and said that it would also lay off an unspecified number of employees to reduce costs by $200 million, or 10 percent. Of Schering-Plough's 12,000 employees, 7,200 are based in New Jersey.
 Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, has been trimming back, too. It plans to combine finance, human resources and information management to cut costs at some of its five pharmaceutical subsidiaries, which employ a total of 10,000 people worldwide.
 Four of the subsidiaries are based in New Jersey. Johnson & Johnson has not said how many jobs will be eliminated but has called the cuts "modest."
 The company's Ortho-McNeil subsidiary disclosed on Dec. 12 that it had received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office in Boston, requesting information about the marketing of Topamax, an epilepsy medication. 
 Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has 8,500 employees at various plants in New Jersey, has had its own set of problems, including patent expirations and the failure of a promising new drug, along with a $1 billion accounting scandal and a troubled relationship with the biotechnology company that has been at the root of Martha Stewart's problems on Wall Street.
 And in July, Bristol-Myers Squibb set aside $600 million to settle claims by state attorneys general that the company had illegally blocked generic competition to its drugs Taxol, for cancer, and BuSpar, for anxiety.
But Mr. Shah says Bristol-Myers Squibb is beginning to pull out of a very rough period, and, in fact, he said, "In my opinion Bristol Myers probably has the strongest position." 
 The company is hopeful that the Food and Drug Administration will soon approve the cancer drug Erbitux for sale based on new data submitted by Bristol-Myers. The F.D.A. had rejected clinical trial data submitted by Bristol-Myers's partner in developing that drug, ImClone Systems Inc. ImClone's founder, Samuel D. Waksal, is serving a seven-year prison term after pleading guilty to securities fraud and other charges in connection with insider trading of ImClone stock at the time of the F.D.A. decision. 
 Many other drug makers, including Aventis, Wyeth and Roche, have kept employment stable or announced slight cuts. 
 In fact, Roche is building a $155 million diagnostics manufacturing plant in Somerset County that will consolidate 440 jobs at different locations around the state and employ a total of 800 when it is finished.
 The state recently missed out on two pharmaceutical projects.
 Merck decided to build a $300 million vaccine plant in North Carolina, without seeking proposals from its home state. 
 "Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to work with them," said Juliet Johnson, a spokeswoman for Governor McGreevey. She also said that the state had recently revised its business incentive programs to generate more pharmaceutical and high-technology jobs.
 New Jersey also lost out in a recent decision by the Swiss drug maker Novartis, which has its United States base in East Hanover. The company chose to retrofit a former candy factory in Cambridge, Mass., as a laboratory for cutting-edge research rather than build a suburban campus in New Jersey.
 "We wanted our scientists to be within the campus of Harvard and M.I.T.," said Paul Herrling, head of global research at Novartis.
 "If you live in a science culture," Mr. Herrling said, "the closer the people are -- to have coffee and go to the cinema and stay out at night -- the more efficient is the interaction, the creativity, and the transfer of knowledge."
 Despite the current downturn, the drug industry is expected to rise again.
 "Inthe long term, this is still a very good industry," Mr. Hassan, the Schering-Plough executive, said. "I still see this as a sunrise industry."
 Pharmaceutical employment in the state is expected to grow to 80,000 by the end of the decade, said Mr. Healey of the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey.

Optimism at Merck
 Mr. Gilmartin said Merck had cycled through tough times before, most recently in the early 1990's. The company followed that up with a string of hits, including Zocor, in the mid- to-late 1990's before its recent slide. 
 Mr. Gilmartin said Merck would begin growing again next year. He also said that the company was about to submit applications for regulatory approval of a pain medicine, Arcoxia, and three new vaccines, including one that could block a virus linked to cervical cancer.
 Analysts are optimistic, too.
 "We will see another wave of consolidation that will give the industry four to five or six years of breathing room," Mr. Shah said. "They're just beginning to understand these complex diseases and fine-tune their efforts. It's going to take another five to 10 years before this massive effort will be realized with new breakthrough products."

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
In Pakistan, a Leader Has More Enemies and Fewer Friends

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ANYONE taking time to ponder the fate of the predecessors of President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan over the last three decades would not find the facts very reassuring. One was hanged, another died in a suspicious plane crash, and two were ousted from power and remain in exile.
 Now, after four years of ruling Pakistan with a wily determination, General Musharraf has earned himself a long list of enemies, any one of whom might wish him dead. They include generals he has sidelined, myriad opposition parties, a range of organized criminal gangs dealing in arms and drugs, the country's jihad-obsessed religious factions and, of course, India, with which Pakistan has fought three wars. 
 When two suicide bombers plowed their vehicles into General Musharraf's motorcade on Christmas Day, making the second unsuccessful attempt on his life in less than two weeks, suspicions immediately focused on Al Qaeda and its allies. American officials shared that assessment, though they noted that in Pakistan very little intelligence is dependable.
 "It's never easy to follow the situation in Pakistan, because reality keeps shifting," said an administration official with long experience in studying the region. "You can never be sure about the reliability of your information."
 A violent change in power in Pakistan is especially frightening to American policy makers and others who fear that the country's nuclear weapons could get into the hands of those waging war against the West. Experts often declare Pakistan one of the most dangerous places in the world and also one of the most difficult places in which to figure out who America's friends are.
 General Musharraf, for example, is accused by Islamic militants in Pakistan of cracking down too hard on Al Qaeda, but is suspected in Washington of looking the other way while Osama bin Laden roams freely along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Both perceptions are rooted in reality.
 American officials say they are impressed that in recent years, for example, the general has spent money on roads and other benefits in the mountainous tribal areas of that part of Pakistan, seeking to curry favor with the Pashtuns who have always rebelled against central rule. It is there that Pakistan has said it is determined to help the United States find Mr. bin Laden. But no American official is entirely convinced that President Musharraf is trying as hard as he might.
 "The image we get in Washington is that there are a lot of negotiations going on," an American official said. "It's certainly not force majeure."
 Administration officials say they take at face value General Musharraf's promise not to transmit nuclear weapons information or materials to other countries, especially Iran and North Korea. Last week, Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage said the general had pledged not to make such transfers "and I believe him."
 The United States is pushing Pakistan to move back toward democracy, but its appeals are tempered by the knowledge that the few elections held in recent years have shown the growing strength of religious parties that revile American influence in their country. The elected local governments of the Northwest Frontier province are among the most militant.
 The day before he survived his latest assassination attempt, General Musharraf made a deal with several hard-line Islamist opposition parties to step down as army chief while remaining the nation's president. In return, the parties agreed to constitutional changes he had been seeking that would solidify the power of the presidency and the armed forces in political life.
 All the feuding among factions in Pakistan, and the rampant trafficking in arms, drugs and smuggled goods, have persuaded American policy makers over the years to put their faith in the military. The country has been under its rule for most of the time since independence in 1947, and the military is today the most powerful force in society.
 Blunt force, once again, only partly explains the role of military influence. The army's tentacles extend throughout the economy. The army or groups alliedwith it own many enterprises, and many retired military officers can expect to serve as heads of private businesses. Along with ruthlessness and intimidation, the army brings discipline, consistency and sophistication to many parts of Pakistani life.
 But history also shows that military rule sows the seeds of its own downfall. The last general to rule Pakistan, Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, died in 1988 at the height of his power, in a plane crash that has never been explained. His death ushered in a cycle of democracy, coupled with instability and corruption, that culminated in General Musharraf's coup of 1999.
 If the past is a guide, General Musharraf faces future instability, with the Americans hoping he can cling to power long enough to keep protecting American interests.

HEADLINE: Dismay in Waterbury Over Governor's Problems 

BYLINE:  By AVI SALZMAN

 BODY:
WATERBURY residents have watched local boy John G. Rowland make headlines since he got out of college and rose from the State Legislature to the United States Congress. When he became governor in 1994, he didn't forget his hometown, helping send millions of dollars to the city in state grants.
 But news about Mr. Rowland these days is almost all sour, and while some are sympathetic to his plight, many people in this city are tired of the words "I'm sorry" from their leaders. After a decade of corruption investigations and a child molestation scandal from their last mayor, those words are starting to ring a little hollow. 
 "It must be something about Waterbury," said Donna Yorker as she walked to a bus stop this month. "Child molesters and thieves." 
Across the street, Robert Thompson, also waiting for a bus, vented his frustration.
"It'll all come out. They all do things and then try to move on and take the focus off of them," he said, referring to politicians in the state. "It's about doing the right thing. That's what's important."
It's hard to blame them for being jaded. Three consecutive Waterbury mayors have been indicted for various acts of corruption, the most recent of which was arguably the worst. Philip A. Giordano is serving 37 years in prison for sexually abusing two children.
So forgive Waterbury residents. They've heard their share of half-hearted apologies, half-truths and outright lies. And with unemployment here at almost 8 percent as of November and the poverty rate at 16 percent as of 2000, Mr. Rowland's false statements about gifts he received for his vacation cottage, including a hot tub, aren't getting a good reception.
"He's using state contractors to do the work," said Blerim Zhuta, who owns a hair salon in a strip mall on Wolcott Street. "If you're going to do something, pay for it out of your own pocket. A lot of people can't afford to live on a lake."
Eric Gibson, a state corrections officer who was at the shop for a haircut, said he thought he could be seeing more of Mr. Rowland soon at his place of employment.
"If he's on the track he's on, he'll need to see one of us sooner or later," Mr. Gibson said. "People in public positions, we look up to them. They're actually playing directly into the stereotype of a politician."
Even at the governor's high school, students viewed their vaunted alumnus with a certain disdain. Two of the three previous mayors to face indictment, the only two to serve prison time, went to Holy Cross High School, where Mr. Rowland graduated almost 30 years ago.
"Every political figure that goes to Holy Cross, something happens to them," said Chris Readel, 16. "It's just funny." He said the misdeeds of public officials who went to Holy Cross have become a running joke among students at the school.
When he went to Holy Cross, Mr. Rowland was the captain of the wrestling team and the president of the senior class. His family, which has a long and rich history in the city, lived about four miles away in the Overlook neighborhood. Mr. Rowland's grandfather, Sherwood L. Rowland, gained renown for fighting municipal corruption in Waterbury after he became the city controller in 1937. Mr. Rowland's father, Sherwood, also served as city controller.
But Mr. Rowland's father has since passed away, and his mother, Cerie, moved out of the city this year, selling the house on Randolph Street to an Orthodox Jewish family. The only remnant of the family's belongings still in the two-story yellow home is the wallpaper in the upstairs bathroom, which pays homage to America's founding fathers, the Declaration of Independence and Betsy Ross. The neighborhood has indeed changed since Mr. Rowland was a boy, as a new yeshiva has brought a number of Orthodox families to Randolph Street.
One of the few families left from Mr. Rowland's childhood are the Cotters of Euclid Avenue. In a recent telephone interview, Mary Cotter said she remembered watching Mr. Rowland, whom she has known since he was 5 years old, cut lawns as a child. He was always ambitious and hardworking, she said. She was upset about the governor's current situation and thinks he's getting a bad rap.
"I just feel that any normal individual, if a friend offers to give them something, they thank them and move on," she said. "I don't think John had any evil intentions. He just made a mistake. Everyone's entitled to a mistake."
After graduating from high school, Mr. Rowland went on to Villanova University. In 1980, Mr. Rowland won his first political seat in Connecticut, representing Waterbury in the state House. In 1984, Mr. Rowland was elected to Congress, where he served three terms.
His first run for the governorship, in 1990, ended in failure. But, four years later, Mr. Rowland won his first of three terms. If he finishes out his third term, he will be the longest-serving Connecticut governor since colonial times.
And even though Waterbury has almost three times as many registered Democrats as Republicans, he received more than 60 percent of the city's votes in the last election.
While Waterbury long thrived because of its brass business, the city declined in the 1960's and 70's. Previous governors virtually forgot about the struggling city, said the current mayor, Michael J. Jarjura, but Mr. Rowland has paid special attention to his hometown.
"In Waterbury there's a particular sense that for many years other governors passed over the city," Mr. Jarjura said. "Since we got a governor from our city it's been more fair," 
Mr. Rowland has helped steer about $153 million in Urban Act money to the city, Mr. Jarjura said. Waterbury built a new courthouse about two years ago and was chosen as the site for a brand-new University of Connecticut branch, which opened this year. A new middle and high school devoted to the arts is scheduled to open next fall. It will connect to the Palace Theater, which was built in 1920 and is undergoing a $30 million renovation.
State investment has also led to more private investment in the city, Mr. Jarjura added.
Since Mr. Jarjura took office to replace Mr. Giordano in 2001, he has helped write new ethics guidelines and restore the city's ethics commission, as well as revamping its purchasing and procurement laws. Past administrations had used a competitive bidding process, but then undermined it by spending millions on change orders, he said.
But the misdeeds of the last decade have left residents wary of politicians with big plans, Mr. Jarjura said.
"Given what the people in Waterbury have been through, it's so hard to restore their confidence," Mr. Jarjura said. "They're under the impression that everybody's on the take."
That's not to say the governor doesn't have a strong base of support here. At Gahan's Eating and Drinking Saloon downtown, customers said they were tired of the recent spate of governor-bashing.
"I think there's nothing wrong with accepting a favor from your friends," said John Sullivan, a bartender who has known the governor since he started in politics. "You know the old saying: 'Let he who is without sin cast the first stone."'

HEADLINE: TELEVISION: THE HIGHS; 
The Programs of the Year

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
 1. 'THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART' -- Comedy Central has the best late night talk show -- better than Leno, Letterman or Conan O'Brien. Mr. Stewart, who is acidly funny about everything, describes Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman as the candidate for "people who want to vote for Bush but don't think he is Jewish enough."

2. TED KOPPEL'S WAR COVERAGE -- ABC's graying anchorman was the most authoritative of the embedded correspondents covering the invasion of Iraq. He brought his cameras in as close as any other reporter storming across the desert with United States troops, but never lost his cool detachment.

3. 'THE OFFICE' -- It's the best comedy on television, even if it can be seen only on BBC America, a digital-tier cable station. The deadpan mockumentary about a group of listless employees of a paper company in the dreary English suburb of Slough has no laugh track, slapstick or obvious punch lines, just infectious social satire.

4. 'HOPE AND FAITH' -- This ABC show has the laugh track, slapstick and obvious punch lines that weigh down most network sitcoms, but Kelly Ripa is surprisingly amusing as a narcissistic, unemployed soap opera star forced to move in with her prim, suburban sister (Faith Ford). Together they are a "Laverne and Shirley" for the Botox generation.

5. 'THE PRACTICE' -- ABC's wilting legal drama underwent an extreme makeover: its creator, David E. Kelley, replaced half the cast with James Spader and made the show twice as good.

6. 'THE ELLEN DeGENERES SHOW' -- The former standup comedian and sitcom star turns out to be a charming and unobtrusively witty talk show host. Her show is a refreshing throwback to the days of Merv Griffin and Mike Douglas, when talk show hosts actually made conversation.

7. 'THE O.C.' -- Fox's nighttime soap opera about rich, pampered teenagers in Southern California may not be uplifting or groundbreaking, but it amply fills the teen angst vacuum left by "Beverly Hills, 90210" and "Dawson's Creek."

8. HBO DOCUMENTARIES -- "Born Rich," a look at what it is like to inherit wealth, directed by one who knows -- Jamie Johnson, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune -- was an unusual, sidelong glance at one of the only remaining closed circles in American society. "Terror in Moscow," a documentary about the taking of 700 hostages in a Moscow theater by Chechen rebels, was an astonishingly intimate portrait of terrorism.

9. 'ANGELS IN AMERICA' -- It redefined the term "made-for-television movie." Mike Nichols's six-hour adaptation, for HBO, of Tony Kushner's epic two-part play about AIDS in the 1980's was exhilarating -- artsy television that didn't make viewers antsy.

10. 'QUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GUY' -- Bravo's makeover masterpiece was the best new reality show. In each episode, five seraphic gay stylists transform a lumpish heterosexual with a new haircut, new clothes, new furniture, new recipes and better table manners. They are the real angels in America.

HEADLINE: The White-Collar Blues 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I am surprised at how passive American workers have become.
 A couple of million factory positions have disappeared in the short time since we raised our glasses to toast the incoming century. And now the white-collar jobs are following the blue-collar jobs overseas. 
 Americans are working harder and have become ever more productive -- astonishingly productive -- but are not sharing in the benefits of their increased effort. If you think in terms of wages, benefits and the creation of good jobs, the employment landscape is grim. 
The economy is going great guns, we're told, but nearly nine million Americans are officially unemployed, and the real tally of the jobless is much higher. Even as the Bush administration and the media celebrate the blossoming of statistics that supposedly show how well we're doing, the lines at food banks and soup kitchens are lengthening. They're swollen in many cases by the children of men and women who are working but not making enough to house and feed their families.
I.B.M. has crafted plans to send thousands of upscale jobs from the U.S. to lower-paid workers in China, India and elsewhere. Anyone who doesn't believe this is the wave of the future should listen to comments made last spring by an I.B.M. executivenamed Harry Newman:
"I think probably the biggest impact to employee relations and to the H.R. field is this concept of globalization. It is rapidly accelerating, and it means shifting a lot of jobs, opening a lot of locations in places we had never dreamt of before, going where there's low-cost labor, low-cost competition, shifting jobs offshore."
An executive at Microsoft, the ultimate American success story, told his department heads last year to "Think India," and to "pick something to move offshore today."
These matters should be among the hottest topics of our national conversation. We've already witnessed the carnage in manufacturing jobs. Now, with white-collar jobs at stake, we've got executives at I.B.M. and Microsoft exchanging high-fives at the prospect of getting "two heads for the price of one" in India.
It might be a good idea to throw a brighter spotlight on some of these trends and explore the implications for the long-term economy and the American standard of living.
"If you take this to its logical extreme, the implications for the entire middle-class wage structure in the United States are terrifying," said Thea Lee, an economist with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "Now is the time to start thinking about policy solutions."
But that's exactly what we're not thinking about. Government policy at the moment is focused primarily on what's best for the corporations. From that perspective, job destruction and wage compression are good things -- as long as they don't get too much high-profile attention.
"This is a significant problem, much greater than we believed it was even a year ago," said Marcus Courtney, president of the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, an affiliate of the Communication Workers of America.
Accurate data on the number of jobs already lost are all but impossible to come by. But there is no disputing the direction of the trend, or the fact that it is accelerating. Allowing this movement to continue unchecked will eventually mean economic suicide for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of American families.
Globalization may be a fact of life. But that does not mean that its destructive impact on American families can't be mitigated. The best thing workers can do, including white-collar and professional workers, is to organize. At the same time, the exportation of jobs and the effect that is having on the standard of living here should be relentlessly monitored by the government, the civic sector and the media. The public has a right to know what's really going on.
Trade agreements and tax policies should be examined and updated to encourage the creation of employment that enhances the quality of life here at home. Corporate leaders may not feel an obligation to contribute to the long-term well-being of local communities or the nation as a whole, but that shouldn't be the case with the rest of us.

HEADLINE: Seminole Casino Plan Inspires Hope and Fear 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Fla., Dec. 28 

 BODY:
It was here, on a run-down stretch of State Road 7, that the multibillion-dollar Indian gambling industry had its humble beginnings. Today, the Seminoles' original high-stakes bingo hall still stands, but it seems a relic from the past.
 Just down the road, the tribe sees its future: a Las Vegas-style complex, the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, now under construction. 
 There are big dreams, great expectations. Tribal leaders hope this casino and a complex in Tampa will more than triple annual gambling revenues to around $1 billion when they open early next year. But some members fear that the tribe is overreaching and that its rags-to-riches story might end in ruin. 
The tribe has taken on $410 million in debt to finance the Hard Rock casino project. James Billie, the Seminoles' leader from 1979 to 2001 and the man who built their gambling empire, was ousted after reports of multimillion-dollar spending sprees.
Some Seminoles say the quest for wealth has blinded the tribe's leaders to the needs of its people.
"We have a severe housing shortage, infrastructure that needs to be updated," Gloria Wilson, a tribe member, said, adding that the casino project and its accompanying debt were "too ambitious for our coffers." 
The Hollywood complex, the bigger of the two casinos, will have 130,000 square feet of casino space, a Hard Rock Cafe, a bar with 42 plasma-screen televisions, a spa and a 6,000-seat arena for concerts, among other features. It will also have 300,000 square feet of retail space and restaurants.
James Allen, the Seminoles' chief executive for gambling, said the hotel had tentative commitments for 60,000 room bookings, enough to fill it for four months.
The two Seminole complexes are expected to draw more than 20,000 visitors a day, bring in $700 million in annual revenue and create 6,000 full-time jobs, tribal officials said. "It's going to be a pure economic engine," said Max Osceola, the Hollywood representative on the tribal council.
The tribe sold $410 million in 30-year bonds to build the two complexes, Mr. Allen said. The Hard Rock Cafe's parent company, the Rank Group, bought $25 million of the bonds. The tribe has only a licensing deal to use Hard Rock's name, so the restaurant chain will not manage the complex. Hard Rock officials declined to comment.
"Some of them were upset, saying: '410 million? That's a lot of money,' " Mr. Osceola said of tribe members. "And that is a lot of money. But what do they say? You've got to spend money to make money." 
There is no doubt that gambling money made the Seminole Tribe of Florida rich. Each of its roughly 3,000 members receives $42,000 a year and free health care and college tuition. Tribal leaders say that figure will probably go up after the Hard Rocks open in April.
The empire Mr. Billie started with the bingo hall in 1979 led other tribes to turn to gambling. The Indian gambling industry had $14.5 billion in revenues last year, according to the National Indian Gaming Commission, a federal agency.
But for the Seminoles, wealth has also invited legal troubles and accusations of greed. Mr. Billie and other leaders have admitted that they went on spending binges. Only Mr. Billie was ousted from leadership.
Tribal lawyers have acknowledged that federal officials are still investigating whether Seminole leaders paid millions of dollars in required taxes on gifts. The lawyers denied any wrongdoing by the tribe. Internal Revenue Service officials declined to comment.
Mr. Billie says the current leadership is spending too much on the Hard Rock casinos and ruining his legacy as chief. "When I was there they made close to $3 billion," he said. "None of these guys will be able to achieve that."

Fueled by tourism, manufacturing and money sent home by Dominicans abroad -- many of them in New York -- the economy grew nearly 7 percent a year. Today that economy is in collapse. Protests are common, and at least eight people were killed during a strike in November. Extraordinary as it sounds, the troubles are largely due to a single bank collapse and its aftermath, a meltdown due to cronyism, corruption, lax regulation and secrecy. 
 Until April, Banco Intercontinental, known as Baninter, was the country's second-largest private bank, and its president, Ramon Baez Figueroa, was Santa Claus. Mr. Baez Figueroa gave away millions of dollars to popular causes and politicians. He gave two S.U.V.'s to President Hipolito Mejia. His generosity served to shield the bank from regulators who might have discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars had disappeared. 
 When Baninter collapsed in April, the government -- against the advice of the International Monetary Fund -- guaranteed all deposits, even those held in the Cayman Islands. Three-quarters of the payments went to 80 very wealthy individuals.
The bailout has cost Dominicans $2.2 billion -- two-thirds of the government's budget for the year -- leading to inflation and a sharp devaluation of the peso. Electricity is highly subsidized, even for the rich, and the state is too broke to pay anyone to generate it, so blackouts last for hours. Recently the government bought two private electricity distribution companies. The move was popular, but it has not led to service improvements and cost the treasury the suspiciously large sum of $350 million. The deal led the I.M.F. to suspend a loan in progress.
The Dominican Republic needs to buy electricity and lessen people's suffering and the risk of social violence. But the I.M.F. and other lenders are right to condition larger loans on reforms like better banking supervision, more transparency and reform of the electricity sector to focus subsidies on the poor. The government has reluctantly made some improvements, but its policies and style remain cronyism as usual -- and are worsening as May elections approach. President Mejia, who had pledged not to run again, is doing so, a move so unpopular that his party is in rebellion. Dominicans would be better served if instead he spent his remaining months working to strengthen his country's institutions.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE RETIRED GENERAL; 
With Tour, Clark Focuses on Southern Votes

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 28 

 BODY:
The New Hampshire primary is less than a month away, but Gen. Wesley K. Clark will spend the waning days of 2003 far from the North. Instead, he will barnstorm across eight Southern states, even though most of them do not hold their primary elections until well into March and many Democrats expect their presidential nominee to have been chosen by then.
 The unusual campaign swing is meant to demonstrate what General Clark's campaign says is his strength in a region where Democrats have not fared too well in recent national elections and thus to portray him as the best alternative to another candidate, Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont. 
 The decision to look ahead to the general election in November before a single vote has been cast in the primaries is a calculated risk by the Clark campaign, which has been briskly raising money over the last three months and attracting growing crowds at recent stops in Wisconsin and South Carolina. 
General Clark is trying to show the party that his national security credentials and experience leading a well-integrated institution make him the most qualified candidate to go toe-to-toe with President Bush in the fall. With five Senate seats being vacated by Democrats in the South, General Clark is also trying to demonstrate that for Southern office-seekers, he would be a strong presence at the top of the ticket.
"The message we're trying to send is beyond the specific states we will visit," Paul Johnson, the Clark campaign manager, said in an interview. "In part the plan is to make the statement that General Clark has a broad base of appeal in all 50 states."
The swing, called the True Grits Tour, will begin Monday at General Clark's campaign headquarters here in Arkansas, then travel over two days to Jackson, Miss.; New Orleans and Baton Rouge, La.; Birmingham, Ala.; Pensacola, Fla.; Memphis and Nashville; Garden City, Ga.; and Mount Pleasant, S.C.
South Carolina has a primary on Feb. 3 and Tennessee on Feb. 10. The other states on the tour hold primaries later, however, with Georgia voting on March 2 and Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida voting on March 9. The Arkansas primary is scheduled for May 18 and the Alabama primary for June 1.
General Clark has also been attracting growing crowds at campaign stops in New Hampshire, where he spent most of his time during the fall after deciding to skip the Iowa caucuses. The crowds are still much smaller than those for Howard Dean, who sometimes draws 1,000 people or more. But as a rookie campaigner, General Clark says that he feels more comfortable in small town-hall settings than behind a lectern, and the campaign has purposely chosen smaller venues for his appearances. 
Mr. Johnson said that during the Southern tour, General Clark's message would be aimed at military families. Many of them are undergoing long separations because of the fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In addition, General Clark is expected to highlight his experience with affirmative action in the military, something he refers to repeatedly on the campaign trail in areas with large minority populations. Though much of the tour will focus on General Clark's plans for the economy, the environment and health care, in Birmingham he will give an address focused on civil rights, campaign officials said. 
The issue came up during a recent visit to Oklahoma City, when the campaign's only public event was a town hall meeting at Stell's, a soul-food restaurant near the state Capitol. Of about 60 people at the meeting, nearly all were African-American, and one person asked General Clark whether he practiced what he preached when hiring campaign workers.
General Clark asked his staff members to raise their hands. "I've got all kinds of people who mirror America," he said, pointing out that about half of the workers were minorities. 
Gwen Tabor, who attended the Oklahoma City event, said she believed General Clark "knows how to talk to people and deal with the problems of the world."
"He knows we have to live together and talk together," Ms. Tabor said. "We need somebody who can lead, which General Clark can do and George Bush has never done."
Some Southern politicians appear to believe in General Clark's ability to attract voters that other candidates might not. On Sunday, The Times-Picayune of New Orleans quoted Representative Chris John, a Democrat and potentially a candidate for the Senate seat being vacated by John B. Breaux, saying that he would be more comfortable campaigning alongside Mr. Clark than any other candidate.
General Clark is clearly having fun these days. Recently, when a contingent of supporters from Arkansas traveled to New Hampshire to show their support, General Clark joined them to "call the hogs," a ritual yelling of "Soooo-eeeeee!" that University of Arkansas fans use to rally their team. Instead of invoking the Razorbacks at the end of the cheer, as is customary, the group ended with "Clark!" which brought a hearty laugh from the general.

HEADLINE: Advertising; 
An antispam law, new questions for food and drug advertising and optimism for a new year.

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives

 BODY:
FOR the advertising industry, the first of many changes expected next year will descend as soon as Thursday.
 That is when a law takes effect that regulates the unsolicited commercial e-mail almost universally derided as spam. The act may ease the problems associated with spam -- which now accounts for half of all e-mail traffic -- by banning false or deceptive headers on a message that can disguise the sender's identity and empowering the Federal Trade Commission to create a "do-not-spam" list, among other measures. 
 The law, however, is one of a number of influences related to government regulation, consumer tastes or technological innovation that are likely to shape the industry in 2004. At the same time, the industry is facing change on many sides, whether complaints about the marketing of junk food or the soaring costs for television commercial time even as audiences shrink, just as it seems to be recovering from one of the worst downturns on record. 
 Soon after the spam legislation takes force, for instance, the Food and Drug Administration will propose changes to its guidelines governing direct-to-consumer drug advertising. The stakes are high because ad spending in the category has reached $2.5 billion a year, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres. And further growth is expected; Novartis, the Swiss drug company, said in November that it planned to increase ads to consumers for its drugs, like Diovan, a top-selling blood pressure pill.
 Even minor changes to the guidelines would be significant. The drug agency is widely expected to reduce the amount of information required in print ads, possibly replacing the pages of extensive detail that are required with a boxed summary of side effects. Despite costing print publishers the revenue from those pages of tiny type, such a change would be likely to help them in the long run by making print a more attractive medium for the drug companies.
 But the controversy over pharmaceutical advertising may be more than matched, however, by further flare-ups over obesity and the advertising of nutritionally suspect food. The American Association of Advertising Agencies, among other groups, has identified obesity and food marketing as the next hot topic in advertising.
 Food marketers of all stripes already are evaluating their advertising practices, hoping to avoid being blamed for the increasing obesity among Americans.
 Many marketers also see the issue as an opportunity. Bally Total Fitness in Chicago is about to begin an ad campaign aimed in large part at the nearly two-thirds of United States adults now defined as overweight.
 "It is our role and responsibility to speak directly to various audiences regarding the ever-expanding waistlines and growing health and fitness needs of Americans, especially the more than 60 million people in this country who are presently overweight or obese," Paul Toback, chairman and chief executive, said.
 Television commercials in the campaign scale back typical shots of hard bodies already in the gym, instead showing a week's worth of fast-food deliveries to a suburban home and a woman searching her closet for clothes that still fit.
 (Using obesity and health concerns in advertising will not work for all marketers, of course, as seen last month when KFC was criticized for ads encouraging the health-conscious to include fried chicken in their diets.)
 While battles over the content of ads continue, marketers must also decide which media outlets will best support their goals in 2004.
 By summertime, many marketers will have revealed their decisions by buying commercial time on the broadcast networks' 2004-2005 season through the bidding process known as the upfront. Despite dwindling audiences for networkshows, marketers set a record in the 2003 upfront when they committed an estimated $9.2 billion to $9.3 billion to buying network ad time. 
 "On the one hand, people understand there is still no better way to aggregate a mass audience," said Adam Hanft, president of the New York agency Hanft Byrne Raboy & Partners. "But there is still doubt that the industry will continue in the same way. Everywhere you read there is a general sense that the traditional 30-second commercial will be an endangered species in the foreseeable future."
 That the growth in television ad spending coincides with continuing declines in network television audiences has created considerable frustration, and envy, among magazine publishers. For the first 11 months of 2003, magazine advertising pages fell 0.5 percent compared with the period a year earlier, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. Just 5 of 12 major categories showed page growth through November; the biggest gainers were the automotive and drugs and remedies categories.
 Not content to suffer silently, the Magazine Publishers of America this year had a contest among marketers and media buyers to give away TiVo recording devices, which let viewers skip commercials. The aim, the organization said, was to play up any misgivings about the effectiveness of network television.
 Those misgivings, already common, may lead to expanded efforts next year to reach consumers outside of traditional channels. 
 The practice of product placement has exploded most visibly, with shows like "The Best Damn Sports Show Period" on Fox Sports Net turning over whole portions of the set to sponsors like Labatt USA. This month the ABC television network made its biggest such deal to date, charging Sears, Roebuck & Company an estimated $1 million to place products like Craftsman tools and Kenmore appliances in episodes of "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition." ABC is exploring similar roles for other advertisers on the series.
 There have been critics of this trend, however, notably the advocacy group Commercial Alert, which called product placement "an affront to basic honesty" in a letter to government regulators. The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing the group's complaint.
 Other avenues to consumers, like cinema advertising and text messages on mobile phones, are likely to keep growing, said Mr. Hanft, but he pointed to one area as a particular likely winner next year: the Internet.
 "We're going to continue to see more money put into the online channel," he said. "This was kind of a threshold year after the bubble, and a lot of marketers are realizing that the tools are getting better," he added, citing sponsored searches on sites like Google and "rich media" allowing marketers to play sounds and animation, and even take over part of a Web page with their ads.
 Moreover, this year has given Internet publishers cause for optimism about 2004. Internet advertising spending totaled an estimated $1.745 billion in the third quarter of 2003, representing the most spending in a quarter since the third quarter of 2001, according to research by the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
 Online publishers may also benefit from the general increase in ad spending many predict for next year; indeed, the recovery, if it happens, may become the biggest story of 2004.
 The president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, O. Burtch Drake, will bang the drum for a better year in a letter to be sent next month to members. "After several rocky years for the advertising agency industry," Mr. Drake writes in the letter, "the coming year already shows promising signs of true turnaround." 
 Another portion of Mr. Drake's letter underscores how unpredictable such turnarounds can be: "Indeed, the much-anticipated -- but never fully materialized -- ad rebound that was predicted for 2002 and 2003 may actually gain traction in 2004."
 Others share his upbeat view.
 "We expect to see a strong recovery in the advertising market in 2004," said Jill Krutick, an analyst with Citigroup Smith Barney, citing the strengthening economy, continued advance demand for television commercial time and the spending generated by the presidential campaigns and the Summer Olympics in Athens. 
 In addition, Robert J. Coen of Universal McCann and John Perriss of ZenithOptimedia, two much-watched industry forecasters, this month increased their predictions of domestic ad spending. Mr. Coen now estimates that such spending will total $266.4 billion next year, up 6.9 percent from an estimated $249.2 billion in 2003. Mr. Perriss predicted more modest growth, about 5.1 percent over 2003, but said increased corporate confidence would help increase spending.
 The shape that spending will take remains less clear.

HEADLINE: Big Stores Make Exclusive Deals To BringIn Music Buyers 

BYLINE:  By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
Serious record collectors generally do not flip through the CD's and DVD's at Wal-Mart, Best Buy or Target. The music departments in those stores are mainly known for offering a narrow selection of chart toppers. 
 But increasingly mass merchandisers and electronics retailers have become the place to go for music that cannot be found anywhere else. That is because many big name artists with new releases to promote, do not just turn to their labels, they also strike exclusive deals with major retailers. 
 In this holiday shopping season, for example, an extended version of Rod Stewart's new CD, "As Time Goes By. . .The Great American Songbook Vol. II" is available only at Target; Wal-Mart has an exclusive special release of Britney Spears' new CD with links to additional tracks online; and a Rolling Stones concert DVD is only sold at Best Buy. Earlier, Target offered a $7 Bon Jovi CD featuring some live and acoustic versions of songs from "Bounce." The full album was released widely to retailers at the same time. 
 Exclusive deals have not been restricted to brick-and-mortar retailers. Amazon.com customers who bought "Afterglow" by Sarah McLachlan before its release could immediately listen to some of its songs through a system on Amazon's Web site. Now that the CD is available, Amazon customers who buy it have exclusive Web access to remixes of some of Ms. McLachlan's songs.
 The exclusive deals are being offered as mass marketers are seeing their share of the music business grow. Discount stores like Wal-Mart accounted for only 13.5 percent of music sales in 1994, said Clark Benson, the chief executive of the Almighty Institute of Music Retail, a Los Angeles-based company that sells data about retailers to record labels. This year the figure is 34.8 percent. Billboard and its corporate sibling Nielsen SoundScan lump electronics chains like Best Buy and Circuit City with traditional music stores. Adding their sales to the other mass marketers would probably raise that group's total to more than 50 percent, said Geoff Mayfield, the director for charts and senior analyst at Billboard.
 For the retailers, the deals are as much about using the artists' appeal to lure customers as they are about selling CD's and DVD's. For the musicians, the deals are less about sales than about promotional campaigns well beyond anything offered by record companies even in their glory days. 
 For example, Target promoted its exclusive seven-song Bon Jovi CD with an extensive television campaign. In the 30-second spot -- which cost $1 million to produce, the band's management said -- snippets from a studio performance of a song on Bon Jovi's new full-priced CD were intercut with footage of band members chatting about the meaning of the song. Best Buy started a similarly ambitious television campaign for its Rolling Stones DVD set last month.
 "If you look at the Target commercial, that's an ad for Bon Jovi and they just stuck their little circle on at the end," said Bruce Kirkland, one of the two principals at Bon Jovi Management. "The key for us really was being included in the ad. The budgets big retailers have are budgets record companies don't have."
 Not surprisingly, the exclusive arrangements irritate other music retailers, particularly independent and regional operators who lack the power and money to cut deals. 
 "To me it's obnoxious," said Michael Dresse, chief executive officer of Newbury Comics, a 24-store chain in New England. "We're kind of being picked off, one artist at a time, by the mass merchandisers who aren't interested in music. They just want to use the power of a band to drive more feet through their doors."
 Further market concentration tends to favor popular performers, like the Rolling Stones and Bon Jovi, who act as a magnet for buyers over emerging or controversial acts. "Being a small act has never been easy," Mr. Mayfield said. "But if you're a starting act, you don't want to be in Wal-Mart. You'll get lost there." 
 In the United States some retailers, including Albany-based Trans World Entertainment which has 940 stores protested Best Buy's arrangement with the Rolling Stones by substantially cutting the number of titles by the band that it stocked. The reaction in Canada has been even more intense. Several large chains have boycotted Rolling Stones products. 
 "If we're not good enough to have all the products from the Stones, then we won't have their catalog in our stores," said Humphrey Kadaner, president of HMV North America, whose 100 outlets in Canada removed all Rolling Stones products. "The only method we have to influence the Stones is to impact their royalties stream," Mr. Kadaner said. 
 After starting its protest last month, HMV Canada tried to make a deal with TGA Entertainment of Toronto. Failing that, it asked Canadian competition regulators to investigate the arrangement with Best Buy. On Dec. 18, Canada's Competition Bureau announced that the exclusive deal did not break any laws. 
 Michael Cohl, who is chairman of TGA and has been the tour manager for the Rolling Stones, dismissed Mr. Kadaner's contention that the Rolling Stones are acting unfairly. "Give me a break," Mr. Cohl said. "This idea that there's only one way to distribute product and it has to be the industry's rules is as anticompetitive an idea as there is." 
 "Once you make the decision to sell a new product you have to ask yourself: Has the traditional method done everything possible for artists?" he said. "The answer is that of course you should consider all things."
 Gary Arnold, the senior vice president for entertainment at Best Buy said the value of such deals became obvious in 1995 and 1996 during the release of the "Beatles Anthology," three double albums. At that time, Best Buy struck a deal to package additional material, like photographs and archival interviews with the band members, with each CD. The result, Mr. Arnold said, was that Best Buy sold more copies of the recordings than any other retailer in the United States. "It showed that it's not all about price to consumers," he said.
 Mr. Cohl and Mr. Arnold came together because of a decision by the Rolling Stones in their last concert tour. They were frustrated by the lack of promotional attention given to music DVD's. "Music DVD's have been handled as an afterthought," Mr. Cohl said. "They're the Rodney Dangerfields of the music industry."
 At the end of their tour, the Rolling Stones produced an unusually long four-disc DVD package titled "Four Flicks" and charged TGA Entertainment, Mr. Cohl's company, with finding a retail partner.
 Only Best Buy provided Mr. Cohl with what he was seeking, a retailer who was also willing to manufacture and distribute the discs. "We looked for the excitement in their voices and the gleam in their eyes," he said."It was no contest."
 The set is priced at an exceptionally low $30. The suggested price for the set in England, where it is distributed by Warner Music to all retailers, is $:50 ($89). 
 Mr. Arnold acknowledged that exclusive music deals help lure additional customers into Best Buy stores. "We know that a consumer, on a given shopping day, has a lot of alternatives for where they want to go." He insists that the unique content of the recordings, not their low prices, is driving the process.
 Little economizing was apparent when it came to promotion. While neither party would discuss details of the arrangement, Mr. Cohl said that Best Buy's commitment to advertising the set in print advertisements and in-store displays is measured in "many millions of dollars for marketing," far beyond that of its usual music marketing. "It's what I would imagine the marketing budget is for a major feature film release on DVD," he added.
 Mr. Mayfield of Billboard, agreed that Best Buy's effort has been extraordinary.
 "They were eye-catching ads, and the overwhelming message was that Best Buy has this video," he said.
 The sales results have been similarly exceptional, he added. From its release in mid-November until late the week before last, Four Flicks sold 155,000 copies in the United States. By contrast, the Rolling Stones' previous concert DVD, "Bridges to Babylon," sold just 24,000 copies in the same period after its release. And its total sales after almost five years are 164,000.
 A random sampling of some older Rolling Stones CD titles by Mr. Mayfield suggests that the exclusive deals may stimulate sales across the board. Sales of Rolling Stones CD's have increased by about 26 percent since Best Buy's campaign started, although such albums may only sell about 1,700 units a week nationwide. Mr. Kirkland of Bon Jovi management said he was confident that the Target campaign not only increased sales of "Bounce," but also increased sales of older Bon Jovi albums at all music retailers. "There was a total sales lift right across the board," he said.
 The Rolling Stones deal was unusual because the rights to the DVD rest with the band, not its record label, the Virgin division of Britain's EMI. Frequently record companies are directly, if discreetly, involved in helping to form the alliances between acts and retailers. The Universal Music, the parent company of Bon Jovi's Island Def Jam label, made the initial introduction at Target for the band's management. But Mr. Mayfield said that record companies, and even many retailers, like to keep a low profile about exclusives. Partly at their request, for example, Billboard does not include exclusive music CD's on its charts.
 What that market concentration means is a matter of debate. Mr. Mayfield said that mass marketers have always been influential. But people looking for recordings from controversial or emerging acts have always gone to specialty shops, a practice he said will continue. Mr. Benson is less sanguine. While music downloading has pressured all parts of the music industry, he said, the sales shift to mass marketers has contributed to record store closings. In the last six months lone, he said, 358 music stores -- chain outlets and independents -- have shut down.
 Exclusive deals will only add to the pressure.
 "I can certainly understand why established artists are doing this, but it drives another nail into the coffin of traditional music stores that are already struggling because of music piracy," he said. "Maybe I'm just a romantic about this stuff. But I think the neighborhood record store is an important part of our culture."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Monday about exclusive deals between musicians and large retailers misattributed a figure for the market share of music sales held by discount stores like Wal-Mart. The figure, 34.8 percent, is from Geoff Mayfield, a senior analyst and director for charts at Billboard -- not from Clark Benson, chief executive of the Almighty Institute of Music Retail.

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report; 
Reporting healthy increase in sales, this holiday shopping season was the best ever for Internet retailers.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
ONLINE retailers enjoyed a stellar holiday season, according to preliminary reports, punctuating a year in which many e-tailers reached profitability and pushed sales steadily higher. But some analysts warned that the profits made by online merchants this year could be harder to come by in 2004.
 The top items selling online this holiday season were computer hardware products; digital cameras and other electronics; movies and CD's; and clothes and toys, according to BizRate, a shopping comparison and research firm. 
 That has not changed much from years past, but this holiday season will go down as the most successful yet for e-commerce, in terms of sales and profits. According to ComScore Networks, a research firm that tracks online spending among 1.5 million Internet users, e-commerce sales reached $11.72 billion from Nov. 1 to Dec. 26, a 29 percent jump from $9.08 billion in the same period in 2002. ComScore's figures exclude travel and auctions, which is an increasingly important mode of holiday shopping for many online users. 
 As of Dec. 26, year-to-date sales -- excluding travel and auctions -- reached $51.51 billion, up roughly 22 percent from $42.37 billion in the same period a year earlier. Those numbers could change slightly, ComScore said, as holiday returns are settled. And unlike most merchants, ComScore records revenues from gift certificates when the certificates are bought, not when they are redeemed.
 Visa USA reported similarly positive results last week. Visa, which says its credit and debit cards are used in about half of all Internet transactions, said nontravel online retail sales from Nov. 17 to Dec. 25 increased 45 percent over the same period last year, to $4.9 billion. As of Dec. 25, year-to-date sales had jumped 37 percent, to $28.4 billion.
 "It's still a healthy industry," said Safa Rashtchy, an Internet analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, an investment firm that earns banking fees from many publicly held Internet companies. "Thirty percent growth is nice."
 Mr. Rashtchy, though, said profits among online retailers were not expected to increase proportionally because competition was increasing on several fronts. Traditional retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck & Company have grown more serious about their Internet operations, as total online revenues have soared past the $50 billion mark this year. Although still contributing only a small fraction of total retail sales, that increased competition is helping to hold down prices. Walmart.com's recent introduction of an online music download store is a case in point. At 88 cents a song, the store's price is significantly below the standard 99 cents other online stores charge, cutting sharply into what analysts said was already a fairly thin profit margin for the retailers. 
 In the future, more money will be flowing out the door of online retailers, thanks to a rebound in the Internet advertising market, which is pushing up the cost of marketing on portals like Yahoo, AOL, which is owned by Time Warner, and MSN, which is a unit of the Microsoft Corporation. 
 Marketers of all stripes are also discovering the lure of so-called pay-per-click advertising through services like Google and Yahoo's Overture, on which they bid to advertise near the results of popular search terms.
 "Just like we've seen in online travel, I'd expect a bidding war, almost certainly on paid search sites, but also for key placement on other sites," Mr. Rashtchy said. "So I'd expect the overall cost for advertising to be up."
 Advertisers who bid for placement on search services like Google and Overture are paying 12 percent more than they did a year ago, said Charlene Li, an analyst with Forrester Research, with the average search term going for 31 cents a click. The bigger increases, Ms. Li said, will come from the "display advertising" side of the business, where portals and other Web sites like CNET.com and CNN.com sell banners, buttons, skyscrapers, pop-ups and other cuts of online real estate.
 Revenues from display advertising on portal sites have grown about 25 percent in the last year, Ms. Li said, while revenues on the larger nonportal sites are up about 20 percent.
 "Everyone's doing pretty well," she said. "It's hard to calculate the average rates, because nobody really knows what their rates are, but they do say they're going up." 
 And they will continue to rise next year, Ms. Li predicted. Search-term advertisers should expect to pay about 8 percent more by the end of next year, she said. And, she said, the cost of online display advertising is expected to increase in 2004, as demand continues to rise.
 "Those who are already advertising say they're going to spend a lot more next year," Ms. Li said. "Publishers are constantly creating new advertising products, and marketers are figuring out what works." 
 Even as analysts fret that profit margins may erode for many online retailers, the companies insist that they can avoid that fate through better management.
 Seth P. Levy, chief information officer of Electronics Boutique, a retailer of video games and software, and president of EB Games Online, said that ad spending had become more focused.
 "We're getting smarter and targeting more directly the online gaming content communities and shopping portals that work best for us," said Mr. Levy, who has just completed his seventh holiday selling season with EBGames.com.
 The company has also increased its reliance on e-mail marketing. EBGames.com has had "more and more success" from its weekly e-mail newsletter, which brings promotions and news to hundreds of thousands of subscribers, he said.
 Meanwhile, the company has been able to maintain profit margins in the face of more costly shipping promotions -- a measure partly taken to keep pace with competing offers from other sites. EBGames.com stocks more than 5,000 used games and consoles, a substantial increase from years past, Mr. Levy said. "Those tend to have better margins," he said.
 As for advertising costs, Mr. Levy said he had not seen increases along the lines of what Ms. Li, of Forrester, noted. But EB Games negotiated its current rates early in the year, when the online advertising market was nearly lifeless.
 "When we renegotiate, I'd expect to see some increases," Mr. Levy said. "But by planning well and making more targeted buys, we should be able to maintain our costs."
 Michael Crotty, vice chairman of the trade group Shop.org and vice president for marketing at Neiman Marcus Direct, which runs the retailer's three Web sites, said he expected to see similar discipline from other merchants. 
 "People running marketing for online companies are much more seasoned now," Mr. Crotty said. "If their spending goes up, it's only because their return from that investment is increasing at the same rate. We start with the profit number and work backwards. If you can sell it to someone at a cost that doesn't work for us, then go for it."

HEADLINE: Cruise Ships Drop Anchor, and New York 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Cruise ship companies, whose mammoth boats have been pulling in and out of New York Harbor in ever-increasing numbers, have long complained about the city's West Side piers, which they say present a crumbling, unappealing and highly congested portal to Manhattan.
 The depth of the problem emerged just before Christmas, when Royal Caribbean International announced that it would move the Nordic Empress and one of the world's largest cruise ships, the 3,114-passenger Voyager of the Seas, to Bayonne. That New Jersey city may not have the glamour of Manhattan, company executives said, but it would not have all the problems, either. 
 New York City officials were caught flat-footed. For nearly a year, they had been mulling over a $100 million proposal from the Carnival Corporation, the largest cruise operator in the world, to build a satellite passenger terminal in Brooklyn, and conducting yet another in a long line of waterfront studies. Officials knew that the West Side passenger ship terminal -- five berths on three piers between 48th and 52nd Streets -- needed a costly upgrade. But they did not think anyone in one the city's fastest-growing industries would actually build a new berth in Bayonne. 
"I think it took everybody by surprise," said Kate Ascher, an executive vice president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "We didn't know anything about this diversion. We have been working with them and others on a redevelopment plan."
The Nordic Empress, which has used Manhattan as its seasonal home port, will move about 10 miles south to Bayonne in the spring, joining the Voyager, which will be new to the harbor.
Ms. Ascher said the city hoped to release the results of the latest study next month. It also hopes to unveil plans for interim improvements to the West Side terminal, like elevators and escalators, and for a long-term effort to expand the city's capacity to handle cruise ships. She said the city was also exploring plans to build a new terminal at Pier 7 in Brooklyn.
"We are moving as fast as we can," Ms. Ascher said. "The industry has grown tremendously in the past three years, and we're running to catch up."
Industry executives said they had heard that before and expressed pessimism over the city's ability to finance the projects and get the work done quickly.
John Tercek, vice president for commercial development at Royal Caribbean Cruises, played down the decision to move the Voyager to Bayonne next spring, saying his company was committed to the New York market. But he acknowledged that the company had already transferred another ship, the 1,500-passenger Horizon, to Philadelphia.
"That ship left the marketplace because it's too congested in New York," he said. "It's not our goal to play off New York versus New Jersey. Our goal is to deliver the best possible customer service and experience. The West Side terminals do not deliver the best customer experience."
The company's move raises the question of whether New York can continue to capture its share of a growing industry. There is no question that the once-somnolent cruise industry is booming, despite war and shipboard viruses. The number of passengers embarking from North American ports has risen by 47 percent since 1998 to about eight million this year, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. The growth was even more spectacular in New York, where the number of passengers jumped 157.2 percent during the same period, to about 450,000 this year.
With cruise ship passengers flying into New York, spending a few days in hotels, eating in restaurants and seeing Broadway shows, the industry says it has an impact of $800 million a year on the city's economy.
As a result, Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Oceania, Cunard and Holland America have been building bigger and faster ships to get to the Caribbean.
But the city's West Side passenger terminals, last renovated in 1970, are frayed and poorly equipped to handle either the number or size of the ships. When the $800 million Queen Mary 2 arrives in New York for the first time next spring, the 1,132-foot ocean liner will extend 132 feet beyond the length of the piers into the shipping channel.
On any weekend day during the cruise season -- from May to October -- up to 10,000 passengers may be debarking and embarking at the same time, creating a traffic nightmare outside the spare and gloomy passenger terminals.
The logjam led Carnival to propose building a $100 million passenger terminal at Pier 7, which sits at the foot of Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. The company, which offered to pay about three-quarters of the cost, said the pier could easily accommodate the Queen Mary 2.
"New York remains our port of choice. But now is the time to stop procrastinating," said Giora Israel, vice president for strategic planning at Carnival. "The berths in Brooklyn can be converted in a short time to allow us to expand capacity in New York and allow for upgrades on the West Side."
Royal Caribbean, a competitor, could not wait while the city considered the idea. Mr. Tercek said the company decided to move the Royal Caribbean line's New York operations to Bayonne, where it could easily convert a warehouse on the old military pier into a terminal, while keeping its Celebrity line in Manhattan.
Daniel L. Doctoroff, deputy mayor of New York for Economic Development and Rebuilding, said the city's loss was not permanent. He said Royal Caribbean had made a commitment to Bayonne of only one year. In the meantime, he said, the Bloomberg administration would soon release a comprehensive plan for renovation and expansion.
"I believe that if New York provides adequate facilities, which will require a substantial investment by the city and its private partners," Mr. Doctoroff said, "I have no doubt in the long term New York City will capture the market share in the area."

HEADLINE: As Schenectady Rusts, Experts Fear Policy Inertia 

BYLINE:  By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: SCHENECTADY, N.Y. 

 BODY:
When Samuel S. Stratton became mayor of the Electric City almost 50 years ago, about 27,000 people worked at the General Electric plant at one end of Erie Boulevard and thousands more worked at the other end, at the American Locomotive Company. On Thursday nights, when the shops stayed open late, a human tide gushed onto State Street, and Mr. Stratton glad-handed voters as they thronged to the vaudeville theaters, elegant department stores and bustling restaurants that lined the city's busiest street.
 In November, his son Brian was elected mayor. But the city the younger Mr. Stratton inherits is a shadow of the one his father, who went on to become a powerful congressman, once governed. 
 It has lost a third of its population. General Electric, which once defined this city, has moved tens of thousands of jobs elsewhere, and ALCO is long gone, having closed the Big Shop, as its locomotive works were known, in 1968. State Street is now a ghostly shell: empty storefronts stand between pizza parlors, a dollar store and a discount clothing shop. 
In November, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the city's bond rating from Ba1 to Ba2, the lowest in the state. Only 11 other municipalities and school districts in the country, including the town of Cicero, north of Syracuse, are rated as low.
Schenectady's tale is in some ways a familiar story of Rust Belt decline. But experts on urban policy say its story also illustrates something else: how New York State, in many ways the quintessential urban state, has no real plan to save its cities. So Schenectady's long decline and uncertain future in some ways is not just its own story, but that of cities across the state.
It was not always this way. From 1886, when Thomas Alva Edison brought his manufacturing operations to this bend in the Mohawk River, the Electric City cranked out innovation, from the television to the Monitor Top refrigerator. At G.E.'s employment peak during World War II, 40,000 people worked at the factory.
Today it is a city that is too small for its britches. From its opulent marble City Hall on North Jay Street, built in 1931, to the outsize Roman Catholic Church, St. John the Evangelist, on Union Avenue -- built in 1904 to accommodate thousands of Italian, Irish and Polish immigrants -- to the row upon row of wood-frame houses in now-dilapidated neighborhoods, the physical dimensions of the city overwhelm its current occupants.
"We're a city built for 100,000 people that only has 60,000 people," said Marv Cermak, who writes a column about Schenectady once a week in The Times Union, an Albany newspaper.
"That's a lot of empty houses and empty streets."
Left behind are a needy population and cheap housing that attracts poor people from downstate.
Hamilton Hill, the city's grittiest neighborhood, is just six-tenths of a square mile, but it accounts for half of the gunfire reported in the city.
"We are losing a whole generation of kids to these streets," said Judy Atchinson, a 62-year-old composer who runs Quest, a program in Hamilton Hill that seeks to keep children away from street gangs. "There are no jobs, no decent housing, no hope. Schenectady is the bottom of the barrel."
The common perception downstate is that upstate is a vast, desolate place that died a slow but natural death when its industrial heyday ended. But the picture here is more complicated.
Schenectady is part of the Capital Region, a relatively prosperous section of upstate propped up by the vastness of state government, which employs more than 30,000 people, along with more than a few private employers. The region is now the focus of an intensive program created by Gov. George E. Pataki to attract high-tech business.
While Schenectady foundered in recent decades, its suburbs prospered. In the towns that surround the city, quarter-million-dollar houses fill cul-de-sacs in tranquil subdivisions. Niskayuna, one of the city's suburbs, has the third highest median household income outside the New York metropolitan region, $70,800.
Some of the city's problems are of its own making. A report by the state comptroller issued in 2002 found gross mismanagement of city money -- money for capital projects, like roads and buildings, had been used to cover operating expenses, for example. Replenishing the city's capital fund required a 25 percent property tax increase in 2003.
But experts on urban affairs say the disparity between the upstate cities and suburbs also reflects the state's failure to develop an effective approach to revitalizing cities. 
"As hard as it is to believe, there is no urban policy in New York State," said Edward C. Farrell, executive director of the New York State Conference of Mayors. "There is no design to help cities recover."
Cities with populations of 50,000 to 100,000 lost a tenth of their total population between the 1990 and 2000 census. Cities have seen their tax bases shrink and their costs mushroom as they struggle to meet the needs of populations that are growing older and poorer. But as costs rise, two out of three cities receive half as much money from the state as they did in 1989, according to an analysis by the mayors' conference.
And many urban experts say that reduced state financing, scattershot economic development plans and multiple layers of government that served to isolate foundering cities from their affluent suburbs have battered places like Schenectady. A survey of city budgets by the mayors' conference this year found that nearly 60 percent of cities said that their financial situations had deteriorated in the past year. 
"People see this decline of cities as inevitable," said Rolf Pendall, a professor of city and regional planning at Cornell University. "It is not inevitable. It is something public policy has helped bring about."
Joseph Conway, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, who once was mayor of Peekskill, a struggling city in northern Westchester County, said in a statement that Mr. Pataki "has led an aggressive, comprehensive effort to strengthen and revitalize" small cities across the state. He cited, for example, the creation of the Office of Small Cities, which gives out $50 million to cities, villages and towns each year. 
"No one has done more to encourage economic growth and job creation in our small cities than Governor Pataki," Mr. Conway said.
And mayors of several cities, including Utica, Plattsburgh and Binghamton, after being prompted by Pataki administration officials, praised various state programs, including the Empire Zone program, which gives tax breaks and other incentives to companies that choose to locate in depressed areas. 
Still, both politics and policy have conspired over several decades to harm New York's cities.
Hemmed in by geography and unable to annex adjacent land the way cities do in other parts of the country, New York's cities are forced to increase taxes in order to raise more cash from fewer people. School districts set up along town lines further isolate cities from their suburbs.
Meanwhile, economic development initiatives, like the Empire Zone program, were initially intended to help cities recover from the loss of major industrial employers, but, bowing to political and economic pressure, many of these zones have been expanded to include suburban locations that are easier to develop. Schenectady's Empire Zone includes land in one of the city's affluent suburbs, Glenville, and in June officials asked for permission to expand it further to include land in other wealthy suburbs.
And there are political issues, too. Rather than being represented by a single person in the State Legislature, cities, unlike most towns, may be broken up among several districts. Two assemblymen share Schenectady, and each has a piece of the suburbs as well, so the representation of cities is diluted, Mr. Farrell said.
While Mr. Pataki created a program that gives extra money to cities in distress, it does not make up for the deep cuts enacted in the early 1990's, when the state last faced a fiscal crisis. Schenectady, despite its serious financial problems, still receives 15 percent less money from the state than it did in 1989, according to the mayors' conference.
And its expenses keep rising.
The slump in the stock market in recent years and enhanced benefits passed by the State Legislature in 2000 mean that cities must contribute millions more toward pensions. In 2002 Schenectady sent Albany $524,033 to pay for pensions. In 2004 that figure will be almost $5 million.
"A city like ours has nowhere to turn for that kind of money," Mr. Stratton said. 
Professor Pendall said the state needed to focus its economic development programs on cities, not suburbs, and provide housing incentives for suburbs to build low-income housing. Redrawing school district boundaries to reduce the city-suburb divide would help too, Mr. Pendall said, but the political realities militate against that ever happening.
Despite its problems, Schenectady is not hopeless. It has a surprisingly good school system that includes special high schools concentrating on the fine arts and other disciplines. It has impressive houses -- the mansions G.E. executives built are among the handsomest homes in the region. 
It has a fine theater, Proctor's, which was recently renovated and is a popular place for concerts and shows. But it cannot compete with its suburbs for homeowners and businesses because its taxes are much higher, said Assemblyman Paul Tonko, whose district includes part of Schenectady.
"The state needs to address tax policy to be fairer to cities," Mr. Tonko said. 
Mr. Pataki has taken an interest in Schenectady, bringing the offices of three government agencies, including the state lottery, to the city, and the new buildings and their workers have helped breathe some new life into the city's decrepit downtown. Albert P. Jurczynski, the city's departing mayor, who declined to run for re-election after two terms, has been ridiculed for suggesting simply dissolving the city and merging it with the county as a way to get out from under its financial problems. But Brian Stratton is considering doing something very similar -- consolidating as many city government functions as possible with the county government in a bid to save money.
"I love this city with all my heart," Mr. Stratton said. "It was great once, and I believe it can be great again. But we are going to need a lot of help to get there."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: The Year Ahead: Consolidation and Competition as an Industry Grows Up -- Venture Capital; 
A Stirring of Hope Amid Pessimism

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: MENLO PARK, Calif., Dec. 26 

 BODY:
After peaking at $17 billion in 2000, venture capital investments in Silicon Valley collapsed in 2001 and 2002, and the market still shows no sign of a real recovery any time soon.
 The collapse was a rude awakening for a generation of venture capitalists who came of age in the 1990's and had not known a downturn until the dot-com flameout. 
 Now experienced venture capitalists on Sand Hill Road, home to the valley's leading venture firms, routinely talk about the possibility that business will not thrive again for years. They say that the valley's investors have to work their way through the more than 8,000 investments in companies that are not profitable but have not yet gone public, been acquired or gone out of business. Some pessimists peg the time for revival as being close to the end of the decade. 
 There have been some stirrings, of course. But after being frozen for nearly two years, any investment activity at all looks like a sign of life. 
 "The turtle is cautiously poking its head out of its shell," said Paul Saffo, a director at the Institute for the Future, which monitors technology trends, but "it is still protecting its vital organs."
 Ultimately, the problem may be simply an outsized imbalance between supply and demand. From 1980 to 2000, the number of venture firms in the country skyrocketed from 87 to 693, according to Venture Economics, a firm that tracks the industry. At the same time, the number of venture capitalists expanded to 8,368, from 1,035. The reality is that there are not enough profitable technology start-up ideas to go around.
 "A second wave of venture companies are destined to die," said Steven Dow, a partner at Sevin Rosen, a venture firm in Palo Alto, Calif.
 Yet there is little visible gloom along Sand Hill Road, a suburban business neighborhood where office real estate is among the most expensive in the world.
 "After all," said Yogan Dalal, a partner at Mayfield Partners here, "we're in the hope business." JOHN MARKOFF

HEADLINE: MEDIA: The Year Ahead: Giving an Audience What It Wants, but Not Giving It Away -- Search Engines; 
Internet Advertising Thrives on Targeted Ads

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
For years, Internet advertising was written off as ineffective. The most typical ad format -- the rectangular banner at the top of the Web page -- was simply too small to be creative, informative or otherwise persuasive.
 So, it is no small surprise that the hottest form of online advertising is now paid listings on search engines -- a mere two sentences that make a banner ad appear epic by comparison. 
Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm, expects search-based advertising spending in the United States to grow 47 percent to $2.8 billion next year from $1.9 billion in 2003, which is faster than any other form of online marketing. 
 The question facing the industry is how big can these small ads really be. The main purveyors now -- Google and Yahoo's Overture Services -- are rapidly trying to place these ads on other Web pages like news articles. And lots of other sites, like the Bizrate shopping engine and the Citysearch local information service, are refashioning their business models to focus on variations of paid-search advertising.
 The main reason that search advertising has been successful is that it presents advertising that consumers might actually want to see. Someone searching for information on arthritis may well be as interested in ads by drug companies and chiropractors as the reports by medical foundations and information sites found by the search engines. 
 A less obvious driver of search ads, but perhaps as important in the long run, is that they sell themselves. Rather than negotiating with an ad salesman, the advertiser buys search ads on a Web site by entering a search term and price it is willing to pay. The highest-bidding ads are displayed, and the advertisers only pay when a user clicks on the ad to visit their Web page. 
 Now Overture and Google have hundreds of thousands of advertisers willing to pay for more clicks than even those highly used search engines can deliver. So they are both placing search ads on other Web pages. But advertisers are concerned that such advertisements are less effective if they are not on a search site, and may not be willing to pay as much for them. There are also some bugs to work out with the automated systems that pick which ads to go on what pages, the president of Overture, Ted Meisel, said. 
 One embarrassing example was the placement of ads by luggage stores on a Web page for a news article about a murderer who carried away his victims in a suitcase. "It's harder to do content targeting than we thought," Mr. Meisel said. SAUL HANSELL

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the outlook for online advertising in 2004 referred imprecisely to a Web site that automatically positioned advertisements for luggage stores next to a news article about a murderer who carried his victims in a suitcase. It was Google, not Yahoo's Overture Services.

HEADLINE: Treasury Notes Lose Some of Their Appeal 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Investors in United States Treasury notes are the most bearish they have been in more than three years amid forecasts of economic growth, according to a weekly sentiment index.
 Ried, Thunberg & Company, a research firm in Westport, Conn., said its index tied to the benchmark 10-year note fell 3 points to 41, its lowest level since September 2000. 
A reading below 50 reflects expectations that the note will fall through the end of March. The 43 investors polled by the firm manage a combined $1.75 trillion. 
 Treasuries are losing appeal on speculation that gains in consumer confidence, manufacturing and employment will lead to inflation and cause the Federal Reserve to raise its target interest rate by the second half of 2004. Investors surveyed cut Treasury holdings to the lowest since mid-2001.
 "The path of leastresistance is rates rising," said Keith Karlawish, president and chief investment officer of BB&T Asset Management Inc., which has about $15 billion of bonds under management. 
 Investors surveyed by Ried, Thunberg cut Treasuries to 21 percent of portfolios from 23 percent, and increased corporate bonds to 36 percent from 35 percent -- the most since mid-August. Mortgage securities and debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered housing companies, were unchanged at 34 percent.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN PICTURES: IN AMERICA 

 BODY:
 IN AMERICA, the year was tinged with eerie echoes of the past: the country again went to war against Iraq, a space shuttle explosion killed seven astronauts, and child abuse charges were leveled against a pop superstar who came under suspicion a decade ago. The Christmas holiday was marked by the post-9/11 reality of heightened terror alerts, and Democratic candidates filled the early stages of the presidential primary campaign with heated words over the United States continued role in Iraq. 
The economy improved, though by how much was a matter of debate; profits increased and the stock market rose, but the job market remained weak and wage growth was slow. On Wall Street, scandals ensnared a number of high rollers, including Martha Stewart, America's premier domestic diva, who is to go on trial next month. A power failure spread across eight states and parts of Ontario, and deadly wildfires claimed a record number of acres in California. A man and a teenager who terrorized the Washington area last year during the sniper shootings were convicted of capital murder in separate trials. In sports, the Cubs and the Red Sox made it to the brink of the World Series before once again breaking their fan's hearts. There were also more gentle reminders of the past. A new Harry Potter book was unleashed after a three-year hiatus; Chicago, the movie version of a hit Broadway show, captured the Oscar for Best Picture. And a well-known actor was elected governor of California.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: ON THE AIR; 
BUSH'S CAMPAIGN FINDS PLATFORM ON LOCAL RADIO

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
President Bush's campaign officials mostly avoid television programs like "Hardball With Chris Matthews," "Inside Politics" or "Face the Nation."
 There will be a time for politics, they say. 
 But on one recent Thursday, Terry Holt, Mr. Bush's campaign press secretary, called in to "The Marc Bernier Show," at 1150 and 1490 on the AM dial here, to talk extensively about how the president wanted to help orange growers and would not be satisfied until "every American who wants a job can have a job." 
It was one of several telephone visits Mr. Holt made to radio stations in the past few weeks, though he has not appeared on a national television program since he started his job in early November. 
While the Bush campaign maintains a low profile on the national campaign stage -- content for now to watch the Democrats beat on one another -- it is aggressively working the expansive hustings of Republican-friendly talk radio, priming the grass roots faithful for battle next year.
Mr. Bernier's program is part of a network of conservative-minded local radio shows in politically important states on which campaign officials are heard daily, programs like "Mid-Day With Charlie Sykes" in Milwaukee, "The Martha Zoller Show" in Atlanta and "The Jerry Bowyer Program" in Pittsburgh.
It is a network that the Democrats do not have -- though they are trying to cultivate one -- and one that Mr. Bush's campaign strategists believe will give him an edge in an election that could go to whichever side best mobilizes its core voters.
Presidents have used radio to reach voters virtually since its invention. But strategists and radio experts say the Bush campaign has taken it to a new level of sophistication, using it far earlier in the campaign cycle and appearing regularly on shows with even the tiniest of audiences.
Mr. Bernier's show, for instance, has an audience of about 50,000 people, compared with more than 14.5 million for Rush Limbaugh every week. The program is so down-home that on one recent night, John Tamburino, owner of Stevens Tire and Auto, walked in off the street to hand Mr. Bernier a Christmas card during a commercial break. Mr. Bernier's political panel that night included Paul Politis, owner of the nearby Gator Beach and Sport, and Virginia Brown, a recently retired hotelier.
But his audience is a politically active bunch in a county, Volusia, that was hotly contested during the 2000 presidential race. As site of the Daytona 500 stock car race, it is chock-full of the so-called Nascar dads, a group that strategists have identified as independent enough to vote for either party.
That is no small thing in a state that Mr. Bush won by 537 votes. Moreover, a survey by Talkers magazine, a trade publication, found that nationwide, 73 percent of talk radio listeners registered to vote did so in 2000.
With the nation mostly evenly divided between Republican and Democrat, "you can win a national election 50,000 listeners at a time," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, who has studied radio and politics.
Still, Ms. Jamieson added: "This is a change in tactics. Radio's been traditionally used later in a campaign, and it's been traditionally larger-audience talk radio." 
Mr. Holt said he called in to radio shows like Mr. Bernier's nearly every day.
If he and other campaign officials were to appear on national television programs, he said, the hosts would try to draw them into a dogfight with the Democratic candidates, something they are not interested in doing.
Hosts like Mr. Bernier, on the other hand, let the campaign address the topics it wants to highlight now, what officials call the president's positive agenda on national security, Medicare and the economy.
"We've had discussions with all of the networks and TV shows about doing their shows, and they know there will be a time for politics, and that will signal a change," Mr. Holt said. "At the radio stations that happen to want us on, and that we seek to get on regularly, we are talking to a group of people that follows our issues."
The gentler treatment that he and his colleagues tend to receive is also a consideration. Mr. Bernier began the interview last week by asking Mr. Holt about the president's recent bout with runner's knee ("he's just anxious to go out and get running," Mr. Holt answered) and whether the campaign could schedule a book signing by the former first lady Barbara Bush to offset the attention Hillary Rodham Clinton was getting for one in Miami.
Saying afterward that he did not want his audience to consider him to be a "lay-down Sally," Mr. Bernier did ask some uncomfortable questions, like whether American forces would find Osama bin Laden and whether jobs would come back. But the interview's friendly tone gave Mr. Holt an opportunity to repeat campaign talking points without facing intensive journalistic follow-up questions. 
Mr. Holt's call to Mr. Bernier's show was not based on a specific event but campaign officials will often book themselves onto talk shows in a more tactical fashion, to shore up support against bad news, to rally support around good news or to answer Democratic barbs unfettered.
The campaign's Southeast regional chairman, Ralph Reed, was a guest on Mr. Bernier's show this month when Democrats gathered near Orlando for the party's state convention. "Reed was ripping the Democrats left and right," said Mr. Bernier's executive producer, Greg Blose, an aspiring Republican radio host himself.
And before the president lifted steel tariffs earlier this month, a potentially unpopular move in industrial areas, Mr. Holt appeared on "The Jerry Bowyer Program" on WPTT-AM in Pittsburgh. Mr. Bowyer said he appreciated the gesture.
The Republican courtship of talk radio began in earnest in 1994, when Newt Gingrich used the medium to push the "Contract With America" and, ultimately, bring about a Republican majority in the House of Representatives. 
Mr. Bush's political staff further perfected the strategy in the 2002 midterm election, when they invited radio hosts to the White House to interview top officials less than a week before the vote.
Administration officials said they invited hosts of all political stripes. But the Democratic National Committee, noting a national dearth of liberal hosts, said the guest list was overwhelmingly conservative. 
The move certainly helped the White House to make friends in important places.
"They wanted to get their voice out, and I got to interview Karl Rove and Andy Card," said Phil Valentine, a conservative radio host in Nashville. "It shows people like me that we're on the radar screen and they care about us. That makes a big difference."

Send the Boss a Card; Baseball Needs Him

BYLINE:  By SELENA ROBERTS

 BODY:
WHERE was Donald Fehr with the smelling salts, or Bud Selig with a palm-frond fan?
 How about a glass of water from Curt Schilling, or a cold towel from Rupert Murdoch? 
 The indebted ones should have been there on Saturday, clinging as snug as Sansabelts around George Steinbrenner's waist, when the Boss who drives baseball's economy, intrigue and competition wobbled before fainting at a memorial service for his longtime friend Otto Graham.
In an instant, there were frantic calls for help on cellphones, paramedics en route and mass concern as witnesses watched Steinbrenner turn two shades of Elmer's after he collapsed on the floor of a reception hall in Sarasota, Fla. 
"Everyone saw it was George, and panic set in," said one witness, Doug Fernandes, a columnist for The Sarasota Herald-Tribune, when reached by telephone yesterday. "For a couple of moments, I thought the worst."
Then, there was relief. Within minutes, color returned to the 73-year-old Steinbrenner's square jaw, his eyes opened and the Boss had the strength to move onto a gurney, witnesses said.
"It shook everybody up," the former Dolphin Earl Morrall said.
It also shook up the image of Steinbrenner as a man with the durable skin of a manhole cover. If he has ever had a cold, he has no doubt demanded that Kid Cashman waive it. Now it's as if the general has saddle sores or Darth Vader has a short in his light saber.
True, those were tears trickling down his cheek this past season, revealing that there is a metrosexual lurking beneath his turtleneck, but the Boss is viewed as the indomitable pinstriped engine that spits out managers and money, demands and Andy Pettitte.
On Saturday, proof of Steinbrenner's vulnerability was marked by a thud. It is still unclear what caused him to faint during a touching slide show in honor of Graham, but there are plenty of dime-store theories.
Was it the emotion of the moment or the Yankees' reported luxury-tax bill of $11.8 million; was it simple dehydration or the $48.8 million in revenue sharing he'll have to pay, according to USA Today; was it the stress of an off-season spent binge shopping and A-Rod watching or the drain of talking over his inner circle?
Whatever caused his swoon, indications are that George will be up and growling again in no time. "To be sure that it was nothing more than a fainting spell, he has had a very extensive cardiac and neurological work-up," Steinbrenner's physician, Andrew G. Boyer, said in a statement released yesterday. Instead of pulling back -- remember when he indicated a desire to relax a while ago? -- Steinbrenner will no doubt push forward with his plan to conquer the cheap knockoffs around him, whether it's Baltimore's Peter Angelos or Boston's John Henry.
Soon, he'll be ready to resume his absolutely necessary role as baseball's eccentric uncle. Loved or loathed, he has put a charge into baseball for 30 years.
Not that anyone had to hold a candle in front of Sarasota Memorial Hospital over the weekend, but if anyone in baseball has thought about sending a get-well card to the Boss, it would not be out of line.
Without a healthy George for three decades, superstars, has-beens and raw projects would not have had anyone to inflate their salaries to a point where the union can cry collusion when owners fall below the bar Steinbrenner sets. Sometimes, the Boss will even bid against himself to provide an economic boost for malcontents like Kenny Lofton.
So, feel better, Boss. Your loyal partner, D. Fehr.
Without a robust Steinbrenner on the prowl, the Red Sox would notbe as motivated to turn to a Luke Skywalker wannabe like Theo Epstein as a means of defeating the dark forces they despise. Recently, Schilling used Boston's desperation as leverage to land his wish list.
So, get well, George. Your happy nemesis, Curt.
Without a vital Boss at the helm of the Yankee dynasty, how would Murdoch's Fox TV have created a ratings point from a Marlins World Series if Florida hadn't had a foil like Steinbrenner? Now, more coupon-clipping teams than ever can live the same small-market dream with the revenue wealth Steinbrenner has to share.
So, take care, George. Your ego equal, Rupert.
Without a hearty Steinbrenner to create an off-season diversion, baseball would be mired in unsavory topics like drug testing, THG and home run asterisks. Instead, those annoying subjects were quickly pushed aside because of an American League East shopping spree inspired by the Yankees.
So, speedy recovery, George. Milwaukee's public enemy, Commissioner Bud Selig.
Truly, every baseball fan should join in, sign a card, send a letter or bake some cookies. Some might successfully argue that the Boss with the shopaholic tendencies has snuffed out baseball, but without Steinbrenner in the daily mix, who would give the sport life?
He is the necessary evil in the empire.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Unit Will Focus on Lawyers and Accountants 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service will announce this morning that it is going to focus on misconduct by lawyers and accountants who represent wealthy individuals and corporations. The I.R.S. commissioner, Mark W. Everson, said auditors would be instructed to develop cases that impose penalties on taxpayers. 
 The move is intended to shut down the lucrative trade in opinion letters, which taxpayers buy in the expectation that they can get penalties waived if their strategy is disallowed. 
 Mr. Everson said he wanted to weed out "attorneys and accountants who sacrifice their independence and integrity at the altar of higher fees." 
 Opinion letters, typically scores of pages long and freighted with caveats, sell for as much as $1 million each. Such letters typically assert that a particular tax strategy is "more likely than not" to survive an I.R.S. audit, but often they are based on unreasonable economic and legal assumptions that do not necessarily match the specific circumstances of the taxpayer who buys the letter.
 Under regulations to be issued this morning, such opinion letters would become worthless for deals made since last Jan. 1, as a defense against penalties, which can run as high as 75 percent of the taxes not paid. 
 Another move would require legal and accounting firms to police their partners through high-level oversight committees. Mr. Everson said that a breakdown in professional integrity at some firms was a core problem for tax law enforcement.
 This strategy is intended to counter the weakening of self-policing resulting from a shift in the legal form of most professional firms -- from partnerships to limited liability partnerships -- a change that has gone virtually unnoticed by Congress in its inquiries into the spread of tax cheating. 
 Under the old form, each partner was liable for all acts by all partners, a powerful incentive to enforce compliance with the law. Under the new form, the liability of each partner for misconduct by other partners is limited or even eliminated, provided that the partner remains unaware of the misconduct.
 To enforce the new oversight and other professional conduct rules, under what is known as Circular 230, Mr. Everson has nearly doubled the staff of the Office of Professional Responsibility to almost 40 people. That office disciplines tax professionals who represent clients before the I.R.S. and, Mr. Everson acknowledged, has historically focused on abuses by small-time tax preparers.
 More significantly, Mr. Everson said he has persuaded a lawyer known for his work in criminal tax law to lead the office.
 The appointment of the lawyer, Cono R. Namorato, a partner at the Caplin & Drysdale tax firm, will be announced this morning. Mr. Namorato rose from I.R.S. criminal investigator in New York in the 1960's to head the Justice Department's criminal tax enforcement unit before leaving for private practice in 1978. 
 "Cono is first-rate," said Sheldon Cohen, the tax commissioner during the Johnson administration and a Washington partner at Morgan Lewis & Bockius. "Appointing him tells me that Everson means serious business."
 Mr. Everson said, "We are trying to draw a line in the sand."
 "We need to have a complete attack on abuses of integrity," he said, and disciplining "fast and loose attorneys and accountants who are working to undermine the system at the high end" is central to that strategy.
 Making tax cheats feel economic pain is also central to the plan. "We are giving instruction to our agents," Mr. Everson said, "that we will no longer accept as mitigating penalties opinions from attorneys who are at once promoting a tax shelter and at the same time issuing a so-called independent analysis of substantially the same shelter for another taxpayer." 
 Abusive tax shelters have become more common in an era of steady cuts in funds for tax law enforcement. 
 With the number of auditors down by more than a fourth from the peak, to about 12,000, cheats have had an easier time avoiding detection. Rules ordered by Congress in 1998 have made audits slower and more cumbersome, forcing the I.R.S. into negotiating with some big taxpayers what issues will be examined and which ignored. 
 Even when the I.R.S. finds cheating, the odds are good that the taxes will go unpaid; among cheats using partnerships, for example, fewer than a fifth are made to pay, the I.R.S. has said, because Congress has not authorized enough money to seek collection against most cheats.
 Focusing on tax returns or penalties that will stick, even if challenged in court, would reduce complaints from taxpayers who say they were trying to obey the complex tax law and owe more only because of a misunderstanding rather than a calculated plan.
 Most significantly, however, would be the deterrent effect by decimating the market for abusive tax avoidance schemes by changing the risk-reward ratio. Currently, abusive tax shelters can be a good investment because even when a shelter is found and collection is enforced, the most a cheat stands to lose is taxes that should have paid anyway. If penalties are made to stick, then word could spread that the price of trying to cheat may not be worth the risk.

HEADLINE: MEDIA: The Year Ahead: Giving an Audience What It Wants, but Not Giving It Away -- Music; 
With CD Sales Slipping, The DVD Steps In

BYLINE:  By CHRIS NELSON

 BODY:
What music industry executives would love to see in the new year is a magic bullet to end the three-year sales slump that they say has mostly been caused by Internet music trading. 
 But since a miracle cure is about as likely as Eminem performing with the Boston Pops, executives at the music labels are aiming to make up lost ground in more modest ways, like promoting music video DVD's. 
 Sales for music video DVD's in 2003 jumped 102 percent over 2002 sales, to 17.2 million units, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Total sales are expected to climb still higher in the coming year. 
 "The entertainment dollars tend to be going more toward visual media," said Jordan Katz, senior vice president for sales at Arista Records. "With music it's a very potent combination." 
 The model for music DVD's is "The New Breed" by the rapper 50 Cent. It has sold 645,000 copies since April, making it the best-selling music DVD of the year. And because the release included a bonus audio CD with four songs, it was ranked No.2 at its debut on Billboard's Top 200 albums chart.
 Despite the spurt, sales of music DVD's still do not come close to sales of traditional CD's. "Get Rich or Die Tryin'," a CD by 50 Cent, has sold more than six million copies. And aside from "The New Breed," the only other DVD to sell more than half a million units this year was the "Led Zeppelin DVD," which has sold 525,000 since May.
 The industry is hardly settled on how best to entice customers with DVD's. Rather than issuing a stand-alone package, Tom Petty, like 50 Cent, has released a DVD set with bonus audio discs. Many more artists, from Metallica to Alicia Keys, have offered bonus DVD's with their traditional CD albums. 
 Even the packaging is still in flux. The hip-hop duo OutKast, for instance, issued their recent DVD collection, "The Videos," in both the jewel boxes used for CD's and the clamshell case used for movie DVD's.
 Label executives hope to find clues in these numbers on how to drive DVD sales in the new year. 
 "Because of the plethora of releases this year, there's certainly a lot of data which we're in the middle of combing over now to make some decisions about what we're going to be doing," Mr. Katz said. CHRIS NELSON

HEADLINE: Critique From 50's Wellesley Grads 

BYLINE:  By MARIAN BURROS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
The credits were still rolling for "Mona Lisa Smile," the new Mike Newell film set at Wellesley College in the mid-1950's, when Norma Solimene Raffaele, class of 1954, weighed in.
 "If I were 18 and I saw this movie I'd never want to go there," she said. Neither would most of us who had attended Wellesley during that decade. As we sat around after a recent screening of the movie in Washington, there was a lot of venting. We knew the movie was not a documentary, but was it really necessary to caricature the students as spoiled brats and the college as a smothering incubator? 
 "I think part of our reaction to the movie was sheer embarrassment," said Gene Billo Haddon, now retired from several careers. "Who would want to be associated with a college like that?"
We recognized the campus. We didn't recognize the students. Nor the faculty, particularly the art history instructor played by Julia Roberts. Fresh from the far more enlightened Berkeley, she has come to Wellesley to shake up the place by teaching modern art and encouraging young women to choose careers instead of marriage. 
"Modern art was not shocking at Wellesley," said Judith Jaffe Silber, who began graduate school in midlife and is now a consultant for social-work programs. How could it be when it had been taught there since the late 1920's? Nor do any of us remember faculty members encouraging us to choose a career over marriage (though several remember seductive male professors, like the professor of Italian in the movie). 
In the 50's most students married shortly after graduating. Mr. Newell got that part right. At the time some wit had translated the college motto "non ministrari sed ministrare" ("not to be ministered unto, but to minister to") to "not to be a minister, but to be a minister's wife." It stuck.
Others, like Ann Oppenheimer Hamilton, chose graduate school first. "The social aspects of marriage versus career, that conflict I thought they had down pat," said Ms. Hamilton, who later went to law school and is now retired from the World Bank. "But for some gratuitous reason they introduced all this political conservatism."
We raised eyebrows when Wellesley was described as the "most conservative college in the nation," a place populated by know-it-all East Coast snobs. Would such a right-wing bastion of the status quo have appointed a black sociology professor in the 1950's, as it did with William Cousins?
More eyebrows were raised when Wellesley was called "a finishing school disguised as a college." That piling on was reinforced by a scene in which a teacher of "poise and elocution" explained to students how to set and seat a table to further the careers of their future husbands. And the students were wearing little organza aprons.
How did we miss those classes?
And where were those rich, snobbish, know-it-all students who one-upped their professors the way the women in the movie offered Ms. Roberts's character brilliant analyses of the paintings shown in slides on the first day of class?
The most brazen thing we did was to knit in lecture halls. "It used to be the height of insolence in a lecture if a knitting needle dropped," said one member of our group, Sally Hawes Cassidy, who works for the Internal Revenue Service.
Yes, there were parietal rules that now seem quaint: When entertaining a gentleman in your room, the door had to be open and three feet had to be on the floor at all times. But there were no lights out at 8 p.m. We were playing bridge and talking about sex into the morning.
Nor did we wear girdles to class. No pearls and earrings, either. Mr. Newell might be surprised to know that many women wore jeans and sweatshirts. "We looked like hell," said Ms. Raffaele, who became a public relations executive in Massachusetts shortly after graduating. Girdles were for weekends,when we got dressed up for dates.
David Ansen's review of "Mona Lisa Smile" in Newsweek spoke for all of us. "The movie's cartoon notions of the 50's and snooty Easterners say more about Hollywood cluelessness than about the period the film condescends to," he wrote.
The 50's offered the first glimmers of the revolution that was to come. And now, after several decades of women's choosing careers, marriage and children simultaneously, some young women are choosing not to have it all, putting careers on hold to have children. 
"There is no good way for women to have the right balance," Ms. Hamilton said. "There is no happy solution until men stay home or partly stay home. The relationship has to change. You can't win."

HEADLINE: Incoherent on Immigrants 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Middlemen in the Low-Wage Economy" (Week in Review, Dec. 28) raises the question of the degree to which companies should be accountable for their contractors' practices in hiring illegal immigrants. 
 I live in the suburbs of New York, where many communities provide gathering points for local contractors to hire day workers, most of whom, I suspect, are illegal immigrants. These "hiring halls" keep the labor pool out of the weather and the public eye; some even provide televisions and other recreational facilities. 
 How can we tolerate a situation in which the federal government is selectively prosecuting companies for hiring illegal immigrants while local communities are providing facilities to encourage such hiring? We need a cohesive national strategy on our illegal immigrant problem if we are ever to regain control of our borders.

HEADLINE: Spare the Rod, Save the Nation 

BYLINE:  By Carl E. Mundy III; Carl E. Mundy III, a Marine lieutenant colonel, is a fellow at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It was April 19 and the Marine battalion I was commanding in Iraq was leaving Samarra to begin a long trip south through Baghdad along highways we had fought on just a few weeks earlier. Major combat operations were coming to a close, and we were headed to the small south-central city of Diwaniyah to undertake the uncertain business of post-conflict operations. 
 For most of us Diwaniyah was personal. The site of skirmishes we had with fedayeen, Iraqi Army Special Forces and local militias, the city represented my battalion's "blooding" -- the scene of our first important combat action and casualties. By returning, we had the chance to root out remaining resistance and help restore a community wrecked by war. 
 As marines only a few days out of intense combat, it was natural for us to want to undertake the "rooting out" part first -- going after the resistance with a vengeance. Fortunately, our division commander, Maj. Gen. Jim Mattis, had a different approach. He shifted our focus from conventional combat toward winning over the people. In so doing, his thinking went, we could isolate the Baathist insurgents and criminal elements and make them easier to detect and eliminate. 
His guiding principle was "do no harm." So he detached our M-1 tanks and armored personnel carriers and, together with artillery, returned them to Kuwait. Armored vehicles are threatening by their very presence -- not to mention being magnets for rocket-propelled grenades. General Mattis believed that any engagement with remaining insurgents could be handled by dismounted infantry.
We also tried to be aware of Iraqi sensitivities. We "dressed down" during foot patrols, removing body armor and helmets. Arabs consider sunglasses distasteful, so we took off our wraparound Oakleys when talking to Iraqis. And with varying degrees of success, we directed young marines not to look at Iraqi women and teenage girls.
Most of our efforts were straightforward. We cleaned, painted and picked up trash at schools. Wherever we went, we used "wave tactics" -- waving at locals, especially children, and smiling at pedestrians. After capturing $5 million during a raid on suspected Baathists, we donated a large sum to a leading mullah for the needy who were not directly eligible for reconstruction money. It seemed the right thing to do and not "buying the peace." And it worked. The mullah became a grateful and helpful friend of the Marines.
In our efforts to overcome rampant crime and pursue remaining Baathists, we flooded neighborhoods with foot patrols, talked with townsfolk to gain information and laid ambushes in problem areas. We avoided rotating companies so that each company could develop a relationship with a specific village. 
When out-of-work Iraqi soldiers began staging demonstrations, we invited their leaders into our compound and listened to their grievances while offering them cold sodas. By treating them as equals, we eased frustrations and countered a descent toward armed confrontation.
None of these techniques were particularly novel to the Marines. And they were practiced by our battalions across south-central Iraq. To be sure, we all benefited from the Shiite majority in the region, most of whom were joyous at the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But it is undeniably significant that in the succeeding five months of post-conflict presence, not a single marine was killed because of hostile action.
I turned over the Third Battalion, Fifth Marine Regiment last summer and headed back to the United States for a new assignment. When my fellow marines return to Iraq in March, they will pick up where our battalion left off and work once again to win over Iraqi hearts and minds. This philosophy will stand in contrast to the new get-tough strategy adopted by American forces in the Sunni Triangle. That area, north and west of Baghdad, is the scene of the most intense violence against Army soldiers, a dynamic much more volatile than the one we faced in south-central Iraq.
Yet it would be a mistake to think that the lessons we learned can't be applied to cities like Tikrit and villages like Abu Hishma. In the spirit of reconciliation, this may be a good time to hold back the iron hammer and extend our velvet glove.
Devising effective counterinsurgency techniques is a challenge. And based on my own experience -- not necessarily the official Marine Corps position -- I do believe additional considerations for fighting the insurgency may be needed. Certainly, United States forces need to press their attacks against regime loyalists and foreign fighters. 
But for every reported military success there are also reports of Sunni Iraqis who are angered by tactics like knocking down doors of houses and shops, demolishing buildings, flattening fruit groves, firing artillery in civilian neighborhoods and isolating large segments of the population with barbed wire fences. Whatever the short-term tactical success of these techniques, they present several problems in America's long-term effort to win support of the Iraqi people.
First, humiliating the Sunni population will set back efforts to establish a rapport with citizens and bring about civil reforms. Resentment of the United States military presence seems to be on the rise. The continued use of such hard-nosed tactics only risks further erosion of trust.
Second, the "get tough" approach resembles tactics used by Israelis in the occupied territories. Talk of Israelis providing "lessons learned" to American forces plays right into the hands of those spreading fatuous propaganda about United States-Israeli desires to dominate Arab lands. Continued use of this approach is sure to reinforce a negative image in the Muslim world that the United States clearly needs to avoid.
With Saddam Hussein out of the picture and regime change deemed complete, Iraqis may also more fervently question why United States soldiers remain in their country. Heavily armed raids and air strikes used to "send a message" instead promise to further alienate the Sunnis, especially when they result in so-called collateral damage. To a lesser extent, but no less important, the hard-nosed style could also diminish the American public's enthusiasm for the war. The danger of any counterinsurgency operation is that it will create sympathy for the insurgents -- or worse, push fence-sitters to the wrong side of the fence.
In light of this, the military should rethink its new strategy. I am not arguing for a "kinder, gentler" solution. I am, though, calling for a return to traditional, integrated methods aimed at maintaining security while genuinely intensifying efforts to improve Iraqis' quality of life. In addition to marines in south-central Iraq, British soldiers around Basra and 101st Airborne Division soldiers in northern Iraq applied this approach with great success. Now is the time to dangle more of the carrot and apply less of the stick in the Sunni region as well. 
As a general rule, counterinsurgency operations call for patience and restraint. We need to abandon techniques like surrounding villages with barbed wire and rounding up relatives of guerrillas. In the short term, the challenge will be accepting the increased risk of violence against American soldiers. In the long term, however, the risk will decrease as conditions improve and the insurgent leadership has less with which to incite the Sunni population. We must outlast the insurgents one day, one week, one month at a time. 
Throughout Iraq, theUnited States needs to place a premium on respecting local customs, building relationships among sheiks and mullahs, pouring money into the economy and finding ways to take disgruntled former Iraqi soldiers off the streets. Servicemen and women can be key symbols of American strength and resolve, as well as ambassadors of American goodwill and compassion.
The moment has arrived for United States forces to reconsider the tactical ways and means they are using to remake Iraq. There will be no quick fixes, but by shifting to more of a velvet glove approach, the long hard slog may be a lot less painful.

HEADLINE: One Mad Cow Sets Off a Stampede 

BYLINE:  By Scott C. Ratzan; Scott C. Ratzan, a doctor, is editor of "The Mad Cow Crisis: Health and the Public Good."

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The discovery of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, in a cow in Washington State should concern us all. Yet this is less because of any risk of contracting the disease through eating beef and more because a knee-jerk reaction by the public, news media and policy makers could threaten our ability to make a reasoned and effective response to the threat.
 So far, we are following the script from 1996, when Britain issued a warning about a rise in a variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, a brain-wasting syndrome in humans that resembles mad cow disease. The experts envisioned all sorts of potential consequences. Some warned of an outbreak that would kill millions, becoming the AIDS crisis that Britain never had. The European Union and countries around the world banned British beef. 
 Few people questioned the assertion that there was a link between eating meat and Creutzfeldt-Jakob in humans. But the dire predictions never came to pass: only about 20 Britons a year have died of the variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob since that scare. There were other victims though: British beef farmers lost perhaps $10 billion in sales, and the British public's trust in government and the press took a severe blow. 
Yet the old misperceptions are again at center stage. Japan and South Korea have blocked American beef imports, cattle prices are tumbling on North American exchanges, and Canada and the United States are in a diplomatic tangle over who is to "blame" for the Washington cow. 
Before we all go order that turkey burger, we should consider a few facts. First, there is no direct evidence that Creutzfeldt-Jakob comes from the ingestion of contaminated beef, or that the syndrome deserves its reputation as the "human form" of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. 
Inaddition, the mad cow prion, the misfolded protein that is thought to cause the disease in cows, has never been found in solid muscle meat like the roasts, steaks and other cuts Americans are likely to eat over the holidays. The parts that are known to get infected -- the brain, spinal cord and parts of the intestine -- are generally not used in American cooking (And there is a minority of scientists who believe the prion is not the carrier of the disease.)
Equally important, most decisions on banning imports or changing feedstocks in the British scare were made not by scientists but by politicians and business people and were based on political and economic considerations rather than actual risk to human health. History is no guide here. 
What is at stake here goes well beyond infected beef: it involves questions of how we should respond to other outbreaks like Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the flu epidemic. Competing messages by the news media, politicians, watchdog groups and medical officials continue to make the public uneasy.
Yes, the immediate focus must be to save lives. But as a former public-health researcher (I am now a vice president in governmental affairs in Europe for Johnson & Johnson, work that has no relation to the mad cow issue), I feel we should also look at each new outbreak as an opportunity to enhance public health. For example, the deadly flu epidemic may in the end improve public hygiene if we can stress the need for hand washing, explain to the public the infectious nature of disease, and reinforce the value of epidemiologic measures. 
Perhaps the mad cow discovery will lead to good policy decisions based on sound science. But for now, that science does not exist -- we simply do not know exactly what we are dealing with. Rushing ahead with bans and slapdash agricultural measures might divert even more attention from the real threats to our health and well-being.

HEADLINE: Bronx Man Is Rescued From His Own Paper Prison 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN; Oren Yaniv and Michelle O'Donnell contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A Bronx man trapped for two days under an avalanche of newspapers, magazines and books was rescued by firefighters and neighbors yesterday in a small urban drama that recalled the macabre 1947 tale of the Collyer brothers.
 The victim, Patrice Moore, 43, of 1991 Morris Avenue, near Tremont Avenue, was found shortly after 1 p.m. in a 10-by-10-foot room crammed with paper and other detritus that completely filled it, except for a small corner where he slept, neighbors and city officials said. 
 A reclusive man who lived alone and had been saving magazines, newspapers, books, catalogs and junk mail for a decade -- and had apparently thrown none of it out -- Mr. Moore was buried standing up under the collapse on Saturday, according to neighbors, who heard him moaning and mumbling through the door, which had been blocked by all the paper. 
The landlord broke in with a crowbar and neighbors began digging into the entombing piles of publications, communications and advertisements. Calls to the city brought the police, three companies of firefighters, health and buildings officials, and officials from the Office of Emergency Management.
It took more than an hour to extricate Mr. Moore -- 50 garbage bags of his paper had to be hauled out just to reach him -- and he was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital with leg injuries, apparently the result of the weight that fell on him and the fluid that accumulated in his legs during his captivity. He was reported in stable condition last night, a hospital spokesman said.
Deon Baitmon, 35, a next-door neighbor who was one of a few people who knew Mr. Moore had been living in a room filled with paper, said she had tried to persuade him to get rid of some of it, without success. "I told him, 'You've got to be able to get in and out,' " she said, "but he didn't really want to hear about that."
While it was hardly comparable, the episode echoed the strange cautionary tale of Langley and Homer Collyer, who lived for years barricaded in a 12-room mansion at Fifth Avenue and 128th Street in East Harlem with their legendary collection of stuff -- tons of newspapers, magazines and books; 14 grand pianos, chandeliers, mirrors, bottles, rotting groceries and an automobile chassis.
On March 21, 1947, alerted by a mysterious phone call, the police broke in and found the body of Homer, who had been blind and bedridden. After lengthy searching, they found Langley's body under piles of junk. He had apparently died of a heart attack weeks earlier after triggering one of many booby traps set for burglars, and Homer had died of starvation several days later.
While people who hoard obsessively are generally regarded as troubled, there is no agreement among experts on the causes of the phenomenon, which dates back thousands of years. Cases are uncovered from time to time, often after the death of a recluse discloses hidden wealth or troves of possessions behind an otherwise unremarkable facade.
After getting a glimpse into Mr. Moore's room yesterday, some neighbors recalled that almost every day for the past decade he had received a heavy load of mail: newspapers, magazines, books that he ordered with a variety of names and never paid for, and tons of unsolicited advertising and other mail.
A cursory examination of the stacks turned up numerous copies of Sports Illustrated, Nascar racing publications, Vibe, Scuba Diving, Essence, skiing magazines, Savoy, Sound and Vision, Fitness magazine and copies of the Harvard Business Review.
"He got everything," said John Thomas, a neighbor. "You name it -- he got it -- except Playboy."
Bennie Jones, 62, the owner of the three-story brownstone, said: "I knew he was getting a whole lot of magazines, but I had no idea there were so many inside. I can't see how he had any space to move in there. It's crazy. He had the place stacked up with magazines, and they fell on him."
Mr. Moore, who was unemployed and paid his $250-a-month rent from the public assistance moneyhe received, lived the quiet life of a hermit, his neighbors said, rarely going out and never allowing visitors into his windowless room on the parlor floor, halfway down a dark, narrow corridor.
"His room is his private room," Ms. Baitmon said. He opened the door to get his mail, which was addressed to people named Joe Smith, Pamela Cruise and other fictitious names, but bore his apartment number, 1-B. Occasionally, she said, she heard his radio or his voice, singing or mumbling to himself.
Over the weekend, she heard his voice from time to time, but there were no cries for help, nothing very coherent. "He was just talking through the door a bit," she said, and noted that she had not been alarmed.
The discovery of Mr. Moore's plight was almost an accident. It happened that he had asked his landlord last week for a small loan, and Mr. Jones went to his door with a couple of dollars yesterday. He knocked on Mr. Moore's door. There was no answer at first, but then he heard a voice inside. It sounded strange.
It occurred to Mr. Jones that Mr. Moore might need help. The door was locked, but Mr. Jones got a crowbar and pried it open. Stacks of magazines and books had fallen against the door, and he had to get a couple of neighbors to force it open.
They were astonished by what they found inside. The room was stuffed from wall to wall and floor to ceiling with stacks of paper. They also heard moaning from a corner, behind the stacks. "He was trapped in a little corner," said Mr. Thomas. "We had to take books out just to get to him."
Mr. Jones called 911, and by the time the firefighters of Engine Company 42 arrived, the neighbors had hauled away enough material to create a path and to unpaper Mr. Moore nearly down to his waist. Another obstacle remained. A bookcase, apparently the only piece of furniture in the room, had also fallen, wedging Mr. Moore tightly in an almost upright position.
The firefighters raised the bookcase, hauled away more loads of paper and eventually freed Mr. Moore, who was carried out on a stretcher.
"He couldn't say much," Mr. Thomas recalled. "He was in pain."
Even as Mr. Moore driven away, the neighbors said, a postman was arriving with another delivery of newspapers, magazines and junk mail for him. "He never threw anything away," Mr. Thomas said.

HEADLINE: The Unkept Promise 

 BODY:
There is a deceiving sense of timelessness to the stillness of rural life. The jungles of Mindanao offer few clues as to whether it's the early 20th century, or the early 21st. Nor do the highlands of Guatemala, the Mekong Delta in Vietnam or the cotton-rich plains of the Sahel in West Africa. But these disparate regions are very much of the present, stitched into the quilt of global commerce. World trade links us to them, as surely as it links London, Tokyo and New York.
 In an effort to understand that relationship, we visited some of the poorest nations in the world in the last six months. We listened to 12-year-old Arnel Mamac's parents on Mindanao, the Philippine island besieged by an Islamist terrorist group, tearfully say they often don't let him walk to school because they fear he may not have the energy to make it on an empty stomach. In a cotton-growing village in Burkina Faso we saw a school with two rooms, but because of a lack of funds, only one classroom was finished. Most unsettling, to an American, is the realization that our nation's agricultural policies -- its protectionist trade barriers and the billions in subsidies doled out to its own farmers -- contribute mightily to the hardships felt by poor farmers in the developing world. 
 The club of rich nations that wrote the rules of global trade has been aggressive in dismantling barriers when it comes to industrial goods and services, in which they hold a comparative advantage. But they refuse to do the same when it comes to agriculture. Politically powerful farm lobbies in Japan, Europe and the United States are not willing to face global competition on fair terms. So agriculture remains the hypocritical asterisk to our fervent free-trade and free-enterprise creed.
It's bad enough that a country like Japan, which became wildly prosperous thanks to the willingness of the outside world to buy its exports, maintains 500 percent tariffs on imported rice. Or that the American Congress would overrule science to decree that catfish from Vietnam, which found popularity among American consumers, are not catfish after all and cannot be marketed as such.
Worse, the developed world funnels nearly $1 billion a day in subsidies to its own farmers, encouraging overproduction, which drives down commodity prices. Poor nations' farmers find they cannot compete with subsidized products, even within their own countries. In recent years, American farmers have been able to dump cotton, wheat, rice, corn and other products on world markets at prices that do not begin to cover their cost of production, all courtesy of the taxpayers.
The rigged trade game is not only harvesting poverty around the world, but plenty of resentment as well. In the Philippines, a former American colony, our agricultural trade policy is seen as a plot to perpetuate imperialism. In Vietnam, a nation that was able to start reducing rural poverty only when it deviated from its Marxist orthodoxy and allowed entrepreneurs to have access to global markets, an exasperated seafood exporter told us, "We are made to wonder if you wish us ill as much in the present as you did in the past."
In Burkina Faso, we heard a cotton farmer tell colleagues that America's bizarre cotton program could be explained only by the fact that President Bush is a cotton farmer. He was wrong. It is some leading members of Congress responsible for the $180 billion 2002 farm bill who are cotton farmers, or who blindly follow the dictates of the so-called King Cotton lobby. 
The idea that our agricultural protectionism harms poor nations is hardly a fanciful one held only by aggrieved third world farmers. Just about any multilateral economic or development agency you can think of has issued reports railing against rich nations' farm subsidies. The World Bank estimates that an end to trade-distorting farm subsidies and tariffs could expand global wealth by as much as a half-trillion dollars and lift 150 million people out of poverty by 2015.
The urgent need to address globalization's imbalances, and restore the credibility of the free-trade system, has never been as apparent as it was in the raw weeks and months immediately following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. That November, at Doha, Qatar, the members of the World Trade Organization committed themselves to a new round of trade talks focused on the elimination of the farm subsidies that are so harmful to the developing world.
The year 2003 was to be crucial in this endeavor. A deadline of last March was set for the 146 W.T.O. members to agree on a framework to proceed on the subsidy question, with substantive agreements expected by a September meeting in Cancun, Mexico. Neither happened.
The March deadline came and went with noaccord. Even more disappointing, on the eve of the Cancun gathering, American negotiators switched sides. Despite Congressional support for gargantuan agricultural subsidies, Robert Zoellick, the United States trade representative, had taken an aggressive position on the need for reform. But suddenly, Mr. Zoellick and his team joined hands with the more recalcitrant Europeans against much of the rest of the world. 
There was a time when the European Union and the United States could jointly dictate terms to the rest of the World Trade Organization, but they cannot any more. Washington's betrayal of its free-trading principles outraged not only the poorest countries, but also some food-exporting allies like Australia. The developing world lashed back. At Cancun, Brazil, India and China created a formidable bloc of 22 nations that rightly opposed proceeding on anything else until some of the more outrageous farm subsidies had been addressed.
Hence the current stalemate. Negotiations meant to inject fairness into global trade are on life-support, thanks mainly to the appalling absence of American leadership. The Bush administration could have joined forces with the likes of Australia and Brazil at Cancun. Our trade representatives could have worked to overcome both the narrowest interests of the American farm lobby and the developing world's own self-defeating protectionism. Instead, the United States meekly aligned itself with a group of countries scared of fair competition. 
For all the hand-wringing about a trans-Atlantic rift over Iraq this past year, President Bush stood shoulder to shoulder with Jacques Chirac of France on a matter that is far more pressing to the billion or so people on earth trying to get by on $1 a day. Together, they formed a veritable coalition of the unwilling. Despite their post-9/11 promises, the United States and the European Union defiantly refused to give up their economic weapons of mass destruction: their trade-distorting farm subsidies.
More rational agricultural trade policies would actually be a boon to many American farmers because their high-tech equipment and large, fertile acreage would make them winners in a more open competition. But there would be losers both here and abroad, and we visited some of them as well, to understand all sides of the story. Ronnie Hopper in Texas, Hubert Duez in France and Koushi Seiwa in northern Japan are all smart, gracious, hard-working farmers. But as appealing as they are as individuals, they have been given an unfair advantage by nostalgia-driven policies that are indefensible on economic, and even moral, grounds.
In a rational global marketplace that conformed to our stated values and commitments to the rest of the world, consumers would forgo Mr. Hopper's cotton, Mr. Seiwa's rice and Mr. Duez's sugar, and buy from others who are now being shut out of the global economy.
This does not mean that rich nations ought to halt their rural development programs. But farmers must be weaned from payments that merely reward them for overproducing crops on which they would otherwise lose money. Such madness is no longer sustainable. Besides proving so costly for taxpayers and for the developing world, there is too glaring a gap separating American and European agricultural policies from the entire logic of the global trade system. Now the developing world is demanding consistency, and a fairer playing field.
The Bush administration, which has been so proudly proactive in Iraq, could jump-start reform with a sweeping unilateral gesture. The ideal starting point would be the dismantling of the most wrongheaded market distortions, our astronomical cotton subsidies and our sugar quota system, which props up domestic sugar prices by restricting imports. But instead of moving in that direction, the president, ostensibly a free-trading Republican, signed the most trade-distorting farm bill in history.
The dutiful Mr. Zoellick may travel the world saying all the right things, but his boss does not seem to appreciate the degree to which trade is integral to broader economic and foreign policy, and to the projection of American power around the globe. Does President Bush sit down with Mr. Zoellick, Condoleezza Rice and his top cabinet officials for far-ranging discussions on farm subsidies and the Doha round of trade negotiations? He should.
Next year's election offers little hope on this score. Democratic lawmakers were among the strongest supporters of the 2002 farm bill, and most of the candidates vying for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination seem to have turned against the Clinton administration's belief that freer trade is a win-win proposition for rich and poor nations alike.
Trade frictions may grow worse, therefore, before we stop harvesting poverty around the world with our farm programs. It could take a threatened collapse of the global rules-based trading system for the political balance of power from Washington to Tokyo to shift decisively against the coddled farm lobbies. But until we start chiseling away at our farm subsidies, the promise of trade will remain a promise unkept for many of the world's poor.

HEADLINE: Our So-Called Boom 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It was a merry Christmas for Sharper Image and Neiman Marcus, which reported big sales increases over last year's holiday season. It was considerably less cheery at Wal-Mart and other low-priced chains. We don't know the final sales figures yet, but it's clear that high-end stores did very well, while stores catering to middle- and low-income families achieved only modest gains.
 Based on these reports, you may be tempted to speculate that the economic recovery is an exclusive party, and most people weren't invited. You'd be right. 
 Commerce Department figures reveal a startling disconnect between overall economic growth, which has been impressive since last spring, and the incomes of a great majority of Americans. In the third quarter of 2003, as everyone knows, real G.D.P. rose at an annual rate of 8.2 percent. But wage and salary income, adjusted for inflation, rose at an annual rate of only 0.8 percent. More recent data don't change the picture: in the six months that ended in November, income from wages rose only 0.65 percent after inflation.
Why aren't workers sharing in the so-called boom? Start with jobs.
Payroll employment began rising in August, but the pace of job growth remains modest, averaging less than 90,000 per month. That's well short of the 225,000 jobs added per month during the Clinton years; it's even below the roughly 150,000 jobs needed to keep up with a growing working-age population.
But if the number of jobs isn't rising much, aren't workers at least earning more? You may have thought so. After all, companies have been able to increase output without hiring more workers, thanks to the rapidly rising output per worker. (Yes, that's a tautology.) Historically, higher productivity has translated into rising wages. But not this time: thanks to a weak labor market, employers have felt no pressure to share productivity gains. Calculations by the Economic Policy Institute show real wages for most workers flat or falling even as the economy expands.
An aside: how weak is the labor market? The measured unemployment rate of 5.9 percent isn't that high by historical standards, but there's something funny about that number. An unusually large number of people have given up looking for work, so they are no longer counted as unemployed, and many of those who say they have jobs seem to be only marginally employed. Such measures as the length of time it takes laid-off workers to get new jobs continue to indicate the worst job market in 20 years.
So if jobs are scarce and wages are flat, who's benefiting from the economy's expansion? The direct gains are going largely to corporate profits, which rose at an annual rate of more than 40 percent in the third quarter. Indirectly, that means that gains are going to stockholders, who are the ultimate owners of corporate profits. (That is, if the gains don't go to self-dealing executives, but let's save that topic for another day.)
Well, so what? Aren't we well on our way toward becoming what the administration and its reliable defenders call an "ownership society," in which everyone shares in stock market gains? Um, no. It's true that slightly more than half of American families participate in the stock market, either directly or through investment accounts. But most families own at most a few thousand dollars' worth of stocks.
A good indicator of the share of increased profits that goes to different income groups is the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of the share of the corporate profits tax that falls, indirectly, on those groups. According to the most recent estimate, only 8 percent of corporate taxes were paid by the poorest 60 percent of families, while 67 percent were paid by the richest 5 percent, and 49 percent by the richest 1 percent. ("Class warfare!" the right shouts.) So a recovery that boosts profits but not wages delivers the bulk of its benefits to a small, affluent minority.
The bottom line, then, is that for most Americans, current economic growth is a form of reality TV, something interesting that is, however, happening to other people. This may change if serious job creation ever kicks in, but it hasn't so far.
The big question is whether a recovery that does so little for most Americans can really be sustained. Can an economy thrive on sales of luxury goods alone? We may soon find out.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Art Exhibits Help Make Time Fly Between Flights

BYLINE:  By SHARON MCDONNELL

 BODY:
Too busy with business meetings to visit the local art museums while on the road? Not to worry. There is an ever-increasing likelihood you can make up for your cultural negligence at the airport.
 At San Francisco International Airport, for example, you will find exhibits of Haitian voodoo art through the end of January and displays of Tiffany glassware and African-American quilts through the end of February. Voodoo-temple tapestries made of thousands of sequins, plus placards on the history of the African religion and its major spirits, are in a Terminal 2 corridor. 
 The 100 Art Nouveau objects, from Tiffany lamps to vases, are in the International Terminal, as are 18 quilts stitched by three generations of a family originally from Mississippi. 
San Francisco International has had rotating shows, ranging from Balinese masks to aboriginal shields, since 1980, and in 1999 it became the nation's first airport to become an accredited member of the American Association of Museums.
"We have been very much in the vanguard in trying to humanize these large public spaces," said Blake Summers, director and chief curator of the San Francisco Airport Museums.
San Francisco's airport also boasts the Louis A. Turpen Aviation Museum, a 6,000-book aviation history library, a permanent collection of 17 contemporary artworks from large installation art to small pieces, interactive exhibits from the city's Exploratorium science museum and the Steinhart Aquarium. 
Viewing art at the airport may not replace a visit to a gallery or museum anytime soon, but there are some advantages.
The exhibits are free, open 24 hours a day and can be a welcome diversion for the harried business traveler, who may be surprised to find so much Pacific Northwest First Nations art at Vancouver International Airport, or steel palm trees with synthetic bark at Los Angeles International Airport, courtesy of NatureMaker, a designer.
Airports are putting on the exhibits both to entertain travelers and showcase local artists. Generally, they buy or borrow the works from local museums or private collectors, and often they work with a local art commission and get financing from the local government. 
One of the oldest art displays at an American airport is at Albuquerque International Sunport, which in the early 1940's hung 10 paintings by a Native American artist from the Taos Pueblo.
Today, the permanent collection of Albuquerque's airport features 112 artworks from more than 80 New Mexico artists. The most valuable, a 17-foot sculpture of a winged Native American man seizing an eagle, "Dream of Flight," by the Santa Fe artist Lincoln Fox, stands incongruously in front of a Baskin Robbins ice cream shop between the A and B concourses.
Also on view are painted wood altars in Spanish Colonial style known as retablos, a color lithograph of a woman with a painted clay pot by the Native American artist R.C. Gorman, oil paintings of desert landscapes and sunsets, and a 1914 "Curtiss pusher" -- an exhibit plane made from wood, bamboo, metal and fabric.
"You come here and you know you're in New Mexico, seeing the design and artwork with influences of our three cultures -- Hispanic, Native American and Anglo," said Regina Chavez, the arts program manager in the city of Albuquerque's Aviation Department.
A local ordinance stipulates that 1 percent of all money raised by the airport in bond offerings must be used to acquire public art for its collection, appraised at more than $1 million.
Art can turn up in the most surprising places, like the tiny Joao Paulo II Airport in Ponta Delgada, a city of 60,000, in the Portuguese Azores in the Atlantic. Forty junglelike painted panels that depict the flowers, volcanoes and fields of the Azores as well as farming, fishing and religious scenes were installed last year, joining the 60 panels put up in 2000 to illustrate the history of aviation. In addition, a mural of handpainted ceramic tiles based on a 16th-century map greets travelers in the arrivals area. 
As almost anywhere else, art at airports is no stranger to controversy.
In February 2002, Stewart International Airport in New Windsor, N.Y., ordered a local artist to withdraw her pastel of a nursing mother two days after it was exhibited because some passengers at the Hudson Valley airport complained.
A few days later, the artist, Shawn Dell Joyce, and a group of mothers with strollers, some nursing their babies, demonstrated for two hours in front of the airport in freezing cold to protest the removal.
A more inspiring story unfolded in Cincinnati, which went to extraordinary lengths to salvage 14 Art Deco-style mosaic murals of American workers that were created in the 1930's by the Munich-born design pioneer Winold Reiss.
The 20-foot-square glass mosaics of local settings, like a Procter & Gamble soap factory and a meat-packing plant, first graced the city's Union Terminal Railway Station, where they had been pressed into wet plaster during construction.
But when demolition plans were announced in 1972, a group raised $400,000 to save them, and the murals, each weighing eight tons, were moved to the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, requiring the removal of telephone wires and overhanging signs along the 15-mile route.
The Kenton County Airport Board disbursed $136,000 to install and restore them, and Delta Air Lines spent $1 million to move five of them to its new terminal in 1993.
Joseph Feierstag, the spokesman for the airport, says the murals are priceless. (Mr. Reiss also designed interiors for New York's Rumpelmayer's ice cream parlor and the Longchamps restaurant chain.)
Tampa International Airport also went to great lengths to rescue Depression-era artwork, in its case seven murals created by George Snow Hill, a prolific artist in the New Deal's program for unemployed artists.
The murals, which chronicle the history of flight, were rolled up and stashed in a boiler room in 1971, when the new terminal was built, and languished there, forgotten, until the mid-1980's, when they were rediscovered. (Two other Hill murals, one depicting the Wright Brothers' flight and the other the world's first scheduled airline flight, remained on display in those years in the airport's executive suite.) 
They were restored and incorporated into the design of the Airside E Terminal, adding new Art Deco-style ceramic tile. 
The Kennedy International Airport in New York also has some impressive artwork, in Terminal 4, which opened in 2001: the "Flight" mobile created by Alexander Calder in 1957 for the old International Arrivals Building; three contemporary pieces, including hologramlike screens of suitcase contents illustrating different personalities in concourse corridors; and a replica of a ceramic mural designed for the original Newark Airport terminal in the 1930's -- all acquired for over $1 million in private money.
In mid-November, Terminal 4 started its International Art Gallery, and fourth graders at Public School 63 in Ozone Park, Queens, created murals and mosaics for its first show.
Will airports be the next hip destination for art-loving hordes? Probably not.
"People are not going to the airport to see an exhibition, so we have to attract the attention of this audience as they walk by," Mr. Summers said. "We capture a much broader range of people than any museum."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
S.& P. 500 Sets a Record, Or Then Again Maybe Not

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit a record high yesterday. At least it did if all 500 stocks in the index are treated as equal.
 That is not, however, the normal way to calculate the index. Measured in the conventional way, in which the 500 stocks are weighted by their market value, the index is 27.4 percent below the peak it reached on March 24, 2000. 
 But S.&P. also measures the index in an alternative way, in which each of the 500 stocks is treated the same. It thus captures the performance that would be expected by investors who put an equal amount of money into each of the 500 stocks and then frequently adjusted their portfolios to keep an equal amount in each stock.
Measured in that way, the index peaked not in March 2000 -- when the stock market bubble is generally viewed as having burst -- but on May 21, 2001, as the recession was beginning to take a toll on smaller companies that had not soared in the bubble but had held their own after the big companies and the big technology stocks began to falter.
From May 21, 2001, until the stock market hit bottom on Oct. 9, 2002, the S.&P. 500 fell about 40 percent, measured in either way. But since then, the recovery has generally been greater among smaller stocks, whether in or out of the S.&P. 500. The unweighted S.&P. 500 is now 68.6 percent above its low, while the S.&P. 500, measured in the conventional way, is up 42.8 percent.
Yesterday, the S.&P. 500 measured in the normal way rose 13.59 points, or 1.24 percent, to 1,109.48, leaving it far from the 2000 peak of 1,527.46. But the unweighted index gained 16.69 points, or 1.25 percent, to 1,351.02. That topped the previous record of 1,342.79.
How can the two measures be so different?
The main explanation is that while all stocks in the S.&P. 500 are large, the index is dominated by a handful of companies. General Electric, the company with the highest market capitalization in the country, carries more weight than the combination of the 100 smallest companies in the index, even though nearly all the companies in the index are large corporations.
"While the big issues, the ones everyone knows about, are doing well, they are not doing as well as the smaller cap issues," said Howard Silverblatt, market equity analyst at S.&P. 
The 10 largest stocks in the index -- G.E., Microsoft, Pfizer, Exxon Mobil, Citigroup, Wal-Mart, Intel, Cisco, American International Group and I.B.M. -- carry a combined weight of 23 percent. Four of those 10 -- G.E., Microsoft, Intel and Cisco -- remain at least 40 percent below where they were when the index peaked in 2000.
In the late 1990's, the S.&P.'s performance was greatly influenced by soaring prices in large stocks and particularly in technology stocks. The index as normally measured did better than its unweighted brother for six consecutive years, from 1994 through 1999.
But this will be the fourth consecutive year that the index did better on an unweighted basis. Measured that way, it rose 7.6 percent in 2000 while the capitalization-weighted index was falling 10.1 percent. 
So far this year, the S.&P. 500 is up 38.5 percent on an unweighted basis. Barring a collapse over the next two days, that will be the best year for the index since S.&P. began performing the alternative calculation in 1990, easily topping the 31.7 percent rise in 1991.
On a capitalization-weighted basis, the gain so far this year is 26.1 percent, an impressive move but on course to be only the fourth-best year over that span and far below the 31 percent rise in 1997. 
One way to look at the different performances is that the conventional way of measuring the S.&P. 500 involves allowing higher and higher proportions of an investment to accumulate in stocks that have done the best. If the same stocks keep outperforming, that strategy will be a good one.
But an equal-weightedinvestment would require constantly selling stocks that had done better than the index while buying stocks that had underperformed. Such transactions would be needed to keep the same proportion of a portfolio in each stock. Such an investor would be less vulnerable to a sharp fall in stocks that had been favorites for some time -- precisely what happened after the stock market peaked in 2000.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES; 
Euro and Pound Advance As Dollar's Drop Continues

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell to a new low against the euro and an 11-year low against the British pound yesterday, as weeks of pressure on the currency persisted in thin trading.
 The euro rose briefly to $1.2511 in European trading, breaking a previous record of $1.2473 from last week, before slipping back under the $1.25 mark. In late New York trading, the euro settled at $1.2489, up from $1.2429 late Friday. 
 The British pound reached $1.7770, an 11-year high, before easing off later in the day to $1.7730 in late New York trading, down from $1.7702 late Friday. The previous high, reached on Sept. 29, 1992, was $1.7895.
"The dollar's decline is just the continuation of an ongoing trend," said Michael Rosenberg, head of foreign exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York.
Even though there was not much news to distinguish Monday's session from earlier sessions, some analysts were surprised that the dollar did not show any bounce at the end of the year as they had expected.
"It suggests how endemically weak the dollar is," said David Gilmore, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn.
The euro, introduced on Jan. 1, 1999, has risen 19 percent against the dollar since the beginning of 2003, with the pace having stepped up sharply since the end of November.
While in recent weeks some had called the euro's brief rise above $1.25 mark an important breakthrough, traders on Monday played down the significance, particularly in light trading.
"Officials and markets are more concerned about the pace of the decline rather than the level of decline," Mr. Gilmore said. "The decline is still orderly and the dollar's current rate is sustainable."
So far, officials on both sides of the Atlantic have indicated they are willing to let the market set currency rates.
And a weak dollar actually can aid the United States economy by making American goods more competitive on price.
"A lower dollar is useful in enabling U.S. companies to become more export competitive," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman, international, at Goldman Sachs in New York. "It helps to encourage other countries to take more domestic stimulative measures to offset the negative impact of the rise of their currencies."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Nasdaq Tops 2,000; Other Major Gauges at 2003 Highs

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks climbed yesterday, extending solid gains for the month and pushing all three main market gauges to their highest closing levels of 2003, as investors bet on an upbeat start to the new year.
 Technology shares took the lead, pushing the Nasdaq composite index above the psychologically important 2,000 level to its highest finish in nearly two years. 
 "This is a seasonally strong time of the year," said Brian Pears, head of equity trading at Victory Capital Management. He said that portfolio managers wanted to show they were fully participating in the strong upward trend stocks had experienced going into the end of the year. 
Wall Street historically has a modest rally in the last five trading days of the year and the first two in January. The so-called Santa Claus rally has gained an average of 1.5 percent since 1950, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.
In addition, January is one of the strongest months of the year for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, averaging a 1.5 percent gain since 1950, according to the almanac.
Investors tend to put money to work ahead of such a period, when money often flows into the market through 401(k) and pension plans, said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of the United States equity group at Deutsche Bank Private Banking.
"People know that this time of the year is when you want to position your portfolios to take advantage of all the cash that typically comes in at the beginning of the year," Mr. Fitzpatrick said.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 125.33 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,450.00, its highest level since March 2002. The Standard & Poor's 500 advanced 13.59 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,109.48, its highest point since April 2002. The Nasdaq rose 33.34 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,006.48, its highest finish since January 2002.
So far this December, the Dow is up 6.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 is up 4.9 percent, and the Nasdaq is up 2.4 percent. Year-to-date, the Dow is up 25.3 percent, the S.&P. 500 is up 26.1 percent and the Nasdaq is up 50.2 percent, putting all three on track to post their first annual gains since 1999. 
Traders said investors were relieved that the weekend had passed peacefully in the United States after the Bush administration put the nation on high alert for terrorist attacks.
Both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq will be closed on Thursday for New Year's Day, and many investors will be off for the entire week.
The American depository receipts of Trinity Biotech surged $1.86, or 56 percent, to $5.14, and ranked among the most actively traded on the Nasdaq. The company said that it received United States regulatory approval to market its H.I.V. test in the United States.
Nanogen, which develops diagnostic instruments for genetic testing, jumped $1.55, or 20 percent, to $9.05, after Zacks Investment Research on Friday made upbeat comments on the market for molecular-testing products.
McDonald's advanced 51 cents, or 2 percent, to $24.60, and was among the most active on the New York Stock Exchange. J.P. Morgan raised its rating on McDonald's, a Dow component, to overweight from underweight.
Early last week, McDonald's and other restaurant stocks fell after the first case of mad cow disease was found in the United States.
Among other beef-related shares, Smithfield Foods, the nation's largest pork producer and a major beef processor, skidded 85 cents, or 4 percent, to $21.06.
Hormel Foods, the maker of Spam luncheon meat and Dinty Moore beef stew, slumped 58 cents, or 2 percent, to $25.57. Credit Suisse First Boston downgraded the two companies to neutral from outperform. 
Treasury prices sank yesterday as the market unwound some of the safe haven premium built up during last week's heightened terror alerts in the United States.
Gains in equities and a renewed slide in the dollar to record lows against the euro provided another excuse to cut prices in an otherwise featureless session, the first of only two full trading days this week.
By late in the day, the 10-year note fell 24/32, to a price of 100 1/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.25 percent from 4.15 percent on Friday. The 30-year Treasury bond declined 17/32, to 10425/32. Its yield climbed to 5.05 percent from 4.97 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.779	99.500	High Rate	0.885	0.995	Investment Rate	0.901	1.016	Low Rate	0.850	0.960	Median Rate	0.860	0.980	Total applied for	$37,183,261	$40,273,626	Accepted	$21,913,821	$20,660,061	Noncompetitive	$1,228,365	$932,998	

Both issues are dated Jan. 2, 2004. The three-month bills mature on April 1 and the six-month bills on July 1.

HEADLINE: Colleges Struggle to Help Black Men Stay Enrolled 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Watching Simon Jackson in class is like watching a man who is conflicted about being in college. For long stretches, he huddles silently in the back corner, his head sunk into his bulky jacket. But every so often he strides to the front of the room to chat with the professor or to write on the chalkboard, self-assured to the point of cockiness. 
 A 10th-grade dropout who earned a high school equivalency diploma, Mr. Jackson, 21, is now a freshman at Medgar Evers College in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, eager, he says, to get a college degree. 
 "I was in school trying to learn," he said. "I liked to learn. I still do. That's why I'm here now." 
As a black man, he is also a rare commodity that the college, part of the City University of New York, is eager to hold on to. The class Mr. Jackson was sitting in recently was a freshman orientation class created this year for men only, in hopes of keeping black male students on track.
Over the course of the semester, class discussions veered from little things, like ways to remember to bring books to school, to how the students felt when they could not get waited on in stores and how difficult it was to go anywhere, even to school, without money in their pockets. 
At Medgar Evers, where 97 percent of the male students are black, the number of male students has been disproportionately low for more than a decade. Right now, only 22 percent of the students are male. And the men are far less likely to graduate than the women. 
The discrepancies are not unique to Medgar Evers. Women outnumber men at most colleges, but the gap is especially large among black students. Nationally, barely a quarter of the 1.9 million black men between 18 and 24 -- prime college-going years -- were in college in 2000, according to the American Council on Education's most recent report on minorities in higher education. By comparison, 35 percent of black women in the same age group and 36 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds were enrolled in higher education.
And the graduation rate of black men is lower than that of any other group. Only 35 percent of the black men who entered N.C.A.A. Division I colleges in 1996, for example, graduated within six years, compared with 59 percent of the white men, 46 percent of the Hispanic men, 41 percent of the American Indian men and 45 percent of the black women who entered the same year. 
"It's the shame of American higher education," said Arthur E. Levine, the president of Teachers College at Columbia University.
Researchers say the obstacles keeping black men from earning college degrees include poor education before college, the low expectations that teachers and others have for them, a lack of black men as role models, their dropout rate from high school and their own low aspirations. 
While most of these problems are common to disadvantaged minority students regardless of sex, black men have the special burden of being pigeonholed early in a way that black female students are not. This was among the findings of the African-American Male Initiative, a program set up by the University System of Georgia to research and remove the obstacles to college enrollment and graduation for black men. The system has 17,000 black men among 250,000 students on its 34 campuses.
The downward spiral begins in Head Start classrooms, said Arlethia Perry-Johnson, the chairwoman of the initiative and an associate vice chancellor of the Georgia system. Some black male students are labeled developmentally delayed, funneled into special education and "never get mainstreamed," she said. Shoved off the college prep track, they begin a "cycle of being reprimanded, disciplined and ultimately suspended for negative behavior," she said, leading to expulsion, unemployment and even crime and imprisonment.
Solving the problem is beginning to get more attention at colleges. Nearly three dozen selective liberal arts colleges, including Amherst, Swarthmore and Wesleyan, have united to create a working group on minority achievement issues, including the underrepresentation of black and Latino men in colleges.
Recently, Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, D.C., sponsored a symposium on the absence of black men in higher education. Women outnumber men by about 2 to 1 at Howard.
This year, Medgar Evers, in addition to creating the all-male course for freshmen, founded a Male Development and Empowerment Center to do research on the problems black men have in college and offer seminars on topics like money management and relationships with women. 
"I decided I had to stop lamenting their plight and try to arrest the decline that is taking place, at least at our institution," said Edison O. Jackson, the president of the college. "What I'm hoping to do is to change the culture, change how we interact with black males. To the extent we can succeed, perhaps the model can be used by others." 
Dr. Jackson, who is no relation to Simon Jackson, decided to teach the all-male course himself. Last semester, the class ran three hours on Thursday evenings, after many of the students had already worked a full day. The students ranged from their late teens to their 30's. Many were immigrants from the Caribbean. Some had children -- at least one was a single father -- and they sometimes missed classes to take care of their youngsters.
Dr. Jackson or his assistant, Hakim Lucas, directed the class discussion. One evening, a student volunteered that he was troubled by his recent attempt to buy his brother a birthday present at Tiffany's. He said he had had trouble attracting a salesclerk's attention. 
"I'm seeing everyone else getting helped," he said, "and no one would help me. I feel like I was being judged."
Dr. Jackson, a short black man with a shaved head, told the class he knew what they were facing. Not long ago, when he had taken a guest to dinner at Tavern on the Green, he was led past a row of empty tables to one at the back of the room, jammed up against a Christmas tree. 
"I didn't get angry," he told the students. "I said: 'I'm sorry. This is not what I want.' It makes no sense to get nasty and ugly." His table was changed. 
He also told them about trips he had made to stores recently, dressed in jeans and sneakers, and being followed by security guards. 
"It is a challenge for us as black men," he said. "You can't fall prey to that. You can't overreact."
Social habits and camaraderie became the focus on another night when Peter Holoman, the director of the Male Development and Empowerment Center, who was visiting the class, observed that the men were scattered around the room as if a teacher had spread them out before a test. Mr. Holoman encouraged them to trade phone numbers and find ways to study together.
"With the sisters, if they don't get something in class, they turn to another student and say: 'Girl, I don't understand that. Give me your number,' " Mr. Holoman said later. "But the brothers are not doing it. They are silent. They don't want to show they are not getting it. It's a sense of machismo."
Mr. Holoman also shared his own bumpy personal journey of how he became homeless after too much drinking, hanging out and not taking life seriously. "The choices we make, the things we do, catch up with us," he said.
But having role models is not the same as taking hold of one's life. Dr. Jackson said that even black male students from middle-class, educated families have difficulty. 
One is Terrence Agard, 19, whose mother is a school principal and whose older brother is in medical school. "Our whole household environment was conducive to learning," he said. "We could talk about issues."
But high school was a struggle. He was dismissed from one for fighting. At another, he started hanging out with gang members.
"There was a lot of excessive aggression at the school and after school," he said. "Studying was not at all a priority. The priority was survival."
He dropped out at 16 and earned a high school equivalency diploma. He enrolled at Medgar Evers but realized he did not really want to be in college and dropped out. After working as a teacher's aide at a day care center and becoming a father, he decided to try again, so that his son would have someone to look up to. 
He called Medgar Evers "the first school I've come to where I really wanted to be," but admitted he had not been conscientious about attending classes.
"I'm muddling through," he said, in an interview during the semester. "Honestly, I still want to do what I can to chill and hang out. I'm trying to figure out how to balance my life."
Simon Jackson seemed to be waging a similar battle. He said that he, too, grew up in a family that valued education, and that his parents wanted him to become a doctor. In high school, he qualified for honors courses, he said, but they were stressful and he dropped them. He spoke breezily of "having a nice mansion with a lab on the side." But he did not like his remedial math class at Medgar Evers, and partway through the semester said he was having "big problems" in college.
One problem was money. He started a job at the college television studio -- a job Dr. Jackson lined up for him -- but he said that working 25 hours a week interfered with his studying. 
Things were not going well on the job, either. He skipped a day of work, he said, because he had no money. He could have walked to work, but he said it was hard to walk around school with nothing in his pocket.
One night near the end of the semester, Dr. Jackson offered to help anyone drop courses they were in danger of failing.
But there were no takers. Instead, many students were taking advantage of extra group tutorial sessions he had set up for them, and several said the sessions were useful. 
One exception was Mr. Agard, who was not there. He had been swept up in personal problems and had stopped attending classes. He ended up withdrawing, but has registered to return.
"I'm definitely going to keep trying," he said last night. 
Except for one other student, who had been sent to Iraq, the rest of the students had also registered for the next semester. Dr. Jackson viewed that, in itself, as a victory, since dropout rates are highest in the freshman year. 
Dr. Jackson said he would teach the class again next semester. He had planned to teach it only one semester, but he said that this group of freshmen needed more coaching and that he wanted to stay with them.

 BODY:
FREEDOM ON FIRE
Human Rights Wars and America's Response
By John Shattuck
390 pages. Harvard University Press. $29.95.
 Most memoirs of government service are written by senior cabinet members or White House aides, and their theme, implicit or explicit, is: Look how powerful I was. The Clinton administration has produced a slew of books along those lines, by the likes of George Stephanopoulos, Sidney Blumenthal, Madeleine Albright and Robert Rubin. John Shattuck, who served from 1993 to 1998 as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, has produced a different sort of memoir. Its theme is: Look how powerless I was. 
 Mr. Shattuck, a former American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, vice chairman of Amnesty International and vice president of Harvard, joined the State Department determined to elevate human rights to the top of the foreign policy agenda. He had every reason to expect that he would be successful, for as a candidate in 1992, Bill Clinton criticized the first Bush administration's policies from Bosnia to China as amoral. But Mr. Shattuck was disillusioned when he realized that there was no consensus within the new administration over the priority to be given to combating repression. 
Only strong direction from the top could have broken through bureaucratic logjams, but President Clinton was seldom willing to provide that push. The president was more focused on economic concerns, and after the Somalia debacle in 1993 he was leery of putting soldiers into harm's way. Mr. Shattuck traces the results of that caution in four crises he participated in -- Rwanda, Haiti, Bosnia and China -- all of which he labels, confusingly, as "human-rights wars," a term he never defines and never distinguishes from plain old ordinary wars.
Mr. Shattuck tried to interest Washington in stopping the killing of some 800,000 people in Rwanda in 1994. But he had trouble getting the administration even to admit that "genocide" was occurring. He and other human-rights activists had more luck getting the United States involved in Haiti because it was closer to home and there was a domestic political constituency (mainly the Congressional Black Caucus) for reinstating Haiti's ousted president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. But although United States troops occupied Haiti in 1995, Mr. Clinton was so eager for an "exit strategy" that, in Mr. Shattuck's words, the country quickly "slid back toward its long tradition of political corruption and government repression."
The United States undertook a longer involvement in Bosnia, and Mr. Shattuck deserves some credit for helping to bring it about. At real risk to himself, he journeyed to Bosnia in 1995 to interview Muslim victims of Serbian "ethnic cleansing." He was one of the first to report on the massacre at Srebrenica, which finally galvanized an apathetic United States government into imposing a peace settlement after four years of fighting that left more than 200,000 dead. But after the 1995 Dayton peace agreement, Mr. Shattuck and his allies found themselves frustrated by the United States military's reluctance to arrest suspected war criminals in Bosnia. Naturally President Clinton refused to order the Pentagon to take action.
Still, Bosnia was a real triumph for Mr. Shattuck compared with the administration's treatment of China. Mr. Clinton came into office determined to hold the Communist government accountable for its actions at Tiananmen Square. In 1993 he conditioned renewal of most favored nation trade status on human-rights improvements in China. But even though Beijing made no appreciable progress, Mr. Clinton, under heavy pressure from the business community, renewed the status anyway in 1994.
Does all this sound a bit familiar? It should. In recent years the story of the Clinton administration's foreign policy struggles has been chronicled in books like David Halberstam's "War in a Time of Peace" and Samantha Power's "A Problem From Hell." Mr. Shattuck's memoir does not add much if anything to these more compelling and more objective accounts.
His main contribution is to describe his personal anguish in losing one policy battle after another. "I thought seriously about resigning," he writes. But he "chose to stay" because "I felt I could do more to advance the cause of human rights by continuing the battle to shape policies inside an administration."
Despite a suspicion that less high-minded motives might have played a role in his decision (he subsequently became ambassador to Prague), a reader is nevertheless left admiring Mr. Shattuck's willingness to fight for his ideals. Unfortunately a single sentence near the end of "Freedom on Fire" raises serious questions about his intellectual consistency. 
Mr. Shattuck writes that four criteria should be used to assess the outlook for United States intervention in a human-rights crisis: whether crimes against humanity are being committed; whether the conflict is causing regional instability; whether intervention is likely to set off a broader conflict; and whether the intervention will use the minimum means necessary to achieve its objectives. By those standards, toppling Saddam Hussein, who murdered more people than Slobodan Milosevic, would seem to be a moral imperative.
Yet Mr. Shattuck writes, "The U.S.-British military operation to change the regime in Iraq in the spring of 2003 did not meet these criteria." Why not? Mainly because it was "unilateral" and lacked the United Nations' blessing. But the occupation of Iraq actually has more legal basis than Mr. Clinton's Kosovo intervention (which also lacked United Nations support), and it has more non-American troop participation than the occupation of Haiti.
It is hard to see how anyone who claims to be a "human rights hawk" could oppose bringing Mr. Hussein to justice. One is left to wonder whether the author, now chief executive of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation in Boston, applies a different set of standards to judge military operations initiated by Republican presidents.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE FORMER GOVERNOR; 
After Complaining About Failure to Stop Attacks, Dean Explains Himself to Party Chairman

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL and JODI WILGOREN

 BODY:
Howard Dean reached out to the Democratic national chairman on Monday, a day after rebuking him as failing to stop attacks by Mr. Dean's rivals for the Democratic nomination, even as those candidates seized on the episode as grist for new criticism.
 The rivals -- Senators Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and John Kerry of Massachusetts, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and the Rev. Al Sharpton -- took issue with Dr. Dean's suggestion on Sunday that the chairman, Terry McAuliffe, should seek to tone down their attacks and with his comment that many young Dean supporters might not vote in November if he was not the nominee. 
 A senior aide to Dr. Dean, Kate O'Connor, said that he called Mr. McAuliffe in the morning to discuss his comments and that they spoke for about five minutes. Ms. O'Connor would not say whether Dr. Dean had apologized to the chairman.
"I can't talk about what they talked about," she said, "but I can say it was very friendly. Believe it or not, they touch base fairly often."
The call to Mr. McAuliffe came less than two weeks after Dr. Dean, a former Vermont governor, called former President Bill Clinton to clear the air a day after seeming to repudiate Mr. Clinton's statement that the "era of big government is over."
Dr. Dean's critics were undeterred on Monday.
In a conference call with reporters, Mr. Lieberman said that he was stunned that Dr. Dean wanted Mr. McAuliffe to "protect him from criticisms from other Democratic candidates" and that he had threatened "to take his supporters and go home if he doesn't get the nomination."
"What does Howard do now that he is being substantively challenged about his policies and his judgments and various misstatements and retractions?" Mr. Lieberman asked. "He goes to the Democratic Party leadership and complains we're being mean to him."
Mr. Gephardt pointed out that Dr. Dean himself had frequently criticized the eight other candidates.
"He said that we weren't real Democrats, that none of us accomplished anything while we were in the Congress. I didn't scream and yell and say Terry McAuliffe has to save me from these discussions. That's what you do in elections," he said.
Mr. Sharpton focused on Dr. Dean's comments about his supporters. "To threaten to withdraw support unless you are the one nominated six months prior to the convention is arrogant and divisive and frankly is one of the reasons so many are questioning Dean's ability to unite the party should he win the nomination," he said.
Mr. Kerry echoed those remarks.
"Listening to Howard Dean's comments yesterday makes me wonder if he's worried about our party's chances for victory or his own personal political future," the senator said. "No one who really cares about the future of the Democratic Party would make such a divisive and threatening statement."
An official of the Democratic National Committee who spoke on condition of anonymity, sought to place the issue in perspective, noting that the party chairman did not act to halt such attacks 12 years ago. "The '92 election was bloody -- Ron Brown didn't step in," the official said. "Clinton got beaten up, but everyone recognized it was a primary."
The debate about party unity came on a day when many of the candidates tried to focus on other issues. Mr. Gephardt outlined a plan to expand services for the disabled; Dr. Dean called for an increase in the minimum wage.
Dr. Dean declined to answer reporters' questions about the latest attacks as he campaigned in Green Bay, Wis., and Detroit. In an interview with a local television reporter in Wisconsin, he said, "I'm not going to respond to Senator Lieberman," adding, "I think these guys are running a desperation campaign."
In a hotel ballroom in downtown Detroit, Dr. Dean received an endorsement from Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the longest-serving African-American in Congress, as he promised to raise the federal minimum wage to $7 an hour from its current $5.15.
"Our philosophy is give your working people a little more money; they might be able to spend some of it down on Main Street," Dr. Dean told about 150 supporters.
Dr. Dean took pains on Monday to connect his urban initiatives to Mr. Clinton, mentioning the former president several times and promising to restore some of his best-known policies like community policing.
Mr. Gephardt, in a one-day dash through Iowa, outlined a plan to expand services for the disabled. He promised to fully finance the Americans with Disabilities Act, to require federal contractors to increase their hiring of disabled people and to expand federal aid to companies owned by entrepreneurs with disabilities. 
In Des Moines, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina reserved his criticism for President Bush, saying the administration's economic policies had divided the country into "two Americas."
"One America does the work, another America reaps the reward," Mr. Edwards told about 100 people at the Creative Visions community center.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: RECONSTRUCTION; 
Japan Says It Will Forgive Most of Debt Owed by Iraq

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
Japan said Monday that it was prepared to forgive most of the billions of dollars of debts that Iraq owes Japan in order to help rebuild the economy, if other creditors did the same.
 The announcement, which came after Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi met with a United States envoy, James A. Baker III, brightened Washington's efforts to reduce Iraq's $120 billion debt to other nations. 
 After Mr. Baker's next stop, in Beijing, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said China would consider reducing the debt it is owed by Iraq, according to the official New China News Agency. The amount that Iraq owes is unclear, though Chinese officials say it is in the billions. 
Iraq owes Japan $4.11 billion, but late charges and other fees bring the total to more than $7 billion -- the biggest debt to a member of what is known as the Paris Club, 19 industrial countries that lend money to developing nations. China is not a member of the Paris Club. 
"Japan would be prepared to eliminate the vast majority of its Iraqi debt, if other Paris Club creditors are prepared to do so in the context of a Paris Club agreement," the Foreign Ministry announced. "This is essential for ensuring the Iraqi people to have the opportunity to build a free and prosperous Iraq, and is of special importance to the international security and stability."
The ministry added that "the precise figures of debt reduction" would be subject to negotiations. Japan has included penalties in debt forgiveness decisions in the past.
"I think we made some very, very good progress on the very important issues of Iraq debt," Mr. Baker told reporters after meeting Mr. Koizumi, and "the United States is very grateful." 
After stopping here, Mr. Baker led his worldwide lobbying efforts to reduce Iraq's debts to Beijing, where he met Prime Minister Wen, who said China "will consider reducing the debts owed by Iraq out of humanitarian concern," according to the New China News Agency.
China, which, unlike Japan, did not support the American-led war in Iraq, has criticized the United States for excluding it and other nations opposed to the war from lucrative reconstruction projects.
Mr. Baker's trip to Asia followed a five-nation trip to Europe this month, during which he secured agreements to reduce Iraq's debt. The exact amounts are open to negotiations; the Bush administration has been pressing creditors to cut the amounts as much as 90 percent.
Mr. Baker secured agreements from France and Germany, the two countries most fiercely critical of the war in Iraq. Iraq owes France about $3 billion and Germany about $2.5 billion, not including interest and penalties.
Russia, which also opposed the war, said recently that it would waive some of its $8 billion in Iraqi debt in return for contracts to help rebuild Iraq and produce oil there.
The Paris Club nations hold about $40 billion of Iraq's estimated $120 billion in loans; Arab nations hold most of the rest.
Alleviating Iraq's crushing debt is considered a prerequisite to rebuilding the economy. Without debt reduction, foreign governments and companies would be reluctant to invest the money needed to resurrect Iraq's oil industry, and most oil revenue would go to meet interest payments.
Debt relief is also critical to the United States' effort to establish a credible sovereign government in Iraq, because a huge debt would hobble any new government from the start. Under Paris Club regulations, debt reduction agreements can be signed only with a sovereign government, along with an economic restructuring program approved by the International Monetary Fund.
Japan had initially opposed forgiving Iraq's debts because of its potential oil revenue and because Japan had already pledged $1.5 billion in grants to Iraq next year, as well as $3.5 billion in low-interest loans during the next four years.
Mr. Koizumi's administration has been one of the staunchest supporters of the war in Iraq, despite popular opposition here. Japan is to send 600 troops to southern Iraq over the next few months, the first time Japanese soldiers will set foot in a country with continuing combat since the end of World War II.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE GENERAL; 
In Southern Stop, Clark Promises to Enforce Voting Rights

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Dec. 29 

 BODY:
Forty years after four black girls were killed in a church bombing here, Gen. Wesley K. Clark visited the same church on Monday and said African-Americans were still in danger of having their votes go uncounted and their voices unheard.
 Speaking at the 16th Street Baptist Church on a two-day campaign visit to the South, General Clark said voting rights were a "very personal issue for me," as someone who had grown up in the South and who had supported affirmative action in the armed forces. 
 He said that if he became the Democratic presidential nominee he would appoint a legal team to monitor the 2004 elections to ensure that problems reported in the contested 2000 election in Florida would not be repeated. 
"If anyone is intimidated or turned away from the polls illegally, we will push to prosecute the perpetrators to the full extent of the law," he said.
General Clark, who is retired from the Army, cited complaints that black voters had been disenfranchised in Florida through rejected ballots or by being turned away at the polls.
His day was soggy and hectic as he traveled across the rainy South, making seven stops on what his campaign is calling the True Grits tour through eight states. 
The trip, which combines campaign events with fund-raisers asking $1,000 per plate of grits, is designed to highlight General Clark's Southern background and military credentials. He has made an effort to reach black voters, who are some of the Democratic Party's core supporters. He has also been seeking to appeal to party centrists who worry about whether Howard Dean, who is ahead in the polls in early primary states, can appeal to voters in the South.
At campaign stops in Jackson, Miss.; New Orleans; Baton Rouge, La.; and Pensacola, Fla., General Clark emphasized his Arkansas roots, telling supporters that he held dear the values of patriotism, faith, family and inclusiveness.
"What it all comes down to is that I am who I am because of what I learned right here in the South," he said, addressing about 100 people in the War Memorial Building in Jackson, in a room with exhibits on voting rights and the history of the United States flag.
The Clark campaign was also trying hard to send the message that the general's beliefs echoed those of another son of the South who talked about faith and family, former President Bill Clinton. The campaign on Monday began running a television advertisement in New Hampshire that features a clip of Mr. Clinton awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to General Clark in August 2000 for his work leading NATO forces in the war in Kosovo.
Neither Mr. Clinton nor his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, has endorsed a candidate for the Democratic nomination, but General Clark said after entering the race that the Clintons had been encouraging of his candidacy. His advertisement was the first by a candidate this campaign season to feature a shot of the former president. 
As he campaigned on Monday, General Clark encountered a heckler who asked whether he supported the Confederate battle flag. His response -- "We stand for that American flag, not the Confederate flag" -- drew applause from a racially mixed crowd.
Despite passage of federal legislation in 2002 to overhaul the nation's voting procedures, General Clark said later in Birmingham, "The result is that today it's only one person, one vote if you live in the right county, and if you vote at the right machine and if your name happens to be on the rolls." 
He urged states to change laws that prevented felons from voting. He said that felons who had served their sentence and who remained out of trouble should be allowed to apply for the right to vote. 
Earlier this year, Gov. Bob Riley of Alabama, a Republican, vetoed a bill supported by black lawmakers in the state that would have allowed felons to regain voting rights. In the last few years, seven states have dropped or eased restrictions on voting by felons, according to the Sentencing Project, a group in Washington.
General Clark drew curious crowds and supporters. In Baton Rouge, the Rev. J. W. Crawford, pastor of Lighthouse Missionary Baptist Church, said he liked the candidate's agenda, including opposition to the war in Iraq, providing money directly to states to stimulate jobs and raising taxes on wealthy Americans to where they were before the Bush tax cuts.
"He can turn the country around economically for the so-called middle class, who I believe are being left out by the greedy rich," Mr. Crawford said.
Norman Pendergrass, a high school chemistry teacher who traveled to see General Clark in Baton Rouge from his home in nearby Denham Springs, said he was interested in the candidate's military background.
"My father is retired military, and that part of his resume attracts me," Mr. Pendergrass, 57, said of General Clark. "I'm a child of Vietnam, and that war affected me directly." 
He said he thought President Bush would have "learned a lesson from that conflict" before sending American troops into Iraq.
"That's why I'm here trying to find an alternative," Mr. Pendergrass said.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 7, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 30 about Gen. Wesley K. Clark's support of voting rights in his campaign for the presidential nomination misstated the number of states that have eased barriers to voting by felons who have served their sentences. It is nine, not seven. The article also referred incompletely to Alabama's consideration of such a measure. Although Gov. Bob Riley vetoed it last June, he signed a similar bill three months later.

HEADLINE: Layers of Ownership Conceal Trouble in Italy 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: MILAN, Dec. 29 

 BODY:
After Enron and other corporate scandals erupted in the United States, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley bill in an effort to prevent abuses. In much of Europe, regulations have been tightened in hopes of avoiding similar problems. 
 But Italy has reacted to its own business disasters in a different way. Led by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, perhaps the nation's leading business executive as well, Italy has moved to remove criminal penalties for accounting fraud and, in the last week, has rewritten its bankruptcy laws to accommodate the failure of Parmalat, the giant dairy and food-processing company controlled by the Tanzi family. 
 Magistrates investigating Parmalat, which was declared insolvent on Saturday, say one factor that allowed the company to hide its problems for so long was a multilayered ownership structure all-too-common among Italy's leading corporations, including Mr. Berlusconi's media empire. 
The reliance on a so-called Chinese box of holdings within holdings invites abuse, critics say, and is compounded by the way Italy's big family-controlled companies are governed at the top, with lots of family members on the board and weak checks on their power.
"The typical structure of Italian capitalism, with family ownership, favors the continuity of companies and, at least in the past, transmitted a level of trust and stability," said Carlo Alberto Carnevale Maffe, a professor of industrial strategy at the Bocconi University Business School in Milan. "The fall of the Tanzi family sends a clear signal of the need for reform of family-controlled capitalism."
As the investigation of Parmalat continued, officials close to the inquiry said that magistrates questioning Parmalat executives and advisers privately told a judge in Milan that Calisto Tanzi, the founder and former chairman of the company, might have misappropriated as much as 800 million euros ($999 million).
The magistrates said Parmalat's total liabilities might be as much as 13 billion euros ($16.2 billion), far above the 8.2 billion euros in debt that the company held at the end of last year. The estimates, according to those close to the investigation, were contained in a document presented by the magistrates to a judge on Saturday when they sought an order for Mr. Tanzi to be detained.
The official questioning seems to be moving even faster than efforts by experts from PricewaterhouseCoopers and two investment banks, Mediobanca and Lazard, to disentangle the web through which Parmalat's finances flowed. Parmalat's new chairman, Enrico Bondi, who was appointed as bankruptcy administrator, met with the experts on Monday. 
Mr. Tanzi acknowledged to investigators on Monday that he funneled about 500 million euros ($624 million) away from Parmalat and into other companies, said one of his lawyers, Fabio Belloni, according to Reuters.
On Saturday, the magistrates said that executives from Italian branch of the auditing firm Grant Thornton had assisted Mr. Tanzi in setting up a Cayman Islands subsidiary of Parmalat. Grant Thornton remained responsible for the subsidiary's auditing even after Parmalat was forced by Italian laws in 1999 to rotate its accountants.
Two Grant Thornton executives who were named by the magistrates -- Lorenzo Penca, the chairman of the Italian unit, and a partner, Maurizio Bianchi -- released a statement on Monday saying they had volunteered to be questioned by the magistrates regarding their work with Parmalat.
In London, Grant Thornton International, the umbrella entity that unites the independently owned auditing firms that cooperate under the name, said that it had "limited powers to obtain information and documents from its independent member firms, who are all separate legal entities." Nonetheless, the statement added, it had "initiated an inquiry as authorized by its governance documents."
Mr. Tanzi, like many industrial patriarchs here, had done all the right things in his long rise to the peak of Italian society. The son of a small delicatessen owner, he built Parmalat painstakingly, currying contacts in the government, where he had close ties to the perennially ruling Christian Democrats before their collapse in the 1990's.
His Catholicism was such an important feature of his public persona that even after he was detained by the police on Saturday and confined in Milan's San Vittore Prison, Italian newspapers reported that he had attended Mass at the prison chapel on Sunday and received communion. That gives some sense of the forgiveness that has long been an important characteristic of Italian society.
"We are a Catholic country," Professor Carnevale Maffe said. "We tend to forgive failings, provided you do penance." 
But even as Mr. Tanzi prayed, a fair amount of soul-searching was going on elsewhere in Italy over what the scandal means for the nation's ability to compete in the global market.
In the race to attract foreign investment, Italy lags woefully behind many European neighbors. A report presented this month by the American Chamber of Commerce in Italy points out that as of the end of last year, about 2 percent of the total stock of American investment abroad was in Italy, Europe's third-largest economy behind Germany and France. That represents only a fifth the amount in the Netherlands and a tenth that in Britain.
"Italy is not taken into consideration by American investors at the same level in which they consider productive investments in other European countries," Enrico Sassoon, the chamber's managing director, wrote in an introduction to the report.
The storm that has engulfed Parmalat comes roughly a year after Cirio, another Italian food company, defaulted on more than $1 billion in bonds. Italians are also struggling to make sense of the long decline of Fiat, the nation's leading industrial conglomerate. 
So far, Mr. Berlusconi's government has reacted to the Parmalat scandal by enacting a decree that accelerated the process of protecting failed companies like Parmalat from creditors, so that its industrial operations can continue and jobs be saved.
Meanwhile, the government has pledged to overhaul the system of industrial and financial regulation, much of which lies now in the hands of the Bank of Italy, the central bank. The government's economic minister, Giulio Tremonti, has long sought to transfer such authority to a unified regulatory body; the spreading Parmalat scandal, with its implications for failures of banks, auditors and other overseers, may finally provide him the power to win that battle with the central bank.
But he still faces a considerable struggle because of the continuing hold that Italian family capitalism has on public policy. Italy's family companies have traditionally lacked good rules of corporate governance, Professor Carnevale Maffe said. At Parmalat, Mr. Tanzi, his brother Giovanni, his son Stefano and his niece Paola Visconti all had important positions on the board or in the group's management. 
Moreover, Italian families have steered their complex corporate structures in ways that ended up leveraging them, placing much of the burden on the units furthest from the family itself. 
"A lot of debt was put on the shoulders of operating companies," Professor Carnevale Maffe said, "which were the last branches of the tree."
Under the stress of Parmalat's failure, though, institutional creditors, including banks and bondholders, may finally force Italian companies to shift strategy, Professor Carnevale Maffe added. 
While outside forces may press for change, Mr. Berlusconi's government is not expected to act hastily to overhaul the regulatory system. For one thing, Mr. Berlusconi himself is the owner of Italy's biggest private media group, and much of his time has been taken up recently trying to win parliamentary approval for a bill that would overcome opposition from Italy's president, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, and allow him to expand his media holdings. 
Mr. Berlusconi's own companies, nestled in dozens of Chinese boxes like Mr. Tanzi's, have in the past faced accusations of accounting fraud. 
Last year, his government pushed through legislation relaxing the penalties for false accounting, which were reduced from criminal penalties to administrative sanctions.
The legislation, said Airs Accornero, a professor of industrial sociology at the University of Rome, "gave a profoundly bad lesson to the economic system."
And those failing, experts said, may still come back to haunt Italy's powerful family concerns.
"For major things," Professor Carnevale Maffe said, "you still go to hell."

HEADLINE: LIBYA'S ATOM BID IN EARLY PHASES 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 29 

 BODY:
The top United Nations nuclear inspector, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, said Monday that Libya's nuclear program was years away from producing a nuclear weapon and that important pieces of equipment were now largely dismantled and stored in boxes.
 But Dr. ElBaradei, who spoke in Libya after visiting four previously undeclared sites where scientists had been working to perfect the enrichment of uranium, did express surprise that Libya had acquired a great deal of high-technology equipment needed to enrich uranium through black-market transactions that have yet to be disclosed. 
 It was "an eye opener to see how much material has been going from one country to the other" and "the extent of the black market network," Dr. ElBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said at a news conference in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, The Associated Press reported. The existence of this shadowy network of middlemen who often circumvent national export controls, he said, proved that those controls were not working.
"What we have seen is a program in the very initial stages of development," Dr. ElBaradei said of the Libyan effort. 
"We haven't seen any industrial-scale facility to produce highly enriched uranium. We haven't seen any enriched uranium."
The Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, met Dr. ElBaradei for about half an hour, during which the Libyan reiterated his pledge to rid the country of illicit weapons, an official traveling with Dr. ElBaradei said. Colonel Qaddafi also pledged to begin immediate compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, especially by submitting to unannounced inspectionsof any site.
"Libya committed today to act as if the protocol was in force," Dr. ElBaradei said, referring to the treaty requirement on inspections. The Libyans have also been asked to produce documentation about their nuclear program, officials with the atomic energy agency said. 
During the news conference, Dr. ElBaradei, a former Egyptian diplomat who last year directed the final inspections in Iraq along with his colleague Hans Blix, said it was his "gut feeling" that Libya was three to seven years away from producing a nuclear weapon. 
"We are now working with them to neutralize any activities, any programs that could have led to a nuclear weapon," he said.
On Sunday, Dr. ElBaradei's inspectors visited four previously unknown sites near Tripoli where nuclear weapons-related equipment was stored. A senior Bush administration official said all the sites had been inspected by British and American intelligence experts in October and early December as part of the secret diplomacy that led to Colonel Qaddafi's renunciation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons on Dec. 19. 
Also over the weekend, Dr. ElBaradei's team met and debriefed Libyan scientists and senior government officials, including Prime Minister Shokri Ghanem and Matouq Muhammad Matouq, a Libyan deputy prime minister and head of the country's secret nuclear program.
Robert J. Einhorn, who was the top State Department official in charge of nonproliferation in the Clinton administration, said in an interview that while it is "very good to get Libya out of the nuclear weapons business, it could be even more important if this helps us to understand the black market in nuclear technology and roll up some of those sources of supply."
A senior official in the Bush administration said Dr. ElBaradei's visit was another reminder that the nuclear agency "missed the Libyan nuclear weapons program just like it missed so many others." A spokesman for Dr. ElBaradei said he responded to this assertion by pointing out that "no verification system would be able to detect the kind of low-level activities Libya was conducting short of sheer luck or some perfect intelligence tip." The spokesman said Dr. ElBaradei had long campaigned for a strengthening of the nuclear safeguard provisions of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
In an interview with CNN on Monday, Dr. ElBaradei said his visit to Libya demonstrated that "we have to go after supplies and the source of supply" of nuclear technologies, because the system of export controls has once again been proven ineffective in Libya. He also said the centrifuges that Libya had acquired for uranium enrichment were inactive.
"There was a very small cascade of tens of centrifuges that were developed years ago as a pilot and that has been dismantled now, and they haven't developed an industrial or large scale cascade, so there were in the experimental stage," he said.
The visit by the international team of inspectors led by Dr. ElBaradei was arranged hastily in the wake of the announcement on Dec. 19 by Britain and the United States that Libya would disclose and dismantle its programs that were intended to develop unconventional weapons in order to reach a new accord with the West.
The announcement followed nine months of intensive negotiations with British and American officials and secret visits by British and American intelligence experts.
The senior Bush administration official said a large contingent of British and American intelligence officials, along with experts from the Department of Energy, the Defense Department and the national laboratories are expected to return to Libya in January to pursue unanswered questions about acquisition activities over the past two decades.
This official said Colonel Qaddafi, facing a deteriorating economic and political climate at home, was motivated by concerns for "regime survival" in finally allowing foreign intelligence officials to see all of his secret weapons laboratories last fall. 
"In October there was an event involving a shipment that Qaddafi expected that did not show up, and after that, he finally said, 'O.K., you can send your teams in,' " the official said. 
President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair both praised Colonel Qaddafi's decision. Mr. Bush hinted that a full disarmament process in Libya could be followed by lifting of sanctions and normalizations of relations, steps that Congress would have to approve and that had seemed inconceivable after decades of vilification and recriminations over Libya's support for terrorism. 
Dr. ElBaradei's description of the Libyan nuclear program appeared more modest and less alarming than the descriptions by Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair when they disclosed that nine months of secret diplomacy had led to a breakthrough with Libya.
Dr. ElBaradei said most of Libya's illicit nuclear equipment was "quite dismantled" and still in boxes.
"Luckily, I think, we are here when they have not developed a full fledged capability, and luckily also they have announced that they are ready to eliminate all programs relevant to weapons of mass destruction," he said. 
At the same time, Dr. ElBaradei called on North Korea to follow Libya's example.
"If a country was to show transparency and active cooperation, that can open the doors" and allow for "a complete change of face," he said, adding, "It is a lesson for North Korea to observe."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
After 1,200 Meals, 'Check, Please'

BYLINE:  By William Grimes

 BODY:
NEW YORK, since the time it could truly be called a city, has been serious about food and not exactly shy about declaring itself to be the country's capital of fine dining. In 1828, when Delmonico's was still a rickety cafe selling pastries and coffee, a local guidebook assured visitors that "New York abounds beyond all other places in the universe, not excepting Paris, in consummate institutions for cultivating the noble science of gastronomy." 
 I'm not sure the claim was, in the strict sense of the word, true. But the sentiment has held steady for nearly 200 years, and at the moment, despite the economic downturn, the facts fit. New York diners have never had it so good. 
 After nearly five years of reviewing restaurants (some 438 reviews, based on more than 1,200 meals), I find myself in the position of the frog in the gradually warming pot of water. Because the temperature increases gradually, the frog fails to notice that he is being poached until it is too late. The same thing has happened to me, but with a delicious difference. In my time on the job, the culinary standards in the city's restaurants have risen across the board. In quality and diversity, dining has gotten better and better. 
When you eat out constantly, it is easy to take incremental improvements for granted. It is only when I stop and look back that I realize what has happened. A couple of degrees at a time, the pleasantly warm water has reached the boiling point.
Two telling indicators spring to mind immediately: desserts and cocktails. Ten years ago, pastry chefs operated fairly anonymously. Today, even modest bistros often print a separate dessert menu with the name of the pastry chef displayed prominently, and in most cases the desserts merit the attention. A new generation of bartenders, inspired by Dale DeGroff's work at the Rainbow Room in the 1980's, now collaborate with chefs to develop innovative cocktail lists attuned to a restaurant's cuisine. The before-meal aperitif and the postmeal sweet are, by definition, peripheral. I single them out because refinement at the margins radiates from the center. When a dining culture is truly vital, you see creativity in all departments.
A confluence of long-term and short-term trends conspired to make my tenure as restaurant critic an extended dream sequence of spectacular meals. Young American chefs poured out of the culinary schools, eager to make their marks and firmly committed to the principles laid down nearly 30 years ago at Chez Panisse, where all meals were based on local produce and fresh ingredients. 
The growing allure of New York as a place to live and work attracted top talent from Europe. French chefs in particular brought the classical training and fierce discipline that, like tannins in wine, give backbone and structure to the city's best menus. They also brought a creative restlessness, an eagerness to try new ideas in a city famously willing to receive them.
An increasing awareness of foreign cuisines and an improving system for delivering exotic ingredients to market changed the appetites and the ideas of chefs and diners alike. Fusion cuisine spawned a dozen fads, fancies and minitrends, like Pacific Rim and Nuevo Latino. Some disappeared virtually overnight. (Remember new-wave Belgian?) But the trend toward more internationalization has become a fact of life. No one blinks at shiitake mushrooms or lemon grass on a French menu. And well-traveled diners now expect restaurants to honor regional differences when presenting, say, Italian or Mexican cooking.
The city's rising fortunes translated into a real-estate boom that had profound effects on dining. New hotels, many of them aimed at a young, stylish clientele, opened the door to younger chefs ready to play a starring role, like Geoffrey Zakarian at Town and Rick Lakkonen at Ilo. They were part of a wider, profound generational shift. Gabriel Kreuther, a sous-chef at Jean Georges, moved a few blocks east and created a highly distinctive style of haute cuisine at the Ritz-Carlton. Another Jean Georges chef, Wylie Dufresne, singlehandedly made the Lower East Side a serious culinary destination with his groundbreaking 71 Clinton Fresh Food, opening up the neighborhoods to a host of small but ambitious restaurants like Alias, Suba, aKa Cafe, Chubo and WD-50, Mr. Dufresne's slightly bigger and much bolder sequel to 71 Clinton.
When I began reviewing, the Lower East Side did not exist asa restaurant neighborhood. Neither did the meatpacking district, NoLIta, the Upper West Side or Smith Street and Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn. Any serious dining map of the city would now have to include these newly colonized territories, opened up by the rising price of real estate in Manhattan and the changing demographics of neighborhoods that formerly made do with cafes and diners. The meatpacking district has never quite lived up to the hype. Pastis anchors the neighborhood, but it is more impressive as a stage set than as a restaurant. The Upper West Side, however, has been blessed. Tom Valenti endowed it with two brilliantly realized restaurants, one French, one Italian. Ouest and 'Cesca brought some badly needed style to a neighborhood that seemed stuck with two alternatives: Cafe des Artistes or takeout. 
The ill-fated Marika transformed itself into Compass and took hold, while Nice Matin and Aix showed that the neighborhood could mob more than one French brasserie at a time. Suddenly, it was no longer possible to joke about dining on the Upper West Side. 
Brooklyn, meanwhile, added one solid restaurant after another, like beads on a necklace. Al di la opened on Fifth Avenue, followed by Blue Ribbon, Moutarde and others, culminating in the shocker of the year when the Zagat Survey voted Grocery, on Smith Street, the seventh best restaurant in the city.
Some of the expected names continued to prosper. Jean-Georges Vongerichten added a Shanghai-inspired restaurant, 66, to his expanding portfolio. Daniel Boulud, after striking out on his own with Cafe Boulud, put all his cards on the table with Restaurant Daniel. After picking up four stars, he opened a snazzy bistro, DB Bistro Moderne, and set off the kind of dining war that could happen only in New York. His $27 hamburger of foie gras and short ribs set off a race toward the $100 barrier, which picked up steam when the Old Homestead created a $41 kobe beef burger, which inspired Alan Miguel Kaplan at Salon Mexico to put together a $45 filet mignon and truffle burrito. Mr. Boulud has come up with the reply valiant, a $50 upgrade of the now-classic DB Burger.
Joining Mr. Boulud and Mr. Vongerichten was another shrewd Frenchman, Alain Ducasse. He arrived spreading rose petals in his own path, and New York responded in the only possible way, with a big Bronx cheer. Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, the most expensive dining proposition the city had ever seen, took a ferocious drubbing in its early days, but Mr. Ducasse showed that he has the talent to match his towering ego. He persevered, and he, or rather his cooking, won me over. Like Mr. Boulud, Mr. Ducasse cashed in on the brasserie trend, although he skipped the hamburger and opted for macaroni and cheese. Mix in New York, with its almost incomprehensible mix-and-match menu format and strange dishware, solidified Mr. Ducasse's reputation in my mind as a maddening genius. I don't know what to do with him, but I'm glad he came. He's part of New York now. Americans were also in an expansionist mood. Sometimes it took a genealogist to keep track of the relationships. Danny Meyer of Union Square Cafe begat Gramercy Tavern, whose chef, Tom Colicchio, created Craft, which begat Craftbar, 'wichcraft and Hearth. Mario Batali, in partnership with Joseph Bastianich, parlayed his success at a tiny, one-syllable Italian restaurant, Po, into a small empire of idiosyncratic, stylish two-syllable restaurants, Lupa, Babbo, Esca and Otto. Stephen Hanson, known for big, loud seafood restaurants, opened another one, Blue Fin, but followed up with Fiamma Osteria, a medium-size Italian restaurant of exceptional quality. Terrance Brennan, the chef and owner of Picholine, decided that the cheese mania of his maitre fromageur, Max McCalman, should be universal. He created Artisanal, the city's first cheese-centric restaurant, and went on to establish a center for cheese maturing, the French art known as affinage, whose influence on New York restaurants could turn out to be profound. Jimmy Bradley scored a hit with the Red Cat, a new kind of all-American brasserie, and showed it was no fluke when he went on to open Harrison and the Mermaid Inn.
Sometimes, a restaurant, or a star chef, would come out of nowhere. Scott Conant, who toiled honorably on the Bowery at the now-closed City Eatery, came into his own in spectacular fashion at L'Impero in Tudor City. One day a colleague happened to drop a menu on my desk from a new Japanese restaurant near his apartment. I looked it over. My eyebrows shot up, and there they stayed, when I tasted my first deep-fried eel backbone at Sushi Yasuda, a restaurant that immediately took its rightful place among the city's finest sushi restaurants. Gary Robins, who cooked brilliantly, and briefly, at Mi, returned without warning to reach even greater heights at the Biltmore Room.
Like every other critic, I also ate mediocre meals. But more often I ate good meals, very good meals and outstanding meals. Sometimes the best came at the expected places, like Le Bernardin or Bouley. Sometimes it came at small but ambitious restaurants too numerous to mention, places like Wallse, Fleur de Sel, Tocqueville, Sumile and 36 Korean Bar and Barbecue. 
It is the sheer profusion and depth of these second-tier and third-tier restaurants that make New York great. In the end, it is not the four-star showplaces but the small neighborhood restaurants that tell you most about the quality of dining in a city. New York, to fall back on a sports metaphor, has a deep, deep bench.
I see no end to this. The new complex at the Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle will deliver half a dozen high-end restaurants in one fell swoop to a city ready and eager to eat. Mr. Batali has a British-style gastropub in the works. Marcus Samuelsson of Aquavit is set to open Riingo, a Japanese-inspired restaurant. Gray Kunz and Mr. Vongerichten are collaborating on Spice, a restaurant devoted to Asian street food, and Eric Ripert of Le Bernardin has joined forces with Michael Vernon, his former sous-chef, at Geisha on the Upper East Side. 
The coming year looks auspicious. I just hope I can get reservations.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
A Festival Not Resting on Its Laurels

BYLINE:  By JOHN ROCKWELL 

 BODY:
This year's 21st annual installment of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival, which ended in mid-December, turned out to be one of the most interesting in years.
 Not because everything was wildly successful. Almost the opposite. Since the name the Next Wave implies taking risks, a succession of blandly applauded offerings would suggest few risks had been taken. 
 That happened in 2002. The 20th anniversary festival was not billed as a retrospective, either of the festival or of the years when it was programmed by Harvey Lichtenstein, the academy's former president. But that was what it looked like then, and now academy officials belatedly speak of it as what they intended all along.
In 1983, when the Next Wave began, the festival was a formalization of work that had been presented on its stages since the fall of 1981 and, in fact, intermittently back to 1967, when Mr. Lichtenstein took over the then-moribund complex.
The academy, and later the Next Wave, served to celebrate innovative work begun in Europe or in Manhattan lofts and museum spaces in the 60's. The festival offered American, mostly New York artists like Robert Wilson, Philip Glass, Merce Cunningham, Steve Reich, Bill T. Jones and Mark Morris, along with Europeans like Peter Brook, Pina Bausch and Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. They got the chance to expand their work to a big stage or, for the foreigners, to be seen in the United States.
This was all very admirable, but when last year's festival presented most of these same names, it made some of us worry that the Next Wave had become a museum. Where was the daring? Maybe it had drained away either because Mr. Lichtenstein and his deputy and successor as artistic director, Joseph V. Melillo (Karen Brooks Hopkins took over the administrative part of Mr. Lichtenstein's job), were obsessed with these few artists, or because they now feared alienating their audience. This year's program allayed many of those fears, both because the artists were innovative and because Next Wave attendance did not drop off.
The 2003 festival did offer some familiar names; that seems understandable, both because familiar artists continue to do good work and because there needs to be some anchor in the innovative tempest.
There was Mr. Cunningham, collaborating with the young art-rock bands Radiohead and Sigur Ross. There was William Forsythe and the Frankfurt Ballet, from which he is soon unwillingly to depart. And there was Ms. De Keersmaeker, whose "Rain," to music by Mr. Reich, was widely hailed.
By this time Taiwan's exquisite Cloud Gate Dance Theater counts as a staple, as well, and perhaps also the American choreographer Susan Marshall. The semistaged production (looked at another way, this was an austere but fully staged version) of John Adams's opera about Middle Eastern terrorism, "The Death of Klinghoffer," may have looked familiar, but it was still controversial and hence worth championing. 
There was also a solid contingent of less well known foreigners: the U Theater from Taiwan, the Flamenco singer Enrique Morente singing songs of Leonard Cohen (improbably enough) and the Improbable Theater from London.
But the heart of the festival, and of Mr. Melillo's intentions, was the cultivation of a new crop of New York and American artists. Not all were unfamiliar, but here they were given the chance to stretch themselves or, as Mr. Melillo put it in a telephone interview the other day, "to be invited into the BAM sandbox."
Unfortunately, Osvaldo Golijov's new opera "Ainadamar" had to be canceled because of the soprano Dawn Upshaw's indisposition. But Bob McGrath of the Ridge Theater got a chance to shine in the "Klinghoffer" production, as did Ms. Marshall and the three founders of the familiar Bang on a Can concerts -- Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe -- and the long-admired Dayton Contemporary Dance Company from Ohio, with their "Flight Project."
By common agreement the least successful of Mr. Melillo's experiments was the production of "Henry IV, Part One," by the downtown director Richard Maxwell. I did not read one review that liked it, nor did I encounter one noncritic who had enjoyed it. But several at least appreciated the concept -- actors treating Shakespeare like ordinary, everyday conversation -- even if they lost interest once they got the point. But this was the best instance of a risk admirably taken, even if the result wasn't admirable. 
The two most admired examples of Mr. Melillo's fostering of local work were "bobrauschenbergamerica," a touching homage to the painter from the Siti Company, the playwright Charles L. Mee and the director Anne Bogart, and the dazzling multimedia "Alladeen." This last took the Aladdin myth as a jumping-off point for a consideration of unseen telemarketers in Bangalore, India, and the mysteries of cultural transformation. It was directed by Marianne Weems of the New York-based Builders Association in collaboration with motiroti, a London visual-arts collective.
In response to the recent recession and downturn in cultural philanthropy, Ms. Hopkins and the academy board cut this year's budget by $5 million, Mr. Melillo said. He made his cuts not in the Next Wave showcase but in the winter and spring seasons, principally in the (one hopes temporary) elimination of what has become an academy pattern, three staged operas in the spring. In 2004 it's down to one, a production of Handel's "Siroe" by the Venice Baroque Orchestra.
The good news is that Next Wave attendance held healthily steady, despite the programmatic risks. That meant 79 percent of capacity, which was almost exactly in line with projections. The 20th-anniversary Next Wave, full of familiar names, drew 80 percent.
Mr. Melillo stoutly defended his 2003 program -- even Mr. Maxwell, whom he conceded did not enjoy a success with the public, but who would have been better served, he argued, by a more intimate, 300-seat theater. Which, he hints, the academy hopes to obtain soon.
Although Mr. Melillo worked with Mr. Lichtenstein for years, in a sense this year's Next Wave represented his coming-out party. His artistic policy is hardly a transformation of Mr. Lichtenstein's, let alone a repudiation. But he is now his own man, and rightly proud of the risks he took and the festival he achieved.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
Time to Put a Cork in '03 and Stick On a Label

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
THE year ending tonight was a good one for wine in America, and not just for the vintage, which, it so happens, wasn't bad. We will have drunk some 264 million cases of wine by midnight, about 14 million cases more than in 2002.
 Early this year, a lot of the surge had to do with price cutting brought on by the economic downturn. But by the end of the year, reluctant imbibers were returning to the wine shops, and prices began to creep up. 
 A good number of those 14 million cases were Two-Buck Chuck, which represents one of the more startling wine success stories ever. Actually, the wine goes by the name Charles F. Shaw. Two-Buck Chuck is a nickname reflecting the label and the wine's $2 price.
The wine is sold only in Trader Joe's food stores, most of which are in California. In fact, outside California, the wine costs $3.
Two-Buck Chuck is produced by Bronco Wine of Ceres, Calif. (A winery called Charles F. Shaw used to exist in the Napa Valley. It shut down a dozen or so years ago, and Bronco bought the name.) It is a phenomenon of the current California wine market, which is laboring to rid itself of an ocean of surplus wine brought on by the economic slump and by overplanting in the 1990's. Chuck appeared in 2002 and jumped to the East Coast earlier this year.
More than just being inexpensive, it gave consumers a chance to express their irritation at the continual rise in wine prices. Someone described it as a reverse cult wine, with people who ordinarily spend $20 or more for a bottle of wine buying 5, 10 or more cases of Two-Buck Chuck at a time. Along with the Australian line Yellow Tail, which ranges from $4.50 to $6 and is now the largest-selling import in the United States, Two-Buck Chuck showed that there is a considerable market for drinkable, very inexpensive wine. This was the year when cheap became chic in the wine world.
This was the year, too, when screw tops became more than a curiosity on wine bottles. Half a dozen New Zealand wineries are now using screw tops, and several California wineries, including Murphy-Goode in Sonoma, are putting them on some wines. Bonny Doon Vineyard near Santa Cruz, which started using them for part of its production several years ago, announced early this year that it would use them for all its wines, including Le Cigare Volant, one of its top labels.
Screw tops were once confined to inexpensive fortified and jug wines. Constant problems with corks have driven producers of fine wines to experiment with various stoppering devices. More and more are adopting the screw top.
This was not a memorable year for wine books. I sort of liked "Out of It: A Cultural History of Intoxication," by Stuart Walton (Three Rivers Press), and Leslie Sbrocco's "Wine for Women" (Morrow Cookbooks).
I still get occasional letters charging that, in recommending one wine or another, I am doing the Devil's work. In fact, anyone who writes about recreational drinking knows full well that the folly of overindulgence and the horrors of addiction are the other side of the coin. So I was intrigued by Mr. Walton's assertion that intoxication has always been with us and always will be -- if not from wine, spirits and tobacco, then from the vast cornucopia of drugs available, and even from old friends like caffeine.
Mr. Walton is British, and I found his foreigner's take on the Volstead Act and its aftermath highly entertaining. But I could not buy his ultimate and rather arch conclusion that intoxication is fundamentally harmless, often beneficial, and as such should be free of any legal or moral restraint. His orotund prose can be a bit wearing, too.
Ms. Sbrocco has produced a lighthearted how-to wine book that runs through the same basics as a hundred other books before it, but with an easier touch and the addition of tips on buying and serving that the author asserts might be particularly useful to a woman. Knowing many women who make wine, sell wine, promote wine and teach and (like Ms. Sbrocco) write about it, I got the feeling that singling them out for their very own wine book might be about 30 years late. 
Of course, there are always more women coming along, and some might prefer their wine knowledge to be gender-specific. They might be more comfortable with a text that, for example, likens the effect of acid on wine to a push-up bra. It lifts, Ms. Sbrocco writes, and separates.
Could this signal a trend? Why not "Wine for Male Dummies" and "Wine for Female Dummies"?
As for wine itself, this was the year when riesling finally began to make an impact on the American market. Not too long ago, famous producers along the Rhine and the Mosel in Germany were pulling out vines because no one was buying their wines. In a happy turn, that trend has been reversed, at least in part as a result of the American reaction to the overblown, high-alcohol, woody whites that have dominated the country's market for so long.
Riesling is an infinitely subtle wine that displays its charms reluctantly. At its best, it is a long-lived wine that takes time to come around. Cheap riesling can be drunk when very young, but wines from great producers like Ernst Loosen in Bernkastel and Rainer Lingenfelder in the Pfalz, both in Germany, and Laurence Faller at the Domaine Weinbach in Alsace make rieslings that often need three or four years of bottle age to reach their best.
(Perhaps the best American rieslings come from the Finger Lakes region in New York, especially from the Hermann J. Wiemer Vineyard on Seneca Lake. Mr. Wiemer, who grew up in Bernkastel, has made riesling New York's signature wine.)
If Americans are developing a taste for good riesling, it means their taste is improving. That's a good thing, and not just for 2003.

HEADLINE: Iran Thanks U.S. for Help, but Refrains From an Embrace 

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: BAM, Iran, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
President Mohammad Khatami said Tuesday that the arrival of an American aid team in this earthquake-ravaged city was a welcome development but should be viewed as just that -- a humane gesture and not a harbinger of improving relations between the United States and the Islamic republic.
 "Humanitarian issues should not be intertwined with deep and chronic political problems," Mr. Khatami said at a news conference in Kerman, the provincial capital. "If we see a change both in the tone and behavior of the U.S. administration, then a new situation will develop in our relations." 
 In Washington, the Bush administration on Tuesday hailed the contacts between Iran and the United States on earthquake relief as one of several "positive developments" between the countries in recent months.
"We reached out to the Iranians," said J. Adam Ereli, a State Department spokesman. "We offered our assistance. That offer was accepted, and I don't think you can see that as anything but a positive development for the people of Iran."
Some policy experts said there was now room for maneuvering, a chance to transcend the "Axis of Evil" versus "Great Satan" labels that each country has stuck on the other. Mr. Khatami also said Tuesday that the death toll from the quake was likely to reach 30,000. A disaster of such scope can create an opportunity for conversations that otherwise may not have taken place, the experts said. 
"It could be interpreted as earthquake diplomacy," said Davoud Hermitas Bavand, a political scientist at Tehran University. "It could be used as a starting point for dialogue."
The brief transit of about 12 American aid workers through the damaged airport terminal here caused a frisson of excitement, with Iranian relief volunteers asking to have their pictures taken with the workers when they heard they were Americans. 
For their part, the Americans insisted that there was nothing political or particularly unusual in their presence. 
The last time a large group of Americans was in the country was in January 1981, when 52 American hostages were released from 444 days in captivity at the American Embassy in downtown Tehran. Relations, severed then, have never really improved.
When asked if he had any qualms about being here, Kevin Garvey, a medical technician from Boston, said "None whatsoever" and several men behind him echoed the thought. 
"This is what we do," added Mr. Garvey, part of a team expecting to establish a field hospital in Bam. "I am totally apolitical when it comes to doing my duties."
Two different teams of Americans are here, an urban search and rescue group from Fairfax, Va., and an international medical response group affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Although the Bush administration dispatched the groups, the Iranians have gone to great lengths to paint them as volunteers.
Asked repeatedly about the issue at his news conference, President Khatami said the United States needed to assuage Iranian fears before relations could move forward. 
"They must attract our confidence, and that requires resolving our differences," he said. "They must respect our sovereignty. They keep on saying that they want to overthrow the Islamic Republic. We have not seen good intentions. We hope that the U.S. will change its behavior so that this wall of mistrust will break."
A group of Iranian doctors watching the arrival of the Americans at the Bam terminal said they distinguished between Washington -- with its threats of "regime change" and its long history of trying to enforce worldwide economic sanctions -- and ordinary citizens.
"We still have problems with the American government; there are no diplomatic relations," said Ali Gorbawi, an anesthesia nurse. "Humanitarian relations are fine, though. We welcome that."
Out of such small seeds, though, diplomatic saplings may spring, some policy experts said. 
"Every situation, every occasion, every incident, if used properly, could be used for constructive relations," said Mr. Bavand, the political scientist. "In politics there is no such thing as not using an opportunity."
A presidential adviser, Mohammad Shariati, conceded as much to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. 
"There is no doubt that the way countries behave at the time of trouble for other countries will affect decision making and will pave the way for other matters," he said. "But I do not think it is a very good time now to talk about change, unless we get a chance to bring up our demands as well."
Washington has swung in recent years between trying to engage Iran and continuing to treat it as an outcast. Iran recently agreed to more wide-ranging international inspection of its nuclear research facilities, which it insists are for peaceful purposes. Iran has also voiced support for the American-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein, who waged an eight-year war across the Iran-Iraq border. At the same time, Iran has urged a speedy United States withdrawal from Iraq, evidently nervous at the prospect of tens of thousands of American soldiers bivouacked next door. 
In reacting to the American group arriving at Bam, one official drew a distinct comparison. 
"You are talking about politics, but these are doctors," said Mohammad Akbari, Iran's deputy health minister. "They are not Mr. Bush or Mr. Rumsfeld coming to kill us."
Other countries that have recently had tense relations with Iran, especially regional neighbors like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, were also sending in assistance, signaling a certain thaw.
There is, of course, a constituency within the Iranian government that acts as if maintaining hostility toward the United States and its allies is one of the pillars that keeps the Islamic revolution alive. After the quake, Iran announced that it would accept aid from all nations except Israel, and Tehran has long supported militant Palestinian fundamentalist groups. 
Similar predictions of thaws in the past have come to naught -- including one in 1990 after a private American relief plane landed in Tehran ferrying supplies to the victims of a devastating earthquake in the Caspian region. That year, though, Iran left the United States off its thank-you list. 
The Bush administration's comments on Tuesday were among several in recent months trying to take advantage of Iran's latest cooperation on its nuclear weapons program. But direct contacts with Iran would be resumed only if the government in Tehran made further progress in shutting down terrorist operatives based in Iranian territory, American officials have said.
On Tuesday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in an interview with The Washington Post, was quoted as saying that Iran's recent actions had been "encouraging" and that the United States was open to "the possibility of dialogue at an appropriate point in the future."
An openness to talking with Iran had been signaled in late October by Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage, who told a Congressional panel that the United States was not seeking "regime change" in Iran and said a future dialogue might be appropriate.
The change in the administration's tone occurred after senior envoys from France, Germany and Britain won agreement from Iran to accept new international inspections of some of its nuclear facilities and to suspend production of enriched uranium, a fuel for potential use in making weapons.

HEADLINE: The Budget Politics of Being Poor 

 BODY:
Quietly and painfully, most states are choosing to crimp the health-care safety net for their poorest and most politically defenseless residents. An ominous new study shows that up to 1.6 million impoverished and working-poor Americans -- at least a third of them children -- have been deliberately knocked from publicly financed health care programs in the last two years. 
Officials in 34 states are opting to slash Medicaid and poor children's health insurance coverage as a path of least resistance to the balanced budgets mandated by law.
 States have raised poverty standards beyond federal requirements, increased bureaucratic delays and even shut down children's health programs entirely to keep entitled poor people off the rolls. For each dollar thereby saved in the state budget, statehouses are losing $4 to $7 in federal aid. Yet more such counterproductive "economizing" can be expected next year, according to the study, by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a government watchdog group. 
 During the 1990's boom, those who despaired of getting universal health insurance through federal action looked to expanding state programs as the best way to protect the working poor. But many of the same states that were increasing health coverage were also cutting taxes. Unlike the feckless tax-cutters in Congress, they cannot simply bury the resulting deficits in future debt. Something had to give, and it turns out to be programs like the hard-won gains in health insurance.
Things would be even worse except for the $20 billion in state emergency aid that the Republican-led Congress was embarrassed into approving at the height of the tax-cut frenzy this year. Since Congress is showing no signs of picking up the slack when it comes to health coverage, it should vote at least a renewal of this aid next year.

HEADLINE: Prison Union Seeks Ouster Of the Chief Of Corrections 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
The union representing sergeants at New Jersey prisons is asking Gov. James E. McGreevey to dismiss Corrections Commissioner Devon Brown, saying he made racially charged comments in a speech about the inequitable treatment of blacks and Hispanics in the criminal justice system.
 In a letter to the governor last week, the union, the New Jersey Law Enforcement Supervisors Association, said that the commissioner's speech at a conference on minorities in prison was "highly inappropriate and racially charged," and that it would aggravate tensions between inmates and corrections officers. 
 Mr. Brown, who is black, said at the Nov. 8 conference at Rutgers that he was distressed by huge racial disparities in the prison population. "This state and nation has lost a generation of young African-Americans and Hispanics, both male and female, to the criminal justice juggernaut."
The union also expressed dismay over comments drawing parallels to slave-era plantations.
"'There are those who with some degree of justification have proclaimed our prisons as being America's new plantations," he said, "for not since slavery has our country promoted policies which have visited such enormous economic and human calamity on the black community."
A Corrections Department spokesman said the commissioner declined to comment on the union's demand, which was reported on Tuesday by The Record of Hackensack. "It's a personnel issue, and we're treating it internally," said the spokesman, Chris Carden.
Mr. Brown told The Record on Monday that the union was angered by proposals that could result in cuts in prison staffing. He has supported a state commission to revisit sentencing laws, as have several legislators who have voiced concern about prison costs, which have risen to $1.1 billion from $200 million in the last 20 years. 
The letter from the union's president, Robert A. Cardone, and first vice president, Thomas Moran, said, "We are extraordinarily concerned that the State of New Jersey has implemented a policy to return violent criminals to all of our neighborhoods simply to save money."
But Ellen Mellody, a McGreevey spokeswoman, said: "The state has not adopted any such policy. The letter is inaccurate, and the governor does not support the early release of prisoners as a cost-saving measure."
Ms. Mellody also said the governor supported Mr. Brown, whom he appointed in March 2002. 
Mr. Cardone and Mr. Moran did not respond on Tuesday to a message requesting comment. 
In 2001, the last year for which statistics are available, the state prison population was 63 percent black and 18 percent Hispanic. The total inmate population peaked in 1999 at 31,493 and has declined to 27,492.

HEADLINE: Korean War Vet's Protest May Keep a Hospital Open 

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: CANANDAIGUA, N.Y., Dec. 30 

 BODY:
In August 1952, Cpl. Ralph A. Calabrese was wounded when his Army barracks collapsed during an attack in Korea. 
 He recovered from some injuries, but he never told doctors he was blind in his right eye. He taught himself to aim with his left eye and returned to the battlefields. "I didn't want to leave my buddies," he explained. 
 Mr. Calabrese said he felt that way again this August -- 51 years later -- when a federal plan was released suggesting that veterans services be streamlined and that several veterans hospitals be closed, including three in New York State, one of them here in his hometown. Mr. Calabrese helped organize a protest that officials say was among the loudest in the nation. 
The outcry may have been effective. Charles Battaglia, a member of a federal commission that has been studying consolidation, said on Tuesday that it plans to recommend that the hospital here stay open. "The consensus is we ought to retain Canandaigua," he said.
The commission is completing recommendations that it will deliver in about five weeks to the secretary of veterans affairs, Anthony J. Principi, who can accept or reject them. The fate of the other hospitals, in Manhattan and Montrose, in Westchester County, will be decided then as well. 
In 1999, a federal study showed that the nation spends $1 million a day maintaining unused space at veterans hospitals. This summer, federal officials suggested that closing some hospitals while building up others would be more cost-effective and could provide better care. 
On paper, Canandaigua may have been an obvious target. The hospital sits on a 171-acre campus next to historic gardens in a Finger Lakes community 30 miles southeast of Rochester. The hospital's amenities include a nine-hole golf course, bowling lanes, barber shop, pharmacy and general store. And the number of patients has shrunk substantially -- to only 200 today from a high of 1,700. 
But those figures don't tell the whole story, supporters maintain. The hospital serves as many as 16,000 people on an outpatient basis, and its amenities provide rehabilitative opportunities. For example, many unskilled veterans are trained as landscapers on the golf course.
The hospital's tranquil setting helps recovering patients like Marion E. Williams, whose alcohol abuse unraveled his life. Mr. Williams lost his job in 1985 and his home in 1997. After rotating between shelters and the streets, he asked to be admitted into a detoxification program in Canandaigua. "I just gave up and wanted to do better," he said. 
Today, at 55, Mr. Williams is employed at the hospital in housekeeping services. He lives in a group home and says he is sober. "This place is really needed," he said. 
Mr. Calabrese said he felt that way, too. He has relied on veterans services to help him cope with lingering problems from his injury, including migraines he described as so severe they had brought him to the brink of suicide. 
It would be unfair, he said, to ask veterans to drive to the next closest hospital, nearly 50 miles away. "They're playing with human beings," he said, "not numbers."
So Mr. Calabrese helped organize a grass-roots effort that included protest signs and old-fashioned letter writing. Of the 200,000 letters received by the commission in response to the consolidation plan, 109,000 were about the Canandaigua hospital, Mr. Battaglia said.
The campaign to prevent its closing received high-level political help too. "It would be a terrible blow to Canandaigua," Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Monday. 
David Baker, president of the community's Chamber of Commerce, said the local economy would lose $250,000 a year if the hospital's 800 jobs were eliminated or moved. "In some fashion, everyone is touched by the V.A.," he said. 
Dr. Lawrence Flesh, chief medical officer for the branch of Veterans Affairs that covers western New York, the office that recommended Canandaigua's closing, said many of the protesters were misinformed, thinking services would be abolished instead of relocated. "We're not going to abandon care," he said.
Still, he acknowledged, the proposal was released at a bad time. "It's not a good thing to do when the country's at war," he said. 
Mr. Battaglia said that although Canandaigua's protest was among the loudest, it was only one of many. "Everyone's in favor of cutting costs," he said. "But no one wants it to happen in their community."

 BODY:
In last year's office pool, for the second year running, I accurately predicted the best-picture Oscar winner. Forget all of the other predictions, which were varying degrees of mistaken; I shoulda been a film critic. 
The multiple choices include one, all or none. My picks are down below. Do not save this page. 
 1. Next tyranny to feel the force of U.S. liberation: (a) North Korea; (b) Iran; (c) Syria; (d) Venezuela.

HEADLINE: Ranchers and Companies Support New Restrictions 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY

 BODY:
In an effort to maintain consumer confidence and to appeal to countries that have closed their borders to American beef, domestic cattle ranchers and food companies said yesterday that they largely supported the Department of Agriculture's decision to increase restrictions on beef production.
 Ann M. Veneman, the secretary of agriculture, said yesterday that the government would enact several new regulations on beef production, including banning the use of small intestines and head and spinal tissues from older cattle. The government also said it would start a national animal identification program and prohibit cattle that are unable to walk when they enter the slaughterhouse, or downers, from entering the food supply. 
 The National Cattlemen's Beef Association, which represents 95 percent of the country's ranchers, said that while its members supported the government's actions they had not erred in their business practices. 
"It's important for us to recognize that the systems that we have had in place did work," Terry Stokes, the association's president, said in a conference call. "Having said that, we now have had a case in the United States. It's important for us to look at and evaluate these systems and enhance them based upon this new information."
Since the single case of mad cow disease was announced last week, more than 30 nations have banned imports of American cattle. Trade with those countries, which include Japan and South Korea, represents about 90 percent of the $3.7 billion American beef export business, the association said. Regaining the confidence of its importers, ranchers said, is worth the millions of dollars they will probably have to pay to absorb the costs of the new rules.
"We do believe that these are extraordinary measures that go well beyond what the international standards would dictate," said Janet M. Riley, a spokeswoman at the American Meat Institute. "In light of these, our trading partners should re-establish beef trade with us immediately."
Several ranchers and food companies said they had been in compliance with some of the new regulations for several years. Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods and Swift Foods each said they did not use downer animals, which the beef association said made up only 0.18 percent of the cattle slaughtered each year. All the companies applauded the government's actions. 
"The steps being implemented by U.S.D.A. will have a minimal impact on Tyson's beef operations, since the company is already doing much of what will be required," Tyson said in a statement.
Swift Foods also announced its own cattle-tracing program yesterday, saying it was the first beef company to do so before the government required such a program.
Consumer groups also lauded the government's announcement but said the agency should have acted earlier to prevent the case of mad cow disease in Washington State. Caroline Smith DeWaal, the director of food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said her group had been lobbying the Agriculture Department since 2001 to ban the use of spinal column and neck bone meat in the nation's food supply. While the agency has banned the use of such tissues in older cattle, it can still be harvested from cattle that are younger than 30 months.
"There's no way consumers can avoid it," Ms. DeWaal said. "While the meat should be more safe than it is today, it's still not safe enough."
Commodity traders said yesterday that cattle futures were showing signs of improvement after posting steep declines in the days immediately after the discovery of the case of mad cow. While cattle for February delivery still fell the maximum of 5 cents a pound yesterday -- to 76.175 cents, down 6.2 percent -- the futures traded for about three hours before hitting the limit. In the previous three sessions, they reached the limit immediately after the opening.
Equity markets stabilized, with most fast-food and restaurant stocks rising for a second consecutive session. One of theday's biggest winners was GeneThera Inc., a small Colorado company that said it had developed a test that could detect mad cow disease in live animals. The company's stock rose 30 percent, to $3.42 a share.

HEADLINE: Pocketbook Issues at Top of Agenda as Democrats Swarm South Carolina 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, S.C, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
Calling himself a Vermont Yankee, Howard Dean pitched a populist economic message on Tuesday in this depressed coastal town where 563 jobs disappeared when a steel plant closed in October and where the county unemployment rate is 14.5 percent.
 "It doesn't matter if you're North or South: if you're from a rural state and you need jobs, you're an American," Dr. Dean told several hundred people outside a historic mansion. "That's good enough for me and I hope it's good enough for you." 
 He focused on pocketbook issues like jobs and health insurance in hopes of luring working-class voters from the Republican Party, whose hold on the South helped George Bush win the White House in 2000. Two of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Gen. Wesley K. Clark, followed suit in comments Tuesday directed at Southerners hard pressed by manufacturing losses. 
"This is not some crackpot socialist idea from some liberal state up in the North; Harry Truman put this in the Democratic platform in 1948," Dr. Dean said of his universal health insurance plan. "I want more than anything to bring South Carolina back to its proud tradition of voting Democrat year after year after year."
The day was a contrast to the intense campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire, where Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, spends much of his time fending off attacks from the other Democratic contenders. Here, Dr. Dean seemed still to be introducing himself to voters, and many said they showed up for the novelty of seeing a candidate.
The novelty is not likely to last.
General Clark landed in South Carolina on Tuesday night for the finale of his two-day, True Grits tour of Southern states, while Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut also arrived to place his name on the primary ballot. Carol Moseley Braun and the Rev. Al Sharpton each opened campaign offices on Tuesday in the state capital, Columbia.
With this year's compressed nominating calendar, several of the candidates see South Carolina, the signature state among seven voting on Feb. 3, as the key to halting Dr. Dean's momentum. For Dr. Dean, South Carolina -- along with Arizona and New Mexico, which vote the same day -- is an opportunity to lock up the nomination early.
General Clark, who grew up in Arkansas, emphasized his heritage of "Southern values," including patriotism, faith, family and inclusiveness, as he campaigned in Charleston, Memphis, Nashville and Savannah, Ga., on the second day of his tour of Southern states. 
The sizes of his crowds have grown steadily as he has proceeded across the South, and a raucous crowd of more than 300 people wedged shoulder-to-shoulder at state Democratic headquarters in Nashville to welcome him. 
At every stop on Tuesday, he recited a biographical sketch long on Southern symbols and short on the final "g" in words like living, helping and raising. He noted that as a boy he said the Pledge of Allegiance every day in school, adding "and we meant it." He told of going to Sunday school and Baptist Training Union. 
"And my stepfather took me out; we went hunting and fishing every weekend," General Clark said. 
In Memphis he said, "It's hard to be talking about family values when there are 8.8 million unemployed in this country." 
Mr. Lieberman, in his last planned trip South before the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 27, said the election "presents a clear choice, between George Bush on one end and Howard Dean on the other," and offered himself as the moderate alternative.
"I'm the man in the mainstream who's going to build from the mainstream values that are held so dearly in South Carolina and throughout the country," he said in Columbia.
Even Mr. Gephardt, campaigning in New Hampshire, talked about South Carolina in a conference call attacking Dr. Dean, a near-daily occurrence in the Democratic race. 
"I think when voters in South Carolina understand what I've done on trade, what Howard's done on trade, I'm going to win a lot of their votes and I'm going to win in South Carolina," Mr. Gephardt said, referring to Dr. Dean's support of international trade agreements in the 1990's. "He's had an 11th-hour conversion and now he's saying what I said for 15 years. Well, you can't change the record that quickly, and I think people are going to see through it."
Dr. Dean, as he does daily, acknowledged his support for Nafta and other treaties but said he would sign no more until trading partners raised their labor and environmental standards. Next to Dr. Dean on the rostrum here was the president of the local steelworkers' union, who could not hold the rally at his local's hall because his parent union has endorsed Mr. Gephardt.
Earlier, Dr. Dean spoke at a breakfast meeting of Democrats in Florence, S.C., and cut a ribbon there at his fifth field office in the state. 
The trip, Dr. Dean's ninth to South Carolina, was planned in part because he was to give a talk, "Why I Want to Be President," at the Renaissance Weekend retreat in Charleston on Tuesday. The sessions, in which Dr. Dean has participated for the past two years, are closed to the public and press. Mr. Clark and Ms. Braun also were scheduled to give speeches there.
This state's Feb. 3 primary is seen by some as a test of Dr. Dean's national appeal. The Dean campaign has tripled its South Carolina staff to 25 in the past three weeks, and plans to add a half-dozen more next week.
Dr. Dean's strategy in the state seems more focused on uniting working-class Southerners for a November general election face-off with President Bush than attracting the African-American votes essential to winning the Democratic primary. 
Both in Florence, where blacks make up 40 percent of the population, and in Georgetown, which is 57 percent African-American, the crowds that turned out were nearly all white. Dr. Dean and his aides have frequently said they do not expect black voters to come to campaign rallies in large numbers, and that they plan to have black legislators and ministers do outreach for them. 
Tuesday's appearance made it clear that some voters were still trying to sort out the candidates. Ernest Nance, 69, who lives in Wedgefield, said of Dr. Dean: "He's solid, and he's from North Carolina."
Actually, that is Senator John Edwards.

HEADLINE: Mr. Deregulation's Regulations: Stuff of Politics, Mad Cows and Suspect Dietary Pills 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Dec. 30 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's twin moves on Tuesday to ban the dietary supplement ephedra and the sale of meat from cows that appear to be sick on the way to the slaughterhouse underscores a simple White House maxim these days: with an election approaching, even a president who came to office assailing government regulation cannot do too much to protect consumers.
 By all accounts, there was no grand political plan to embrace government activism suddenly -- events forced the administration's hand. Ephedra's fate has seemed clear since a 23-year-old pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles died after taking it early this year, though this is the first time the Food and Drug Administration has banned such an herbal supplement. And with mad cow disease suddenly dominating every cable channel and front page, Mr. Bush and a small clutch of his aides staring out at the cattle grazing his ranch here knew they had to appear to be taking action. In this case, the action included some protective steps they rejected as unnecessary just months ago. 
 In fact, quietly, in ways few would notice, Bush aides have been doing everything they could think of in recent months to inoculate Mr. Bush against accusations that the war in Iraq has led him to ignore risks and annoyances of everyday life.
The man who drew cheers in 2000 by promising to roll back government interference with the private markets has, in recent months, gladly signed legislation to restrict telemarketing and e-mail spam, and boasts at fund-raisers that he will lock up executives who abuse the public trust in their companies. It is a line that always draws big cheers, a reflection of how the political atmospherics about big government have changed in the three years Mr. Bush has been in office.
"As far as I can tell, he has not uttered the word 'deregulation' since 2001," said James L. Gattuso, a research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, who recently completed a study of Bush era regulations. "This stuff about the antiregulation president is a Howard Dean myth," he said.
That is certainly the way Karl Rove, the president's chief political strategist, would like to position Mr. Bush in the coming year. An so, in the last week of 2003, the administration has suddenly reached back to the politics of Theodore Roosevelt, who instantly rode the political winds after Upton Sinclair published "The Jungle," sending his own agents to the Chicago stockyards and pressing for the first Federal Meat Inspection Act in 1907.
Mr. Bush, who used to keep a volume of T.R.'s speeches on his coffee table here, has said little about the efforts to contain mad cow disease. But he is expected to address the issue on Wednesday, when the residents of this farm town expect him to show up -- as he traditionally does on Dec. 31 -- at the local diner for his favorite cheeseburger special. 
The new actions enable him to answer his Democratic challengers, who since Sunday have been issuing broadsides against the administration for waiting too long to act. "The new policy is too little and much of it is too late," Representative Richard A. Gephardt said on Tuesday. "Many of the measures should have been taken immediately when we knew that the deadly disease was a threat to our food supply." Both Mr. Gephardt and Senator John Kerry issued point-by-point plans this week to deal with the issue; many of those steps were taken by the Agriculture Department on Tuesday. 
"It's a time to be cautious," one of Mr. Bush's aides in Washington said late on Tuesday, when asked about the seeming rush to enact rules that have been debated, to little effect, for many months. "You want to make judgments based on good science, but also on maintaining confidence."
Election-year moves toward consumer regulation are hardly a new invention. Bill Clinton announced the end of the "sniff and poke method" of inspecting meat in the summer of 1996, just as he was up for re-election, when the issue was salmonella poisoning, not mad cows. It was Mr. Clinton's F.D.A. that also proposed, at the beginning of his second term, a warning label on supplements containing ephedra, but his administration backed away after industry complaints that the supplement's links to strokes and heart troubles were unconvincing. 
The administration acted after doing a study but also after California, New York and other states moved ahead of the federal government in banning sales. It was not until Tuesday that Tommy G. Thompson, secretary of health and human services, declared: "Today's action tells consumers the time to stop using these supplements is now."
Those were not the kind of words heard from this administration in 2001. At that time there was a freeze on most Clinton-era regulations that were still pending. Mr. Bush very publicly rejected the Kyoto protocol on global warming, and environmental regulations like the one that sharply restricted commercial activity in roadless areas of national forests. 
But Kyoto is now regarded inside the White House as a good decision that was presented in the clumsiest possible way -- opening Mr. Bush to accusations that he was a shill for big business. Soon, the White House began to sound a little less strident about regulation. After halting a Clinton-era regulation on acceptable levels of arsenic in drinking water, Mr. Bush adopted those regulations. Indeed, Mr. Gattusso sees no decline in overall government regulation in the Bush years -- he counts 75,000 pages of the Federal Register filled with new rules this year. It is the kind of statistic Mr. Bush liked to cite in less than complementary terms in the last presidential election.
Some experts say the administration has more than politics in mind as it approaches new regulations. "The key to understanding this administration's approach to regulation comes in three words: cost-benefit analysis," said Robert Hahn, the director of the Joint Center for Regulatory Studies, run by the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution. "This balancing approach will surely raise the hackles of some conservative and liberal ideologues. But it's the right approach to policy."
In the coming year, it may also be the right approach to politics. On the campaign trail, Mr. Bush will no doubt appeal to patriotism with talk about Iraq and Sept. 11, portray his tax cuts as the key to economic recovery and appeal, as he does at each stop, for every citizen to help a neighbor. But he may also remember what Upton Sinclair said about the political movement touched off when he revealed conditions in the slaughterhouses. "I aimed at the public's heart," he said later, "and by accident I hit it in the stomach."

HEADLINE: An Operation to Ease Back Pain Bolsters the Bottom Line, Too 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON and MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
A complex operation called spinal fusion has emerged as the treatment of choice for many kinds of unrelenting back pain. A quarter million of the procedures, in which metal rods are screwed into the spine to stabilize it, were performed this year in the United States, three times as many as a decade ago.
 But a number of researchers say there is little scientific evidence to show that for most patients, spinal fusion works any better than a simpler operation, the laminectomy. And laminectomies get patients out of the hospital and back to their daily routine much faster. Some people, experts add, would be better off with no surgery at all. Even doctors who favor fusions say that more research is needed on their benefits. 
 In the absence of better data, critics in the field point to a different reason for the fusion operation's fast rise: money. 
Medicare can pay a surgeon as much as four times more for a spinal fusion, some doctors say, as for a laminectomy, an operation in which some bone is removed from the spine to relieve pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. Hospitals also collect two to four times as much, a gulf that has grown steadily as fusion operations have grown more complex. Medicare spent an estimated $750 million last year on spinal fusions, said Sam Mendenhall, the editor and publisher of Orthopedic Network News, a newsletter. 
So like hysterectomies or certain forms of prostate surgery, some doctors say, back surgery is an example of how money can influence decisions about which treatments to use -- especially when there is limited evidence about which treatments work best. Indeed, as the nation's biggest health plan, Medicare plays a huge role in shaping American health care, from the kinds of hospitals that get built to the amount of chemotherapy drugs that cancer doctors prescribe.
"The reality of it is, we all cave in to market and economic forces," said Dr. Edward C. Benzel, a spine surgeon who is chairman of the Cleveland Clinic Spine Institute. Though doctors, as a rule, should favor the least complicated treatment -- with surgery being the last resort -- Dr. Benzel estimated that fewer than half of the spinal fusions done today were probably appropriate. He described the current system of paying doctors as "totally perverted."
Doctors and hospitals are not the only players with a financial stake in fusion operations. Critics blame the companies that make the hardware for promoting more complex fusions without evidence that they are significantly more effective. Some sort of hardware is used in almost 90 percent of lower-back fusions, Mr. Mendenhall said, compared with fewer than half in 1996. Between Medicare and private insurers, the national bill for the hardware alone has soared to $2.5 billion a year, he said.
"A lot of technological innovation serves shareholders more than patients," he said.
The hardware makers acknowledge giving surgeons millions of dollars in consulting fees, royalty payments and research grants, but say the money promotes technical and medical advances that improve back care. 
"We can't innovate to help patients without these physician relationships," said Bob Hanvik, a spokesman for Medtronic, the Minneapolis company that is the biggest maker of spinal hardware. "Most physicians don't want to give away their time."
Some former Medtronic employees, however, have accused the company of paying surgeons kickbacks. A lawsuit brought by Scott A. Wiese, a former sales representative, accused Medtronic of trying to persuade surgeons to use its products with offers of first-class plane tickets to Hawaii and nights at the finest hotels. Some of those lucrative consulting contracts, the suit claimed, involved little or no work.
Medtronic said it did nothing wrong, and it denied the accusations in the lawsuit, which was filed in 2001 and settled in 2002. But the company disclosed earlier this year that the federal government was investigating charges that it paid illegal kickbacks to surgeons. Federal officials declined to comment on the investigation, and Medtronic said it would vigorously defend itself. 
Still, between the allure of money and the quest for breakthroughs in treatment, some prominent spinal surgeons say that back care has gone astray.
"I see too many patients who are recommended a fusion that absolutely do not need it," said Dr. Zoher Ghogawala, a Yale University clinical assistant professor of neurosurgery who is conducting a study comparing spinal fusion with laminectomy. Health experts note that if Medicare is overpaying doctors for back operations, other kinds of care are shortchanged, because the program is budgeted a fixed amount each year for doctor's fees.
Fees vary widely around the country, but several surgeons said that Medicare reimbursed doctors roughly $4,000 for a spinal fusion, versus $1,000 for a laminectomy. Mr. Mendenhall said that hospitals typically collected $16,000 for a fusion -- and $10,000 more for an increasingly common "360 degree" operation in which hardware is attached to both the front and back of the spine -- versus $7,000 for a laminectomy.
"The money is driving a lot of this," Mr. Mendenhall said. The cost to patients will differ based on their insurance coverage, and patients with traditional Medicare coverage will have to shoulder some of the higher surgeon fees. But some patients may push for what they believe is the most-advanced treatment.
Many spine surgeons defend fusion operations, saying that some patients clearly benefit from them, even if some of the procedures are not warranted.
"There is some indication that if you do it right, it can benefit people," said Dr. Eric J. Woodard, a spine surgeon at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, who noted that a well-designed Swedish study recently showed positive results for some patients. More research needs to be done, he added, to identify the category of patients who have the best odds of being helped. In the meantime, Dr. Woodard said, many doctors are being more selective about who gets a fusion operation.
In part, the rise of spinal fusions represents the natural process of medicine. Surgeons perform operations, and when -- as in the case of back pain -- the outcomes are mixed, surgeons strive to improve their techniques.
The Medicare payment system, in turn, rewards complexity, because it lets doctors bill for the individual procedures they perform within a single operation. It also tries to encourage the development of new medical technologies. And the makers of medical devices like fusion hardware exert themselves with frequent success in persuading Medicare to pay for their new products. 
Earlier this year, for example, Medtronic persuaded the government to cover a new kind of bone graft material, called Infuse, for use in spinal fusions. Surgeons describe the new material as having the potential to represent a real advance. Still, Medtronic scored a significant coup, experts said, in Medicare's decision to make an additional payment, as much as $4,450, to hospitals to help cover the cost of Infuse, on top of the flat fee paid for the operation. 
"The power of the device industry is growing tremendously," including its ability to influence Medicare officials, said Susan Bartlett Foote, a professor of health policy at the University of Minnesota.
Medicare officials are unaware of any problems concerning reimbursements for spinal fusions, an agency spokeswoman said. Industry executives said that Medicare patients deserved quick access to breakthrough treatments that might improve the quality of their lives.
Because of the scant data on the benefits of back operations, patients with similar complaints receive widely differing treatments for their pain, according to a 1999 study by researchers at the Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences at Dartmouth College. The National Institutes of Health is doing a large study to determine which patients will benefit from various treatments.
"There is a real paucity of convincing science about spinal fusion in particular," said Dr. Richard A. Deyo, a professor of medicine and of health sciences at the University of Washington. He was involved in the attempt by the federal government in the mid-1990's to issue guidelines for back surgery. 
The guidelines, which recommended a conservative approach and discouraged surgery, were roundly attacked by spine surgeons. Indeed, the surgeons nearly succeeded in persuading Congress to eliminate financing for the federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, which developed the guidelines. Sofamor Danek, the Medtronic unit that makes fusion hardware and was then an independent company, unsuccessfully sued to prevent the agency from making its recommendations public.
Some surgeons are disturbed by the level of influence that industry has on their profession, particularly in research. "This is a topic which orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons and the societies associated with both their groups are definitely concerned about," said Dr. Brett A. Taylor, an orthopedic surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis. 
The absence of solid research means that patients sometimes have little to go on in deciding whether to have surgery. 
Three years ago, Dr. Sam Ho, the chief medical officer of PacifiCare, a California insurer, suddenly developed severe back pain, the result of an extruded disc. His neurosurgeon, he said, insisted that he needed a laminectomy, but the surgeon could not offer any studies indicating that the operation would help. Nor, Dr. Ho said, could the surgeon tell him how many operations he had performed or how his own patients had fared. 
Dr. Ho said he refused the surgery and made a complete recovery within two months. 
Spinal fusion has a history of controversy. Device makers were the subject of numerous lawsuits in the early 1990's charging that they were paying surgeons illegal kickbacks to use their screws. Most suits were unsuccessful, often because courts were not convinced that the screws had caused injury or pain.
But similar accusations have surfaced in recent years. In his lawsuit, filed in a state court in Los Angeles, Mr. Wiese, the former Medtronic sales representative, said that he was told by his bosses to do "whatever it takes" to sell fusion hardware. Two doctors demanded consulting contracts in return for using Medtronic's products, the suit contended, but the contracts were a "sham," because little work was done for the pay. The suit was settled for undisclosed terms, and Mr. Wiese's lawyer declined to comment on the matter.
In interviews, two other former Medtronic employees said that the company engaged in similar practices as recently as last year. They said that Medtronic's sales representatives routinely offered enticements to surgeons to use the company's hardware, including lavish trips and visits to a strip club near the Memphis headquarters of the Sofamor Danek division. The former employees said they had spent as much as $1,000 a night per doctor for a night on the town.
"It's a business deal," said one of the employees, who declined to be named because he still works in the medical device industry. "It takes money to make money." 
A document provided by one of the former employees listed about 80 surgeons who have consulting agreements with Medtronic that pay as much as $400,000 a year.
Mr. Hanvik, the Medtronic spokesman, said that the company had policies in place to prevent its sales agents from providing improper inducements to surgeons. The company works closely with some surgeons, he said, and pays them fairly for their time creating new devices and improving the design of existing products. The annual amounts on the list are the maximum each doctor can receive. "They only get paid for the work they do," he said. 
Trying to rise above the flood of money, researchers like Dr. Ghogawala at Yale say they are now conducting studies free of industry support in search of basic answers about the efficacy of back operations. Having raised private money to finance his pilot study comparing fusions and laminectomies, Dr. Ghogawala plans to apply for government financing for a larger, five-year study.
"I think we are identifying who needs it and who does not," he said. "It's critical to know if it's a lot of unnecessary surgery for a lot of people."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Fell; Housing Market Softened 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer confidence declined this month from its highest level in more than a year, while the housing market softened in November, two reports released yesterday showed.
 A third report said that manufacturing in the Midwest expanded at a slower pace in December as orders fell and inventories shrunk. 
The data "showed a continued strong and growing economy, albeit with a bit less momentum this month than last," said Peter Kretzmer, a senior economist at Banc of America Securities in New York. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its factory index declined to 59.2 from 64.1 in November, the strongest since February 1995. 
 The Conference Board, a private research group in New York, said its consumer confidence index slipped to 91.3 from 92.5, which was the highest in 14 months. 
 Previously owned home sales fell 4.6 percent last month, to a 6.06 million annual rate, the National Association of Realtors said.
 Analysts expected a confidence reading of 91.8 from the originally reported 91.7, while home sales were expected to slip to a 6.32 million rate from 6.35 million in October. In the Chicago report, where any reading greater than 50 indicates expansion, the forecast was 62.
 Manufacturing at factories in the Chicago area expanded at a slower pace in December as orders fell from a nine-year high and inventories declined, the survey of purchasing managers showed.
 Investors and economists watch the Chicago area for clues about the direction of manufacturing because the region has more factory workers than any metropolitan area except for Los Angeles. Before the 2001 recession, Chicago had the most factory jobs. The nation's manufacturers have not yet begun to restore the 1.4 million jobs they have shed since the recession ended.
 The production index declined to 63.4 from 69, while the index of order backlogs fell to 50.8 from 59.6 in November.
 The inventories index dropped to 40.6 from 43.4 in November. Stockpiles have grown in only one month since March 2000. Rising orders and declining inventories suggest production will continue to increase to meet new orders.
 "Inventory declines suggest greater manufacturing activity down the road," said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research in New York. The regional report shows manufacturing "is still running at a swift pace, it's just the foot has been taken off the accelerator."
 The Commerce Department said earlier this month that business inventories fell to a record low relative to sales in October.
 Sales of previously owned houses backed off from a record pace set two months earlier. November was still the fifth month that sales exceeded a six million-unit pace, a level that had not been reached before.
 November sales of previously owned houses declined in all four regions. They fell 6.6 percent in the Midwest, 5.1 percent in the South, 4.1 percent in the Northeast and 2.4 percent in the West. 
 The median price fell 0.5 percent to $170,900 last month from $171,800 in October and is up 5.9 percent from the year-earlier month.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Boston Goes From Strong to Weak in a Short Time

BYLINE:  By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 29 

 BODY:
Its construction virtually complete, the newest downtown office tower here emits a distinct cobalt blue glow at night. 
 But with no tenants despite a three-year leasing effort, the $260 million 650,000-square-foot high-rise building assumes an ominous cast that reflects the weakening of an office market that a few years ago was among the strongest in the country. 
 Of the 57 million square feet of downtown offices here, about 9.9 million square feet, or 17.4 percent, is available for lease or sublease, up from 4.5 percent three years ago. In 1991, the last market trough, 16.2 percent was available. Asking rents average $34.61 a square foot a year, down 43.4 percent from $61.17 in 2000. 
 More worrisome, in the coming months another one million square feet may be back on the market, said William F. Collins, a senior vice president at Spaulding & Slye Colliers, a real estate services and development firm. The market has usually absorbed about one million square feet ofoffice space a year.
 "Two months ago, I thought the leasing market had turned the corner, but since then we've been hit by the perfect storm," Mr. Collins said, citing the mergers of Fleet Bank with Bank of America and of the insurer Manulife with John Hancock as well as the financial and job losses in a mutual fund industry faced with accusations of tainted trading practices. Over all, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Massachusetts lost 41,500 jobs this year, suggesting even further tenant consolidations.
 Slackening demand exerted more downward pressure on rents, making it difficult for the new building at 33 Arch Street to reach the rental goal of $40 to $60 square foot a year recently quoted by its developer, Dean F. Stratouly, president of Congress Group Ventures based in Cambridge.
 He said that he and his partners -- the National Electrical Benefit Fund, a pension fund, and Value Enhancement Fund IV, an investment fund based in Atlanta -- had established a reserve fund that would enable them to pay the expenses of an unoccupied building for two years. That sum is about $10 million a year, brokers and city officials estimate.
 "I'm confident we'll make some significant lease announcements early in 2004," said Mr. Stratouly, who leased 10,000 square feet of the building for his company, Congress Group Ventures. He noted that his investors may also put more money into the project. 
 Todd Johnson, director of Equity Real Estate for National Electrical, the pension fund of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said that he was investing in Washington, New York, San Diego and Chicago, and that Boston was considered one of the weaker United States markets.
 "The mutual fund and technology sectors have been very damaged in this recession," Mr. Johnson said. But he said of 33 Arch Street: "We think it's a fabulous investment; nothing else will be built here for a good while. We're in for the long term."
 But Lisa M. Campoli, executive vice president of Meredith & Grew Inc., a real estate services and development firm here, said a costly few years could lie ahead for the investors. She said that 33 Arch Street "is a new, quality building, but there will be a capital loss." 
 "The question," Ms. Campoli said of the capital loss, "is how big it will be, who carries it and will it result in a change of ownership."
 Indeed, lenders are increasingly finding themselves taking back deeds to office buildings in the metropolitan region, usually in properties outside the central business district. 
 The keys to a Boston office complex were returned to the lender last month, in what brokers said was the first time since the early 1990's such a transfer had taken place downtown. In November, the Boeing Company, which is based in Chicago, gave the deed to the 231,000-square-foot Lincoln Plaza back to Washington Mutual Inc. of Seattle. 
 Boeing had acquired the historic property, which was renovated in the 1980's, when it bought the Hughes Electronics Corporation in 2000, a Boeing spokeswoman said.
 Two weeks later, on Dec. 4, Credit Suisse First Boston took back the deed to a 410,000-square-foot office complex in suburban Wayland that was owned by Mr. Stratouly and a unit of Fidelity Investments. The lease of their anchor tenant, the Polaroid Corporation, was nullified as a result of the company filing for bankruptcy protection and the last Polaroid employees moved out in October. Mr. Stratouly's efforts to lease in the suburbs, where 29 percent of the 78 million square feet is available, were not successful.
 This bleak landscape bodes poorly for building values, Ms. Campoli noted. 
 "It's a bifurcated market," she said. "Buildings leased to high quality tenants are still rising in price, but values for other buildings are falling as owners decide to sell." 
 In 2003, commercial properties in Boston worth about $1.2 billion were sold, compared with $2 billion in 1999, Meredith & Grew said. This year's average sale price of $237 square foot is down from $267 a year ago. The rise in sale prices from 2000 to 2003 reflected late 1990's rents that reached $80 square foot. With rents lower and vacancies higher, she said, "over time, prices will flatten or decrease."
 In 2004, more building owners are expected to sell, Ms. Campoli said, motivated by a dwindling tenant pool and the expectation that whatever economic recovery occurs will be a gradual climb rather than a sudden bounce. "There will be a little more distress," she added, "and lenders who take back assets they don't want to manage will also sell."
 From his perspective, said Andrew M. Wright, senior consultant for Reis Inc., a real estate research firm based in New York, "It's a tenants' market." Based on availability rates, Reis rates Boston as 40th out of 50 United States metropolitan markets in terms of performance compared with fifth place at the end of 1999. 
 Now, the tumble reflects a weak economy that has reined in the demand for space. In the early 1990's, the tailspin of the commercial real estate market resulted from an oversupply of offices.
 For 33 Arch Street, this means that even if leases are signed, rents are not likely to surpass $45 a square foot for the best space, said Ronald K. Perry, an executive vice president at Meredith & Grew. "It's not realistic to expect more in today's market," he said. "The strategy there is to try to lease the low and mid-rise floors first."
 The building, which sits on a 20,000-square-foot parcel between the downtown retail and financial districts, was conceived in the 1980's by another developer. Construction of the glass-clad tower designed by Elkus/Manfredi Architects began in the summer of 2001. Only a few weeks of construction work remain, Mr. Stratouly said, but the official completion is set for April.
 Those involved with the building hope that past will not be prologue. Arch Street is in the historic Tontine Crescent, a district laid out for development by Charles Bulfinch, the architect of the Massachusetts Statehouse and other signature buildings of 19th-century Boston. 
 "Bulfinch," Mr. Stratouly explained, "went bankrupt on the project and spent the rest of his life working as an architect to pay off his debt."

U.S. Takes Steps to Keep Beef Parts Out of Food
The secretary of agriculture announced new steps the department would take to keep beef parts that might carry mad cow disease out of the nation's food supply, including banning the use of sick cows and speeding up testing to detect diseased animals.
 Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman issued the orders at the same time that federal trade representatives were trying to persuade Japan and South Korea to lift their bans on American beef. More than 30 countries have stopped buying American beef since the discovery last week of the first case of mad cow disease in the United States. Page A1. 

The Agriculture Department has issued a series of tougher meat regulations, including a recall on more than 10,000 pounds of meat from 20 cows that were slaughtered with the sick cow in Washington State. A15.

Domestic cattle ranchers and food companies said that they largely supported the Agriculture Department's decision to increase restrictions on beef production. A15.

To the Editor:
 In "The White-Collar Blues" (column, Dec. 29), Bob Herbert, writing about American companies' "offshoring" their workers, says, "Allowing this movement to continue unchecked will eventually mean economic suicide for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of American families." 
 Economic suicide? No. Economic homicide.
The offshoring of all kinds of jobs is killing our way of life. I wonder what these companies will do when there is no one left here who can afford their products.
I managed to fall from the middle class to the working class during the course of my lifetime. I tremble that my children might not even do that well.

HEADLINE: U.S. Issues Safety Rules to Protect Food Against Mad Cow Disease 

BYLINE:  By DENISE GRADY; Donald G. McNeil Jr., Anahad O'Connor and Colin Campbell contributed reporting for this article. 

 BODY:
The secretary of agriculture imposed a broad set of new rules yesterday to try to protect the nation's food supply from mad cow disease, including banning the use of sick "downer" cows and certain beef parts as well as ordering speedier testing of suspect animals. 
 Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman issued the orders at the same time that federal trade representatives were trying to persuade Japan, the largest importer of American beef, and South Korea to lift their bans on it. More than 30 countries have stopped buying American beef since the discovery last week of the first case of mad cow disease in a cow in the United States. Ms. Veneman said both trade and scientific issues had been considered in determining what actions to take. 
 Faced with plummeting cattle prices and analysts' warnings of potentially long-term economic effects from the restrictions imposed by other countries, spokesmen for the beef industry said yesterday that they generally supported the stricter rules. But consumer groups said the department should have acted years ago, instead of waiting for the first case to occur. 
The measures include an immediate ban on using animals that cannot walk because of injury or illness, or downer cows, to provide meat for humans. In addition, carcasses singled out to be tested for mad cow disease, most likely those of older cows or those with signs of nervous-system disease, will be kept until the results come back, instead of being butchered and sent to market immediately, as they have been until now.
Under the new protections, the Agriculture Department will also begin using a new identification system to track animals in the event of disease outbreaks.
In addition, brains, skulls, spinal cords, vertebral columns, eyes and certain nerve tissues from cows older than 30 months, as well as the small intestine from all cows, will also be banned from the food supply because they are most likely to harbor the agent that causes mad cow disease. But brains from younger animals will still be considered fit for human consumption.
Other new rules, also meant to keep high-risk tissue out of meat products, will require changes in the use of machines that remove meat scraps from bone and will ban a practice, air-injection stunning, in which air is blasted into an animal's skull to render it unconscious before slaughter.
At a news conference yesterday in Washington, Ms. Veneman said she was also appointing an international panel of scientific experts to review the new measures and recommend others if needed. 
"While we are confident that the United States has safeguards and fire walls needed to protect public health, these additional actions will further strengthen our protection systems," she said. 
Dan Murphy, a spokesman for the American Meat Institute, which represents some of the nation's largest beef companies, said: "This is a huge and dramatic and very positive step forward. It sends a message to consumers that they need not have any doubt in the safety of U.S. beef."
But in a statement, the organization said it believed the government had gone too far on some measures. The statement criticized the ban on downer cows and the extensive prohibition on certain cow parts, saying it went beyond what was necessary. 
Mr. Murphy said federal agricultural officials had worked with industry officials and kept them informed of the proposals to make sure the meatpacking industry could institute the changes.
"What they haven't done is lock themselves up in their Washington headquarters and write the rules without any sense of what's needed and what the impact will be on the industry," Mr. Murphy said.
Terry Stokes, chief executive officer of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said his group also supported the department's action.
"It was to enhance a safety system that we had in place, and just adds another layer of protection for our consumers," Mr. Stokes said.
But Caroline Smith DeWaal, a spokeswoman for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group, said: "The downer decision is a huge leap forward, but it's really too bad U.S.D.A. waited to take this step and others until after the first case was found. These are changes that many scientists and consumer advocates have been calling for for years." 
Gene Bauston, president of Farm Sanctuary, a group in Watkins Glen, N.Y., that has been petitioning the Agriculture Department since 1998 to stop allowing downers to be used as food, said: "We're hopeful that this is an outright ban on slaughtering downers. There has been some discrepancy in the past about what exactly is a downed animal. There's been a tendency to say that if an animal is just injured it's not a downed animal."
The decision to ban downer cows is based on the possibility that an animal unable to walk might have mad cow disease. That may be true even if an animal appears only to be injured because it may have hurt itself through lack of coordination -- a sign of the disease.
There are about 200,000 downers a year in the United States, out of 35 million cows slaughtered annually, and until now some of them -- including the Holstein that tested positive last week in Washington State -- wound up in the meat supply. That will no longer happen, but what will become of the downers is not clear.
Julie Quick, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department, said: "It's too soon to say. We need to develop a system to address downers at livestock markets and on the farm. We need to get to them for surveillance purposes, and we're still working on a system to do that."
If downer cows are not tested, cases of mad cow disease may be missed, since downers are more likely than healthy animals to be infected.
Similarly, Ms. Quick said, it is not clear what will be done with the brains, spinal cords and other parts that must be removed from slaughtered animals before the meat is processed.
"Under the current system, it would be a rendered product," Ms. Quick said, referring to the process in which animal remains are boiled down, dried and turned into powder that can be used in some animal feeds, fertilizers and other products. "Whether it would go into the feed supply is a question for the Food and Drug Administration to address. They are also looking at potential measures and options, but they haven't announced anything. It's too soon to say."
The Agriculture Department has said that the Washington State cow apparently came from a farm in Canada, where it may have been infected by contaminated feed more than six years ago, just months before a feed ban was imposed on rendered cattle parts that were considered the principal means of transmitting the disease. At yesterday's news conference, Dr. Ron DeHaven, the chief veterinary officer at the Agriculture Department, said officials were still trying to trace 81 other cows that may have been shipped to the United States at the same time.
"We are conducting a painstaking record review to determine the location of these cattle," he said. "Some were on the same premises as the positive cow."
Ms. Smith DeWaal said: "In 2002, we imported 1.7 million head of cattle from Canada. While U.S.D.A. is searching for these 81 cows, the problem may be much bigger."
Only one case of mad cow disease has been reported in Canada, in May, also from Alberta, where the Washington cow may also have originated.
The investigation into where the Washington cow was infected has sparked a bit of a border war between Canada and the United States, with Canadian officials asserting in the last week that they wanted to wait for DNA evidence as proof that the animal was born in Canada. 
Officials there alsohave pointed out that when the Canadian case was revealed in May, the United States imposed a complete and sweeping ban on Canadian beef. Canadian ranchers were suddenly cut off from their most important market and destination for 70 percent of Canada's beef exports. Now, there are too many live cattle not being sent to slaughter, cattle prices are depressed and some ranchers are facing the prospect of bankruptcy. The industry as a whole has lost more than $1 billion in sales since May because of mad cow disease.
The ban remained largely because Japan threatened to stop accepting United States beef exports unless certified and labeled to be free of meat or byproducts originating in Canada. American officials said that would be too costly given the highly integrated nature of the American and Canadian beef industries.
When the more recent case of mad cow disease was found in Washington last week, Canada's ban was more measured than that of the United States' seven months earlier. Canada restricted some American beef products, but the ban did not include the import of live cattle for immediate slaughter or boneless beef from cattle under 30 months old.

HEADLINE: Corporate Pensions Face Pressure Despite Stock Rally 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
This year's stock market rally has added more than $100 billion to corporate America's depleted pension funds, but even that has not been enough to offset forces that continue to weaken the funds.
 If all of America's 500 largest companies had to make good on their promises to workers and retirees immediately, they would have to plug a $259 billion gap in their pension funds, according to a study by Standard & Poor's which will be published soon. A year ago, even though stock prices were lower, the same companies were considerably closer to meeting their obligations, being only $212 billion short. 
 That is because their obligations to their workers have spiraled up at an even faster pace than stocks have risen. One obvious reason for this is that as the baby boom generation ages, many more people are starting to claim their money. Another factor is that many pension calculations incorporate several years' worth of data, to smooth out sharp fluctuations, so the market shocks of the last three years are still working their way through the system. Finally, an otherwise positive economic development, low interest rates, is an albatross on the funds because they magnify the value of future pension obligations in today's dollars. 
 Whatever the reasons, for the nation's corporate pension funds to have lost ground in this year's bull market suggests that the troubles that flared up in the bear market will not be easily cured, and almost certainly not by market gains alone. But after more than a year's search for solutions, officials with responsibility for the $1.6 trillion sector remain sharply divided on what to do.
 Some companies have found ways to bring their plans up to full funding, including General Motors, which started the year deep in the hole. But others, like UAL, the parent of United Airlines, remain burdened with woefully underfunded plans and lack the cash to make even the minimum contributions required by law. They are lobbying for changes in the rules.
 Most retirees continue to get their pension checks, to be sure. The pension system is not out of money, nor is it expected to run out in the foreseeable future. But over all, companies' pension assets are slipping further behind their obligations, renewing questions about whether enough money will be there for all of the 44 million Americans who have been promised pensions sooner or later.
 The nation's pension predicament has major implications for investors. For starters, it is difficult for them to calculate how much cash any given company's pension liability will pull away from the business. About three-fourths of America's 500 largest corporations, as well as tens of thousands of smaller businesses, offer traditional, defined-benefit pensions and are required to set aside money to pay them. While the companies are required to make good on them, these debts are rarely stated clearly on corporate balance sheets.
 "The investor has to figure out where the money's going to come from, and how it's going to affect the growth of the company," said Howard Silverblatt, the Standard & Poor's analyst who is compiling the pension study. The Financial Accounting Standards Board will begin requiring more disclosure of pension data starting in 2004, but not enough to satisfy the many critics of pension accounting.
 Even if the cash problem were solved overnight, another uncertainty would remain: where exactly should all the pension money be invested? For years, fund managers have collectively parked about two-thirds of their assets in stocks. But with the population aging and more and more pensions coming due, some specialists say a larger share should be shifted to safer investments like bonds. If that happens, the implications for the markets would be huge.
 As for solving the current cash crunch, Bush administration officials say recent events show that the current pension law is not enough. In two of the most destructive recent pension failures, Bethlehem Steel and U.S. Airways both followed the funding rules but ended up with huge deficits anyway, costing steelworkers and pilots more than $1 billion in lost benefits when the plans finally defaulted. 
 Earlier this year, administration officials pushed for an array of amendments to tighten the law. They called for making companies take the looming costs of older workers into account when calculating pension debt, for example; for fuller disclosure of pension information; and for higher pension insurance premiums for companies with high-risk investments. 
 But none of the administration's ideas have attracted much support in Congress, which must enact any amendments. Business groups and some unions have argued that the pension law is outdated and punitive and needs to be relaxed, not tightened. Unable to agree on a solution, Congress let a temporary relief measure that has reduced pension obligations for the last two years expire today. As a result, companies will suddenly owe substantially larger contributions -- about $35 billion more in 2004, according to government projections. 
 Companies expected to owe big pension contributions in the next two years include the Ford Motor Company; Delta Air Lines; AMR, the parent of American Airlines; ChevronTexaco; Delphi; DuPont; Hewlett-Packard; Halliburton; and Goodyear Tire and Rubber. For some, like Goodyear, scraping together the cash will be very difficult. For others, like Halliburton, it may be easier because military contractors are often able to pass through pension costs to the federal government. The companies have until April 15 to produce the cash. Members of Congress have promised to take up the pension issue when they come back late in January, and say they can enact pension relief retroactively. But companies say the uncertainty is meanwhile making planning difficult. Delphi, for example, has estimated that Congressional action could save it at least $750 million over the next five years. 
 Some companies are biting the bullet and making big contributions. A few, including General Motors, 3M, Honeywell International, Continental Airlines, Delphi, Maytag, Duke Energy, Boeing and ITT Industries, have even put in more than the legal minimum in recent months, reducing or wiping out their deficits.
 G.M. raised about $18 billion by issuing bonds and selling its Hughes Electronics subsidiary, partly to reassure investors alarmed by its disclosure earlier this year that its total worldwide pension shortfall had surpassed $25 billion, more than the company's entire market capitalization. 
 The move is considered a big factor in the nearly 50 percent run-up of G.M.'s stock price since the company began to lay out its plans last June -- even though the company still has billions of dollars of debt to repay, to bondholders, rather than retirees.
 Other companies are trying to decide whether to follow in G.M.'s footsteps. Delphi recently sold $400 million of trust preferred securities to raise money for its pension fund, and combined that with cash on hand for a $1 billion voluntary cash contribution. It says it will pump in another $600 million in 2004. 
 Some companies on tight budgets are turning to noncash assets to pump up their pension funds, though these contributions must often be approved by the Labor Department. U.S. Steel recently proposed putting the timber rights to 170,000 acres in Alabama into its funds, for example, and Northwest Airlines put in 13.3 million shares of stock in a subsidiary airline.
 Companies get tax deductions and increased profits due to a controversial accounting rule when they contribute their pension funds.
 Other remedies are also being pursued. At least half of all companies surveyed by the Fidelity Management Trust Company said they had been considering a radical restructuring of benefits. They are not allowed to retract benefits already earned by their workers, but they can "freeze" their plans in ways that prevent some or all employees from earning additional benefits. 
 Companies can also close their pension plans to new employees, and gradually shift their work forces into new, less generous plans that exert smaller claims on corporate cash. The CSX Corporation, a railroad, took these steps at the beginning of the year, and Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, CSX's chief executive when the changes were devised, has held them up as a model of fairness. 
 Other companies, like General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Verizon, have given workers a bonus rather than a pay raise this year, a potential brake on pension obligations that are often based on wages or salary. And Verizon says it has extinguished its pension debts to more than 20,000 employees this winter by persuading them to accept lump-sum payments instead. 
 The General Accounting Office spent several months this year trying to find out how many companies have frozen their pension plans since 2000, but concluded that the task was impossible because companies are not required to divulge the information. (They are required to tell the government when they cancel pension plans entirely, however, though such cancellations are uncommon at the moment.)
 Some companies, especially those like airlines that offer very rich benefits to some employees, have reached the point where they can no longer comply with the pension law and are requesting exemption from this year's contributions. The Internal Revenue Service declines to divulge the names of the companies that have sought such waivers, but it says their number has increased sharply this year. A few companies, like Northwest Airlines and United Airlines, have disclosed their applications for the waivers in their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 These financially strapped companies have also been lobbying Congress to reverse a 1987 law that requires them to make quarterly catch-up contributions, which United alone says would cost it $4.8 billion over five years and impede its struggle to emerge from bankruptcy. The House voted overwhelmingly to suspend those payments for the airlines, but the measure has stalled in the Senate, and the Bush administration has expressed firm opposition to such relief. 
 "Giving a special break to weak companies with the worst-funded plans is a dangerous gamble," said Steven A. Kandarian, executive director of the agency that insures pensions. "The risk is that these plans will terminate down the road even more underfunded than they are today. If that happens, workers will lose promised benefits and the pension insurance system will suffer additional multibillion-dollar losses."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 8, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Dec. 31 about efforts by big companies to address shortfalls in their pension funds included one company erroneously among those that are expected to owe large contributions in the next two years. Ford says it contributed $1 billion in late 2003 and will not be required to make more contributions any time soon.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: Chip Sales To Rise 18% In 2004 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 Global semiconductor sales will rise 18 percent next year, the biggest jump since 2000, on demand for personal computers and mobile phones, the International Data Corporation said yesterday. Worldwide chip sales will reach $188.8 billion in 2004, the market researcher said in a statement. 
International Data revised an April prediction of 16 percent after a "very strong recovery" in the second half of the year. Mobile-phone makers like Nokia are selling more as they benefit from demand for cheap handsets in emerging markets and as users in the United States, Europe and Japan buy phones with cameras and organizer functions. Economic growth and price cuts are helping to spur personal computer sales to consumers and businesses. In 2000, worldwide chip sales jumped 37 percent to $204 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. International Data expects 2003 revenue to grow 14 percent. From 2003 to 2008, the semiconductor market will grow at an annual growth rate of 12.5 percent, rising to $282 billion in 2008 from $160 billion this year, International Data said.

HEADLINE: In Sutton Place's Backyard, Private Oasis on Public Land 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
This is the story of the garden at 1 Sutton Place South, a verdant jewel atop Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive that serves as the lush backyard for one of the city's most exclusive addresses.
 It is an urban tale of blue-blood money, city planning, secret compacts and, ultimately, private control of public land. 
 The story goes something like this: In 1939, the city grabbed most of the co-op backyard under eminent domain to build what was then called the East River Drive. In turn, the city agreed to lease the land atop the highway back to 1 Sutton Place and its residents for $1 a year.
That lease, as it turns out, expired in 1990, but the board members at 1 Sutton Place admit that they, with great care, remained strategically mum about the lapse. They even swore prospective apartment buyers to absolute secrecy about the matter. 
Whether the city did not notice, or did not care, it had little to say about the garden that had become one of the building's great appeals. Neither the Dinkins, Giuliani or Bloomberg administrations made a move to repossess the property for 13 years.
Now, though, roughly seven decades after the city began building the F.D.R., the state needs to rehabilitate the highway, and to tear up the co-op's garden in order to get it done -- finally forcing into the open the question of who actually owns and controls the green oasis.
Sutton Place -- a stretch of blocks north of the United Nations and home at one time or another to Greta Garbo, Henry Kissinger and I. M. Pei -- has long been synonymous with wealth and exclusivity in Manhattan, where money alone does not always guarantee you an apartment. Gloria Vanderbilt once charged that River House, regarded as a quintessential Sutton Place address, denied her an apartment because of her friendship with the entertainer Bobby Short, who is black. The building's board said she simply did not have the money.
The residents of 1 Sutton Place -- the socialite C. Z. Guest once lived in the penthouse, the designer Bill Blass was a tenant, and the designer Carolyne Roehm lives there now -- want the lawn, the rhododendrons and the shade trees restored, and returned to their use. But the city may want it for a riverfront esplanade that would link the small city parks -- more brick courtyards than leafy green respites -- immediately to the north and south of the garden.
"The reconstruction of the F.D.R. provides an opportunity for us to consider creating an esplanade and connecting the adjacent parkland," said Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe.
That does not sit well with the residents of 1 Sutton Place, who pay millions of dollars for their apartments after meeting the stiff social and financial requirements of the co-op board.
Turning their backyard into a public esplanade "would ruin one of the most wonderful buildings in New York," said Betty Sherrill, a resident and former president of the co-op board. "That would be mean to all the people who live there. It'd be right in front of their windows. They paid a lot of money for those apartments. The city doesn't even keep up the parks on the right and left of us, much less the one in front of us."
The Parks Department has not yet broached the issue with the co-op. But the State Department of Transportation, which is spending $136 million to rehabilitate the F.D.R. from 54th to 63rd Streets, has promised the co-op that it will restore the garden when it is done, at an estimated cost of $400,000.
Still, the future of the garden, and whether it will be turned into a waterfront park for public use, could well become an incendiary issue for the residents along the neighboring blocks. They have long complained that there is too little public park space in the neighborhood.
"It's a touchy issue for us, to say the least," said Edward Rubin, a member of the local planning board, Community Board 6.
The 13-story Italian Renaissance building at 1 Sutton Place South was built in 1927 at a time when the city's social topography was undergoing an upheaval. The Vanderbilts, Morgans, Delanos, Havermeyers and other members of the city's elite were migrating from Fifth and Park Avenues farther east, buying newly renovated townhouses along what would become known as Sutton Place.
The Phipps family, whose fortune was based in Pittsburgh's steel mills, and the architectural firm Cross & Cross erected 1 Sutton Place on the site of a coal yard and brewery. Designed by Rosario Candela, the most sought-after architect for luxury buildings, the apartment house offered large three- and four-bedroom apartments, a triple-arched porte-cochere and a lobby with views of a private garden facing the East River.
The co-op was topped by a 17-room, 5,000-square-foot apartment and 6,000 square feet of terraces. It was originally created for Amy Phipps, who later turned it over to her son, Winston Guest, a well-known polo player, and his wife, C. Z. Guest. At one point, Janet Annenberg Hooker, a sister of Walter Annenberg, acquired the apartment, which was put on the market in 1998 for $15 million, at the time a record price.
In the 1930's, the city began construction of the East River Drive, taking away private gardens like the one at 1 Sutton Place and boat launches as it condemned land along the waterfront. Property owners formed the First Avenue Association to fight condemnation and assessments for the drive, but many owners cut their own deals with the city.
Under the terms of a 1939 agreement with the city, Paul Hammond, president of 1 Sutton Place, agreed to limit the co-op's claim for its land to $1 in return for the city's promise to build a double-decked roadway that would be covered by two feet of soil "suitable for planting."
Mr. Hammond, a real estate financier and yachtsman who won a 1928 race to Spain aboard his schooner Nina, ensured that the co-op could lease the land above the highway for a total of 50 years, with rent starting at $1 a year and rising to the grand sum of $1.46 a year in 1980.
The city-owned land accounts for 13,500 square feet of the co-op's 15,000-square-foot rear garden, according to the Department of Transportation.
The first threat to the patch of urban paradise came in 1990, when the lease expired. The co-op, for its part, said nothing, and oversight of the property was lost in the city's bureaucratic maze.
But three years later, Betsy Gotbaum, then the parks commissioner, sought to bring the co-op's garden under the control of her department, touching off a quiet debate over its fate. She noted in a memo at the time that the co-op was "very exercised about the possibility of this becoming a park."
Ms. Gotbaum, it appears, backed off pressing any case. In the memo, she concluded, "Since I am told that this is one of the 10 best residential buildings in Manhattan, it does not make sense to me for the city to create an improvement that will decrease the property value of the residences."
Ms. Gotbaum, now the city's public advocate, said in a recent interview that she did not recall details of the controversy, although she said, George Gould, the president of the co-op, was an old friend of her husband, Victor Gotbaum. A former municipal labor leader, Mr. Gotbaum worked with Mr. Gould during the dark days of the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970's.
The Parks Department became the technical custodian of the property in 1995. But nothing changed at 1 Sutton Place South, and the board took steps to keep it that way.
The members passed a resolution requiring all prospective buyers to review the semisecret status of the garden and sign a strict confidentiality agreement. The resolution explained that the board was not seeking to renew the lease because it would require a public review, which they apparently felt could go badly for the co-op's wealthy owners.
Secrecy is common in the world of New York co-ops, where many residents do not even know the names of their fellow shareholders, said Andrew Herz, the longtime lawyer for 1 Sutton Place, who helped draw up the resolution.
"Whenever you deal with something that is generally not for public dissemination, you ask people to sign a confidentiality agreement," Mr. Herz said. "People talk too much in this city anyway. We didn't want people talking about our private affairs."
Mr. Gould, the current president of the co-op and a former undersecretary of the treasury in the Reagan administration, explained that if the city did not bring up the issue, "we'd just let it go on."
As for the prospect of turning the garden into a public esplanade, Mr. Gould said: "It's not something that thrills me, in the sense of the hassle, noise and security issues. We originally owned the property down to the waterfront. It was my understanding that the lease was, in a sense, in lieu of compensation for taking the land. From our self-interested point of view, we would like to see it stay the way it is."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Marketers are preparing radio commercials that also send text messages to car dashboard displays.

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives

 BODY:
FOR marketers, it may finally be paradise by the dashboard light. Big radio companies like Clear Channel Communications and Infinity Broadcasting are equipping some stations with technology that broadcasts not just commercials but text messages that appear on car radio displays. And advertisers like First Charter Bank in Charlotte, N.C., which will use the approach in a campaign beginning in late January, are signing on to see whether extra text can give their spots extra heft.
 The technology -- called R.D.S., for radio data system -- has long been common in Europe and available in the United States, where it is gaining as cars increasingly come ready for the technology and radio stations compete more fiercely for ad revenue against satellite radio and other media. 
 But consumer advocates like Ralph Nader said the potential for driver distraction, not to mention irritation, could make dashboard advertising more boondoggle than boon. "Anything that keeps the eye off the road increases the risk of a crash," Mr. Nader said in a phone interview.
 Radio has weathered the recent economic slump better than some other media. Radio ad spending has nearly regained its losses since it sank in 2001. It rose to $19.4 billion in 2002 from $18.4 billion in 2001, according to the Radio Advertising Bureau in New York. Through September 2003, radio ad sales rose 2 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, the bureau reported.
 But most marketers and media executives, facing an uncertain economy and worried about devices, like TiVo, that permit viewers to skip commercials, feel heavy pressure to reach consumers in new ways, said Steve McKee, president at McKee Wallwork Henderson in Albuquerque. 
 "Advertisers are spending more and getting less because of what we call 'fragflation,' the fragmentation of audiences combined with media inflation," said Mr. McKee, who has worked extensively with text message marketing using cellphones. "They're desperately searching for new ways to reach prospects." Radio stations are also looking for new approaches. They have used the radio data system to promote concerts during songs by the appropriate bands and movies during songs by bands that play on the soundtracks. 
 For First Charter, a small bank with 53 branches in 17 North Carolina counties, generating attention can be tough amid better-financed campaigns from the much larger banks nearby, said J. Kevin Toomb, executive vice president and marketing director at the bank.
 "It's a crowded marketplace," Mr. Toomb said. "Any way we can stand out, we will do it."
 First Charter decided to add text messages to its radio ads after prompting from Planet Central, an agency with offices in Charlotte that was preparing the bank's next radio campaign. 
 Planet Central executives had seen that radio data system technology was used mostly to provide station, artist and song identification, said Steve St. Clair, managing partner and creative director. 
 "So we thought," Mr. St. Clair said, "why couldn't it contain some other information than 'Mariah Carey'?"
 While the script for the First Charter campaign is not final, the text portion is reasonably clear: "CALL NOW" and the bank's toll-free number are likely to flash in sequence across dashboard radio screens when First Charter spots play. Other messages might include "FREE CHECKING" or "FREE GIFT."
 Displaying the text while the commercial plays is important to consumer comprehension and satisfaction, Mr. Toomb said. "When the subject matter is consistent, the mind will process it better," he said. On the other hand, he added, "If they were listening to Shania Twain and a First Charter notice came up," they might become upset. 
 But Mr. Nader said the accumulation of dashboard devices like Global Positioning Systems and large map displays was already pulling drivers' eyes in the wrong direction.
 "All these kinds of distraction," he said, "add up to the following: the driver is paying more attention to the inside of the vehicle than the dynamics outside."
 Backers of radio data system advertising say they share some safety concerns and will keep their messages simple to minimize distraction.
 Dashboard ads also drew criticism for delivering advertising to yet another place that was once merely functional, as happened with automated teller machine screens, movie theater lobbies, elevators, taxis, cellphones, restrooms, gas station pumps and subway station floors.
 Gary Ruskin, executive director at Commercial Alert, a consumer advocacy group in Portland, Ore., called the text ads "the newest invasion of ad creep."
 "A lot of people enjoy a moment of solace in the car," Mr. Ruskin said. "Predictably, this will drive plenty of people nuts."
 Mr. McKee, the McKee Wallwork president, said the tempests over telemarketing and spam e-mail in 2003 showed that there were limits, particularly when consumers consider ads intrusive.
 "Just because you can advertise somewhere doesn't mean you should," Mr. McKee said. "Remember the 'do-not-call list'?"
 Executives involved with the radio technology disagreed, saying that some listeners may be put off but more will be receptive or at least open minded.
 "A listener of classical music may disapprove of these ads more than pop radio listeners," said Ryan Steelberg, president at dMarc Networks in Newport Beach, Calif., which offers radio data system content and services. 
 "There's a big opportunity for advertisers and marketers who are trying to get through to consumers through another medium," he said.

Dow Average Falls Slightly After a Year of Big Gains

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average fell for the first trading day in three yesterday after a decline in consumer confidence and slower-than-expected growth in Midwest manufacturing dented the optimism that had lifted the benchmark to its first annual gain in four years.
 "Investors are focused on profits, and to the extent they don't see as much near-term strength, it will cause them to back off a bit," said Joseph Stocke, who helps manage $500 million as chief investment officer of StoneRidge Investment Partners in Malvern, Pa. 
The Nasdaq composite index rose, finishing at the highest in almost two years for a second consecutive day.
 Shares of Alcoa, the world's biggest maker of aluminum, led the Dow's drop as some investors shifted out of stocks that have rallied this year and into groups that have lagged like telecommunications and energy. Boeing rose as it received Navy contracts worth as much as $9.6 billion. 
 The Dow shed 24.96 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,425.04. The Nasdaq rose 3.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,009.88. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 0.16 point to 1,109.64, the highest since April 2002.
 Benchmark indexes are headed for their first annual increase since 1999: the S.&P. 500 is up 26 percent, the Dow has added 25 percent and the Nasdaq has climbed 51 percent.
 Seven stocks rose for every five that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. About 978 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, the slowest full-day trading since August 29. The stock market is closed tomorrow for New Year's Day.
 Alcoa fell 80 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $38.11, for the biggest drop in the Dow average. The stock has surged 67 percent in 2003.
 Other stocks that have led this year's rally declined. Citrix Systems, a software maker that is up 75 percent this year, fell 34 cents, to $21.55. Allegheny Technologies, a maker of specialty materials including stainless steel, lost 48 cents, to $13.42 after more than doubling this year.
 Laggards like Qwest Communications International, the local-telephone company, and El Paso, the largest United States natural gas-pipeline owner, advanced. Qwest rose 17 cents, to $4.17 and El Paso added 8 cents, to $8.19.
 Boeing gained 28 cents, to $42.28. It was awarded $8.56 billion to build up to 210 Super Hornet fighter jets and a separate $979 million contract to create a new model capable of jamming radar. Shares of Northrop Grumman, the primary subcontractor on the project, lost 7 cents, to $94.97.
 Among technology shares, Cisco Systems, the largest maker of equipment to link computers, fell 28 cents to $24.12. I.B.M., the world's biggest seller of computer services, shed 89 cents, to $92.63.
 FedEx, the biggest overnight package-delivery company, lost 94 cents, to $69, after agreeing to acquire Kinko's from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, for $2.4 billion. FedEx said the purchase would add to 2005 earnings.
 Symbol Technologies rose 38 cents, to $17.23. The company, the world's largest maker of bar-code scanners, said its chief executive, Richard Bravman, had resigned as part of its efforts to resolve a government investigation into accounting practices.
 Rambus, a computer memory-chip designer, gained $3.27, to $29.77. Analysts said a competitor, Micron Technology, might have to pay Rambus to settle potential price-fixing charges. Micron lost 22 cents, to $13.73.
 The American depository shares of Trinity Biotech each representing one share, rose for a second day, gaining $1.05, to $6.19. Trinity, the Irish maker of blood tests, said Monday that it won United States approval to market its test for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell in New York as an index gauging consumers' outlook rose to the highest level since 2002, dimming the appeal of government debt.
 More investors are shunning Treasuries for riskier assets like stocks as analysts increase their forecasts for the economy in 2004. The 10-year note is headed for its first annual decline in four years.
 By late in the day, the 10-year note dropped 4/32 to 99 29/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.26 percent from 4.25 percent on Monday.

 HIGHLIGHTS

COURT APPROVES NUDE BARBIE -- Photographing a nude Barbie in a blender or sizzling in a wok is an artist's First Amendment right, a federal appeals court decided on Monday. Referring to Barbie's manufacturer, the court said, "Mattel cannot use trademark laws to censor all parodies or satires which use its name." The lawsuit, filed by Mattel in 1999 against the artist, Tom Forsythe of Kanab, Utah, had previously been dismissed by a federal judge in Los Angeles, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Forsythe, a self-described "artsurdist," posed the dolls in a series titled "Food Chain Barbie," which, he said, criticizes "the materialistic and gender-oppressive values" he believes the dolls embody. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said he had earned $3,659 selling postcards of the series. Mattel argued that the photographs of Barbie, frequently depicted in sexually provocative poses, would confused consumers into believing it endorsed the project. Writing for the three-judge appeals panel, Harry Pregerson said the lawsuit "may have been groundless and unreasonable." Mr. Forsythe called it "ridiculous." Mattel did not return calls seeking comment, The Associated Press said.

STATES TRIM ARTS BUDGETS -- Struggling for income, states are slashing their financing of theaters, museums and performance groups by nearly a quarter. The cut in annual state spending, to $272.4 million from $354.5 million, comes after Congress increased its allocation to the National Endowment for the Arts to $122.5 million from $115.7 million in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. Citing figures from the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, The Associated Press reported that California slashed its spending on arts by 90 percent, to $1.9 million in 2004 from $20.3 million in 2003. New York, while remaining the leading state supporter of the arts, trimmed its allocation to $44.7 million from $51.5 million.Florida, the next most generous arts supporter, went to $6.7 million from $30 million. Michigan cut its budget to $11.8 million from $22.5 million. Missouri eliminated any appropriation for the arts, but authorized $3.5 million in spending from a state-funded cultural endowment.

BRITNEY IN MOTION -- Britney Spears, left, has booked her first international performance of 2004. She is to appear on June 5 in Portugal at the Rock in Rio-Lisbon festival. The event, on May 29 to 30 and June 3 to 6, also features Metallica, Sting, Guns N' Roses and Slipknot. Ms. Spears, promoting her latest studio album, "In the Zone," plans a North American tour that begins on March 2 in San Diego and is expected to end on April 10 or 12 in New York, according to a Reuters-Billboard report.

TORONTO: THE DANCING STOPS -- After 20 years of showcasing contemporary dance from Canada and Europe, the biennial Festival International de Nouvelle Danse in Montreal has come to an end. The event, known as FIND, was voted out of existence by its board earlier this month, according to The Toronto Star. The festival, which had lost $200,000 in public financing since 2001, was a casualty of a $600,000 accumulated deficit.

SMOLDERING CURTAIN -- Vicki Lawrence, left, was singing "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia," her agent David Brokaw, said, when a smoldering curtain sent Ms. Lawrence and her audience out of a Nevada showroom where she was performing on Sunday night. About 750 people were watching the show at Don Laughlin's Riverside Resort Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nev., some 100 miles south of Las Vegas, when a fireproof curtain next to a stage lamp overheated and began to smoke, The Associated Press reported. Ms. Lawrence, a veteran of "The Carol Burnett Show," was unhurt. A stagehand was treated after inhaling smoke and fire-extinguisher fumes.

STONES: A NEW DVD -- A DVD recording of the daylong Rolling Stones concert that attracted more than 430,000 people to Downsview Park in Toronto on July 30 is to be released in the spring. The concert, intended to revive Toronto's economy after an outbreak of SARS, also featured AC/DC, Rush, Justin Timberlake and the Flaming Lips. According to a Reuters-Billboard report, the Stones' tour manager, Michael Cohl, said, "We're hoping by April or May to have it out." He told The Toronto Sun that all 13 performers in the event were recorded and should be included in the DVD, but it was not known if the entire concert would be released.

HEADLINE: LETTER FROM EUROPE; 
Russia and the Rich Western Neighbors: A Cold Peace

BYLINE:  By Steven Lee Myers

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
"By their mentality and culture, the people of Russia are Europeans," President Vladimir V. Putin said in an interview this fall, addressing the centuries-old choice here between East and West. 
 The real question, however, is whether Russia is -- or even wants to be -- part of today's Europe. 
 There is increasing evidence that the answer is no.
In the last few months, Russia and Europe have found themselves at odds, sometimes pointedly, over a raft of diplomatic, political and economic issues, belying the widely held notion that the collapse of the Soviet Union would herald Russia's ever-deepening integration into all parts of a new world order. 
No diplomat likes to say it, but the European Union's expansion next year -- along with NATO's -- is etching a new frontier across the Continent, enveloping the former Soviet republics of the Baltics and the former satellites of Eastern Europe into the elite clubs of democratic states.
The curtain across Europe may be less iron-clad than in the past, but there is no dispute that Russia is on the other side of it, not just politically and economically, but perhaps psychologically as well.
"Russia remains beyond the expanding West," Dmitri V. Trenin, deputy director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote this month in Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
In recent negotiations over joining the World Trade Organization and ratifying the Kyoto treaty on climate change, Russia has clashed fundamentally with Europe's vision on free markets and the environment. 
In its internal affairs, Russia has angrily dismissed European criticism of its gruesome war in Chechnya -- criticism more strident than any recently from the United States, which is more accepting of Mr. Putin's view that Russians in Chechnya are under attack from foreign Islamic militants.
Europe has also criticized the prosecution of the oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky and of its parliamentary elections earlier this month, which the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said raised doubts about "Russia's willingness to move towards European standards for democratic elections."
These are political -- and in some cases purely economic -- disputes, but something more profound is happening. 
To many Russians, Europe is more than just a geographic place. It is an idea. In Soviet times, it represented democracy and freedom, if also capitalist decadence. It is still the standard by which Russia is measured, almost always unfavorably. 
Increasingly, though, Europe is seen as little more than a source of money and goods, which have turned Moscow and other cities into oases of consumption and even luxury in a country still besieged by poverty and despair. After a tumultuous decade of painful economic reforms, more and more Russians seem willing to reject Europe as a democratic idea or model. 
In his four years in office, Mr. Putin has governed with an authoritarian hand, increasing the role of the security services, consolidating state control over television and business and otherwise rolling back some of democracy's basic, if messy freedoms. And he is overwhelmingly popular, heading into a re-election campaign next year essentially unchallenged. In the elections this month, the party defined by its fealty to him cruised to victory, crushing not only the Communists, but also two parties with liberal, pro-Western images and ideas, Yabloko and the Union of Right Forces. 
The election's biggest surprise was the success of two nationalist blocs, the Liberal Democratic Party led by the outlandish xenophobe Vladimir V. Zhironovksy, and a milder, more respectable version of it, Motherland.
Dmitri O. Rogozin, a leader of Motherland, said in a post-election interview that Russians have grown disenchanted with a decade of democratic experiment and what he called the broken promises of Europe.
"When democratic reforms were taking place in our country, people were willing to take on losses, such as the destruction of the Soviet Union," he said. 
"Everyone thought that this would lead to very close relations with the West, when everyone would live well, that there would be European standards of living, freedoms," he went on. "However, tomorrow has arrived, and it has turned out to be just as gloomy as yesterday."
What divides Russia and Europe is unlikely to become a chasm or start a new cold war. Russia, like the rest of the world, is susceptible to globalization. After its expansion, the European Union will account for more than half of Russia's foreign trade, making cooperation, if not integration, essential.
Sergei O. Sokolov, head of the Foreign Ministry's department for European relations, called the disputes with Europe -- over everything from duties to visas -- the inevitable growing pains of closer relations. But he added that Russia drew a distinction between integration "with" Europe and integration "into" it, one meaning cooperation, the other membership. 
The Russia he described will be an independent power, a proud nation that expects to be treated as an equal of Europe, not a part of it.
Mr. Trenin, in his article, agreed, but warned that Russia was creating the foundations for "a new isolationism," though not necessarily within its own borders. 
In recent months, Russia has aggressively wielded its diplomatic and economic influence in its traditional dominion along the arc of Europe's new frontier.
In Georgia, Russia has provided succor to two separatist enclaves. In Moldova, Mr. Putin tried to broker a settlement of another separatist conflict that would ensure the presence of Russian troops indefinitely. In Lithuania, President Rolandas Paksas faces an impeachment battle over accusations that he became susceptible to Russian influence.
Russia's actions abroad, like those at home, have raised concerns in Europe, deepening distrust of Mr. Putin's commitment to a democratic course. In the near future, Mr. Trenin wrote, Europe and the United States "will treat Russia as though the Soviet Union has been replaced by its czarist predecessor."
If Europe is keeping Russia at arm's length, so is Russia keeping Europe.
"More and more, Russian leaders are viewing the West as a source of resources for modernization and geopolitical challenges -- not as a common home where Russia itself may find its proper place," Mr. Trenin said.
Mr. Putin, in the interview, completed his answer by emphasizing, twice, that Russia had no intention ever to join the European Union. Whatever its cultural ties to Europe, Russia's relations will be limited up to what he called the "historic horizon."
"It is up to a new generation of decision makers in Russia," he said, "to see to it how the relationship between Russia and the European Union develops."

HEADLINE: Democratic Candidates Differ On Economy, but Often Subtly 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
As the Democratic presidential candidates put the economy at the front and center of their campaigns, their differences boil down to a handful of issues: how much to roll back tax cuts, how much to raise spending, how much to reduce deficits and how to approach trade.
 But the dividing lines are often subtle. The rival platforms can look like different sides of a Rubik's Cube: varying combinations of the same basic proposals. 
 All the candidates say they would repeal at least some of the tax cuts enacted during the Bush presidency, a high-risk stance that amounts to running for office on a pledge to raise taxes. The last Democratic presidential candidate to try that was Walter F. Mondale, who offered it in 1984 as part of a deficit reduction plan; he lost to President Ronald Reagan in a landslide. 
Most of the candidates have also proposed large new health care programs, with Representative Richard A. Gephardt's the most ambitious, costing more than $200 billion a year. And none of the candidates have fully explained how to steer the federal budget back from the Bush-era deficits to the surpluses created in the Clinton administration.
"Everybody would like to protect tax cuts for the middle class, have universal health care and do dramatically better on the deficit," said Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton who has advised a number of the current Democratic campaigners. "The first thing you learn when you do the numbers is that you can't do all that."
The principal differences among the candidates lie in their tone and philosophy toward business and free trade. The debate on those issues leaves them sounding at times as if they are far more divided over Mr. Clinton's economic legacy than President Bush's, which they uniformly condemn.
Mr. Clinton was the Democrat who gave his party a new message, declaring that "the era of big government is over" and preaching budget restraint, middle-class tax cuts and free trade.
The candidates who view themselves as heirs to Mr. Clinton's approach position themselves as more friendly to business and would retain much of Mr. Bush's tax cuts. They continue to support free-trade agreements despite fierce complaints by some manufacturers and labor unions of devastation wrought by cheap imports from China and brutal competition from Mexico.
"Are we going to build on the pro-growth, pro-jobs, fiscally responsible, strong-on-security, socially progressive legacy of Bill Clinton?" Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut asked in a speech in New Hampshire this month. Or, he continued, "are we going to fall back on the failed policies and positions of the past?"
Others are calling for a new era of more activist government; the most concrete differences among these candidates are how much they would raise taxes and how much they would spend on programs like new health care initiatives.
Mr. Gephardt, of Missouri, and Howard Dean, former governor of Vermont, would repeal all tax cuts enacted in the last three years, including popular provisions like the one allowing a bigger child tax credit and another eliminating the "marriage penalty" under which some two-income couples paid more in taxes once they married and began filing jointly.
Mr. Gephardt and Dr. Dean have both offered expensive new health care plans, with Mr. Gephardt proposing to spend more than $2 trillion over 10 years, and Dr. Dean nearly $1 trillion. "While Bill Clinton said that the era of big government is over, I think we have to enter a new era for the Democratic Party," Dr. Dean declared not long ago.
The Democratic candidates are also polarized on the issue of trade, a decade after Mr. Clinton won Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, with Mexico and Canada, and stood against his party's core supporters in organized labor.
Mr. Gephardt voted against Nafta, as well as Mr. Clinton's trade agreements with China and the World Trade Organization. He has vowed to renegotiate all those accords and has called for an "international minimum wage" that would raise workers' pay among exporting countries where cheap labor keeps costs low.
"Our trade policies remind me of the Red Sox sending Babe Ruth to the Yankees," Mr. Gephardt said recently. "They are bad deals that haunt us."
Two other candidates, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and the Rev. Al Sharpton, would go further still: they want all three agreements repealed.
As for Mr. Lieberman, John Kerry and Carol Moseley Braun, they all voted for free-trade deals in the Senate, and still defend them. 
Dr. Dean has flipped back and forth on trade. Though a supporter of Nafta when he was governor of Vermont, he began his presidential campaign by proposing that the United States reduce trade barriers only with countries that adopt American standards on labor and the environment. He later retreated, saying that trading partners need adopt only basic standards like allowing collective bargaining.
But all the candidates, acknowledging the anger in many states about the loss of jobs to China and Mexico, say they would be much tougher in acting against "unfair" trade practices.
The national economic challenges that the current candidates survey are certainly as formidable as at any other time in recent years. Despite accelerating economic growth, unemployment remains stubbornly high. And the government's long-term fiscal outlook is ominous, with economists across the political spectrum warning that without drastic action, the wave of retiring baby boomers will bring such high costs for Social Security and Medicare that the nation will face crushing debt.
Many of his critics argue that Mr. Bush has helped create the long-term problems by cutting taxes at a time of high spending on the military and domestic security. But the Democratic candidates have themselves avoided laying out any long-term strategies. And though all have attacked the president for record deficits that could total $5 trillion over the next decade, none have offered more than hazy proposals for balancing the budget.
In any event, the various campaigns do differ substantially on how they would handle taxes. Mr. Gephardt and Dr. Dean would erase all of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, meaning a net tax increase that could exceed $2 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Gephardt would essentially spend all that money on a universal health care program that would cost about $214 billion in the first year alone. Dr. Dean has proposed a health care plan that would cost about $88 billion a year, or some $900 billion over 10 years.
The candidates whose stances more closely resemble Mr. Clinton's -- Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kerry, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina and Gen. Wesley K. Clark -- would repeal tax cuts only for families earning more than about $200,000 a year. These candidates, who are positioning themselves as centrists, would reduce deficits a little more quickly than Dr. Dean or Mr. Gephardt, given the size of the Dean and Gephardt health care plans. But though they would raise about $1 trillion by scaling back the Bush tax cuts, they too would spend much of that on expanded health care and other programs.
Mr. Lieberman, meanwhile, would restructure all the tax rates, pushing up the top bracket to 39.6 percent and creating a "recapture" tax that would raise rates even higher for those families with incomes above $250,000. Campaign officials say the net result would be $1.1 trillion in additional tax revenue over 10 years, and a reduction in taxes for 98 percent of taxpayers.
Mr. Edwards as well would try to reduce taxes on middle-income households. His plan calls for about $160 billion in new tax benefits, including a tax credit against down payments on a home and lower taxes on dividends for middle-income households.
Mr. Kerry would retain the Bush tax cuts for people below the top brackets, and would add new benefits like a tax credit to offset college tuition costs.
Proposals to cut spending are in short supply. Mr. Edwards has called for a 10 percent reduction in federal workers. But he has not proposed to reduce spending by the full amount saved, and he would not impose the reduction on military programs and domestic security.
General Clark has outlined a plan to save $2.3 trillion over 10 years. But $600 billion of that would come from a reduction in costs for debt service, a calculation that assumes interest rates remain low. An additional $300 billion would come from closing corporate tax loopholes, though those could not be closed without big fights in Congress. And $225 billion would come from the perennial category of future savings: greater efficiency.
Dr. Dean has campaigned as a devout believer in fiscal discipline, but he has not set out any timetable for balancing the budget, saying only that he would put the government "on a path" toward balance.
Mr. Kerry has pledged to reduce the deficit in half by the end of a second presidential term. That may well be a realistic goal, but it is less ambitious than Mr. Bush's pledge to cut the deficit in half after only five years.
Given the constraints, experts say, all plans inevitably have a pie-in-the-sky quality.
"Whoever is president in 2005 is going to be staring at a gigantic budget hole, and filling that hole will be a monumental task," said Alan Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton University who has advised both Dr. Dean and Mr. Kerry. "You have to make a distinction between someone's desires and what they can actually do."

The Issues
This is the first in a series of articles comparing the policy positions of the Democratic candidates for president.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 8, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A grouping of thumbnail sketches on Dec. 31 with a front-page article about the economic proposals of the Democrats seeking the presidential nomination referred incorrectly to Gen. Wesley K. Clark's plans for spending on large health care programs. He has indeed offered specifics: $695 billion over 10 years, partly to guarantee coverage to all uninsured Americans under 22 and to subsidize insurance for those who have trouble paying for it. The sketches also misstated the positions of John Edwards and Howard Dean on Nafta. They say they will indeed renegotiate it and other trade agreements.

HEADLINE: How Disappearance in '84 Blighted Family in Iraq 

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 30 

 BODY:
A month after American troops occupied Baghdad, the family of Dr. Taki al-Moosawi was gathered at his Baghdad home, watching one of the Arab satellite channels that have become popular since the toppling of Saddam Hussein made it possible for any Iraqi, not just the ruling clique, to have satellite receivers.
 And suddenly there it was: Old film clips of executions looted from the archives of the General Security Directorate, the most powerful of Mr. Hussein's secret police agencies. There, too, in the last terrifying moments before he was blown apart by a grenade his executioners had taped onto his chest, was the nephew who had disappeared without trace more than 18 years before, Mehdi Salih al-Moosawi. 
 When the secret police came for him and other males in the family in December 1984, Mehdi was a quiet 22-year-old student at a Baghdad technical college, a karate champion just back from service as an infantryman in the Iran-Iraq war, the father of two infant children. 
He was accused, along with Dr. Moosawi, of planting bombs in Karamanah Squarein Baghdad, though Dr. Moosawi says that the charge was false and that the real offense was speaking, among friends, in ways that were critical of Mr. Hussein.
In all the years since Mehdi's arrest, there had been no rest in the search for his nephew by Dr. Moosawi, a British-trained physiologist. The doctor himself was released after several months, on the intervention of an acquaintance who was a cousin of Mr. Hussein, but he was haunted, he says now, by the anguish of having left Mehdi in the dungeons of the secret police headquarters in central Baghdad.
When he saw the tape on Al Jazeera, an Arab station that has frequently been criticized for whitewashing Mr. Hussein's rule, Dr. Moosawi said, he was overcome with anger and disgust, as well as shame that it had been Mehdi who died, not him. He also felt at that moment, he said, that any price Iraqis paid for the overthrow of Mr. Hussein, including the ravages of the American invasion, had been worth it.
"In my own mind, I was already dead from the moment that Mehdi disappeared," he said. "I wished only that it could have been me, sitting there in the desert. Only later on, when I remembered that the Americans had come here to end this terror, did I begin to think, well, we were all dead, but we have been resurrected, we have been born again."
What happened to Mehdi, and what became of his family as they balanced their quest for him with a relentless theater of fealty to Mr. Hussein, is a grim -- and grimly familiar -- parable of the terror inflicted on 25 million Iraqis during the 24 years of Mr. Hussein's rule. 
The critical view the family now takes of the American-led occupation may also hold clues for the United States as it confronts a brutal insurgency and grapples for some formula that will bring American troops home.
"They did a very good job for America and for Iraq in getting rid of Saddam, and we thank them," Dr. Moosawi said. "Now, they are young boys lost in a foreign country, and every day there is a bomb in the road. They live a terrible time. So please tell them, we would like that they would leave our country as soon as possible, as soon as they have arranged a stable government to replace Saddam."
Dr. Moosawi embodies much of what America has brought to Iraq. On the instruction of American officials, all 63 of Iraq's universities and technical colleges held elections this summer for presidents, vice presidents and deans; Dr. Moosawi, once a pariah among his colleagues because of the taint he bore from his brush with the secret police, is now vice president of Mustansiriya University, a proud if dilapidated institution in Baghdad that was founded by one of the ruling caliphs of the Islamic world in the 13th century.
Through all the years of the search for Mehdi, the family's hopes had been sustained by contacts with a senior officer in the mukhabarat, one of the prime agencies in Mr. Hussein's constellation of secret police agencies, which exacted money from the family, saying it would buy food, clothes and medicine for Mehdi in an undisclosed prison. It was a deceit of a kind that became common as Mr. Hussein's government came ever more to resemble an entrenched mafia whose brutality and greed metamorphosed into unrelenting terror.
The Moosawis suffered as grievously as any other from that murderous terror, Dr. Moosawi said, listing 9 members of the extended family who were executed under Mr. Hussein, and 30 others who are still missing, presumed dead, after being taken away by the dictator's enforcers.
Yet nothing had prepared the family for seeing the horror of Mehdi's end in the secret police film, which is available on a compact disk that sells on handcarts in bazaars all over Iraq. Dr. Moosawi, 50, hands copies of the CD to visitors to his university office, although he says he and most other members of the family, including Mehdi's father, Salih, and his mother, Zeineb, have never been able to watch through to the film's dismal end.
The CD shows Mehdi, sometime in 1985, emerging with two other young men from a white van, at what is said by the narrator to be an execution site in the flat, hot desert outside Baghdad. Their hands are bound behind their backs, and they have rags, in Mehdi's case a green bandanna, for blindfolds. 
A group of men led by Ali Hasan al-Majid -- Mr. Hussein's cousin, known as Chemical Ali for his role as commander of Iraqi forces that used chemical weapons to attack a Kurdish town, Halabja, in 1988 -- stand at ease, cheering and clapping as the death sentences are read.
But these, it quickly becomes clear, are to be no routine deaths. The revolutionary court has condemned the three young men to hanging, the narrator says, because of their complicity in bombings that killed many people, including "women and children," in Baghdad. But President Hussein has ordered an exemplary punishment: that the condemned will be "blown to pieces," the narrator says, quoting from the document being read to the men in the desert.
One by one, the men are led forward to a mound of earth bulldozed as a sort of blast shield, and forced to sit down, cross-legged, on the ground. A man wearing a watch with Mr. Hussein's face on the dial then approaches, slips a grenade into the breast pocket of each of the victims, then closes the pocket by securing it with white medical tape. A wire runs back toward the execution party, linked to a battery and a detonator.
Each of the first two men is blown apart within seconds, their dismembered bodies lying in the fold of the earthen mound as Mehdi, in a brown track suit top, is led forward to his end. As the grenade is fixed and the tape secured, his bandanna, around the lower part of his face, slips further. Moments before the end, he looks up to his left, a slight, lightly moustached young man with a look of terror in his eyes, and says four or five words to the man leaning over him. On the tape, the words are indecipherable.
Then the detonator is pressed, and Mehdi disappears in a cloud of smoke and dust. The execution party walks away, led by Mr. Majid, laughing and congratulating each other. Mr. Majid, who later commanded troops who occupied Kuwait in August 1990, is now a prisoner himself, captured by American troops in Mosul in August. He was No. 5 on the list of 55 "most wanted" members of Mr. Hussein's leadership, and is likely to be among those, along with Mr. Hussein, who was captured himself on Dec. 13, who will face war crimes trials before Iraqi courts.

In the Dungeon
After 19 Years, Memory Still Stuns
Dr. Moosawi is a busy man these days. In his outer office at Mustansiriya University sits an American-trained Iraqi bodyguard with a pistol in his waistband, surrounded by dozens of petitioners seeking dormitory rooms, jobs as teachers and guards, scholarships and other favors that Dr. Moosawi can grant as the university's chief administrator. He also supervises postgraduate students in physiology at the medical school.
By his own account he is a quiet man, scion of a prominent Iraqi Shiite family respected for lineal ties that reach back to the Prophet Muhammad, and to a school of Islam that emphasizes tolerance, humanity and progress.
But when he sat down to tell Mehdi's story, and his own, he appeared to move into another world, speaking in a monotone that continued for two hours and more at a time, without interruptions from others in the room, without inflection or overt sign of emotion beside a gaze fixed on the carpet and the occasional wringing of his hands.
His descent into the gulag began at the University of Dundee, in Scotland, where he completed his doctorate between 1977 and 1984. They were years that bracketed Mr. Hussein's ascent to the presidency in 1979, and the Iraqi attack that began the war with Iran in 1980, leading by 1988 to a million dead on the two sides. As Dr. Moosawi told it, he left an Iraq at peace, in the middle of an oil boom that financed great progress in education, medicine and other fields, and returned on holiday in 1981 to a nightmare.
"I had a problem with Saddam right from the start," he said, speaking in a sometimes rusty, slightly Scottish-inflected English. "There were all those wounded people from the war, with no medical attention at all. There was no care for the families of the soldiers killed. On the radio, there were these songs with words that talked of the war as your lover. I was confused. War means killing, war means death. How can it be your lover?
"Everything had changed. The attitude was, 'Either you are fighting, or you are not an Iraqi citizen.' Everything was military, and everywhere the color was khaki. All your friends were in the army, or the people's militia. A lot of bad habits had been initiated among the ordinary people, like cheating, telling lies and spying. Schoolchildren were encouraged to spy on their parents, and wives on their husbands, and of course this led to the destruction of the family."
Back in Scotland, Dr. Moosawi spoke to fellow Iraqi students of his contempt for Mr. Hussein. Then, in June 1984, he returned to Iraq. 
The first sign of trouble came when the Health Ministry refused to certify his Ph.D., barring him from working. Then, in December 1984, he said, 50 armed men from the secret police burst into the home of his older brother, Salih al-Moosawi, Mehdi's father, and arrested the two brothers, a cousin and two of Dr. Moosawi's nephews, one of them Mehdi.
His vision blinded by blackened, wraparound glasses, Dr. Moosawi said, he was driven to the General Security Directorate, which was then scattered around a score of old buildings in one of Baghdad's most historic sections and known as the White Palace, after a porticoed mansion once owned by a queen of Iraq. Long ago the houses had been owned by Jewish merchants; by the 1980's, the Jews were all gone, and the mansions had been converted to interrogation centers.
"They said, 'All of you have to be executed; all of you have to be destroyed,' " Dr. Moosawi said. " 'None of your family has to stay alive.'
"Before we got in the car, a very bad man pointed his gun at me and said, 'You are to be killed now.' An officer came out and said, 'What are you doing?' and he said, 'He swore against Saddam Hussein.'
"It was not true, of course. The officer told the man to put his gun away."
At the interrogation center, the men were taken down stairs into a pitch-black basement, then separated. Dr. Moosawi's cell was just large enough for one man to sit, and two to stand, with an earthhole in the corner for a toilet. Mehdi was taken to another cell, and never seen again. It was bitterly cold and damp, Dr. Moosawi said, and women could be heard weeping somewhere in the dark.
Weeks passed, then months. Betweeninterrogation sessions, the only contact with guards was when bread crusts were thrown into the cell. 
"We didn't know if it was night or day," Dr. Moosawi said. "I told my nephew and my cousin, 'This is the time of our death, and we have to be patient, and strong.' " 
Guards taunted them. "They said, 'Well, you are a doctor,' " he recalled. "I said, 'Yes,' and they laughed and said: 'Forget about it. It's all over for you. You will be buried here.' "
Finally, he was taken from the cell, up the stairs and into the presence of an officer, who told Dr. Moosawi he was to be released. 
"Up the stairs I saw something I had forgotten, the sunlight," he said. "I thought, they will drive me to another place of execution. I said to the officer: 'Would you do me a favor, please: execute me here. I don't want to wait.' And he said: 'Dr. Taki, you are my friend. Honestly, you will not be executed. You are free.' "
Later, Dr. Moosawi learned that an Iraqi he had met in Britain -- a cousin of Mr. Hussein's, though Dr. Moosawi says he did not know that -- had visited his Baghdad home by chance, learned of his arrest, and intervened to have him released. Also freed were Mehdi's father and the two other men, but not Mehdi. Dr. Moosawi's name was placed on the secret police's special watch list of potential traitors.

After the Dungeon
A Time of Searching, A Time of Hate
At home Dr. Moosawi found the women in black, mourning men they had presumed lost forever. Remembering that, he paused, and wept silently into a handkerchief. After a full minute, he resumed.
Eventually, Dr. Moosawi got a job teaching at Mustransiriya, but colleagues avoided him. Friends stopped contacting his family, except for a few who came late at night or telephoned using false names. 
Payments were made to the secret police officer who promised to look after Mehdi. But asking about his whereabouts, at secret police headquarters and prisons, was dangerous. "We'd say, 'Give him to us, and let us have a gun, and we will kill him,' " Dr. Moosawi said. "Of course, it was a lie."
Another war came in 1991, after the Iraqi seizure of Kuwait, and Mr. Hussein's grip tightened still further. Economic conditions worsened under the United Nations sanctions imposed after the Kuwait invasion. Virtually the whole economy turned into a black market, controlled by Mr. Hussein and two of his sons. By the mid-1990's, with the Iraqi currency thoroughly devalued, Dr. Moosawi's salary as a full professor came to be worth barely $2 a month. 
But he had something most Iraqis did not: a certain immunity to fear.
"I had learned, No. 1, that I wasn't afraid of death; No. 2, that I wasn't afraid of a hard life," he said. "I'd seen the worst, and I believed I should give as much as I can. I worked day and night at the medical school, and tried not to think about anything else."
A marked feature of Dr. Moosawi's account was that for long periods he barely mentioned the name of the fallen dictator, as though unwilling to invoke it. 
Now, nine months after the American occupation began, mass graves are being exhumed all across the country, and charges of war crimes and genocide weighed against Mr. Hussein, whose secret police, by estimates of Iraqi human rights groups, may have killed 300,000 to one million Iraqis.
Though American troops captured Mr. Hussein in a bunker near Tikrit, many Iraqis say privately that he still casts a long shadow, and that his loyalists, insurgents now, can still strike with ambushes, assassinations and roadside bombs. Dr. Moosawi said any killer could enter hisoffice in the throng of petitioners, and that, for his family's sake, he should be careful when saying anything about Mr. Hussein.
Still, the picture he painted of Iraq's last years under the dictator suggested that Mr. Hussein's psychological hold on Iraqis, through the terror, had eroded fast after the 1991 war over Kuwait. 
"If you had come to me and asked me about Saddam Hussein a year ago, I would have told you that he was a hero, that the Iraqi people love him," Dr. Moosawi said, "because if I tell you the truth I'll be finished. They will kill me."
But secretly, Dr. Moosawi said, Iraqis had decided, after Kuwait, that the dictator had to go. "After the war with Iran ended, with nothing gained and everything lost, people thought Saddam would become like a priest, that he would pay for what he had done by becoming a very good man. Then, in two years, he attacked Kuwait, and even people who had doubted it understood that the government of Saddam was against the people."
Secretly, Dr. Moosawi said, he began meeting with others at the university, forming the nucleus of a group of intellectuals who have since formed a society to work for a re-birth of Iraq. At home, a year ago, he and his family watched the drumbeat of yet another approaching war, this time with the Americans coming to overthrow Mr. Hussein.
Their fear, he said, was that President Bush would compromise with Mr. Hussein at the last moment, giving him a reprieve of the kind he gained when American troops stopped at the Iraqi border in 1991. 
"We wished that Saddam would leave without a war, but unfortunately this didn't happen," Dr. Moosawi said. "So we Iraqis came to a place where we said, 'We will have to sacrifice something to have our freedom,' and the war fought by the Americans was the price."
When American advance columns arrived in Baghdad on April 9, he said, and appeared on television assisting in the toppling of Mr. Hussein's statue in Firdos Square, there was joy among the Moosawis that there had not been since Mehdi disappeared. 
"I went to my brother to congratulate him", he said, speaking of Salih, Mehdi's father. "It was like we were dreaming. There were tears and smiles. Everybody was laughing and crying."
But in the months since, the mood among the Moosawis has soured, and not only because of the bitterness of learning, after weeks of visiting virtually every secret police station in Iraq, and scanning lists of political prisoners posted on lampposts and trees, that Mehdi would not be coming back. The Americans, Dr. Moosawi said, have failed the high expectations of Iraqis and have sunk so low in popularity that most cannot wait to see them go home.
"It is freedom the Americans have given us, but it is not good freedom," he said. "Yes, we wanted freedom against dictatorship, truth against lies, education and progress instead of pushing the intelligentsia down. But what have we got? There is no law, we live in the dark without electricity, there are no police to stop the thieves, nobody to control the traffic, no gasoline.
"In those respects, we say, 'Things were better under Saddam.' "

Reverse Commute: Bringing the Office to the Employee

BYLINE:  By IRA BRESKIN

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, N.Y., Dec. 24 

 BODY:
For Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the satellite office it opened in this Long Island town more than three years ago for some of its technical specialists has paid off in the ability to attract and retain prized professionals. 
 The convenience attached to working in the 2,500-square-foot, second-floor office at 1300 Veterans Memorial Highway helped the firm in its recruitment of talent for its eight-member technical design team, said Carl Galioto, a partner who leads its technical division. Moreover, he said, there has been no turnover. 
 Skidmore, Owings & Merrill opened the office in May 2000 as "an experiment, trying something new," Mr. Galioto said, because of the hard time it had hiring recruits who were based in New York City before the industry downturn several years ago. 
 The firm chose the location essentially to re-enlist Eric Van Epps, 37, who is now the co-manager of the Hauppauge office. He had left several years earlier, worn down by the daily almost four-hour round-trip commute between his home in Suffolk County and the firm's headquarters in downtown Manhattan. 
 "If you ever open a Long Island office, let me know," Mr. Van Epps told management after leaving the firm.
 Skidmore, Owings & Merrill took the bait and brought the Long Island operation to Mr. Van Epps's doorstep -- actually to his basement -- until it rented suitable commercial space and hired a staff.
 The team in Hauppauge -- three architects and five technical professionals, including Mr. Van Epps -- work with designers and third-party consultants to produce unglamorous but critically important contract or construction documents. These detailed technical documents typically include architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical and plumbing drawings and specifications. 
 Suburban staff members are "a pressure relief valve," handling the overload that is generated primarily by the firm's almost 300 employees on Wall Street, as well as an office in Washington, Mr. Galioto said.
 In fact, technical document production, the most labor-intensive part of building design, is easily subdivided, he said.
 Apart from luring technical talent attracted by the short commute to their Long Island homes, the Hauppauge office also offers significant economic advantages over the firm's Manhattan office. Operating costs, primarily rent, are about a third less, Mr. Galioto said.
 Ann M. Roland, a senior associate at Fox & Fowle, an architecture firm in New York, said that housing technical architects at a remote location is logical because office-based client meetings are infrequent late in the design cycle, when construction drawings typically are prepared. 
 Skidmore, Owings & Merrill's Hauppauge location, less than a mile north of the Long Island Expressway, offers several logistical advantages. The office is less than a 10-minute drive from the Long Island Rail Road's Central Islip station, providing a direct link to Midtown. Staff members can reach project sites throughout the United States by catching flights at Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma, about seven miles away. 
 And the Long Island location appeals to potential clients with local projects, Mr. Van Epps said.
 Apart from its Manhattan and Hauppauge locations, the 67-year-old Skidmore, Owings & Merrill operates full-scale offices in Chicago, London and San Francisco and smaller design facilities in Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Washington.
 Admittedly, working at a remote location can also present challenges. The designers in Hauppauge do not enjoy some benefits attached to a larger office, like availability of on-site seminars. 
 But reaching staff members in Hauppauge "is no different than calling someone on the next floor," Mr. Galioto said.
 Technical designers in Hauppauge generally work directly on large project files, connected by high-speed telephone lines that hook directly into servers in Manhattan.
 But because this state-of-the-art technology "is not as seamless as we would like," employees in Hauppauge occasionally attend meetings in Manhattan with colleagues, project managers, consultants and clients, Mr. Van Epps said. The novelty of the trip to the city increases the appeal.
