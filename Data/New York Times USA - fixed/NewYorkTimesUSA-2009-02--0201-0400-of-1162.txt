HEADLINE: Ticketmaster Merger Plan Could Touch On Antitrust

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
If Ticketmaster Entertainment and Live Nation agree to merge, it would become a powerhouse in the music industry and an early test of the Obama administration's views on concentrated corporate power, particularly in an area with potentially stark implications for consumers.
 ''For a couple of different reasons this is likely to have reasonably intense scrutiny,'' said Bruce Sokler, a lawyer in the Washington office of Mintz Levin, who focuses on antitrust matters. ''One is, it's going to be an early, big spotlighted merger for the new administration. Second, it is a deal with great interest for consumers.'' 
 While hurdles remain that could scuttle a deal, the two companies have been in merger talks and could announce a pact as early as Friday, although a likelier possibility is next week, according to two people briefed on the matter who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
 The combination of the two companies would place under one corporate umbrella dominant players in all sides of the live concert business: the sale of tickets, the representation of artists and the control of concert halls. Of particular issue to regulators, say lawyers with expertise in antitrust law, would be Live Nation's recent entry into the ticket-selling business -- essentially a challenge to Ticketmaster on its own turf.
 ''That would definitely be something the government would want to look at,'' said Joseph J. Simons, a partner at Paul Weiss Rifkin Wharton & Garrison, and a former chief antitrust enforcer at the Federal Trade Commission.
 Regulators, Mr. Simons said -- whether from the Department of Justice or the F.T.C., the two government bodies that review mergers -- are often hesitant to approve deals that quash new competition in a historically concentrated business. 
 In the ticket business, Ticketmaster had 30 percent of the $21 billion events market last year, according to data from Forrester Research. But in the more narrow view of just concerts, Ticketmaster's market share was closer to 70 percent, according to Scott W. Devitt, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. Mr. Devitt estimates that Live Nation, as a promoter of concerts, is three times the size of its next nearest competitor, the Anschutz Entertainment Group.
 ''I think it's safe to say this will be reviewed aggressively,'' Mr. Devitt said.
 Robert W. Doyle Jr., a partner at Doyle Barlow & Mazard, a Washington law firm that specializes in antitrust litigation, said that the high market share in ticketing and event promotion made this ''a problematic deal.''
 ''I think the Obama administration would be much more aggressive'' than the prior administration in reviewing merger deals, he said.
 A representative for Live Nation declined comment, and a spokesman for Ticketmaster was not immediately available for comment.
 Ticketmaster has a long history of entanglement with regulators and plaintiffs over questions of anticompetitive practices, but has mainly escaped those complaints intact. 
 This week, a congressman sent a letter to the F.T.C. seeking an investigation into the company's relationship with a subsidiary, TicketsNow.com, that sells tickets on the secondary market.
 The congressman, Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, wrote in a letter that he was responding to concerns that fans of Bruce Springsteen had technical problems when trying to buy concert tickets on Ticketmaster's Web site. But an ad on the same page could direct them to buy tickets on TicketsNow.com at a ''value marked up hundreds of dollars beyond their original value,'' according to Mr. Pascrell.
 In the letter, he wrote, ''there is significant potential for abuse when one company is able to monopolize the primary market for a product and also directly manipulate, and profit from, the secondary market.''

HEADLINE: Foreign Firms Lining Up For Part of Stimulus Plan

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER and JAMES KANTER; Martin Fackler reported from Tokyo and James Kanter from Brussels. Ian Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa.

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
What makes a product American? 
 Last week the House of Representatives voted to require that public works projects financed by the $819 billion stimulus bill use only American iron and steel. 
 The Senate agreed Wednesday night to water down some of the ''Buy America'' provisions in its version of the $900 billion economic stimulus bill to ensure that the provision would not violate any international trade agreements.
 But much of the material needed to overhaul infrastructure or develop alternative energy is produced by foreign companies in American factories, and many of those companies are planning to increase the amount they produce in the United States.
 Despite the increasing chatter about the threat of trade protectionism, many foreign businesses are gearing up to win a piece of the stimulus package. Some are hiring staff in the United States. Others -- from Japan, Germany, France and South Korea -- are building American factories to make solar cells, lithium batteries, turbines or subway trains. 
 In a series of television interviews on Tuesday, President Obama signaled that he would try to remove the ''Buy American'' restrictions that would cover projects like airports, dams, railroads and mass transit systems. A major concern, the president said, was to avoid creating friction with big trading partners that could lead to a full-blown trade war.
 John Bruton, the United States ambassador to the European Commission, had sent letters to the secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, warning that the provision ''doesn't make economic sense'' and could cause ''retaliatory measures.''
 Syed Kamall, a spokesman for the Conservative Party in the European Parliament, has warned that the provision could lead to Europe and the United States erecting ''a new economic Iron Curtain.''
 Industry executives and government officials in Japan say building American plants will become a common strategy for Japanese companies, both to bring production closer to customers and to avoid trade friction. 
 Japan's auto industry followed a similar strategy in the 1980s. 
 Even before the threat of American protectionism arose, many foreign companies had decided to increase their American presence after Mr. Obama's election in November. 
 In December, Alstom, the French heavy engineering company, announced that it would expand its presence in the United States with a factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. Alstom, which makes turbines for the power industry and the high-speed TGV trains, said any new business would probably mean additional jobs and more secure employment for American workers. 
 ''We have a big industrial presence in the United States, and in that regard Alstom is an American company,'' said Pierre L. Gauthier, president of the company's operations in the United States. 
 As part of their lobbying campaign to win new business, foreign companies are trumpeting how their work will help American economic prospects at a time of increased competition from countries like China. 
 Echoing the view that is popular overseas, that the Obama administration will reinvigorate American science, Regine Coqueran, a spokeswoman for Alcatel-Lucent, a French maker of telecommunications equipment, said, ''We have a clear role to play in the renewed emphasis on science and technology through the strength of Bell Labs, our research arm.'' 
 Ms. Coqueran said the company, which bought the American equipment maker Lucent Technologies in 2006, also wanted to play a significant role in increasing the availability of high-speed Internet services to American households. She said health care businesses and energy companies in the United States were also likely buyers of state-of-the-art communications. 
 In October, Sanyo, the producer of solar cells, broke ground on a factory in Oregon for producing silicon ingots, the raw material for making cells. Sanyo expects sales in the United States to jump roughly fourfold over the next two years. To meet rising demand, the company plans to build a second American sales office in addition to its current one in Dallas, which would triple the number of its sales-related employees in the United States. 
 There are widespread expectations that Mr. Obama's stimulus plan will transform the United States into the world's largest growth market for green technologies. It promises $150 billion over a decade to create five million jobs and update energy infrastructure. 
 But few believe the United States can reach those goals alone. 
 ''America is suddenly positive about solar,'' said Kenichiro Wakisaka, a senior manager in Sanyo's solar division, ''but it doesn't have enough production capacity to cover its demand.'' 
 Moreover, foreign business leaders point out that national origin can be difficult to determine these days. 
 After 20 years of free trade between the United States and Canada, Jayson Myers, the president of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, an industry group, said it was sometimes difficult to determine when something was an American product or a Canadian one. 
 U.S. Steel, for example, sends steel slabs cast at its large operation in Hamilton, Ontario, to its mills in the United States to be rolled into sheet steel. Those rolls, in turn, might travel to other mills in the United States or back to Canada to be given rust-resistant coatings or other final treatments. 
 John Armstrong, a spokesman for U.S. Steel, said the company could ''very easily'' adjust that system to cut out the Canadian mills. But he added that U.S. Steel long ago stopped making structural steel and reinforcing bars for concrete -- the two products most likely to be affected by infrastructure programs -- to concentrate on more profitable kinds of steel. 
 Nonindustrial companies are staffing up in the United States, too. Peter Morrison, chief executive of the architecture company RMJM, which is based in Edinburgh, made a strategic decision to refocus on the United States when he heard Mr. Obama speaking enthusiastically after his election about renewing America's transport infrastructure. 
 ''I realized that meant new buildings for railways and airports on a huge new scale,'' Mr. Morrison said. ''We literally pulled our global infrastructure team out of Hong Kong and plonked them in New York.'' 
 Although Mr. Morrison's company has had a strong presence in the United States since a merger with the American architectural firm Hillier in 2007, it lacked a practice in the United States dedicated to winning contracts for infrastructure projects. 
 RMJM generates about 35 percent of its revenue in the United States. That proportion could now grow to as much as 50 percent, Mr. Morrison said. The company soon could be operating a United States-based infrastructure team of as many as 60 people, up from none before Mr. Obama's election. Many of those new employees would be American designers, engineers and architects.
 He also said he thought Mr. Obama would resist protectionism to enable American companies to keep important investments intact abroad and to win new business in fast-growing countries like China and India. 
 But most foreign companies that could provide material for alternative energy or infrastructure are not setting up operations in the United States, and the broader ''Buy American'' provisions in the Senate bill would probably affect them, if passed. 
 Across Asia, for instance, companies are gearing up for American-size demand. A half-dozen Taiwanese start-ups have entered the solar market, including Gintech Energy, a two-year-old company with ambitions to produce 1.5 gigawatts of cells a year by 2011. 
 Industry analysts and executives say not just big manufacturers, but also Japan's legions of smaller companies, which make things like battery containers and the insulators used on wind turbines, also stand to profit. 
 One is Eurus Energy, a Tokyo company that builds and manages wind farms. The company's chief executive, Tetsuro Nagata, said the United States was already its biggest growth market even before the new administration. Eurus already operates wind farms in the United States, including one completed recently in Texas. 
 ''America's sudden concern about global warming means that what was already a huge pie will suddenly get a lot bigger,'' Mr. Nagata said. ''There will be enough for everyone, American and overseas companies, to share.''

HEADLINE: An Ode to the Stimulus Bill

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
The economy is in crisis, and we are so relieved that the Senate has finally gone to work debating the critical stimulus plan and ... 
 Oh, dear Lord. John McCain is making a speech about earmarks. 
 ''... $188,000 for the Lobster Institute, which includes a lobster cam at the bottom of the ocean that so far we haven't been able to work!''
 Earmarks, you will remember, are those frequently porky little bits of appropriations for specific projects that legislators like to stick into budgets. During the presidential race, McCain gave the definite impression that earmarks were a threat to the nation's well-being -- second only to radical Islamic fundamentalism. 
 And although McCain lost the election (by a lot, really), Barack Obama still made a point of saying that there would be no earmarks in the stimulus bill.
 Which there are not. Nor is there anything for the Lobster Institute. But the old stories are always the best stories. Anyway, we're talking government spending, so there must be something nefarious somewhere. 
 ''You don't have to call it an earmark and it doesn't have to be technically an earmark, but ... that's certainly their effect,'' McCain said darkly.
 The Republicans have been doing an extremely thorough job of making this American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (stimulus bill to its friends) sound like a wasteful ball of lobster cameras. Even its authors now seem a little embarrassed. ''It may not be perfect, but it's pretty good,'' said Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, defensively.
 Come on, people. Let's give the stimulus some love. What's not to like? That it's messy? My desk is messy. Everything Congress ever touches is messy. It's true that you could produce a much tidier stimulus plan with a few big, whopping tax cuts. But that could only conceivably work if people went right out and spent the money. Unfortunately, recent history suggests that they are more likely to stick it in a pillow that they can hug while lying in a fetal position and listening to the evening news.
 It is also true that some of the bill's priorities, like increased aid to low-income college students, are more useful than stimulative. But who wants to rail against Pell Grants? You wind up sounding like Kay Bailey Hutchison on ''Meet the Press,'' complaining obliquely about ''nice spending, but not necessary right now.''
 So the opponents focus on things with names that sound frivolous or funny. This is an old game that works for almost any form of human communication. Let me explain with a story. When I was beginning my career as a reporter, I once covered a shooting in which the victim was gunned down while playing an arcade video game. This was so long ago that the game in question was Pong.
 It was not a very interesting crime, and under normal circumstances it would have vanished in the daily ebb and flow of New York City police reports. However, the shooter made the terrible mistake of including a colorful detail, and he became the Pong Slayer, whose every court appearance merited additional coverage.
 The Republicans' real objection is that the Democrats want to grow the size of government. But they're playing Pong. This bill has money to fix a school swimming pool in Meriden, Conn.! What kind of priority is that? There's millions to re-seed the National Mall!
 By now, the public has gotten the idea that it's all a big waste, something the Communicator in the Oval Office has not been very good at contradicting. It's time for a presidential address to the nation, with charts and perhaps a little illustration of California dropping off into the ocean.
 Whenever the Republicans bring up anything in the stimulus bill that sounds a little weird, the Democrats have been pathetically eager to throw in the towel. Witness the Senate's defeat of $246 million in tax breaks for Hollywood studios, which might not have sounded so silly if you were a college student whose father is a cameraman.
 At the insistence of the White House, the Democrats eliminated $200 million to expand federal assistance to states that want to provide family-planning services to poor women. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the money would eventually save about $400 million by cutting unwanted pregnancies. But it became a big rallying point for social conservatives. (''Won't fewer people mean fewer taxpayers?'' demanded columnist Cal Thomas.) So goodbye family planning. 
 The $200 million to fix up the National Mall was tossed out in the House. The much-decried money for disaster insurance for the honeybee industry, which is already the subject of snippy T-shirts, never existed, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Or if it did, it's been whisked away and buried under the floorboards. 
 If you're walking around and happen to see a very large but very battered stimulus bill hobbling by, give it a pat on the back. It's been Ponged within an inch of its life.

HEADLINE: Despite Prestige, the Senate's Allure Seems to Be Fading

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It costs millions of dollars to get in, comes with a nice salary, plenty of staff members, national influence and real prestige, but the Senate obviously does not hold the irresistible attraction it once did.
 Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican stalwart, was the latest to jolt his colleagues this week with his decision to depart for the new administration -- a Democratic one at that. Mr. Gregg became the third senator to leave for the executive branch and the fifth if you count Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr., who now run the executive branch. Others, notably Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, were eager to make the move.
 Ken Salazar served only four years of his first term as a senator from Colorado before resigning to become interior secretary, a nice job for a Westerner but not necessarily a can't-turn-down plum for a senator with a bright future. 
 Four Republicans have announced they will retire at the end of their current terms. 
 The Senate appears to be in a recession of its own.
 ''I think there are some aspects of Senate life that haven't been fun the last couple of years, which have to do with the acrimony and lack of getting things done,'' said Senator Mel Martinez, the Florida Republican who announced this year that he would not seek a second term. ''It is not fatal to the institution, it has been here a long time, but there are a lot of people leaving.''
 Mr. Martinez and others say another factor is the incessant fund-raising needed to generate the money to run for the chance to win and raise more money to run again.
 ''It is a huge money chase, and in a bad economy it gets that much more difficult,'' said Senator Sam Brownback, the Kansas Republican who is not running next year in accordance with a term-limits pledge.
 Then there are the politically charged message votes, the impossible-to-please interest groups, the strain on family, the angry constituents, the uninformed critics and the intensifying news media scrutiny.
 ''Really, you just have to watch everything,'' said Chuck Hagel, the former Nebraska Republican senator who decided not to seek re-election last year after a flirtation with running for president.
 Mr. Hagel, 62, who plans to teach and engage in some business ventures, said he wanted to go out at a point where he could pursue new opportunities. But he acknowledged a certain frustration with the way things got done -- or did not -- in the Senate.
 ''You have 100 members in there now who essentially all have the same rights,'' Mr. Hagel said. ''Any member can get up at any time and talk as long as they want, make as big a fool of themselves as they want.''
 Even those who are sticking around admit that the Senate ground is shifting.
 ''The classic script of the Senate is you get elected, keep in touch with the folks back home and stay a gazillion years,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. ''That has been turned on its head.''
 Democrats say Republicans, now in the minority in both the Senate and House, must grapple with the sense of irrelevance that can come from being out of power. They say that Mr. Martinez of Florida faced a difficult re-election and that even Mr. Gregg was going to struggle to win a fourth term in New Hampshire.
 The House is suffering a bit of its own drain as well. Representative Adam H. Putnam, Republican of Florida and a former House leader, has already announced he is quitting to seek state office. 
 But it is not just Republicans. At some points last year, it seemed the entire Senate was angling either for the presidency, the vice presidency or a cabinet slot. Hillary Rodham Clinton, foiled in her presidential bid and stuck down the seniority ladder, leaped at the chance to be secretary of state in her rival's administration, and Senator John Kerry wanted the job as well.
 Meanwhile, Rahm Emanuel left a top position in the House Democratic leadership to become White House chief of staff. And Hilda L. Solis resigned as a congresswoman from Los Angeles to become the nominee for labor secretary.
 The lawmakers say people have individual reasons for quitting: age, health, the search for a new challenge, a sense that they have a hit a wall. After serving as a governor and as a member of the House and the Senate, Mr. Gregg may have seen the cabinet as a way to round out his career.
 But Mr. Salazar, who took the interior job offered by Mr. Obama, had just begun a promising career in the Senate and was a well-liked centrist with a Hispanic heritage from an increasingly important swing state. Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and majority leader, said Mr. Salazar could not turn down the opportunity.
 ''It was a very difficult thing for him to leave,'' said Mr. Reid, who noted Mr. Salazar's growing up as part of a large family on a ranch with no electricity. ''This means so much to his family to have a Salazar as part of the president's cabinet.''
 And Mr. Reid, who is devoted to the Senate, said it would be wrong to presume other recent departees were simply fed up.
 ''You can't blame Obama,'' said Mr. Reid about the Senate's most prominent loss. ''He was here two years. He couldn't have gotten tired of it that quickly.''

HEADLINE: The Unthinkable Option

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
 When it comes to Iran, the choice of metaphor is limited.
 ''I would never take a military option off the table,'' Barack Obama declared during the campaign, a position unchanged since he became president.
 ''We are not taking any option off the table at all,'' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at her Senate confirmation hearing.
 As for Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, he tweaked the mantra this way: ''The military option must be kept on the table.'' 
 All three have also talked up dialogue with Iran. But the question, more pressing since Iran fired its Islamic satellite into orbit this week, remains: what in reality is this threat of force and what purpose does it serve?
 I've read think-tank scenarios that have the United States bombing Iran's nuclear installations at Natanz, hitting Iranian military bases to limit the response, imposing a naval blockade and infiltrating special forces from Iraq or Afghanistan. After eight Bush-Cheney years, such plans exist at the Pentagon.
 To which my response is: Hang on a second.
 The United States' role in the 1953 coup here that deposed the Middle East's first democratically elected government lives in memory. Any U.S. attack would propel 56-year-old Iranian demons into overdrive and lock in an America-hating Islamic Republic for the next half-century.
 From Basra through Kabul to the Paris suburbs, Muslim rage would erupt. The Iranian Army is not the Israeli Army, but its stubborn effectiveness is in no doubt. Rockets from Hezbollah and Hamas, and newly tested Iranian long-range missiles, would hit Israel.
 Chaos would threaten Persian Gulf states, oil markets and the grinding U.S. campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. war front, in the first decade of the 21st century, at a time of national economic disaster, would stretch thousands of miles across the Muslim world, from western Iraq to eastern Afghanistan.
 It is doubtful that a bombing campaign would end Iran's nuclear ambitions, so all the above might be the price paid for putting off an Iranian bomb -- or mastery of the production of fissile material -- by a year or so. 
 In short, the U.S. military option is not an option. It is unthinkable.
 This is the poisoned chalice handed Obama by Bush, who responded to Iranian help in Afghanistan in 2001 by consigning Iran to the axis of evil, rebuffed credible approaches by the former moderate president, Mohammad Khatami, and undermined European diplomacy.
 No, the real ''Red Line'' will be set by Israel.
 Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's leading candidate to become prime minister after elections next week, has said ''everything that is necessary'' will be done to stop Iran going nuclear. I believe him.
 Never again is never again. There's no changing that Israeli lens, however distorting it may be in a changed world. That could mean an Israeli attack on Iran within a year. If the U.S. military option is unthinkable, equally unthinkable is the United States abandoning Israel.
 That is Obama's dilemma. Netanyahu is right about one thing. The Iranian nuclear program, which Iran implausibly says is for civilian purposes, is ''the greatest challenge'' now facing 21st-century leaders. If Obama fails, his ''new era of peace'' will become the bitterest phrase of his inaugural.
 I asked Mohsen Rezai, the former commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards and secretary of one of its highest state organs, the Expediency Discernment Council, how he sees the U.S. threat. ''America will not do anything military within the next 10 years,'' he said. ''What the U.S. needs to do now is regroup, repair, reconstruct.''
 And an Israeli attack? ''Maybe, but it would be one of its stupidest decisions.''
 There is little time to lose. Vice President Joseph Biden and senior Iranian officials, including Ali Larijani, the speaker of Parliament, will mingle at the Munich Security Conference this weekend. They should talk.
 But only Obama can overcome the gridlock. He must break with the Bush years in more than words. That requires a solemn declaration that the United States recognizes and no longer seeks to destabilize the Islamic Republic -- an implicit renunciation of force.
 A threat, in Iranian eyes, can only come from a domineering power, the very U.S. attitude this country cannot abide. 
 I think the tightened sanctions being contemplated by Obama are a bad idea.
 The sanctions don't work; they enrich the regime cronies who circumvent them. Plunging oil prices are a cheaper weapon. They will concentrate Iranian minds as the economy nose-dives.
 Decisiveness is foreign to the many-faceted Iranian system. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader and ultimate arbiter, will not easily be swayed from a course that would shred the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, of which Iran is a signatory, among other disasters. But reason can still prevail.
 It was Rezai, back in the late 1980s, who wrote Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, telling him the course he had vowed never to alter -- prosecuting the war against Iraq until victory -- had to be abandoned or disaster would follow. Khomeini changed his mind. Peace came.
 Khamenei's ultimate duty is to preserve the revolution by being true to Khomeini's example. Obama might, obliquely, remind him of that.

HEADLINE: Senate Adds Homebuyer Tax Credit to Stimulus Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As President Obama met with centrist lawmakers to address concerns over the $900 billion economic stimulus plan, the Senate on Wednesday voted to expand the package with a tax credit for homebuyers of up to $15,000, a provision championed by Republicans as addressing a root cause of the recession. 
 The vote to add the tax credit, at a cost of about $18.5 billion, came as Senate leaders seemed to be nearing completion of negotiations. The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, suggested that a final vote on the stimulus plan could come on Thursday. 
 Moderate lawmakers in both parties are pushing to reduce the overall cost of the measure and to focus it more tightly on provisions that will quickly spur spending and create jobs. 
 Mr. Obama, while expressing willingness to compromise, also issued a warning to some Republican critics who have said they will press for major changes to the bill, including the removal of many spending programs in favor of wider tax cuts. 
 ''I've heard criticisms of this plan that echo the very same failed theories that helped lead us into this crisis, the notion that tax cuts alone will solve all our problems, that we can ignore the fundamental challenges like energy independence and the high cost of health care and still expect our economy and our country to thrive,'' he said. 
 ''I reject that theory,'' Mr. Obama continued, ''and so did the American people when they went to the polls in November and voted resoundingly for change. So I urge members of Congress to act without delay.'' 
 And, as if taking a cue from their president, Senate Democrats on Wednesday evening used their newly strengthened majority to swiftly reject a series of Republican amendments intended to cut spending or broaden the tax package in the stimulus bill. 
 Presuming Senate Democrats muscle the bill through, the final legislation must be reconciled with the $820 billion measure approved last week by the House. 
 The tax break for homebuyers, which the Senate approved by voice vote without opposition, was the second amendment in two days intended to encourage consumers to make major purchases. On Tuesday, the Senate approved a tax incentive for car buyers, sponsored by Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, that would allow the deduction of sales tax and loan interest on purchases made this year. 
 But while both of those incentives were applauded by lawmakers who said that the bill should quickly induce consumer spending, some economists said they were short-sighted and lacked the forward-thinking approach Mr. Obama has demanded. 
 Adam Posen, deputy director of the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said that homebuyers would have trouble accessing loans because of the continued tightness in the credit markets and that the car buyer incentive fell short by not focusing on fuel-efficient vehicles, and that the money might be better directed at mass transit. 
 ''They are also structurally unsound,'' Mr. Posen said of the two provisions, ''reinforcing the attempts of industries that are too large -- housing construction, automobile production -- to survive based on government distortions.'' 
 He called them both ''terrible, pandering ideas.'' 
 But Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, a former real estate broker, who was the prime sponsor of the homebuyer credit, said it was modeled after a similar, $2,000 homebuyer incentive that helped lead the country out of recession in 1975. 
 ''We do have a history in this country with housing and it goes back to the crash of 1974, which actually in terms of inventory and price declines was comparable to what's happening now,'' Mr. Isakson said at a news conference. 
 ''Within one year of the inception of that tax credit, two-thirds of the available inventory that was on the market was gone. The market moved back to a balanced inventory, values stabilized and things became very healthy. The only reason I know all of that is I was selling houses in 1974, that's what I was doing to feed my family and make a living.''
 The tax credit would give buyers 10 percent of the price of a primary residence bought within one year, up to $15,000, and is intended to stabilize plummeting home prices, which caused a wave of foreclosures and led to the near collapse of the financial system as Wall Street firms wrote down billions in mortgage-backed assets. 
 With Wednesday's additions, the cost of the Senate package has climbed well above $900 billion -- the limit that Mr. Obama has set for the final legislation. Intense negotiations seemed likely over how to reduce the price tag. 
 At the White House on Wednesday, Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, personally delivered a list of cuts, totaling about $100 billion, that she said should be made. 
 Ms. Snowe met one-on-one with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office, and the president met later in the day with Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska. Ms. Collins and Mr. Nelson have been working on a substitute bill that would strip out spending that they said would not provide an immediate jolt to the economy. 
 Ms. Snowe, leaving the White House, said it was imperative that ''every provision has a job creation component.'' 
 Initiatives that critics hope to remove from the bill include $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts, $14 million for cyber security research by the Homeland Security Department, $1 billion for the National Science Foundation, $400 million for research and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, $850 million for Amtrak and $400 million for climate change research.

HEADLINE: Experts in U.S. and China See a Chance for Cooperation Against Climate Change

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and ANDREW C. REVKIN; Edward Wong reported from Beijing, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
When Chinese officials and the Obama administration begin serious discussions over issues at the heart of relations between China and the United States, the usual suspects will no doubt emerge: trade, North Korea, human rights, Taiwan.
 But an increasing number of officials and scholars from both countries say climate change is likely to become another focal point in the dialogue. American and Chinese leaders recognize the urgency of global warming, the scholars and officials say, and believe that a new international climate treaty is impossible without agreements between their nations, the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases.
 In a sign of this new emphasis, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to stress the importance of new steps on energy and global warming when she visits China, perhaps as soon as this month, an Obama administration official said. 
 Two reports being released Thursday propose ways for President Obama and Chinese leaders to begin addressing together, as a major priority, how to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases linked to rising temperatures. 
 One report, ''A Roadmap for U.S.-China Cooperation on Energy and Climate Change,'' is a joint project of the Asia Society and the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, both based in the United States. Scientists and policy advisers from both countries contributed to the report. 
 The origins of the report indicate that it could carry weight in the White House. It was produced by a committee led by Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate in physics who is now the secretary of energy, and John L. Thornton, a professor at Tsinghua University who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for United States ambassador to China. John P. Holdren, Mr. Obama's choice for science adviser, is another contributor.
 The report recommends that China and the United States convene a presidential summit meeting to create a broad plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, followed by the appointment of senior officials and independent experts to councils and task forces to develop concrete programs. It says the two governments should lay out areas for cooperation, including low-emissions coal technologies, energy efficiency and conservation, and renewable energy. 
 The other report, by two Brookings Institution fellows, David B. Sandalow and Kenneth G. Lieberthal, presents a menu of nine ways to build political support in both countries for sustained cooperation on cutting emissions.
 In China, scholars and policy advisers who support the proposals in the ''Roadmap'' report say talks on energy technology and climate change could foster cooperation between the Obama administration and China. A central question is whether Chinese leaders and American lawmakers will be too focused on reviving their economies to pay serious attention to curbing emissions.
 But at least in public, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and other officials have said recently that the financial crisis gives China an opportunity to turn its growth model away from one that was not environmentally sustainable.
 ''I believe climate change may become a very important issue which will put China-U.S. relations in a new framework in the 21st century because the stakes are high,'' said Wu Jianmin, a senior adviser to the Foreign Ministry. ''We all understand we don't have much time left. We've got to work together.'' 
 This largely meshes with Mr. Obama's hope for helping to revive the American economy by developing non-polluting energy technologies and ''green jobs.''
 Todd Stern, appointed Mrs. Clinton's special envoy for climate change, said the administration hoped to end sparring between the nations over who needs to do what first.
 ''Secretary Clinton is keenly aware that the United States, as the largest historic emitter of greenhouse gases, and China, as the largest emitter going forward, need to develop a strong, constructive partnership to build the kind of clean-energy economies that will allow us to put the brakes on global climate change,'' he said in an e-mail message.
 But some American officials and experts on climate and energy say that although Chinese leaders declare they are serious about the issue, it has been hard to pin them down on specifics. 
 Mr. Wen, in an interview with The Financial Times published Monday, restated China's position that it does not intend to agree to specific limits at a United Nations conference on climate change scheduled for December in Copenhagen.
 ''It's difficult for China to take quantified emission reduction quotas at the Copenhagen conference, because this country is still at an early stage of development,'' he said. ''Europe started its industrialization several hundred years ago, but for China, it has only been dozens of years.''
 Gao Guangsheng, who directs the climate change office at the National Development and Reform Commission, presented a white paper in October that said the world's richest countries should contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to helping developing countries combat global warming.
 Zhang Haibin, an associate professor at Peking University who specializes in international environmental politics, said that China and the United States had historically had weak cooperation on the climate change problem, but that Chinese leaders believed that the relationship could change under Mr. Obama.
 Several American experts on energy, climate and Chinese-American relations said the ''Roadmap'' report built on recent calls for sustained partnerships on energy efficiency, technology for capturing carbon dioxide from power plants and other initiatives. But they said that task forces and summit meetings would be ineffective unless they led to programs and investments that continued for many years. 
 ''Nearly everything that these two countries have tried to do jointly on climate and energy has been episodic,'' said David G. Victor, a political scientist at Stanford University who studies energy and climate. ''The financial crisis has created an opportunity for a dialogue, but it also creates a host of new risks as the countries turn inward.'' 
 Orville Schell, journalist who helped supervise the writing of the report as director of the Asia Society Center on U.S.-China Relations, said that in recent meetings Chinese officials had begun to recognize the need to take action on climate change.
 ''We have watched as officials in China have become much more receptive to the need to do 'something' about climate change, although they are still unwilling to set caps,'' Mr. Schell said in an e-mail message. ''We have also watched our own country molt out of stubborn opposition to a far more open willingness to recognize the scientific basis of the problem and the need to do something about it.''

HEADLINE: Panetta, Obama Choice for C.I.A. Chief, Discloses Finances

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Leon E. Panetta, the White House nominee to take over the Central Intelligence Agency, earned more than $1 million last year serving on corporate boards, consulting and delivering speeches, including some given to imploding banks at the height of the financial crisis. 
 Merrill Lynch gave Mr. Panetta $56,000 for two speeches in 2008, and Wachovia paid his standard fee of $28,000 for an appearance last October, according to financial disclosure forms Mr. Panetta submitted to the Office of Government Ethics.
 Both financial institutions are now owned by other banks.
 Mr. Panetta, who will appear Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee for his confirmation hearing, also received a $28,000 speaking fee last September from the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that owns a number of companies doing business with the Pentagon and other national security agencies. 
 The finances of President Obama's aides are under particular scrutiny after two White House nominees had to withdraw this week amid revelations that they had failed to pay income tax. 
 Tommy Vietor, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Panetta had no similar tax problems and had not had to pay any back taxes since being tapped by the White House to lead the C.I.A.
 ''We anticipate that tomorrow's hearing will focus on the substance of Mr. Panetta's views about how to strengthen our intelligence gathering and keep our nation safe, as all of Mr. Panetta's income and investments have been thoroughly reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics,'' Mr. Vietor said. 
 A former congressman, Mr. Panetta was President Bill Clinton's chief of staff until stepping down in 1997.
 Mr. Panetta earned more than $750,000 last year in consulting fees and from serving on a number of boards, including Fleishman-Hillard, Blue Shield of California and the BP Corporation North America. 
 Since leaving Washington, Mr. Panetta has devoted most of his time to running the Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy, a nonprofit organization in California that works to draw young people into government service.

HEADLINE: Citing Write-Down, Time Warner Posts Loss and Forecasts Flat Year

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
The media giant Time Warner reported a $16 billion fourth-quarter loss on Wednesday and said that it expected its 2009 profit to be essentially flat.
 The company attributed the loss mainly to a large write-down that it disclosed last month to account for the decline in value of two struggling units, America Online and Time Inc., the magazine division that publishes titles like Sports Illustrated, Time, Fortune and People, and in Time Warner Cable, which the company is spinning off to shareholders.
 A bright spot was the company's cable networks, which include HBO, TNT, TBS and CNN. The unit was the only one of four divisions -- excluding Time Warner Cable -- to have revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue at the unit increased 9 percent, to $2.9 billion, compared with last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, it also grew 9 percent. 
 The other units -- AOL, Time Inc. and Warner Brothers, the movie and television production division -- all posted revenue declines for the year and the quarter.
 Separately, Time Warner Cable, in which Time Warner retains an 85 percent stake, said it lost $8.2 billion in the fourth quarter and would lay off 1,200 people.
 For the quarter, Time Warner lost $4.47 a share, compared with a profit of $1.03 billion, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $12.71 billion, from $12.64 billion.
 Excluding the write-downs, the company's profit was 23 cents a share, compared with the 26 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates.
 For the full year, the company lost $13.40 billion, or $3.74 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $4.39 billion, or $1.17 a share. Its full-year operating loss was $15.96 billion. Revenue rose to $46.98 billion, from $46.48 billion.
 Stock in Time Warner, which is based in New York, fell 36 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $9.42 a share.
 As previously disclosed, Time Warner took a $24.2 billion write-down last year. Of that, $14.4 billion was ascribed to the cable unit, $2.2 billion to AOL and about $7.6 billion to Time Inc.
 In a conference call on Wednesday morning with analysts, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the company's chief executive, said Time Warner was ''well positioned relative to the rest of the industry.'' 
 On Tuesday, the Walt Disney Company reported lower-than-anticipated earnings, and the News Corporation, another of Time Warner's peers, will report earnings on Thursday. Many analysts expect a multibillion dollar write-down.
 Mr. Bewkes also said that the state of the economy had resulted in ''the most uncertainty and the least visibility'' in memory.
 He said that excluding the cable unit and the various one-time items, Time Warner earned 66 cents a share last year and the results for 2009 should be about the same. 
 But the forecast was leavened by the company's acknowledgment that there was little certainty in business trends for the foreseeable future, especially in the advertising market.
 ''It's incredibly tough to make decisions right now,'' John K. Martin, Time Warner's chief financial officer, said in the call.
 One analyst, Michael Nathanson of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, titled his report on Wednesday, ''Time Warner: 4Q a Sloppy Mess, but '09 Guidance Is Clean.''
 Ad revenue at AOL and Time Inc. declined significantly. Advertising at AOL was down 18 percent, or $113 million, in the period, and at Time Inc. was down 20 percent, or $158 million. 
 As for the drop in print advertising at Time Inc., Mr. Bewkes said, ''this may continue for some time.''
 At Warner Brothers, revenue declined 11 percent, or $395 million despite the success of ''The Dark Knight,'' the second highest-grossing film of all time, after ''Titanic'' (in dollars not adjusted for inflation). Time Warner's DVD of the movie was released in the fourth quarter, and the company cited slowing DVD sales as one factor in the decline. 
 Time Warner also disclosed that Google was seeking to sell its 5 percent stake in AOL, for which it paid $1 billion in 2005. Google, in a recent regulatory filing, estimated that its investment in AOL had shrunk to about $274 million. Under the agreement, Time Warner can now either buy back the stake from Google, or decide to spin off the company to shareholders, thereby allowing Google to extract value.

HEADLINE: Obama Woos G.O.P. With Attention, and Cookies

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Can the shrill tone of Washington be changed through a presidential act of contrition? Or, perhaps, an enticing platter of oatmeal raisin cookies?
 This week, President Obama has already served up both at the White House.
 To one set of visitors, a gathering of Democratic and Republican members of Congress whom he invited to watch the Super Bowl on Sunday, he carried around the freshly baked cookies as he mingled with his guests. To another set of visitors, the five broadcast and cable television anchors he invited to the Oval Office on Tuesday, he extended a blunt mea culpa and said he took responsibility for nominating aides with tax troubles.
 With two weeks of the presidency now under his belt, both of these cases offer a window into how Mr. Obama may try to build relationships -- and dispatch controversies -- during his time in office. 
 Since the inauguration, one of the hottest tickets in town has been an invitation to the White House. And Republicans have been scoring them nearly as often as Democrats.
 The president has held a cocktail reception for a bipartisan group of legislators, conducted sit-down meetings with House and Senate leaders of both parties and staged an indoor tailgate party Sunday to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers defeat the Arizona Cardinals.
 The social calendar continues on Wednesday evening, when the president and First Lady Michelle Obama open the Blue, Green and Red Rooms of the White House to more leading members of Congress.
 The guests gain a bit of prestige from being invited to the White House. Does the president stand to gain anything in return by opening the door to Republicans who have already signaled their disapproval of his economic recovery plan and other items on his agenda?
 Representative Trent Franks, Republican of Arizona, was among those invited to watch the Super Bowl in the White House theater. As Mr. Franks tells it, he is ''probably as philosophically opposed to this president as any member of Congress.''
 Yet as he left the party on Sunday evening, Mr. Franks said he did so with a new respect for Mr. Obama, whom he had seen in person only once before. (''I doubt he would remember,'' he said. ''I saw him at a distance.'')
 ''First of all, when you have a meeting like this, it humanizes and personalizes opponents, where you recognize them as human beings,'' Mr. Franks said. ''I think that does a lot towards helping people put aside politics and really try to do what is best for the country.'' 
 Though the capital was buzzing late Tuesday afternoon with the news that Tom Daschle had withdrawn as the nominee for health and human services secretary because of scrutiny over income tax arrears, Mr. Franks did not so much as mention that controversy as he talked to a reporter. He said he would not hesitate to oppose the president ''when I think he is doing something wrong for the country,'' but he suggested that at least some type of a relationship has started to develop between the two.
 ''There is no question that I feel like I know him better than I did,'' Mr. Franks said. ''I give him great credit for his attitude and gracious hospitality.''
 While Mr. Obama would surely like to win over some Republicans in the short term, particularly to vote on his economic plan, his advisers said it was just as important to build up a reservoir of good will to use at some point down the road.
 Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, said he was ''pleasantly surprised'' to be invited to the White House to watch the Super Bowl. He brought his three children -- ages 14, 12 and 8 -- who joined other kids at a Wii station that was set up in the East Wing. Like Mr. Obama, he was elected to Congress in 2004, but they hadn't seen one another since freshman orientation four years ago on Capitol Hill.
 ''We had a wonderful time,'' Mr. Dent said of his family's night at the White House. ''He seems like a guy you could have a lot of fun with.''
 Their conversations were rooted in family and football, he said, not in their differences over the economic stimulus plan, which he called ''a large spending bill -- a mistake.'' But he won't soon forget his time with Mr. Obama.
 ''It's extraordinarily important for the president to reach out and establish relationships with people on both sides -- I commend him for that,'' Mr. Dent said. ''Trying to get things done in Washington is largely about relationships. You have to have them.''
 Aside from the hometown loyalties of members of Congress whose states sent teams to the Super Bowl this year, the White House declined to discuss how the guest lists were drawn up. But the office of social secretary, working with political advisers and legislative liaisons to Capitol Hill, keep a careful accounting of who has been invited and who should receive an invitation one day soon.
 Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, was not only following the football game the other night, but also watching the interaction between the president and his Republican guests. (''No,'' she said, ''the Republicans were not all standing in one corner.'') 
 In fact, she said, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, spent considerable time talking to the president and Mrs. Obama.
 Ms. Klobuchar dismissed the Washington chatter about how no Republicans supported the president's economic stimulus bill in the House last week, despite considerable efforts by Mr. Obama to reach out to them. She said the talk oversimplified the calculus by the White House as it figures out how to deal with the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. 
 ''They are looking beyond one vote,'' Ms. Klobuchar said. ''They want a new kind of culture in Washington. He really means it.''
 And that, she said, may explain why the president was personally serving a platter of oatmeal raisin cookies to his guests the other night.

HEADLINE: Japan's Big-Works Stimulus Is Lesson for U.S.

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HAMADA, Japan -- The Hamada Marine Bridge soars majestically over this small fishing harbor, so much larger than the squid boats anchored below that it seems out of place.
And it is not just the bridge. Two decades of generous public works spending have showered this city of 61,000 mostly graying residents with a highway, a two-lane bypass, a university, a prison, a children's art museum, the Sun Village Hamada sports center, a bright red welcome center, a ski resort and an aquarium featuring three ring-blowing Beluga whales.
Nor is this remote port in western Japan unusual. Japan's rural areas have been paved over and filled in with roads, dams and other big infrastructure projects, the legacy of trillions of dollars spent to lift the economy from a severe downturn caused by the bursting of a real estate bubble in the late 1980s. During those nearly two decades, Japan accumulated the largest public debt in the developed world -- totaling 180 percent of its $5.5 trillion economy -- while failing to generate a convincing recovery. 
Now, as the Obama administration embarks on a similar path, proposing to spend more than $820 billion to stimulate the sagging American economy, many economists are taking a fresh look at Japan's troubled experience. While Japan is not exactly comparable to the United States -- especially as a late developer with a history of heavy state investment in infrastructure -- economists say it can still offer important lessons about the pitfalls, and chances for success, of a stimulus package in an advanced economy.
In a nutshell, Japan's experience suggests that infrastructure spending, while a blunt instrument, can help revive a developed economy, say many economists and one very important American official: Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, who was a young financial attache in Japan during the collapse and subsequent doldrums. One lesson Mr. Geithner has said he took away from that experience is that spending must come in quick, massive doses, and be continued until recovery takes firm root.
Moreover, it matters what gets built: Japan spent too much on increasingly wasteful roads and bridges, and not enough in areas like education and social services, which studies show deliver more bang for the buck than infrastructure spending.
''It is not enough just to hire workers to dig holes and then fill them in again,'' said Toshihiro Ihori, an economics professor at the University of Tokyo. ''One lesson from Japan is that public works get the best results when they create something useful for the future.''
In total, Japan spent $6.3 trillion on construction-related public investment between 1991 and September of last year, according to the Cabinet Office. The spending peaked in 1995 and remained high until the early 2000s, when it was cut amid growing concerns about ballooning budget deficits. More recently, the governing Liberal Democratic Party has increased spending again to revive the economy and the party's own flagging popularity.
In the end, say economists, it was not public works but an expensive cleanup of the debt-ridden banking system, combined with growing exports to China and the United States, that brought a close to Japan's Lost Decade. This has led many to conclude that spending did little more than sink Japan deeply into debt, leaving an enormous tax burden for future generations.
In the United States, it has also led to calls in Congress, particularly by Republicans, not to repeat the errors of Japan's failed economic stimulus. They argue that it makes more sense to cut taxes, and let people decide how to spend their own money, than for the government to decide how to invest public funds. Japan put more emphasis on increased spending than tax cuts during its slump.
Economists tend to divide into two camps on the question of Japan's infrastructure spending: those, many of them Americans like Mr. Geithner, who think it did not go far enough; and those, many of them Japanese, who think it was a colossal waste.
Among ordinary Japanese, the spending is widely disparaged for having turned the nation into a public-works-based welfare state and making regional economies dependent on Tokyo for jobs. Much of the blame has fallen on the Liberal Democratic Party, which has long used government spending to grease rural vote-buying machines that help keep the party in power.
But some Western economists who have studied Japan's experience say the stimulus accomplished more than it is now given credit for. At a minimum, they argue, it saved the economy from an outright, 1930s-style collapse.
Moreover, they say, any direct comparison of Japan and the United States is inevitably misleading, because Japan has spent so much more over the years on infrastructure. Having neglected its roads, bridges, water treatment plants and more over the years, the United States is bound to generate a greater payback for such spending than would Japan.
Beyond that, proponents of Keynesian-style stimulus spending in the United States say that Japan's approach failed to accomplish more not because of waste but because it was never tried wholeheartedly. They argue that instead of making one big push to pump up the economy with economic shock therapy, Japan spread its spending out over several years, diluting the effects.
After years of heavy spending in the first half of the 1990s, economists say, Japan's leaders grew concerned about growing budget deficits and cut back too soon, snuffing out the recovery in its infancy, much as Roosevelt did to the American economy in 1936. Growth that, by 1996, had reached 3 percent was suffocated by premature spending cuts and tax increases, they say. While spending remained high in the late 1990s, Japan never gave the economy another full-fledged push, these economists say.
They also say that the size of Japan's apparently successful stimulus in the early 1990s suggests that the United States will need to spend far more than the current $820 billion to get results. Between 1991 and 1995, Japan spent some $2.1 trillion on public works, in an economy roughly half as large as that of the United States, according to the Cabinet Office. ''Stimulus worked in Japan when it was tried,'' said David Weinstein, a professor of Japanese economics at Columbia University. ''Japan's lesson is that, if anything, the current U.S. stimulus will not be enough.''
Most Japanese economists have tended to take a bleaker view of their nation's track record, saying that Japan spent more than enough money, but wasted too much of it on roads to nowhere and other unneeded projects.
Dr. Ihori of the University of Tokyo did a survey of public works in the 1990s, concluding that the spending created almost no additional economic growth. Instead of spreading beneficial ripple effects across the economy, he found that the spending actually led to declines in business investment by driving out private investors. He also said job creation was too narrowly focused in the construction industry in rural areas to give much benefit to the overall economy.
He agreed with other critics that the 1990s stimulus failed because too much of it went to roads and bridges, overbuilding this already heavily developed nation. Critics also said decisions on how to spend the money were made behind closed doors by bureaucrats, politicians and the construction industry, and often reflected political considerations more than economic. Dr. Ihori said the United States appeared to be striking a better balance by investing in new energy and information-technology infrastructure as well as replacing aging infrastructure.
Japan's experience also seems to argue for spending heavily to promote social development. A 1998 report by the Japan Institute for Local Government, a nonprofit policy research group, found that every 1 trillion yen, or about $11.2 billion, spent on social services like care for the elderly and monthly pension payments added 1.64 trillion yen in growth. Financing for schools and education delivered an even bigger boost of 1.74 trillion yen, the report found.
But every 1 trillion yen spent on infrastructure projects in the 1990s increased Japan's gross domestic product, a measure of its overall economic size, by only 1.37 trillion yen, mainly by creating jobs and other improvements like reducing travel times.
Economists said the finding suggested that while infrastructure spending may yield strong results for developing nations, creating jobs in higher-paying knowledge-based services like health care and education can bring larger benefits to advanced economies like Japan, with its aging population.
''In hindsight, Japan should have built public works that address the problems it faces today, like aging, energy and food sources,'' said Takehiko Hobo, a professor emeritus of public finance at Shimane University in Matsue, the main city of Shimane. ''This obsession with building roads is a holdover from an earlier era.''
The fruits of that obsession are apparent across Shimane, a rural prefecture about the size of Delaware where Hamada is located. Each town seems to have its own art museum, domed athletic center and government-built tourist attraction like the Nima Sand Museum, a giant hourglass in a glass pyramid. The prefecture, with 740,000 residents, even has three commercial airports able to handle jets, including the $250 million Hagi-Iwami Airport, which sits eerily empty with just two flights per day.
In Hamada, residents say the city's most visible ''hakomono,'' the Japanese equivalent of ''white elephant,'' was its own bridge to nowhere, the $70 million Marine Bridge, whose 1,006-foot span sat almost completely devoid of traffic on a recent morning. Built in 1999, the bridge links the city to a small, sparsely populated island already connected by a shorter bridge.
''The bridge? It's a dud,'' said Masahiro Shimada, 70, a retired city official who was fishing near the port. ''Maybe we could use it for bungee jumping,'' he joked.
Koichi Matsuoka, a retired professor of policy at the University of Shimane in Hamada, said useless projects like the Marine Bridge were the reason that years of huge spending had brought few long-term benefits here. While Shimane has had the highest per capita spending on public works in Japan for the last 18 years, thanks to powerful local politicians like the deceased former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, its per capita annual income of $26,000 ranked it 40th among Japan's 47 prefectures, he said. He said the spending had left Shimane $11 billion in debt, twice the size of the prefectural government's annual budget.
Still, local officials in Hamada warn that their city's economy will collapse without public works, though they recognize the spending cannot continue forever. They offered their own lesson to American communities in the Obama era: when you choose public works projects, be sure to get ones with lasting economic impact.
Among Hamada's many public works projects, the biggest benefits had come from the prison, the university and the Aquas aquarium, with its popular whales, they said. These had created hundreds of permanent jobs and attracted students and families with children to live in a city where nearly a third of residents were over 65.
''Roads and bridges are attractive, but they create jobs only during construction,'' said Shunji Nakamura, chief of the city's industrial policy section. ''You need projects with good jobs that will last through a bad economy.''
Correction: March 3, 2009, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Feb. 6 about the possible lessons the United States could draw from Japan's attempts to recover from a severe downturn after the bursting of a real estate bubble in the late 1980s referred incorrectly to the steps the country took to try to stimulate its economy. Although the country spent trillions of dollars on infrastructure projects and cleaned up the debt-ridden banking system, it did not reduce consumption taxes to encourage consumer spending. (The government raised the tax in 1997 over the objection of many economists in an attempt to reduce growing budget deficits.)

HEADLINE: BIPARTISAN PUSH TO REDUCE COSTS OF STIMULUS PLAN

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Carl Hulse, Jeff Zeleny and Kate Phillips contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan group of senators worked furiously in backroom negotiations on Thursday to cut the cost of the more than $920 billion economic stimulus plan. Senate Democratic leaders said they would await the outcome of those talks before calling for a final vote on the measure, perhaps on Friday.
Members of the bipartisan group, led by Senators Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said they wanted to trim provisions that would not quickly create jobs or encourage spending by consumers and businesses. They spent much of the day scrutinizing the 736-page bill and wrangling over what to cut.
By early evening, aides said the group had drafted a list of nearly $90 billion in cuts, including $40 billion in aid for states, more than $14 billion for various education programs, $4.1 billion to make federal buildings energy efficient and $1.5 billion for broadband Internet service in rural areas. But they remained short of a deal, and talks were expected to resume Friday morning. 
''We're trying to focus it on spending that truly helps stimulate the economy,'' Ms. Collins said. ''People have different views on whether or not a program meets that test. So we're continuing to talk. We get close, and then it drops back, and then we get close again.''
President Obama, while once again urging Congress to act swiftly, avoided taking sides by saying that a package of about $800 billion was in the ballpark of what he believed the economy needed.
''The scale and scope of this plan is right,'' Mr. Obama said in a speech to House Democrats who were on a retreat in Williamsburg, Va.
''If we do not move swiftly,'' the president said, ''an economy that is in crisis will be faced with catastrophe.'' He added, ''Millions more Americans will lose their jobs. Homes will be lost. Families will go without health care. Our crippling dependence on foreign oil will continue. That is the price of inaction.''
The White House announced that Mr. Obama would make a televised speech to the nation about the economy on Monday night.
The Senate debate took place on the eve of the release of January jobs data. Economists expect the national unemployment rate to hit 7.5 percent, and to reach double digits in some industrial states. Last week, almost 4.8 million people collected unemployment insurance, the highest weekly number in 40 years.
The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said he believed that Democrats could muscle the stimulus bill through with at least two Republican votes. But late Thursday he said he would give the bipartisan group until Friday to reach a deal. If no deal is reached, he said he would call for procedural vote on Sunday aimed at moving to final vote.
The efforts of the bipartisan group, which at one point numbered about 20 senators, essentially tied Mr. Reid's hands, giving him little choice but to allow time for a compromise measure to emerge. The behind-the-scenes brokering distracted from the Senate floor where formal debate continued and senators at times traded angry barbs.
The Democrats will need the support of at least two Republicans and probably more to win passage of the stimulus bill, which for procedural reasons will require 60 votes. The Democrats now hold 58 seats, but only 57 have been voting this week. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts has been absent because of illness.
Ms. Collins is clearly one Republican they are counting on. But on Thursday evening she said she would not vote for the measure in its current form and wanted further changes in spending programs. ''My goal is to be able to support a bill,'' Ms. Collins said.
At issue is the huge package of tax breaks and government spending intended to halt the economy's downward spiral and spur a recovery that is the centerpiece of Mr. Obama's agenda. Congressional Democratic leaders have promised to adopt the measure and send it to the White House for his signature by the end of next week.
Lawmakers said they can still meet that goal. But once the Senate acts, the bill must still be reconciled with a version passed by the House last week, and some House Democrats said Thursday that they were increasingly alarmed by reports of efforts in the Senate to remove programs that they believed would lift the economy.
The cost of the Senate measure has risen substantially above the $820 billion House-passed bill, first with the addition of a $64 billion provision to spare millions of middle class Americans from paying the alternative minimum tax in 2009, and the more recent inclusion of tax breaks for purchases of homes and cars, totaling $30 billion.
As an amendment to the stimulus bill, the Senate voted on Thursday to limit pay and ban bonuses for the 25 top executives at companies that have received money from the Treasury's $700 billion bailout program for the financial industry.
The vote came a day after Mr. Obama imposed a $500,000 cap on pay for executives whose companies receive substantial bailout money in the future. The Senate provision could be applied retroactively to companies that already received rescue money.
Comments earlier in the day by Mr. Reid and other members of the Democratic leadership suggested a growing frustration with Republican opposition to the recovery measure and assertions by some in the minority party that Mr. Obama's aggressive efforts had so far failed to win over a large number of critics.
Republican efforts to drastically alter the package, by eliminating huge blocks of spending in place of expanded tax cuts, continued Thursday morning as Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, proposed yet another substitute bill, including a plan to slash corporate and personal income taxes. Democrats defeated his proposal and others.
''Despite the efforts of the president, Senator Reid and all of us to reach out, we're getting rebuffed,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, said at a news conference with other leaders. ''Has bipartisanship been a failure? Well, so far it's not working. But it takes two to tango, and the Republicans aren't dancing.''
Republicans suggested that Democrats were angry because they simply had not been able to generate widespread support for their proposal among lawmakers or the general public.
''The question is not, doing nothing versus doing something,'' the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said. ''The question is the appropriateness of an almost $1 trillion spending bill to address the problem.''
At times the spirit of bipartisanship dissipated from the chamber. At one point, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, sought to remind Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, that Democrats had agreed to add to the stimulus bill two major tax provisions proposed by Republicans.
''I thank the senator for his comments,'' Mr. Graham replied, more irked than grateful. ''If you believe this is a good process to spend $800 billion, we're on different planets. We're making this up as we go. If this is a good process, why are 16 senators meeting around the corner trying to figure out how to keep this thing from stinking?''
Moments later, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, interrupted Mr. Graham saying she wanted to ask a question, but in fact she wanted to chastise him for waving around a copy of the bill. ''Theatrical,'' she exclaimed. ''Did you do that when George Bush was president and he sent down a bill twice as big as that? Did you ever do that? You can do that. That's theatrics. You can do that.''

HEADLINE: Russia Offers Kind Words, But Its Fist Is Clenched

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY; Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Talk about mixed messages. Russia's leaders this week could not say enough good things about President Obama. His statements on Afghanistan were ''encouraging,'' his arms control proposals were ''a fresh signal,'' and plans for talks with Iran were ''encouraging signals.''
But the compliments came with the geopolitical equivalent of a punch in the nose. 
On Tuesday, in Moscow to accept $2.15 billion in Russian aid, Kyrgyzstan's president announced a decision to close an air base in Manas that the United States uses. That move poses a formidable obstacle to Mr. Obama's biggest foreign policy aim, prosecuting the Afghanistan war.
Maybe this should not have come as a surprise. Starting with the bristling speech by President Dmitri A. Medvedev hours after Mr. Obama was elected, the signals from Moscow to the new American administration have veered from hostile to conciliatory and back. Moscow is clearly exploring the idea of cooperation. But it also insists, in arm-twisting fashion, that Mr. Obama make Russia's interests a priority.
''It's not clear to me who's calling the shots or what exactly the message is,'' said Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state under President Clinton and now president of the Brookings Institution. ''It's an odd way to set the table for a serious, forward-looking dialogue. The Russians claim to want a discussion.''
Afghanistan has been seen as an important area for cooperation between the countries because Russia has deep worries about the spread of Islamic extremism in the region. That notion was thrown into doubt on Tuesday when the Kyrgyz president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, announced plans to close the base, which is used to supply the military operation in Afghanistan.
Kyrgyz and Russian officials have said the move has nothing to do with the pledge of Russian aid, but Moscow has long sought to push the United States out of the bases it has leased in Central Asia. Russian comments since then have suggested that if Mr. Obama hopes to proceed with his plans to deploy as many as 30,000 more troops in Afghanistan, he will have to secure Moscow's support. That means addressing Russian complaints about issues that include American plans for missile-defense facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic and the expansion of NATO.
''In the Russian mind, there is a window of opportunity to bargain, and if we are sitting down to bargain, we better have good cards on our side of the table,'' said Oksana Antonenko, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. ''What they see in the best-case scenario is a deal. A bargain,'' she said. ''It's not a partnership.''
The move was startling because it occurred amid a string of signals that Moscow was willing to engage Mr. Obama.
American policy makers were encouraged by Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which he muted his caustic anti-American tone. Mr. Medvedev organized a candid, hourlong meeting with the editor of Novaya Gazeta, a newspaper that is critical of the Kremlin and has lost a series of employees to gangster-style killings. He also promised to rewrite an anti-treason law that had infuriated human rights activists.
In the last two weeks, Moscow announced that it was ready to open a NATO supply route to Afghanistan through Russia. And though official sources would not confirm it, an anonymous Defense Ministry official told the Interfax news service that Moscow had dropped a plan to station Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad, near the Polish border.
Then came Tuesday's announcement about the Manas air base. ''This really did come out of the blue for me,'' said Andrew C. Kuchins, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''It is a particularly Russian tactic: it's sort of brutal, and rude, and makes it harder to achieve what you think their goal is.''
Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview on Thursday that he called his counterpart in Moscow, Gen. Nikolai Makarov, on Wednesday, but had made no headway on the base closing.
The Russians do not share Europeans' giddiness over Mr. Obama. Relations between Russia and the United States last year reached their lowest point since the Soviet Union's fall. Mr. Obama will have to deal with ''the tail end of the Bush legacy,'' including memories of last summer's war in Georgia, said Sergei M. Rogov, director of the Institute for U.S. and Canada Studies in Moscow.
''Can you imagine, after the Georgia war, that Russia would lobby Kyrgyzstan on behalf of the United States?'' he asked. He added that the decision ''was not something Russia did, it was something against which Russia didn't object.''
And Russian leaders are growing impatient to see concrete plans from Washington. Mr. Obama seems willing to slow the timeline on missile defense and NATO expansion, but not to shelve the projects publicly.
''The real ballgame has not started,'' Mr. Rogov said. ''There will be tough bargaining on many issues.''
It may be a mistake to look for a grand plan in statements coming out of Moscow, where major players still disagree about the benefits of a friendlier relationship and may be addressing domestic audiences.
One raw issue -- American influence in the post-Soviet sphere -- underlies the raft of policy disputes between the capitals, said Professor Angela E. Stent, who directs Russian studies at Georgetown University. Resolving it ''may be impossible to do,'' she said, ''but it has to be tried.''

HEADLINE: McDonald's Scales Back Prices in China

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
When McDonald's sharply lowers the price of the Filet-O-Fish sandwich and double cheeseburger in China, one thing is clear: the global slowdown has truly arrived in the once-sizzling Asian economy. 
 McDonald's announced Thursday that residents of China, the world's most populous nation, would now be able to feast on four new combo McDonald's meals -- the other two feature a chicken filet sandwich and a pork burger -- for 16.50 yuan, or $2.41, a cut of up to one-third from the former price. 
 The promotion, McDonald's said, is ''in line with the government's direction to stimulate domestic demand'' and ''help build a stronger economy.'' As the economy slows, ''we can do our part by helping stimulate domestic demand in the restaurant sector,'' said Jeff Schwartz, chief executive of McDonald's China.
 McDonald's is not the only food retailer to have lowered prices in China Others, like KFC, also have started promotions as consumers in China begin to fret about slowing growth and rising unemployment. But the price reduction by one of the world's best-known companies highlights how the downturn that began in the United States has changed shopping and selling patterns as far away as China. 
 Just a year ago, the prices of staples like pork, rice and cooking oil were soaring, lifting inflation and threatening to overheat the Chinese economy, which had recorded double-digit growth for half a decade. Now, with growth slowing to 9 percent in 2008, and expected to be even lower this year, the pressure is on for retailers to entice shoppers with special deals.
 Standard and Poor's, the ratings agency, said on Thursday that it expected China to grow about 6.5 to 7 percent this year and to pick up steam slightly next year, with a pace of 7.8 to 8.3 percent in 2010. And S.& P.'s chief economist for the Asia Pacific region, Subir Gokarn, said he expected consumer price inflation to slow to 1.7 to 2.2 percent this year, from 5.9 percent in 2008. 
 Still, China remains attractive because of the size of the market and growth rates that are still ahead of those in most of the rest of the world. McDonald's is planning to expand in China, which is now one of its fastest-growing markets. 
 McDonald's opened its first restaurant in China in the southern city of Shenzhen in 1990. Since then, the number of outlets has mushroomed to 1,050, staffed by more than 60,000 employees. Another 175 restaurants are planned for this year. 
 McDonald's has been a rare beneficiary of the global downturn, as shoppers around the world switch to lower-priced goods. Last week, the company reported that sales had continued to climb during the last three months of 2008, when nearly every other industry reported a sharp downturn.

HEADLINE: Working Away

BYLINE: By STEPHEN REGENOLD

 BODY:
A FLASH in the dark, then thunder at 11,000 feet. It was predawn on a snowy winter day at Crested Butte Mountain Resort, where ski patrollers wield explosives to assess the snowpack before the chairlifts open up.
 Across the valley, upstairs in a 5,000-square-foot home, Bill Ronai was rising to start his day: Breakfast. A phone call. E-mail.
 Maybe a ski later in the afternoon. ''I work when I have to, and I ski when I can.''
 Mr. Ronai, 62, has owned an apartment on Riverside Drive in Manhattan for three decades. But since 2002 he has run his financial consultancy many weeks of the year from a home office perched at nearly 10,000 feet in the Elk Mountains of central Colorado. 
 Like thousands of professionals around the country, Mr. Ronai has eluded the traditional constraints of geography -- not to mention altitude -- to foster a white-collar career essentially based in the wilderness. His five Colorado acres abut a national forest, and deer, bear and foxes are common sights from any one of the 10 windows in his sunny upstairs office.
 Working from a vacation home -- be it a beachside condo or a mansion in the mountains -- has become increasingly common as broadband Internet, expanding cellphone coverage, and overnight courier delivery service have added flexibility to many corporate careers. The Crested Butte area, an alpine valley home to fewer than 3,000 people, is certainly not alone in this trend, but it offers a revealing window into the phenomenon of telecommuting from a community formerly cut off from the world. 
 In 2003, Colorado laid fiber-optic lines to upgrade its telecommunications infrastructure, an initial step in bringing bandwidth and cheaper high-speed connections to mountain towns like Crested Butte, about a five-hour drive over winding mountain roads from Denver. Airplanes bank around mountains before descending to Gunnison-Crested Butte Regional Airport, where Chicago, Dallas and other major cities can be reached most days on nonstop flights. FedEx trucks rumble along Elk Avenue, the town's quaint main street with cafes, ski shops and sidewalks squeezed in by snow banks six feet high. 
 ''In this community, there are a handful of lucky people who can work anywhere they want and have chosen Crested Butte,'' said Bo Stambaugh, managing broker at Crested Butte Resort Real Estate. 
 Mr. Stambaugh said he has seen at least 20 real estate transactions in the past two years with buyers who intend to work part-time from Crested Butte. ''The mind-set is switching from 'owning a vacation home that I visit once a year' to 'having a mountain home where I come to live to the fullest.' ''
 On a chairlift ride, David Dimmock, an American who lives in London and owns two town houses in Crested Butte, pointed with a ski pole to a crater in the snow. ''There's a bomb hole,'' he observed, referencing the mark of an avalanche charge dropped by patrollers early in the day.
 It was late December, but more than 100 inches of snow had fallen already, creating tenuous avalanche conditions in the ungroomed bowls and chutes at one of Colorado's most precipitous ski areas. Mr. Dimmock, 49 and single, wanted to snoop for powder. ''Could be knee-deep in the trees,'' he said.
 Each year, Mr. Dimmock, who works in currency trading for Merrill Lynch, comes to Crested Butte for multiweek getaways. He rents out one of his four-bedroom town houses and keeps the other unit for friends, family and personal use.
 A spring break tradition in March, in which he invites coworkers to ski and stay at his town house, features early-morning stock trading. ''We set up the laptops and talk to London in the morning,'' Mr. Dimmock said. ''We ski, and then we head back home, reboot and talk to Asia in the evenings.''
 Other Crested Butte professionals have escaped city life altogether.
 Benn Dunn, 35, a risk-management consultant, came to the area on a ski vacation three years ago. He moved back permanently a couple of months later, buying a duplex near downtown and, later, a two-story home on Elk Avenue.
 Mr. Dunn, who still owns both homes but rents out the duplex, came from Canton, Conn., where he was burdened with daily commutes to Hartford or Manhattan. ''I felt like I was spending my life in a car.''
 Now Mr. Dunn, who is married and has two young children, bikes five blocks to work. His office, until a recent project change, was stocked with what he estimates was $100,000 worth of computer equipment, including high-speed T1 broadband Internet lines, a Bloomberg terminal flat-screen monitor, Web-conferencing equipment and a dedicated intranet connection to the headquarters of his employer, a hedge fund in Connecticut.
 He skis in the backcountry above Crested Butte several weekday mornings, climbing mountains to find untracked snow and taking calls and e-mail, sometimes surreptitiously, on a BlackBerry from offices back East. ''They don't always need to know where I am,'' he said.
 Technology has made geography unimportant for many jobs, said Jonathan Schechter, executive director at the Charture Institute in Jackson, Wyo., a think tank focused on community growth and sustainability in remote and small towns, including resort communities. ''There are fewer and fewer constraints for people who want to work in remote places,'' he said.
 Mr. Schechter, a former management consultant who grew up in California and worked in Boston before moving permanently to Wyoming, said the term ''telecommuting'' had lost its distinction. Answering e-mail or taking a conference call in New Jersey versus Colorado or Wyoming -- or Belize, for that matter -- is considered commonplace.
 ''People used to go to places like Crested Butte or Jackson Hole for two weeks a year on vacation,'' Mr. Schechter said. ''Now people are asking themselves, 'Why don't I live and work in a place that I love?' ''
 Mr. Schechter also said Telluride, Colo., was a good example of a town associated with vacation getaways that's now home to a growing number of telecommuters. But he noted Crested Butte in particular as a special example, as the town has emerged over the past decades from a mining bust to developing tourism and is now diversifying its local economy.
 Even in a down national economy, telecommuting can be feasible, or for some organizations, it may be economically advantageous. John Girard, a business and technology analyst at Gartner in Trumbull, Conn., said remote workers could save a corporation money. ''Companies investigating operating costs often look to trim office space and real estate,'' he said. ''One solution is to have people telecommute.''
 Mr. Girard noted that some workers were willing to accept reduced pay to telecommute and live where they wanted to live. ''In a bad economy, that makes sense.'' 
 About 7 percent of American workers in mid- to large-size corporations now do some form of telecommuting, according to Scott Morrison, a research analyst with Gartner who recently completed a major survey on telecommuting trends.
 Mr. Ronai, who has two grown children and lives with his wife, Anne, was first drawn to the Elk Mountains a decade ago on a ski trip. He and his son were on a bus riding to the airport. ''I looked back at the expanse of the mountains, the valleys, and something struck me,'' he said. 
 Over the years, the family has kept the New York apartment but moved around, including to Tokyo and London. They never forgot Colorado, and in 1999 the Ronais bought their five-acre lot above Crested Butte and hired an architect to design a home.
 White stalks of aspen trees cram in around the house, which was built in 2002. ''Our driveway is at about 9,730 feet,'' Mr. Ronai said. ''My office is higher still.''
 He scans spreadsheets on a computer screen many mornings, then leaves to ski or, in the warm months, hike or mountain bike. A golf course, fly-fishing and whitewater rafting on the Gunnison and Taylor Rivers, which swirl through the valley, are other diversions.
 Mr. Dunn, the risk-management consultant, like many locals and second-home owners, has a season pass to the town's ski resort. But most days he skips the lifts to ski under his own power in the backcountry, striding uphill for an hour or more to gain a single run.
 When his phone rings -- there is cell coverage throughout the valley -- he pauses to catch his breath. He looks at the number and answers, a hand cupped if needed to block the wind.
 On top, Mr. Dunn scans the valley. He clicks in and adjusts his goggles, pushing off. Fresh snow below for a hundred turns. Fresh snow then a ski back to his car, a quick drive to town and back to work to finish his day.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise Despite Continuing Worries

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Wall Street shrugged off worries about jobless numbers and retail sales on Thursday as indexes ended higher after erasing losses from earlier in the day. 
 Markets have moved fitfully in the last few trading sessions as lawmakers in Washington battle over an economic stimulus package and brutal economic reports roll in.
 But on Thursday, stocks sustained a rally after starting the day lower. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 106.41 points, or 1.34 percent, to 8,063.07, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.64 percent, or 13.62 points, to 845.85. The Nasdaq increased 2.06 percent, or 31.19 points, to 1,546.24, helped by gains in computer stocks. 
 ''The market's going to move sideways until we see what Washington comes up with,'' said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. 
 Shares of financial companies bounced back as investors speculated about the government's next steps to prop up the banking system, and the chance that mark-to-market accounting rules could be modified. On Wednesday night, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said that the rules could be tweaked for banks with potentially huge write-downs.
 ''The market is liking the rumors it's hearing,'' said Ryan Larson, head equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management. 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is expected to unveil a strategy next week to address the billions of bad assets on the balance sheets of major financial institutions. Despite receiving billions under the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, some big banks are still teetering.
 ''We have great hope that TARP 2 is going to be better than TARP 1,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, market strategist for the private client group at Stifel Nicolaus. ''There's no reason to that, that other than that hope always springs eternal.'' 
 Shares of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase all climbed. Bank of America also recovered after it had slipped below $5 a share on Wednesday. Bank of America's stock has dropped more than 50 percent this year as investors worry about its financial stability and potential costs from its acquisition of Merrill Lynch.
 Shares of Wal-Mart Stores rose more than 4 percent after a new report showed the world's largest retailer had defied a broad slump in retail sales in January. While sales for the entire retail industry fell 1.8 percent in January, Wal-Mart's sales increased 2.1 percent, not including fuel, according to the research firm Retail Metrics.
 Wide gains in the consumer sector buoyed companies whose sales had dropped -- sometimes by double digits -- in January. Shares of Target, Macy's and Kohl's all ended higher.
 On Thursday, the government reported that first-time unemployment claims last week rose to 626,000, the highest in 25 years.
 Businesses including Caterpillar and Home Depot have announced thousands of job cuts, and economists say they expect the unemployment rate -- to be reported on Friday morning -- to rise to 7.5 percent in January.
 ''The market's in a twilight zone right now,'' Mr. Yardeni said. ''The fact that they're not really going down sharply on bad news is heartening in a perverse way. We've been down so long it's starting to look up to us.''
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 6/32, to 107 2/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 2.91 percent, from 2.94 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Forestalling Foreclosure

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
People seem to pass certain milestones on the road of financial desperation. First the unpaid bills pile up. Then the bank forecloses. Finally, they reach the end of the line: bankruptcy court.
 But now policy makers are talking about redrawing this map by putting the bankruptcy court before foreclosure to give people a chance to keep their homes.
 It has been done before, on a relatively small scale and with some success. In the midst of the farm crisis during the 1980s, Congress gave bankruptcy judges the power to reduce onerous farm loans to reflect a steep drop in land prices.
 The Obama administration and Congressional Democrats are pushing a similar idea to stem the swelling tide of home foreclosure. Yet a close look at the farm experience raises questions about how widespread any relief would be. 
 While the creation of a special bankruptcy workout for farmers, known as Chapter 12, helped resolve that earlier crisis, many farmers still lost their farms or had to scale them back, according to judges and lawyers who studied the effects. 
 If a similar allowance is provided today for Chapter 13 filings, which let homeowners keep their property while working out their debts, bankruptcy courts could help a few million homeowners. But millions more would still face foreclosure, especially if unemployment continued to rise. Credit Suisse, for example, estimates that about 20 percent of an expected eight million foreclosures could be avoided by letting judges alter the terms of home loans. 
 ''We are making the best of a lousy situation,'' said Joseph A. Peiffer, a bankruptcy lawyer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who has represented both farmers and lenders and favors giving bankruptcy courts power to modify home loans. But, he added, ''there will still be people losing their homes.'' 
 One of his clients, a farm family in eastern Iowa, sought Chapter 12 bankruptcy in late 1986. The family had borrowed when times were good to pay medical bills, but struggled to keep up with payments when interest rates jumped and crop prices fell. The day before the family filed its case, a lender seized half of its 350 cows. ''It was sort of like a perfect storm of bad things,'' Mr. Peiffer said.
 The bankruptcy court eventually wrote down about 40 percent of the family's $1.5 million debt, and today, they are still farming, according to Mr. Peiffer. 
 That type of resolution may help troubled homeowners avoid foreclosure, advocates say. Having a bankruptcy judge change loan terms can solve disputes that bankers and borrowers might be unable to tackle on their own, they say. And some loans could become more profitable for banks in bankruptcy than in foreclosure, where losses can be 50 percent or higher after legal and home repair costs, according to Rod Dubitsky, a Credit Suisse analyst.
 Perhaps more important, a bankruptcy judge can also cut through a thicket of legal complications for mortgages packaged into securities and sold to investors, which some banks say they have no authority to modify. Some investors have threatened to sue banks if those mortgages are altered. 
 But the banking industry fiercely opposes the proposal to amend bankruptcy law. Officials warn that they would have to raise the price of credit to offset the cost of having to wait years to see whether borrowers successfully pay off modified loans -- or slide back into default. Only a third to 40 percent of Chapter 13 personal bankruptcy filings are successful, experts say, often because people lose jobs again, become sick or get divorced. 
 Foreclosure might bring them less, but banks and investors would get some money right away if they seized homes. 
 In Chapter 12, judges could change interest rates and reduce, or ''cram down,'' debts secured by farmland, which suffered a boom-bust cycle in the 1970s and 1980s. The amount written down was added to other unsecured debts, like credit card balances, which are repaid cents on the dollar from money left over after living expenses and secured debt payments. Congress made Chapter 12 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy Code in 2005. 
 Neil E. Harl, an agriculture and economics professor at Iowa State University, found that 85 percent of the first 150 farmers in Iowa who filed bankruptcy under Chapter 12 were still farming in 1995. 
 But many farmers who encountered distress did not seek bankruptcy protection: from 1986 to 1997, farmers filed 19,216 Chapter 12 cases, according to the Agriculture Department -- less than 1 percent of the two million family farms that existed in 1995. ''As soon as everybody knew it was there,'' Mr. Harl said about cram-downs, ''they did the next best thing, which is to sit down and negotiate.''
 Nonetheless, bankers say that Chapter 12 resulted in higher interest rates, as lenders passed on the costs of bankruptcy. The Agriculture Department estimated in 1997 that rates on farm loans increased by 0.25 of a percentage point to 1 percentage point as a result of the law. 
 The Financial Services Roundtable, an industry lobbying group, calculates that cram-downs may increase the cost of mortgages by up to 2 percentage points either through higher rates or bigger down payments. The restrictions on cram-downs ''keeps the cost of homes low, and this bill will unravel that,'' said Scott E. Talbott, its chief lobbyist. 
 But other experts say such estimates are inflated. Adam J. Levitin, an associate professor of law at Georgetown University who favors changing the law, said rates may only rise by 0.15 of a percentage point. 
 Lawmakers and lobbyists in Washington are deeply divided on cram-downs. The opposition includes Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who helped create Chapter 12. Banks, with the exception of Citigroup, have vowed to fight cram-downs, though some lobbyists have been pushing for amendments that would limit them to certain loans and would let lenders recoup losses if home prices rebound. 
 The Obama administration and Democrats, including Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, hope to pass the measure either on its own or as part of another bill.
 The measure is eagerly awaited by households like the Benitez family in Palm Coast, Fla., which hopes bankruptcy will help them keep their three-bedroom house. 
 Rosa Benitez, a real estate agent, and her husband, Carlos, who works in construction, have been unable to pay their mortgage since payments on their adjustable rate loan shot up in early 2008. At the same time, given the housing crash, they are making a lot less money.
 ''Everything started going down when the mortgage payments went up,'' Ms. Benitez said. The couple owes $227,000 on their mortgage and $31,000 on a home equity line of credit, but their home is worth only $175,000. Ms. Benitez said the couple could catch up if their debt was reduced to the current value of the home.
 Still, the couple, like many others, is vulnerable to falling behind again as home prices decline further. But Robert M. Lawless, a law professor at the University of Illinois who favors cram-downs, said success should not be viewed simply ''in terms of dollars and cents.''
 ''We forget the human side of the bankruptcy case,'' he said. ''Sometimes bankruptcy is about the soft landing.''

FOR CHILDREN
 THUNDERBIRD AMERICAN INDIAN DANCERS 
 Dance Concert and Powwow
 Every culture has its bogyman. 
 Or bogywoman. Just such a female creature -- ''equal-opportunity scary'' -- stars in the children's matinees of the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers. Known as the Basket Ogre to the native peoples of the Pacific Northwest, this hairy giant devours rude, grubby little ones. Her story, which recalls ''Hansel and Gretel'' (perhaps every culture has a version of that too), is playfully recounted by Matoaka Little Eagle, who plays all the parts with just enough vulgar flourishes to captivate listeners under 10. (The bogeywoman likes to suck wax out of her young victims' ears, along with their brains.) But this ogre, whose song theatergoers help bellow, is no match for motivated children; she's even a really bad dancer. 
 She is definitely, however, the only inept performer in Thunderbird's annual event at Theater for the New City, presented as a two-hour evening powwow and as a 90-minute family matinee. Narrated by Louis Mofsie, the troupe's artistic director, the afternoon program offers almost a dozen intricately choreographed dances. Highlights include an Oklahoma warriors' dance, in which men wear huge fans of feathers attached to their waists at the back, making them appear like enormous, colorful birds, and a Pueblo hoop dance, in which two performers ultimately work with four hoops apiece. Their challenge is to pick them up from the floor without using their hands.
 Children in the audience receive a challenge too: the Winnebago tribe contest dance. The company, which has its own young members (above, Ciaran Tufford) demonstrates the steps, which require each person to pluck a feather from a floor stand using only his or her mouth; hands, knees and elbows cannot touch the ground. ''When you get home,'' Mr. Mofsie genially told a recent group of eager volunteers, ''teach Mom and Dad how to do that.''
 Those who can't make it downtown to the show, which also includes what Mr. Mofsie calls ''one of the first kinds of rap,'' can catch him and some of his fellows on Saturday in Upper Manhattan. There the dancers will perform in a free and familiar setting: the great outdoors. (Dance concert, Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village; $10; matinees, $1 for children with a paying adult. Also Saturday at noon, Inwood Hill Park, meeting at Inwood Hill Nature Center, the 218th Street entrance; nyc.gov/parks/rangers, or 311.)

 'THE AFRICAN DRUM' (Sunday through Wednesday) Shadow Box Theater's multimedia presentation of traditional African tales features characters that include a talking leopard, a wise loon and a turtle that is just as resourceful as the hero of ''The Tortoise and the Hare.'' All are shadow puppets, manipulated behind a lighted screen. (Through Feb. 26.)

 'ANIMAL TALES' (Saturday and Sunday) The Lolli-Pops concerts from the Little Orchestra Society use friendly characters like Bang, Bow, Buzz and Toot to introduce music. In this case they're also introducing a program that gives tuneful life to much-loved stories. The musicians will offer Daniel Pinkham's ''Make Way for Ducklings,'' inspired by Robert McCloskey's book, and Gail Kubic's ''Gerald McBoing Boing,'' based on the Dr. Seuss classic. And Shostakovich's ''Tale of the Silly Little Mouse'' is also on the bill.

 'ARCHAEOLOGY ZONE: DISCOVERING TREASURES FROM PLAYGROUNDS TO PALACES' (Sunday through Thursday) Children will step into the shoes of an explorer like Indiana Jones in this exhibition at the Jewish Museum, but the adventures will be purely scholarly. Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. (Through June 15.) From 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. (until 8 p.m. on Thursdays), the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

Free with museum admission: $10; $7 for 65+; $5 for students; free for under 16. 
 AUDRAROX (Sunday) One way to get children to listen to parents: put Mom and Dad in a band. Most members of AudraRox, which sounds a bit like the Go-Go's, have children themselves. The group, founded by Audra Tsanos, will play a concert for ages 2 to 7 at the Jewish Museum. At 2 p.m., 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org; $15; $10 for children; $12 and $8 for family-level members. 
 'BUILDING BRAINSTORM' (Friday through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) The next generation of budding architects can try out their designs at this new exhibition at the Brooklyn Children's Museum. The bilingual display (English and Spanish) invites children to build model high-rises, houses and crawl-through spaces while devising solutions to architectural and engineering challenges. The fun also includes working with textures and materials. (Through May 3.) Friday, Wednesday and Thursday, noon to 5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. At 145 Brooklyn Avenue, at St. Marks Avenue, Crown Heights, (718) 735-4400, brooklynkids.org. Free with admission: $7.50; free for members and under 1. 
 DARWIN CELEBRATION WEEKEND (Saturday and Sunday) Happy Birthday, Charles Darwin! Although the big event -- his 200th -- doesn't actually come until Thursday, the New York Hall of Science is holding some early festivities, including a screening of ''Charlie and Kiwi,'' an animated film on his theories, and a chance to meet Darwin (well, a reasonable facsimile) and question him. Science projects include comparing fossils and matching bird beaks with their functions. From 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 699-0005, nyscience.org.

 'DEAR EDWINA' (Friday through Sunday) What if Ann Landers had been a child -- and she could sing? Then she might have been Edwina Spoonapple, the young heroine of this charming new musical by Zina Goldrich and Marcy Heisler (''Junie B. Jones''). Edwina is an advice columnist who delivers her counsel tunefully, and this show details her quest to be in a festival. (Through April 19.) Friday at 4 p.m.; Saturday at 1, 4 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at 11 a.m. and 1 and 4 p.m.; DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, dearedwina.com; $39. 
 'ELMO MAKES MUSIC' (Friday through Thursday) Young fans of ''Sesame Street'' know that the monsters living there are usually lovable rather than scary. And in this production they're musical too. This latest edition of ''Sesame Street Live'' features the cuddly monster Elmo and his neighbors helping out a new music teacher who's lost her instruments; the gang comes up with some unusual improvised replacements. (Through Feb. 16.) Friday, Wednesday and Thursday at 11 a.m.; Saturday and Sunday at 10:30 a.m. and 2 and 5:30 p.m.; WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-7171, sesamestreetlive.com; $15, $26, $37 and $54. 
 'THE FESTIVAL OF THE VEGETABLES' (Saturday and Sunday) Children don't always welcome vegetables, but they should make an exception for these: they're stars in a theater-dance-music piece about the produce-filled dreams of a toddler who falls asleep in a grocery store. Written by Michael Kosch and choreographed by his wife, Rachael Kosch, the production, for ages 5 and older, includes a brussels sprout that chases strollers and a red cabbage that's a Romeo. (Through Feb. 15.) At 11 a.m., Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302, metropolitanplayhouse.org; $12; $10 for children 12 and younger. 
 'GOLLY GEE WHIZ' (Saturday and Sunday) It's no accident that the main characters in the opening production of Tada! Youth Theater's season are named Judy and Mickey. This musical, a revival from 1999, captures the high spirits of 1930s pop culture, when stars like Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney were all the rage. The action takes place in 1939 in Happyville, where the teenage residents decide to boost the economy by putting on a show. (Maybe it will give audience members a few ideas.) (Through Feb. 15.) Saturday and Sunday at 2 and 4 p.m., 15 West 28th Street, Manhattan, second floor, (212) 252-1619, Ext. 128, tadatheater.com; $20; $8 for ages 15 and under; premium tickets (with preferred seating), $25 and $15. 
 'HARRY THE DIRTY DOG' (Saturday and Sunday) Manhattan Children's Theater has revived this 45-minute show, which is a delight for ages 3 to 8 and a source of solace to parents. After all, what if all their bath-hating toddlers were dogs? The play, adapted by Karen Abbott from Gene Zion's book of the same title, follows the adventures of the title character, a usually amiable mutt who has a strong antipathy for soap and water. (Through Feb. 22.) At noon and 2 p.m., 52 White Street, near Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $20. 
 'HIS PEOPLE' (Sunday) Children today are used to films being loud -- sometimes very loud. But this movie, made in 1925, presents its story silently, showing the efforts of a family of Russian Jews to make a new life as immigrants on the Lower East Side. But though the film has no sound, the screening will have a soundtrack: Paul Shapiro, the jazz musician, has composed a score, and his sextet will play live as Old World meets New. At 3 p.m., the Museum at Eldridge Street, Eldridge Street Synagogue, 12 Eldridge Street, between Canal and Division Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0888, eldridgestreet.org.; $10; $5 for 62+, students and 18 and under. 
 'HOUSE ABOUT IT' (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) This exhibition gives new meaning to playing house. Created by the Staten Island Children's Museum, the show, whose centerpiece is a child-size house under construction, introduces young visitors to all aspects of the building trades. Activity stations include an architect's office, a space to examine foundation materials and a workbench to practice sawing and drilling. The house offers opportunities for tiling and shingling, and a dollhouse lets young decorators ponder fabrics and furnishings. Hours: Friday, and Tuesday through Thursday, noon to 5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, (718) 273-2060, statenislandkids.org. Free with admission: $5; free for members. 
 'JOSE LIMON: THE MAKING OF AN ARTIST' (Friday, and Monday through Thursday) This latest production from Making Books Sing, an organization that turns literature for young people into musical theater, is as much about dance as about song. Based on an unfinished memoir by Jose Limon and celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth, the show illustrates his journey from poverty in Mexico to the pinnacle of the modern-dance world. With book and lyrics by Barbara Zinn Krieger and music by Charles Greenberg, the show runs one hour. At 10:30 a.m., Goldstein Theater, Kingsborough Community College, 2001 Oriental Boulevard, Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, (212) 573-8791, makingbookssing.org.; $9 to $23. 
 'MYSTERIOUS, MAGICAL MOONLIGHT' (Sunday) What is it about those silvery beams? They've inspired lovers, poets and of course composers, whose resulting works will be played in this concert, part of the Chamber Music Society's Meet the Music! series for ages 6 and older. The program will include Beethoven's ''Moonlight'' Sonata, Debussy's ''Claire de Lune'' and more recent works, including one by the M.C., Bruce Adolphe. Some science and improvisation will be offered too. At 1 and 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $15. 
 'ONCE UPON A TIME' (Sunday) Mother Goose, a cat, some mice and a kind-hearted tailor are among the characters children will meet in this production, the first annual Janet Bookspan Memorial Concert for Children and Families, aimed at listeners from kindergarten through eighth grade. Presented by the Manhattan School of Music, this free program includes the Overture from Bernstein's ''Candide,'' Ravel's ''Mother Goose'' Suite and ''The Tailor of Gloucester,'' an opera adapted by Robert Sirota, the school's president and the concert's narrator, from the book by Beatrix Potter. At 2 p.m., Borden Auditorium, 122nd Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (917) 493-4428, www.msmnyc.edu. 
 'PETER PAN AND ADVENTURES IN NEVERLAND' (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) New York might seem like a Neverland to many, and it is indeed the setting of Zakiyyah Alexander's new, Americanized adaptation of J. M. Barrie's classic. Presented by the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater as a puppet musical (Daryl Kojak composed the score), it also features a Tiger Lily who's a native of India. (Through June.) Fridays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, at 10:30 a.m. and noon (with an additional 2:30 p.m. show on Wednesdays); Saturdays and Sundays at 1 p.m.; 79th Street and the West Drive, Central Park, (212) 988-9093, cityparksfoundation.org; $8; $5 for 18 and under. Reservations required. 
 'PINKALICIOUS, THE MUSICAL' (Saturday and Sunday) It's time to think pink again. This show for ages 4 to 12, from Vital Children's Theater, is in yet another revival, so if you missed it earlier, you can catch it now at the Bleecker Street Theater. Elizabeth and Victoria Kann have adapted their children's book, in which the pink-obsessed title character finds out that sometimes being in the pink can be too much of a good thing. (John Gregor wrote the score and some of the lyrics.) (Through April 26.) At 1 p.m., 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200, vitaltheatre.org; $29.50. 
 PRESERVATION DETECTIVES' FAMILY TOURS (Sunday) The Lower East Side has transformed over the last century, but the past still comes vibrantly alive in many of its corners. One is the Eldridge Street Synagogue, the landmark 1887 building where many Jewish immigrants worshiped. Now the Museum at Eldridge Street, the organization that restored the synagogue, is leading a family tour every Sunday. Children 5 to 10 can view artifacts, learn neighborhood and cultural lore and this month design a three-dimensional community space. At 1 p.m., 12 Eldridge Street, between Canal and Division Streets, (212) 219-0302, eldridgestreet.org; $10; $8 for students and 62+; $6 for ages 5 through 18. 
 'SLEEPING BEAUTY' (Saturday and Sunday) Think of this as the fairy tale in miniature: lasting only an hour, it is set in a tiny kingdom beneath the roots of a tree. But the characters will still seem as large as life, portrayed onstage by the dancers of New York Theater Ballet, who are presenting the premiere of this new version by James Sutton. Based on the original ballet by Maurius Petipa, the dance centers on Princess Aurora's fateful 16th birthday. At 11 a.m. and 1 and 3:30 p.m., Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160, nytb.org; $30; $25 for children; except for the 3:30 p.m. performance on Saturday, a benefit for the company's study program for underprivileged children; $100 and $75, including a post-show party; reservations, (212) 679-0401. 
 'TAOUB' (Friday through Sunday) You can think of this as a collection of magic carpet rides, though the carpet in this case is a taoub, or enormous flowing sheet. The members of Groupe Acrobatique de Tanger, a company of Moroccan acrobats, use the taoub in a presentation of physical skill and ancient street arts. Recommended for ages 6 and older, this production at the New Victory Theater also incorporates live Arabic music and film projections. Friday at 7 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at noon and 5 p.m.; 209 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org; $12.50, $25 and $35.

Tennis equipment is available for loan; parents must register their children onsite. More information and a full list of locations:(347) 417-8157, nyjtl.org. 
 'TREASURE ISLAND' (Saturday and Sunday) Yo, ho ho and a bottle of rum. Well, this production won't emphasize rum, but it will offer plenty of pirate antics. A musical adaptation by Michael Sgouros and Brenda Bell, the show, recommended for ages 5 and older, is presented by Literally Alive Children's Theater, which brings books to the stage. A preshow workshop includes a discussion of Stevenson's novel and an art project, the making of a treasure chest. Workshop at 10 a.m., show at 11, Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, literallyalive.com; $25; $20 for children; workshop, $5 for children, free for adults. 
 'A YEAR WITH FROG AND TOAD'LAUREL GRAEBER 4961 'A YEAR WITH FROG AND TOAD' (Saturday and Sunday) Along with Oscar and Felix -- or, for young audiences, Bert and Ernie -- Frog and Toad are among the arts world's great Odd Couples. This musical, by the brothers Robert Reale (music) and Willie Reale (book and lyrics), brings to life their friendship, first imagined by Arnold Lobel in his 1970s series of children's books. A scaled-down version of the show that ran on Broadway in 2004, ''Frog and Toad'' has found a perfect home in Atlantic for Kids, the children's wing of the Atlantic Theater Company. (Through March 1.) At 10:30 a.m., Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (646) 216-1190, atlantictheater.org.; $15; $10 for under 12 and members. LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: Company's Fortunes Change, And the Whitney Benefits

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Even in these grim economic times, institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art are able to continue building their collections. Some are gifts from donors unaffected by the financial markets; others are acquisitions in the works before things grew ugly; and then there is art that seemed out of reach before but is now available because of changing fortunes. 
 That last category includes a new gift of about 150 works from the Altria Group (Philip Morris Companies until 2003). When it moved its headquarters to Richmond, Va., from New York last year and stopped its charitable arts financing, it donated its art collection to a number of museums including the Whitney. 
 Altria and the Whitney have had a long relationship. For 25 years the museum had a branch in the company's building at 120 Park Avenue, a space the museum was forced to close in 2008. But ties between the two organizations date to 1967 and included a special purchase fund as well as exhibition support. 
 ''It is because of this long relationship that we received so much art,'' said Donna De Salvo, the Whitney's chief curator. ''They gave us the opportunity to select the works that best complemented the collection.''
 Included in the latest gift is Philip Guston's self-portrait ''Thoughts,'' a 1972 oil on paper. ''It's one of the first times he showed himself smoking, a motif he went on to explore in subsequent works,'' Ms. De Salvo said. Altria also gave the Whitney three 1965 Warhol screenprints of Jacqueline Kennedy at different historic moments -- ''Jackie I,'' ''Jackie II'' and ''Jackie III'' -- that were included in the portfolio ''11 Pop Artists,'' that was published a year later. ''It's one of the first major Pop Art portfolios,'' Ms. De Salvo said. ''We didn't have any of them.'' 
 Traditionally the museum cherry-picks from its biennials. Last year it bought 17 works from the 2008 edition -- about the same as from past biennials -- with funds from the museum's various acquisition committees, sometimes helped by individuals. 
 For many of the artists, like the Californian Daniel Joseph Martinez, this will be the first time their work has entered the museum's permanent collection. The Whitney recently acquired Mr. Martinez's ''Divine Violence,'' a 2007 room installation consisting of 92 wooden panels painted in automotive gold flake, each bearing the name of an international organization that has links to violent or coercive tactics. ''They're beautiful and minimal, and yet what lurks beneath is something which is much more sinister,'' Ms. De Salvo said. Mr. Martinez's work also appeared in the biennial in 1993. 
 The duo Amy Granat and Drew Heitzler will also be represented in the permanent collection for the first time with ''T.S.O.Y.W.,'' a 2007 two-channel projection. The work, depicting an art road trip, is a modern-day interpretation of Goethe's romantic novel ''The Sorrows of Young Werther.'' 
 Some acquisitions deepened the museum's holdings. The Whitney added to its collection of Sherrie Levine works by buying 18 inkjet prints -- ''Equivalents: After Stieglitz,'' from 2006 -- based on Stieglitz's 1920s and '30s series of cloud images. 
 Also adding to existing holdings is a 1987-88 painting by Chuck Close of the artist Francesco Clemente. It is a gift of Leonard A. Lauder, the museum's chairman emeritus, through his American Contemporary Art Foundation. 
 New Use for Dia Site
 In October, when business slowed, the Chelsea dealer Elizabeth Dee and some colleagues began to exchange ideas about what to do in such an unusual moment. 
 ''I saw a need to bring people together to talk about moving forward,'' she said. Out of these exchanges came X, a new nonprofit space that will present a variety of initiatives, everything from traditional exhibitions and performances to site-specific installations and lectures. 
 Located in the former home of the Dia Art Foundation, at 548 West 22nd Street, in Chelsea, X will open on March 7. While it plans to hold weekly lectures and other events, the space will change programs four times a year. A group of international arts professionals -- museum directors, curators, dealers and art historians -- will have their hands in the offerings, Ms. Dee said. Cecilia Alemani, an independent curator, will be its curatorial director. 
 First up are installations by artists whose work questions today's shifting economic climate. On the building's ground floor, Mika Tajima, who is part of a collaborative called New Humans, will create an installation that is part film set, stage, green room and editing room. It will also include 35 sculptures and two streaming videos. Other members of New Humans will put on a performance too, but the date has not been set, Ms. Dee said. 
 The second, third and fourth floors will be devoted to 18 rarely shown films by Derek Jarman, the filmmaker who died in 1994 at 52. And on the roof will be the artist Christian Holstad's ''Leather Beach,'' a remake of a 2006 site-specific installation that was originally seen in a former delicatessen at East 43rd Street and Third Avenue. The piece is a meditation on urban gay culture. 
 Meanwhile a familiar work will be reinstalled in the building's stairwells: the 1996 site-specific fluorescent light installation that Dan Flavin created for the space in 1996. It is on loan from Dia. 
 Young Artists' Outlet
 Young is cool. But in the art world, young generally means unknown. So when the New Museum of Contemporary Art releases on Friday the list of artists included in its first triennial, ''The Generational: Younger Than Jesus,'' the 50 names -- all under the age of 33 -- will probably conjure few images. 
 The show -- running April 8 through June 14 and taking up the museum's entire home, on the Lower East Side -- includes an international group of artists from Algeria, Lebanon, Turkey, Venezuela, Poland and elsewhere. 
 While many have never been seen in a museum context before, a handful have. Last year Loris Greaud, for instance, became the youngest artist to show a project at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris; Cory Arcangel, a New York computer artist, was included in the 2004 Whitney Biennial; and the Beijing artist Cao Fei's work has been seen in several international biennials. Ms. Cao currently has an exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London, as well as work in Prospect.1, the survey show in New Orleans. 
 Although the Whitney has its biennial and P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center has ''Greater New York,'' Lisa Phillips, the New Museum's director, said this survey would be different. ''It's international and it's focused on a generation,'' she said. ''Something like this was lacking in the city.''

HEADLINE: China's Unemployment Swells as Exports Falter

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of migrant workers are returning here earlier than usual from their home villages after the Chinese New Year holiday. Lugging their belongings in plastic sacks and cardboard boxes, they are hoping to find increasingly scarce jobs. Many will fail.
 Liu Yijiang, a 21-year-old worker from Guangxi Province, stopped his bicycle in front of a factory's gate and explained that he had been unable to find work since he was laid off late last year by a ceiling lamp factory and went home to his village. 
 ''I came back early to see if I can find a job,'' he said. ''A lot of my friends are out of work.'' 
 A spokeswoman for the Guangdong Provincial Labor and Social Security Bureau said Thursday that 3 million of an expected 9.7 million migrant workers had returned to the province by Wednesday evening. Many have jobs waiting for them, but two million have no employment lined up and must look for work, she said. 
 Beijing authorities disclosed Monday that based on an agriculture ministry survey of villages just before the Chinese New Year holiday last week, about 20 million of the nation's 130 million migrant workers are unemployed.
 In the factory city of Dongguan, adjacent to Guangzhou, many plants have deferred reopening for up to three weeks for lack of orders from the United States and Europe, said Eddie Leung, the chairman of the Dongguan Association of Foreign Invested Enterprises.
 At Fortunique, a manufacturer of hospital gowns and other protective wear on the southern outskirts of Guangzhou, about 50 men and women showed up early Thursday morning looking in vain for jobs. More came to the gate through the day.
 ''I haven't seen that since the early 1990s,'' when China's economic boom was still in its early stages, said Charles Hubbs, the company's owner.
 Security forces are taking precautions to prevent social unrest. Police officers were positioned every few feet along the walls and fences outside the main railway station here on Thursday. Endless throngs of arrivals poured out of the massive building, their faces haggard after journeys that can be 30 hours or more in rail cars that often offer standing room only.
 At the nearby intercity bus station, loudspeakers tied with police tape to streetlamps told arrivals over and over again, ''Do not loiter or stand at the station. Move on quickly. Do not sit or squat.''
 One big question is where penniless migrant workers will sleep until they find jobs or return home. Factories here in the Pearl River delta region of Southeastern China, which accounts for nearly a third of China's exports, typically provide dormitories for a majority of their workers.
 The rest, particularly married workers, live in crowded nearby apartments.
 But factories that have shut down have closed their dormitories. Unemployed workers seem to be staying with friends in local apartments for now, manufacturing and human resources managers said. The provincial labor bureau announced Tuesday that it was setting up free job fairs in the cities. But the bureau also said it would offer numerous subsidies for workers willing to leave the cities and go to rural areas -- including free vocational classes, subsidized school fees for children and a waiver of government fees for the registration of new small businesses.
 Guangdong Province accounts for nearly a third of China's exports, making it especially vulnerable as Western retailers sharply reduce orders to focus on selling the inventory they already have.
 Electric utility use was down nearly 8 percent in December from a year ago in Guangdong and across China. Electricity is an excellent barometer of the Chinese economy because most usage is industrial, said Jing Ulrich, the chairwoman of China equities at JPMorgan Chase.
 But Guangdong's actual decline in electricity use is much greater. At least one-fifth of all electricity generated in the province until the last few months was produced by tens of thousands of diesel generators in the backyards of factories, because the provincial grid, unable to keep pace with growth, imposed severe rationing.
 This winter, all rationing has been lifted and factories have unlimited access to inexpensive electricity from the grid, so the backyard generators have been shut down. 
 Wage demands, another barometer of economic health, have plunged. Skilled workers who used to demand up to $430 a month are eagerly accepting jobs that pay half as much, managers here said.
 ''They just want a job -- no demands on salary,'' Mr. Hubbs, the Fortunique owner, said.
 One big mystery is how many factories have closed permanently and how many are simply giving long holiday furloughs to their workers. Provincial and national statistics on businesses and factories are often contradictory. And government statistics on unemployment over all are not considered reliable.
 Another big mystery is what effect unemployment will have on the number of strikes and other protests that occur here regularly. Some experts are worried.
 ''It's more possible to cause social unrest if the workers cannot find jobs,'' said Liu Kaiming, the executive director of the Institute for Contemporary Observation, an advocacy group for labor rights in Shenzhen, a factory city that abuts Dongguan and Hong Kong.
 In the last two years, there was -- on average -- one strike a day involving 1,000 or more workers in the Pearl River delta, and many more strikes by smaller groups of workers, said Han Dongfang, the director of the China Labor Bulletin, an advocacy group in Hong Kong that wants to see independent labor unions and collective bargaining in mainland China.
 He cautioned that the frequency of strikes in the region made it hard to tell whether a recent spate of strikes reported in the Hong Kong news media was the result of greater social friction, or simply more reporting in response to the global economic downturn.
 Beijing authorities plan rapid increases in economic stimulus spending in Guangdong to offset the downturn in exports here. The focus will be on building more roads, bridges and rail lines in a region that already has some of China's best infrastructure.
 But even as government investment starts to accelerate, private investment is declining, which may endanger more jobs.
 Preliminary results from a study just completed by the American Chamber of Commerce of South China, which looked at 551 mostly foreign companies, found that they planned to invest $6.5 billion this year. A similar study a year ago found plans to invest $11 billion in the next year.
 ''We're seeing people investing more methodically and more cautiously,'' said Harley Seyedin, the chamber's president.
 Separately, a national survey of Chinese purchasing managers, released Wednesday, showed that most expected the economy to continue to worsen, although the expected steepness of the decline had moderated somewhat.
 Stanley Lau, the deputy chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, which represents the owners of the 60,000 factories in the region controlled by Hong Kong business officials, estimated that 10 percent of these factories had already closed in the last year because of more stringent government policies on labor, taxes and the environment.
 Another 5 to 10 percent could close soon because of weaker export orders. ''I'm sure there will be more to come,'' he said.

To the Editor:
 ''Small Payroll, but Big Woes on Insurance'' (front page, Feb. 3) shows not only the dollar cost of health care to small businesses but also the amount of time small-business owners must spend negotiating insurance programs. This is time away from their core business and directly affects their profitability. 
 Furthermore, dealing with health insurers adds unneeded stress to their and their employees' lives. Enacting taxpayer-financed universal health care would probably do more for small businesses and the economy than all the stimulus programs proposed.

Film Series
 BREADLINES AND CHAMPAGNE (Friday through Thursday) Film Forum kicks off a monthlong festival of films made during the Great Depression on Friday with Mae West's outrageous 1933 ''I'm No Angel,'' offered at the equally outrageous admission price of 35 cents -- the average price of a Manhattan movie ticket in 1933. On Saturday and Sunday a double bill demonstrates how deeply Hollywood was concerned with the social issues of the day: Frank Borzage's glorious romance ''Man's Castle,'' with Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young as unemployed residents of a Central Park shantytown, and Frank Capra's didactic comedy ''American Madness,'' in which a heroic banker (Walter Huston) resists a run on his establishment. The pleasures continue through March 5, with many of the Warner Brothers titles shown in newly struck prints from the original camera negatives in the Library of Congress. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $11. (Dave Kehr) 
 FADED GLORY (Friday through Wednesday) With 35 titles offered, this has to be one of the largest retrospectives of the independent black cinema -- a k a ''race movies'' -- ever assembled in New York. The program begins on Friday at 7 p.m. with a screening of a new 35-millimeter print of Spencer Williams's magnificent work ''The Blood of Jesus,'' a 1941 film that energetically tramples the rules of Hollywood storytelling as it tries to translate the style and substance of a religious revival meeting into cinematic terms. The film scholar Jacqueline Stewart will introduce the program. At 9:30 p.m., there's ''God's Step Children'' (1938), the first of several films in the program by the indomitable Oscar Micheaux, one of the earliest and certainly the most persistent creator of films for African-American audiences. Micheaux's 1925 ''Body and Soul,'' which will be screened at 8 p.m. on Saturday, with musical accompaniment by the pianist Donald Sosin and the bass singer Kevin Maynor, is probably the director's most fully realized work. It is a parable about twin brothers -- one an alcoholic thief, the other a college-educated inventor -- both played by Paul Robeson. Other highlights include Richard Maurice's ''Eleven P.M.'' (Sunday), a rarely screened experimental feature from 1928; Richard Norman's ''Flying Ace'' (Wednesday), a 1926 action film produced by the Florida-based Norman Film Manufacturing Company; Murray Roth's ''Yamekraw'' (Tuesday and Wednesday), a one-reel vision of African-American history, based on James P. Johnson's composition and filmed in 1930 at Warner Brothers' Brooklyn studios; and Edgar G. Ulmer's 1939 ''Moon Over Harlem'' (Sunday and Tuesday), a gangster film shot in a New Jersey warehouse on a budget of $8,000. The series runs through Feb. 19. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr)
 MOVIES
 Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.
 'BRIDE WARS' (PG, 1:34) Die, Bridezilla, die! (Manohla Dargis) 
 'CADILLAC RECORDS' (R, 1:48) This rollicking and insightful celebration of Chicago blues serves as a group portrait of a remarkable, volatile constellation of artists, including Muddy Waters (the impressive Jeffrey Wright), Chuck Berry (Mos Def) and Etta James (Beyonce Knowles). This movie is crowded and sprawling, and if it rambles sometimes, that's just fine. (A. O. Scott)
 'CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA' (PG-13, 2:20, in Hindi, Cantonese and Mandarin) The immensely popular Akshay Kumar stars in this genial mash-up of Bollywood and kung fu. Too frantic at the beginning, ''Chandni'' settles down to become an enjoyable if slight Saturday matinee picture. It was financed and distributed by Warner Brothers, a first for Bollywood. (Rachel Saltz) 
 'CHE' (R, 4:17, in Spanish and Englishshown in two parts 2:09 and 2:08) Nearly four and a half hours long and spanning more than a decade, ''Che'' surely deserves the overworked, frequently misapplied label of epic. But it's a narrow epic, and while Benicio Del Toro, in the title role, offers a performance that's technically flawless, the movie is politically naive and dramatically inert. (Scott)
 'THE CLASS' (No rating, 2:08, in French, with English subtitles) An artful, intelligent, heartfelt fiction film from the director Laurent Cantet about modern French identity and the attempt to transform young students of all sizes, shapes and colors into citizens through talk, talk, talk. (Dargis)
 'THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON' (PG-13, 2:47) A hothouse blossom of romance, intrigue and breathtaking digital effects from David Fincher (''Zodiac,'' ''Fight Club''). Brad Pitt stars as a man who ages backward, but it is Cate Blanchett who provides the film's delicate, graceful emotional center of gravity. (A. O. Scott) 
 'DOUBT' (PG-13, 1:44) Adapted by John Patrick Shanley from his stage play, this drama about a Roman Catholic priest suspected of child molestation stars a tamped-down Philip Seymour Hoffman as the accused and an energetic, often wackily comic Meryl Streep as his accuser. (Dargis) 
 'FROST/NIXON' (R, 2:02) It's twinkle (Michael Sheen) versus glower (Frank Langella) in Ron Howard's amusing, facile edition of the Peter Morgan theatrical smackdown. (Dargis)
 'FROZEN RIVER' (R, 1:37) Venturing deep into the trenches where hard-working Americans struggle to put food on the table, Courtney Hunt's powerful, somber film evokes a perfect storm of present-day economic and social woes. Playing an impoverished mother of two who smuggles illegal aliens across the Canadian border, Melissa Leo gives an awards-worthy performance. (Stephen Holden)
 'GRAN TORINO' (R, 1:56) Once again Clint Eastwood shows everyone how it's done, with a sleek muscle car of a movie set in that industrial graveyard called Detroit about a racist who befriends a besieged Hmong family next door. (Dargis)
 'HAPPY-GO-LUCKY' (R, 1:58) Happiness is a complicated, difficult matter, and for the bopping bloom at the center of Mike Leigh's generous, expansive new film -- a gurgling stream of giggles, laughs and words played by a glorious Sally Hawkins -- it's also a question of faith. (Dargis)
 'HOTEL FOR DOGS' (PG, 1:40) Children and dogs: those two magic words distill the appeal of this cuter-than-cute, sweeter-than-sweet family film about animal-loving kids who embark on a crusade to rescue all the stray pooches in a fictional city. (Holden)
 'INKHEART' (PG, 1:43) A movie about books coming to life that never manages to do so itself. (Scott) 
 'I'VE LOVED YOU SO LONG' (PG-13, 1:55, in French) The French novelist Philippe Claudel, making his debut as a director, shows sobriety and restraint in this story of a woman making her way back into normal life after serving a prison sentence for the murder of her son. Kristin Scott Thomas gives a remarkable lead performance, and Elsa Zylberstein as her sister is nearly as good. A climactic plot twist cheapens and diminishes the film somewhat, but it is still, for the most part, a powerful and subtle melodrama. (Scott)
 'JUST ANOTHER LOVE STORY' (No rating, 1:40, in Danish) As this twisty Danish thriller zigzags between austere realism and surreal gore, you have the not unpleasant sense of being taken for a ride. It may not go anywhere in particular, but it is as exciting as a trip through a well-equipped, scary fun house. (Holden) 
 'LAST CHANCE HARVEY' (PG, 1:38) Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson don't make a lot of sense as a screen couple, but there's something irresistible about watching two people fall in love, even in contrived, sniffle- and sometimes gag-inducing films like this one. (Dargis)
 'LET THE RIGHT ONE IN' (No rating, 1:54, in Swedish) A charming and chilling Swedish love story directed by Tomas Alfredson about a lonely boy and the girl next door who may just happen to be a vampire. (Dargis)
 'LUCK BY CHANCE' (No rating, 2:26, in Hindi and English) This enjoyable Bollywood offering spends a lot of its time wittily satirizing Bollywood itself as it tells the story of two young actors finding and losing romance as they try to find movie fame. Farhan Akhtar is a find as the male lead; Zoya Akhtar, his sister, wrote and directed. (Neil Genzlinger) 
 'MAN ON WIRE' (PG-13, 1:34) Philippe Petit's 1974 tightrope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center might have seemed, at the time, like a crazy stunt, but James Marsh's beautiful documentary understands it as a work of art. (Scott)
 'MARLEY AND ME' (PG, 2:05) The bland, obsequious screen adaptation of John Grogan's best-selling 2005 memoir of his up-and-down relationship with an unruly Labrador retriever has a surefire tear-jerker ending. But the bond between human and pet and what they can learn from each other remains unexplored. (Holden) 
 'MEDICINE FOR MELANCHOLY' (No rating, 1:27) The day after a one-night stand, two young, black San Franciscans (Wyatt Cenac and Tracey Heggins) muse on matters of love, race and urban life in Barry Jenkins's modest, witty and self-assured first feature. (Scott) 
 'MEMORIAL DAY' (No rating, 1:33) Spring-break delirium is equated with the excesses at Abu Ghraib in this dubious exercise in mock-documentary conceptualism. (Nathan Lee) 
 'MILK' (R, 2:08) Gus Van Sant's film about Harvey Milk (1930-78), the San Francisco City supervisor who was one of the first openly gay elected officials in the country, is less a standard biopic than a sharp, lyrical history lesson, touching not only on a crucial decade in the gay-rights movement but also on the rough and tumble of big-city politics and the tricky ways of love. Sean Penn outdoes himself as Milk, balancing his intense conviction with an unusual and welcome playfulness. The large supporting cast is also excellent, and includes James Franco as Milk's lover and campaign manager, Scott Smith, and Josh Brolin as Dan White, Milk's colleague on the Board of Supervisors and also his murderer. (Scott)
 'MOSCOW, BELGIUM' (No rating, 1:42, in Flemish) You may have observed the characters' banal situations in countless other movies, not to mention in your own life, but it is unusual to find them explored with such matter-of-fact truthfulness. (Holden)
 'MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3D' (R, 1:41) Adding an extra dimension to the fondly remembered 1981 Canadian slasher about a rogue slayer in a small mining town, ''My Bloody Valentine 3D'' blends cutting-edge technology and old-school prosthetics to produce gore you can believe in. And if the gas-masked villain is less than terrifying, his pursuit of a naked young woman (Betsy Rue) is inspired. If there were an award for acting full-frontally while wearing sky-high stilettos, Ms. Rue would surely teeter away with it. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
 'NEW IN TOWN' (PG, 1:36) In this flat romantic comedy Renee Zellweger plays a corporate shark from Miami dispatched to an underperforming branch in New Ulm, Minn., where the folksy locals (including Harry Connick Jr.) thaw her frozen heart. (Holden) 
 'NOT EASILY BROKEN' (PG-13, 1:39) Directed by Bill Duke and based on a novel by the megachurch minister T. D. Jakes, this story of a marriage under stress is hokey and sometimes clumsy, but anchored in an earnest engagement with the lives of its characters, who have the good fortune of being portrayed by a fine cast. (Scott)
 'NOTORIOUS' (R, 2:02) The legend of Biggie Smalls, the Brooklyn-born rapper who was murdered in 1997, is given the full epic-melodrama-biopic treatment in this uneven, rarely dull film, among whose producers are Smalls's mother, Violetta Wallace, and his friend and mentor Sean Combs. Those two important figures are played by Angela Bassett and Derek Luke, while Smalls is impersonated by Jamal Woolard, whose faithful mimicry compensates for some of his limitations as an actor. (Scott)
 'PAUL BLART: MALL COP' (PG, 1:30) Fat people are funny. Fat people who run into things are funnier. Fat people who run into things and have humiliating working-class jobs? Stop, you're killing me! (Lee)
 'RACHEL GETTING MARRIED' (R, 1:54) Anne Hathaway plays Kym, furloughed from rehab to attend her sister Rachel's wedding. The director, Jonathan Demme, working from a script by Jenny Lumet, takes a fairly conventional family-therapy drama and packs it with exuberant vitality. There is ample sorrow and recrimination at this party, but nonetheless you'll be sorry when it ends. (Scott)
 'THE READER' (R, 2:03) You have to wonder who, exactly, wants or perhaps needs to see another movie about the Holocaust that embalms its horrors with artfully spilled tears and also asks us to pity a death camp guard. Kate Winslet plays the guard; Stephen Daldry directs. (Dargis)
 'REVOLUTIONARY ROAD' (R, 1:59) Sam Mendes directs Kate Winslet and a fine Leonardo DiCaprio in a waxworks edition of the corrosive, furiously unsentimental novel by Richard Yates about an unhappy marriage in the mid-1950s. (Dargis)
 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' (R, 2:00) A modern fairy tale from Danny Boyle (''Trainspotting'') about a pauper angling to become a prince, this sensory blowout largely takes place amid the squalor of Mumbai, India, where lost children and dogs sift through trash so fetid that you swear you can smell the discarded mango as well as its peel. (Dargis)
 'SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK' (R, 2:04) To say that Charlie Kaufman's feature debut is one of the best films of the year or even the one closest to my heart is such a pathetic response to its soaring ambition that I might as well pack it in right now. (In other words: Go!) (Dargis)
 'THE UNBORN' (PG-13, 1:40) There's a dybbuk loose, and Gary Oldman is the rabbi who must stop it. (Dargis)
 'UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS' (R, 1:32) Michael Sheen howls up a storm in this prehistory to the first two ''Underworld'' flicks, which rewinds to when the werewolves rebelled against their vampire masters. (Dargis) 
 'THE UNINVITED' (PG-13, 1:27) Regrets only. (A. O. Scott)
 'VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA' (PG-13, 1:36) A rueful comedy from Woody Allen about two young American women (Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall) who, during a summertime European idyll, savor numerous Continental delicacies, some provided by the equally alluring Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz.

 'WALTZ WITH BASHIR' (R, 1:27) Ari Folman's animated documentary about Israeli soldiers haunted by memories of the 1982 Lebanon war is part memoir, part dream, part combat picture and altogether amazing. (Scott)
 'WENDY AND LUCY' (R, 1:20) In Kelly Reichardt's latest film Michelle Williams plays Wendy, a lonely young woman who encounters a run of bad luck while drifting through Oregon and Washington with her dog, Lucy. At first glance the film seems like little more than an extended anecdote, but underneath this plain narrative surface is a lucid and melancholy inquiry into the current state of American society. (Scott) 
 'THE WRESTLER' (R, 1:45) Mickey Rourke, with sly, hulking grace, stars as a washed-up wrestler hoping for a comeback. But like its hero, the movie has a blunt, exuberant honesty, pulling off even its false moves with conviction and flair. (Scott)

HEADLINE: Focus on Bonds Misses Bigger Picture

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Like the relentless Lt. Philip Gerard of the 1960s' TV series ''The Fugitive,'' the United States government has chased Barry Bonds to the ends of the earth in hopes of convicting him on charges that he lied to a grand jury investigating steroid use in sports.
 There have been raids, and the government has thrown Bonds's former trainer Greg Anderson in prison because he refused to testify against Bonds. 
 On Wednesday, 300 pages of evidence against Bonds were released that may have put doubt in the minds of his most devout supporters. But the Bonds case is no longer about doubt or supporters. It is about scale and priorities.
 The intensity of the government in this case has even some lawyers beginning to question its actions.
 ''When you step back, you really do have to wonder what's going on,'' Carl Tobias, the Williams professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said Thursday.
 ''Why are they so aggressive? Why have they spent so much money, and to what end? I don't know what the point is anymore.''
 At a time when the nation is in one of the deepest recessions in its history, when hundreds of thousands of Americans are barely surviving, the government is spending millions of dollars to prosecute Barry Bonds.
 On Thursday, the federal court in San Francisco dealt the government's case a potential setback when United States District Judge Susan Illston said she would most likely throw out doping calendars and ledgers that prosecutors contended Anderson used to monitor Bonds's use of performance-enhancing drugs. She also said she would very likely throw out the results from three positive tests for steroids in 2000 and 2001 as evidence at the trial.
 Significantly, Illston said that the government needed someone to state that the test samples came directly from Bonds. Without that, Illston said, ''the documentation is not hooked up to this case.'' She called the claims that the test results were from Bonds ''classic hearsay.''
 That someone would presumably be Anderson.
 After all the pages are read, all the smoke is cleared, the case against Bonds may come down to loyalty. As long as Anderson is willing to choose prison over testifying against his friend and client, the government's case may well depend on hearsay.
 The trial is scheduled to begin March 2, but is there anyone in the San Francisco jury pool who has not heard about the perjury charges against Bonds and formed an opinion?
 ''Maybe the case can't even be heard in San Francisco,'' Tobias said.
 Where can it be moved? To Mars?
 The larger question is, why does the government persist?
 During the presidential campaign, then-Senator Obama suggested that having the government spend inordinate resources on steroids-related issues was not a prudent use of time or resources and suggested that the topic should not be a high priority for Congress or the federal government.
 Appearing on the ESPN radio show ''Mike and Mike in the Morning'' last October, Obama, when asked about how much the government should be involved in the steroids issue, said that ''seeing a lot of Congressional hearings around steroid use is not probably the best use of Congressional time.''
 While Obama acknowledged that young people are drawn to sports and many make sports stars their heroes, he said that the nation had far greater priorities. ''We've got nuclear weapons and a financial meltdown to worry about,'' he said. ''We shouldn't be worrying about steroids as much as I think sometimes we do.''
 Nor should the government, with potentially thinning evidence, be spending millions of dollars in pursuit of Bonds.
 There are, of course, legitimate concerns that the judicial system will be corrupted if people get away with lying to grand juries. So why, then, as Tobias pointed out, is Scooter Libby free? 
 ''The one case that I think is similar is the Scooter Libby case in the sense that it was all about perjury,'' Tobias said.
 Libby was indicted on federal charges of perjury and obstruction of justice resulting from the grand jury investigation into the leaking of the identity of the C.I.A. operative Valerie Plame. He was convicted on one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury and one count of making false statements to federal investigators. The prison sentence was commuted by President Bush.
 It was under the Bush administration that the Olympic sprinter Marion Jones was jailed after she admitted to making false statements about her use of performance-enhancing drugs, the N.F.L. quarterback Michael Vick was sent to prison on a dogfighting conspiracy charge and the rigorous pursuit of Bonds began.
 The new administration should step in and instruct the United States attorney's office to end this fool's mission against Bonds. His reputation has been destroyed and his hopes of reaching the Hall of Fame have probably been dashed. And the United States is out of millions of dollars in taxpayer money.
 And to what end?
 So prosecutors can say, ''We struck out Barry Bonds.''
 Let it go, Lt. Gerard.

HEADLINE: On The Edge

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
A not-so-funny thing happened on the way to economic recovery. Over the last two weeks, what should have been a deadly serious debate about how to save an economy in desperate straits turned, instead, into hackneyed political theater, with Republicans spouting all the old cliches about wasteful government spending and the wonders of tax cuts. 
 It's as if the dismal economic failure of the last eight years never happened -- yet Democrats have, incredibly, been on the defensive. Even if a major stimulus bill does pass the Senate, there's a real risk that important parts of the original plan, especially aid to state and local governments, will have been emasculated. 
 Somehow, Washington has lost any sense of what's at stake -- of the reality that we may well be falling into an economic abyss, and that if we do, it will be very hard to get out again.
 It's hard to exaggerate how much economic trouble we're in. The crisis began with housing, but the implosion of the Bush-era housing bubble has set economic dominoes falling not just in the United States, but around the world. 
 Consumers, their wealth decimated and their optimism shattered by collapsing home prices and a sliding stock market, have cut back their spending and sharply increased their saving -- a good thing in the long run, but a huge blow to the economy right now. Developers of commercial real estate, watching rents fall and financing costs soar, are slashing their investment plans. Businesses are canceling plans to expand capacity, since they aren't selling enough to use the capacity they have. And exports, which were one of the U.S. economy's few areas of strength over the past couple of years, are now plunging as the financial crisis hits our trading partners.
 Meanwhile, our main line of defense against recessions -- the Federal Reserve's usual ability to support the economy by cutting interest rates -- has already been overrun. The Fed has cut the rates it controls basically to zero, yet the economy is still in free fall. 
 It's no wonder, then, that most economic forecasts warn that in the absence of government action we're headed for a deep, prolonged slump. Some private analysts predict double-digit unemployment. The Congressional Budget Office is slightly more sanguine, but its director, nonetheless, recently warned that ''absent a change in fiscal policy ... the shortfall in the nation's output relative to potential levels will be the largest -- in duration and depth -- since the Depression of the 1930s.''
 Worst of all is the possibility that the economy will, as it did in the '30s, end up stuck in a prolonged deflationary trap.
 We're already closer to outright deflation than at any point since the Great Depression. In particular, the private sector is experiencing widespread wage cuts for the first time since the 1930s, and there will be much more of that if the economy continues to weaken.
 As the great American economist Irving Fisher pointed out almost 80 years ago, deflation, once started, tends to feed on itself. As dollar incomes fall in the face of a depressed economy, the burden of debt becomes harder to bear, while the expectation of further price declines discourages investment spending. These effects of deflation depress the economy further, which leads to more deflation, and so on. 
 And deflationary traps can go on for a long time. Japan experienced a ''lost decade'' of deflation and stagnation in the 1990s -- and the only thing that let Japan escape from its trap was a global boom that boosted the nation's exports. Who will rescue America from a similar trap now that the whole world is slumping at the same time?
 Would the Obama economic plan, if enacted, ensure that America won't have its own lost decade? Not necessarily: a number of economists, myself included, think the plan falls short and should be substantially bigger. But the Obama plan would certainly improve our odds. And that's why the efforts of Republicans to make the plan smaller and less effective -- to turn it into little more than another round of Bush-style tax cuts -- are so destructive.
 So what should Mr. Obama do? Count me among those who think that the president made a big mistake in his initial approach, that his attempts to transcend partisanship ended up empowering politicians who take their marching orders from Rush Limbaugh. What matters now, however, is what he does next. 
 It's time for Mr. Obama to go on the offensive. Above all, he must not shy away from pointing out that those who stand in the way of his plan, in the name of a discredited economic philosophy, are putting the nation's future at risk. The American economy is on the edge of catastrophe, and much of the Republican Party is trying to push it over that edge.

HEADLINE: Young Wizard of the Canvas Who Left the Masters Speechless

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
In 1617 a cross-eyed young artist came to the attention of the master of Bolognese painting, Ludovico Carracci, then in his 70s. Astounded by the youngster's talent, the old man described him in a letter as a ''freak of nature'' who ''leaves even the most distinguished painters speechless.'' 
 That young artist was Giovanni Francesco Barbieri, known as Guercino, a nickname meaning ''squinter.'' Born in the village of Cento, just north of Bologna, in 1591, Guercino went on to have a long, celebrated and lucrative career as a speedy and prolific painter of frescoes, altarpieces and oil paintings before his death in 1666. 
 Paintings by Guercino hang in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Getty Museum, the Hermitage and many other major institutions. According to H. W. Janson's ''History of Art,'' ''the Baroque style reaches a thunderous climax'' in his ceiling fresco ''Aurora'' in the Villa Ludovisi in Rome: a wild, windy view from below of the sun god racing across the sky in a horse-drawn chariot.
 Now a series of works from Guercino's earliest, least-known years is on view at the Italian Cultural Institute in Manhattan. It is not an astonishing show, pace Carracci, but it is interesting and, in a quiet, unassuming way, beguiling. 
 The bulk of the exhibition consists of a series of small, mostly pastoral frescoes that Guercino produced around 1617 for the walls of Casa Pannini, home of a wealthy family in Cento. Because of the deterioration of the house around 1840, restorers removed as many of the murals as they could and transferred them to canvases, rendering them portable. 
 They still have painted plaster surfaces, which gives them an appealing physical presence. But unlike oil paintings on canvas, they are made in an economical and, in many cases, sketchy manner, and their colors, which look as though they might have been bright and luminous at first, are now muted and dingy. Nevertheless they project an absorbing visual poetry. (The frescoes are all from the Municipal Art Gallery of Cento and have never been shown in the United States.)
 The earliest piece in the show, a faded fragment of a fresco showing Mary gazing at her child, is traditionally said to have been made by Guercino when he was just 8. If so, he was certainly some kind of prodigy.
 Images from the Casa Pannini include scenes of people hunting, farming, fishing and otherwise enjoying blissful rural lives. Many have illusionistic carved stone frames, which make them seem like windows to the outdoors. Among the more peacefully bucolic paintings is a landscape with a river, a small mill and a pointy mountain rising in the hazy distance. With its beautifully modulated atmospheric perspective, it conveys an Edenic natural harmony. 
 In several pictures, including two rear views of nude putti and two grisaille paintings of reclining figures personifying painting and sculpture, architectural settings suggest that the frescoes were designed to visually merge with the original construction of the house.
 Some pictures are violent. One shows men fighting bears in a mountainous landscape. ''Ostrich Hunting'' depicts hunters in turbans with spears and long poles attacking an enormous bird. ''Animals Fighting in a Pen'' takes place in a zoo: a crowd looks in through barred windows to a room where a big dog spars with a lion while a small elephant lies apparently dead in a corner.
 A somber, meditative note is struck by a picture of an old, bony, white horse grazing in a dark green landscape under a gray sky with the glowing, pale pink of the setting sun over the horizon. It is a sad allegory of death.
 Organized by Renato Miracco, director of the Italian Cultural Institute, along with Fausto Gozzi of Cento and Milena Naldi of Bologna, the exhibition also includes some lovely small oil paintings. The highlight is ''Mystic Wedding of St. Catherine in the Presence of Saint Carlo Borromeo'' (1614-15), a richly colored oil on panel painting in which the naked baby Jesus, a sturdy toddler, sits on the lap of a woman luxuriantly enveloped in pink and royal blue as a worshipful, kneeling man with a scarlet cape over his white robes looks on.
 Almost equally compelling is ''Madonna of the Sparrow'' (1618-20), an exquisitely tender, deeply shadowed image of Mary with a little bird on one finger and her pudgy baby on one knee. Gazing raptly at the bird, the child holds a string that is tied to its leg.
 Perhaps the most intriguing picture is an oil on canvas from 1615-17 depicting a funny-looking man in a floppy hat with a turned-up brim riding a mule and holding a staff with a little owl perched on its end. He is Rinaldo Corradino, a Don Quixote-like fictional character said to be ''by nature a ridiculous man.'' 
 ''Guercino'' continues through March 2 at the Italian Cultural Institute, 686 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 879-4242, iicnewyork.esteri.it.

HEADLINE: For Hard Times, Softer Sells

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Hyundai promises potential customers that they can return their new cars ''if you lose your income in the next year.'' Carmel 6, a taxi and limousine service in the Northeast, gives viewers stressed by ''these times of economic turmoil'' 30 seconds of silence -- no narrator, music or sales pitch.
 And Travelocity, the online travel agency, is running a bare-bones spot featuring its ''roaming gnome'' mascot, but the little guy isn't moving. Instead, handwritten signs are held up announcing deep discounts on hotels. ''We know times are tight,'' the signs say. ''So we are cutting our budget for this commercial.'' 
 Television advertisements are adjusting to the recession more speedily than the programming they bracket. ''Judge Judy'' is still hollering at absentee dads, ''Two and a Half Men'' continues to titter about blondes, booze and promiscuity, and even ''Law & Order'' rips its murder plots from last year's headlines. Advertisers, trying to sell their wares against a backdrop of collapsing 401(k) plans, lost jobs and foreclosed houses, have adopted a tone that is a jangle of mournful compassion and forced good cheer. 
 It's not an absolute shift or even a constant one. Television advertising's altered mood is a little like the changes in fall foliage; just as autumn leaves turn earlier and more intensely in Vermont, the most direct and bleakest ads cluster around morning cable news shows, echoing the latest stock market dips and unemployment figures. They grow gentler and more sparse around daytime soap operas and talk shows. By prime time, the messages are oblique. 
 Best Buy, the consumer electronics chain, doesn't address the economic woes head-on; it tries to assuage a potential buyer's remorse. One recent ad cast the purchase of a 60-inch flat-screen HDTV not as self-indulgence, but as an O. Henryish act of loving sacrifice. After a man sells his football season tickets to pay for the wedding, his grateful bride surprises him with a huge set so he can still watch the big game. A kindly salesman sums it up this way: ''Another love story at Best Buy with a 60-inch TV in the middle.''
 Even ads shown during the Super Bowl on Sunday -- costing up to an estimated $3 million for a 30-second spot and as eagerly watched as ever -- had veiled allusions to the economy buried inside outwardly positive and humorous commercials that hewed to campaign styles of yesteryear. 
 A Budweiser commercial for Bud Light signaling that people will do anything to hold onto their favorite beer was uncannily like one that ran at the Super Bowl 10 years ago, except that this one was adjusted for stagnation. 
 The 1999 ad showed two grungy young men at a grocery store checkout who, short on money, opt to go without toilet paper rather than put back their six-pack of Bud Light. In 2009 the people lacking cash are white-collar workers who, while sitting around a conference table, offer to forgo their bonuses rather than sacrifice their daily ration of Bud Light. (The employee who timidly suggests cutting the office beer budget is tossed out the window.)
 Banks, financial service companies and insurance brokers don't have the luxury of making light of the bad news, though some try to ignore it. Citibank is running ads that promise clients cautious, loyal stewardship and business as usual, with no mention of the frozen credit market and Citigroup's multibillion-dollar bailouts, let alone bonuses and corporate jets. 
 Allstate Insurance takes the opposite approach, selling itself as steeled for austerity by the Great Depression. Against a montage of Walker Evans-style photographs of bread lines and weary sharecroppers, the actor Dennis Haysbert says,''1931: not exactly a great year to start a business, but that's when Allstate opened its doors.'' 
 Explaining that the company has weathered 12 recessions since then, Mr. Haysbert offers viewers hope and even a silver lining, noting that bad times force people to ''start enjoying the small things in life.'' The screen flashes to a large family around a dinner table. ''It's back to basics,'' he says.
 Not all ads try to ride the recession, of course. Evening news broadcasts are still framed with life-affirming ads for Paxil, Pavix, Reclast and other medications. Models and movie stars still shill for Jennie Craig and L'Oreal. But increasingly, commercials for luxury goods adjoin sorrowful paid appeals -- lobbying campaigns -- by teachers, hospital workers and industry groups, and the contrast is stark and unnerving. 
 Mercedes-Benz has an ad that shows its GLK utility vehicle racing at top speed through ancient, narrow streets of a picturesque Tuscan village. The image is supposed to showcase the new S.U.V.'s smaller size and agility, but especially in today's climate, it mostly suggests a boorish insensitivity to the local population.
 The ad looks all the more tactless when it is followed by one placed by the United Federation of Teachers that shows a group of well-behaved children constructing model bridges and skyscrapers out of paper and paste. ''Kids rarely get a second chance,'' a sonorous voice-over intones. ''So even in difficult times, investing in our children cannot be put on hold.''
 Educators aren't the only ones taking their case to the public. Interest groups that normally channel their lobbying efforts toward government are using available ad time to lobby viewers on everything from environmental protection and health care to natural gas.
 Some try to shame public officials: in New York, an ad placed by a health care association and union includes a blind patient in a wheelchair castigating Gov. David A. Paterson, who is legally blind, for hospital cutbacks with the words, ''How could you do this to me?'' 
 Commercials for food and household products stress frugality over taste and prestige, and they echo tips and feature stories that now fill shows like ''Oprah'' and morning news programs. On Wednesday the hosts of ''Today'' donned Snuggies, those fashion-backward fleece blankets with sleeves that are advertised on television as a way to keep down heating costs. 
 In the post-prosperity era, news programs look like infomercials, and commercials try to look like newcasts. An ad for Francesco Rinaldi pasta sauce features a female anchor -- introduced by the kind of pulsing theme music used on CNN and MSNBC -- who announces a news flash: ''Now you can feed a family of four for under $10.'' 
 More and more of the commercial time slots abandoned by banks and car companies are being filled with infomercials, even in prime time, and not just for companies trying to sell foreclosed and repossessed homes. Those businesses are producing some of the peppiest ads on television. 
 ''John, going to see those TFPs was so much fun!'' a woman says chirpily, referring to tax foreclosure properties in an infomercial for John Beck's Free and Clear Real Estate System. ''I just can't believe how much money you can make from them!''
 No matter how bad the economy gets, advertising will always try to appeal to vanity, and commercials will never stop trafficking in youth and beauty. Privilege, however, is no longer something to aspire to. 
 A Frito-Lay spot for Cheetos features a soccer mom munching on a bag of chips at a game, rolling her eyes as a snootily dressed lady natters to her about her son Cody's ''trilingual immersion program'' and his fluency in Mandarin. The mom, getting ready to leave, kisses the annoying woman goodbye, deliberately smearing the back of her snow-white blouson with orange Cheetos crumbs. 
 The commercial isn't selling flavor, and it certainly isn't marketing the chips as a clean, easy-to-eat snack. The company is signaling what so many other advertisers are seeking to convey these days: forget the haves; they have something to offer the have-less.

HEADLINE: The Upside To Resisting Globalization

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
As globalization spread in recent decades, the pace of world economic growth picked up. Open economies, it turns out, can grow faster than closed ones.
 But now, as the financial crisis has turned to an economic one, it appears that those running a closed economy may be in better shape to weather the storm.
 Kenneth S. Rogoff, the Harvard economist, noted at the International Monetary Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week that India, which has ''comparatively stringent restrictions on international capital flows,'' also seemed to have the most optimists and seemed to be in line for economic growth in a year when few countries are. 
 ''Thank heavens for the strong regulatory framework we have in our financial system,'' he quoted one Indian corporate executive as saying.
 In contrast, the countries that opened the most to the international capital markets, and that sought to bring in business with relatively lax regulations, now are suffering the most. Iceland was the wonder economy of the world; now it is broke.
 The metaphor that comes to mind is that of a large ship. A single-hull ship will cost less to build and operate than a similar ship with a double hull. It will therefore earn more money on every trip, but it is more likely to be sunk if it encounters a severe storm or large iceberg.
 The financial system was allowed to spin out of control at just the time it could do the most damage to the world.
 Before this episode, the evidence seemed to show that developing countries could benefit from being financially open, assuming other factors were present. ''Full-fledged opening of the capital accounts in the absence of essential supporting conditions can vitiate the realization of any benefits, while making a country more vulnerable to sudden stops of capital flows,'' Mr. Rogoff, a former chief of research at the International Monetary Fund, wrote a couple of years ago. That paper was written jointly with three economists then with the I.M.F., M. Ayhan Kose, Eswar Prasad and Shang-Jin Wei.
 Those essential conditions, the paper added, ''include stable macroeconomic policies as well as sufficiently strong financial and other institutions, regulation and governance.''
 When Mr. Rogoff and his colleagues wrote those words, they had in mind the regulation in the country doing the opening, not in the United States and Britain, where most of the world's major banks were based.
 But it is just those countries that have proved the truth of the warning. ''We were just incredibly irresponsible,'' Mr. Rogoff said of the American regulators. ''We had all the blinking red lights. Our leaders were blind to what was happening.''
 Mr. Rogoff is far too much of an economist to think that the solution is to close economies. ''The lesson cannot be that you should go to financial autarchy,'' he said.
 But the world might be in better shape now if more countries had chosen that route, and thus been more insulated from the credit storm that has left companies and countries around the world fearful that they will be unable to obtain needed financing.
 There is sure to be a new American regulatory architecture coming out of all this, and there will be more efforts at international collaboration. 
 Among regulators, a buzzword now is ''countercyclical,'' and efforts will be made to incorporate that into any new system. In essence, that says that regulators should force banks to take fewer risks when things are very good -- perhaps by raising required capital levels -- and to relax the standards when things are very bad and the world is desperate for credit. The current system tended to react to everything being good by concluding less capital was needed.
 We'll see in some new cycle if that idea would really work. Would the regulators be willing to act when things are very good, as they failed to do in the last cycle? Some have doubts, among them Walter B. Kielholz, the chairman of Credit Suisse, who says he thinks governments are unlikely to support regulators if banks and customers complain.
 This crisis has shown the Achilles' heel of a globalized financial system to be a lack of high-quality, and consistent, regulation to prevent overconfident bankers from taking irresponsible risks. A year and a half ago, when it appeared to be a subprime mortgage issue for the United States, most countries thought they could glide past it. But it turned out that everyone in that globalized system was vulnerable to the collapse that began at the center.
 ''I believe we need a global financial regulator with real teeth,'' Mr. Rogoff said this week, ''to prevent the lowest common denominator problem.'' Before this crisis, capital flowed to the place where it was least regulated, and some countries competed to be that place. It is worth remembering that the Bush administration was trying to use the threat of overseas competition to relax regulation before the financial system blew up.
 If that doesn't happen, then the most rational thing for many countries may be to insulate themselves from the globalized economy. ''Countries will feel required to put on more capital controls so they are not exposed to countries that are taking risks,'' Mr. Rogoff said. 
 As with the buyers of double-hulled ships, countries that follow that course are likely to be less successful most of the time. Opportunities for international banks will be reduced.
 Taking steps to stop that from happening -- by getting an effective regulatory system -- would help the global economy and, in the long run, the institutions being regulated. Accomplishing that will be a lot harder, and less popular politically, than putting limits on executive bonuses. But it could do a lot more good.

HEADLINE: Regulator Says Bailout Fund Is Misleading the Public

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Watchdogs monitoring the government's bank bailout called for an overhaul Thursday, with one accusing those running it of misleading the public, while senators slammed the program as chaotic and poorly managed.
 Under the $700 billion program meant to stabilize the financial system, the Treasury Department has so far spent nearly $300 billion to bolster financial institutions and automakers in exchange for preferred shares and warrants.
 But in buying those securities, Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary, misled the public about how it was going to price them, said Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor and head of an oversight panel for the bailout, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. 
 ''Treasury simply did not do what it said it was doing,'' Ms. Warren said at a hearing before the Senate banking committee. Many members of the panel condemned management of the program, which is barely four months old.
 The program proceeded ''in a chaotic, unorganized and ad hoc manner,'' said Daniel K. Akaka, Democrat of Hawaii.
 Neil M. Barofsky, another watchdog for the program, told the Senate committee his office was turning to criminal investigations. ''That's going to be a large focus of my office,'' he said.
 On projections by some analysts that TARP may need more money soon, Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, said, ''There will be no additional funding for this program without airtight assurances that it will be better managed.''
 The Obama administration plans to unveil a strategy on Monday aimed at reviving the credit markets, helping struggling homeowners and lifting the economy out of recession.
 Tighter TARP management is expected to be a part of that package. A preview of that came Wednesday when the White House announced a $500,000 annual cap on executive pay at companies receiving TARP money.
 The Bush administration began TARP in response to an alarming slowdown in global capital markets set off by a housing slump that undermined mortgage-backed bonds carried on the books of major financial institutions.
 Congress approved the $700 billion program after Mr. Paulson said it would be used to buy broken bonds and clean off banks' balance sheets. But days after that approval, Mr. Paulson changed the focus to buying preferred shares in banks.
 Ms. Warren, head of TARP's Congressional oversight panel, told the banking committee that after three months on the job, her panel was still not getting enough answers from Treasury. She described the bailout as ''an opaque process at best.''
 Ms. Warren said she plans to release a report on Friday that calculates Treasury put about $254 billion into financial institutions in 2008, but got only $176 billion in value.
 ''That's a shortfall of about $78 billion,'' she said, adding that Mr. Paulson ''was not entirely candid'' in his description of TARP's bank capital injection program.
 Mr. Barofsky, the independent TARP inspector general at Treasury, raised concerns about potential fraud in one of several programs financed by bailout money, the Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility. ''Treasury should consider requiring that some baseline fraud prevention standards be imposed,'' Mr. Barofsky said in his first report to Congress.
 He told the committee the government had collected more than $271 million in dividends from its TARP-financed bank shares and said the department needed a strategy for administering its holdings.
 A Treasury spokesman said the department would adopt many of Mr. Barofsky's recommendations.
 Treasury holds $279.2 billion in preferred shares from 319 financial institutions, paying dividends of 5 to 10 percent, according to Mr. Barofsky's report.
 The government also received common stock warrants from 230 institutions, most of which are now out of the money. The largest positions in warrants include the American International Group, Bank of America, Citigroup and General Motors.

HEADLINE: Republicans Seize on Nominees' Tax Problems

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Long after President Obama finds a new secretary of health and human services, presumably one who has paid his or her taxes, the damage from this week's failed nomination may still plague him and his party.
 For years, the Democrats have struggled to shed the image of a high-tax party, and Mr. Obama made significant progress last year, according to opinion polls. But the succession of Obama nominees who failed to pay all of their taxes handed the Republicans a simple, powerful and possibly enduring argument in future tax debates.
 ''It is easy for the other side to advocate for higher taxes,'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House Republican whip, told a party retreat last weekend, ''because you know what? They don't pay them.''
 That's become a common refrain in conservative circles in recent days: 
 Senator Jim DeMint, a South Carolina Republican, on ABC's ''This Week'' on Sunday: ''I can see now why liberals don't mind if the tax rate goes up, because they're not going to pay it anyway.''
 Roger Hedgecock, a California radio talk show host, on ''Lou Dobbs Tonight'' on CNN: ''It came down to a situation where the American public realized the Democrats who always want to raise taxes on people didn't want to particularly pay the taxes on people.''
 Sean Hannity on his Fox News Channel talk show: ''I guess the reason Democrats want to raise taxes, use class warfare, attack corporations is because they take everyone else's money and redistribute it. But they themselves don't pay taxes, so there's no reason for them to worry about tax increases, right?''
 The chorus underscores the reversal of fortunes for Mr. Obama and the Democrats on the tax issue. Mr. Obama spent much of last year's campaign promoting his plan to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans, promising to raise them only on those Americans who make more than $250,000 a year. Surveys during his general-election contest with Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, suggested that Mr. Obama had erased some of the traditional Republican edge on taxes.
 A CNN survey a few weeks before the election showed that more Americans trusted Mr. Obama on tax policy than trusted Mr. McCain, by a margin of 50 percent to 44 percent. Exit polls on Election Day found that 71 percent of voters thought their taxes would go up under Mr. Obama -- but that was not much more than the 61 percent who thought they would go up under Mr. McCain.
 After his victory, Mr. Obama moved quickly to reinforce his intention to be a tax-cutter, not a tax-raiser. The economic recovery plan he put forward originally devoted 40 percent of the money to tax breaks, although that proportion has since fallen to one-third or less in the version later passed by the House. Republicans are pushing for deeper tax cuts in the package, but no one is pushing for tax increases at the moment. 
 Even so, the series of nominees with tax problems could redefine the political dynamics. First there was Timothy F. Geithner, who as treasury secretary now oversees the collection of taxes, but failed to pay $34,000 he owed until the offer of a cabinet job materialized. Then there was Tom Daschle, nominated for secretary of health and human services, even though he neglected to pay $128,000 in taxes until he was selected. And then there was Nancy Killefer, chosen to be the White House chief performance officer, who once had a $900 lien placed on her house for failing to pay unemployment taxes on household help.
 Mr. Geithner managed to win confirmation anyway; Ms. Killefer and then Mr. Daschle withdrew their nominations this week. Either way, the three cases, on top of the tax troubles of Representative Charlie B. Rangel of New York, the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, provide ammunition for the opposition.
 ''The challenge for Democrats is that Obama did a good job during the general of convincing voters that his party wasn't just about raising taxes and spending more money,'' said Sara M. Taylor, who was White House political director under President George W. Bush. ''Between the stimulus and now the Daschle-Geithner tax problem, all that ground is gone.''
 Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster, said Mr. Geithner's confirmation ensures that the issue will be lasting, because his past will come up whenever the issue of tax increases comes up. ''It doesn't help for the late-night comedians to have a ready target on Dems and taxes,'' he said. ''If they are laughing at you instead of with you, that has a corrosive effect.''
 Some Democrats argued that this, too, shall pass, and that the imbroglio will not affect the more fundamental shift in the politics of taxes. ''That line would work better if Obama weren't about to enact one of the largest middle-class tax cuts in history,'' said Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council and a former domestic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton. ''Republicans found out in the 2008 campaign that it's hard to tar Democrats as a high-tax party when Democrats aren't for raising taxes.''
 But in a way they will be for raising taxes next year, at least on the wealthiest Americans, when Mr. Bush's tax cuts are due to expire. Mr. Obama and leading Democrats want to make those tax cuts permanent for most Americans, but repeal them or let them lapse for the rich. Republicans are already arguing that Democrats will not stop there, and it is not hard to imagine television ads featuring the faces of Mr. Geithner and Mr. Daschle.
 Given the fiscal strain the government will face by then -- Mr. Bush left a deficit topping $1 trillion, the largest in proportion to the economy since World War II, and Mr. Obama and Congress are on the verge of adding hundreds of billions of dollars more to it -- the pressure to consider broader tax increases may change the debate. And Mr. Obama's policy goals of expanding health care and curbing climate change could lead to more pressure for tax increases to pay the costs.
 Joe Andrew, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said that the nominees' tax problems, along with questions about Mr. Obama's vetting process and his decision to nominate a Republican senator for secretary of commerce, have all combined to undermine the Democrats' reputation.
 ''The reason that these are all related is that it is the pro-growth Democrats who have spent decades trying to change the image of the Democratic Party as high-tax and unfriendly to business,'' said Mr. Andrew. ''So to look like we don't pay our taxes and don't have a Democratic C.E.O. to be America's business and commerce representative is a double whammy to the image.''
 The consolation, as he sees it, was Mr. Obama's decision to take the blame and admit a mistake in the handling of the Daschle nomination. ''What is positive about it,'' Mr. Andrew said, ''is we have a president who gets it, took responsibility for half the problem and moved on.''
 Now the question is whether the country will move on as well.

HEADLINE: Getting Tough in Washington

 BODY:
We're happy to see President Obama getting tough with Congressional Republicans who are trying to sabotage the stimulus and recovery bill and bring even greater ruin on the economy. Since Mr. Obama campaigned on the promise of bipartisanship, we hope he will also bring his hammer down on shortsighted Democrats who are threatening their own brand of havoc.
 Mr. Obama had it exactly right on Thursday when he warned against reducing ''the scale and the scope'' of the economic measure. If anything, the government should be more ambitious in its spending on economic stimulus, recovery and growth. 
 Unhappily, there are many Republicans who have not learned the lesson of this last campaign -- that Americans rejected their arguments that government is the enemy and tax cuts answer all economic questions. 
 It would be highly irresponsible for Congress to accept the Republicans' wrongheaded calls to cut back on the stimulus portions of the economic package, and shortchange longer-term spending on health care, schools and infrastructure. We applauded Mr. Obama when he said, ''The time for action is now because we know that if we do not act, a bad situation will become dramatically worse. Crisis could turn into catastrophe.''
 Mr. Obama needs to remind Republicans that he won the election on those terms. And he is going to have to get tough with Democrats. So will House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who have been too timorous about wielding their power. 
 In the Senate, Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, spent the day working with Republicans to dangerously strip down the Senate's version of the economic measure. What noxious programs were they so eager to dump? Money for the Amtrak passenger rail system, the shortchanging of which has been a damaging annual ritual that has put America decades behind most of the world.
 Short-term stimulus -- more unemployment insurance, shovel-ready projects that put Americans to work -- are a top priority. But Republican claims that spending money on projects that would take a year or two to develop is not stimulus are nonsense. By all projections, this will be a long recession and a protracted recovery. Money should be in the pipeline now for 2010 and 2011.
 The idea that spending on infrastructure is too high in the bills before Congress is equal nonsense. The American Society of Civil Engineers has called for $2.2 trillion in repairs and upgrades for dismal roads and bridges and other structures. That's even before considering bullet trains or a national health care system. 
 In the House, Ms. Pelosi will have to help Mr. Obama overcome protectionist Democrats who have already voted a provision that would require stimulus-financed projects to use only American-made iron and steel. Senate Democrats inserted an even worse provision -- requiring that all manufactured goods bought with stimulus money be made in this country. That has been somewhat diluted, but not nearly enough.
 The ''Buy America'' plan could touch off a trade war, which would be disastrous for the American economy and American workers. It's astonishing that any national leader could have forgotten what happened when Congress tried this before. Remember Smoot-Hawley?
 We know Mr. Obama is capable of uniting disparate groups. That comes with a tendency toward conciliation, which we admire, but we hope he resists it now. Mr. Obama made concessions on the House version of the economic plan, and no Republican voted for it. 
 The president must explain to Americans that a strong economic stimulus is essential for their economic recovery. If Senate Republicans still want to filibuster, Mr. Reid should call them on it. No filibuster on this urgent a bill could withstand the certain public outrage.

HEADLINE: U.S. Searches for Alternative to Kyrgyz Base

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER and ELLEN BARRY. 
Elisabeth Bumiller reported from Washington, and Ellen Barry from Moscow. Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration scrambled Wednesday to come up with an alternative to a crucial United States air base in Central Asia, used to supply the growing military operation in Afghanistan, after the president of Kyrgyzstan ordered the American base in his country closed. 
 Defense and State Department officials said they had concluded that Russia had pressed Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic, to expel the Americans. Russia has promised not to impede the American-led fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, but has also sought to push United States forces out of bases it began leasing in Central Asia in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
 The Kyrgyz Parliament planned to vote next week on a measure that would close the base at Manas, a major air hub for troops and cargo. Loss of the base would present a significant problem for the Obama administration as it deploys as many as 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan over the next two years. Taliban attacks have made another prime supply route to Afghanistan -- an overland pass through Pakistan -- highly unreliable.
 A senior State Department official said that negotiations with Kyrgyzstan over the base had been halted and that the alternatives under consideration included bases in Europe and the Persian Gulf, as well as a possible expansion of existing bases in Afghanistan. 
 The United States has leased the Central Asian base since after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, but American officials said they believed that Russia was using an offer of more than $2 billion in loans and grants to Kyrgyzstan to force the United States out of the region, colloquially referred to as ''the Stans.''
 ''The motivation is to have a strong bilateral relationship with the Stans that prevents the Stans from hosting U.S. or NATO facilities on their soils,'' a Defense Department official said.
 About 15,000 personnel and 500 tons of cargo pass through Manas each month. The base is also the home of large tanker aircraft that are used for in-air refueling of fighter planes on combat missions over Afghanistan.
 The American officials, who insisted on anonymity because of the delicacy of the negotiations, said that it was possible that the United States would resume talks with Kyrgyzstan but that for the next weeks the United States would be investigating whether some of the functions of the base could be relocated, perhaps to more than one place.
 The State Department official said it was still possible that the United States might offer Kyrgyzstan more compensation for the base after the other alternatives and their costs had been explored. ''Once we evaluate what this is really worth to us, we'll talk to them about money,'' he said. The United States calculates that it pays Kyrgyzstan more than $150 million in assistance and compensation each year. But the State Department official said that only a portion of that money went directly to the Kyrgyz government. ''Frankly, we haven't been excessively generous,'' the official said.
 The State Department official said that ''fundamentally it comes to money, and the Russians are trying to buy us out.''
 A statement by the Kyrgyz government on Wednesday argued that the American mission in Afghanistan had outlasted its original goals, the terrorist threat there had ''been removed,'' and that NATO airstrikes in Afghanistan had caused unacceptable civilian casualties. 
 The Kyrgyz president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, announced the decision on Tuesday in Moscow, where his impoverished country won $150 million in aid and the forgiveness of $180 million in debt in addition to the $2 billion in loans. Russian officials claimed that the announcement of the base closure was purely coincidental, but Russia has long resented the United States presence in Central Asia. 
 If the measure passes the Kyrgyz Parliament, as expected, Washington would have 180 days to close the base. The senior Defense official said the closure ''has all the earmarks of being a done deal.''
 Russian officials took pains on Wednesday to reassure President Obama that they hoped to cooperate with him in Afghanistan and elsewhere. But the conciliatory words sounded peculiar beside the blunt fact of the base closure, which seemed to communicate that American plans in the region should be coordinated with Moscow. 
 ''The calculation behind the Russian move is that the Americans have not so many alternatives,'' said Fyodor A. Lukyanov, the editor of Russia in Global Politics. ''If you need something there, you should go not to Bishkek but to Moscow.''
 Russian leaders also hope to secure concessions from Mr. Obama on a variety of issues, among them planned missile defense facilities in the Czech Republic and Poland, revamped security structures in Europe, and a renegotiation of the Start I arms treaty. 
 President Dmitri A. Medvedev said Wednesday that Russia and its allies were ready for full-fledged, comprehensive cooperation with the United States and other coalition members in fighting terrorism in the region. But he also laid out his own view of the best approach in Afghanistan, with veiled criticism of the United States. 
 ''Democracy cannot be forced -- it must grow from within,'' he said. ''It's not the number of bases that matters. It would be good if that would reduce the number of terrorists, but the fight against terrorism is not limited to building up military forces.''
 But by stressing that they are ready to search for alternatives in Europe, the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan itself, the Americans also appeared eager to signal that they would not allow Russia to dictate the terms of its engagement in Afghanistan or the region.
 This is not the first time that United States officials have tangled with Kyrgyzstan over the base at Manas. During negotiations this summer, the State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the United States would pay more than $150 million in assistance and compensation for the base this year. At the time, a government statement said the United States had contributed more than $850 million to support democracy, economic development, aid projects and security in the Kyrgyz Republic since its independence from the Soviet Union. 
 At a news conference in Moscow on Tuesday, Mr. Bakiyev complained about a 2006 incident in which a United States serviceman had shot a Kyrgyz truck driver on the base, and said Washington had also ignored his requests for more money.
 ''Eight years have passed,'' he said. ''We have repeatedly raised with the United States the matter of economic compensation for the existence of the base in Kyrgyzstan, but we have not been understood.'' 
 Kyrgyzstan's close relations with the United States have long unsettled Russia and China, which both have military interests in the region. 
 In 2005, the country appeared to move further into Washington's orbit after a popular uprising, supported in part by the United States, toppled the corrupt and increasingly authoritarian government of Askar A. Akayev, sending the president fleeing across the border. The bloodless coup was part of a wave of popular revolts, known as color revolutions, that remain a source of anger and suspicion among Russian officials, who consider them Washington-hatched schemes meant to undermine Russia's influence in the region.

(Manohla Dargis) 'CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA' (PG-13, 2:20, in Hindi, Cantonese and Mandarin) The immensely popular Akshay Kumar stars in this genial mash-up of Bollywood and kung fu. Too frantic at the beginning, ''Chandni'' settles down to become an enjoyable if slight Saturday matinee picture. It was financed and distributed by Warner Brothers, a first for Bollywood. 
 (Rachel Saltz) 
 'THE CLASS' (No rating, 2:08, in French, with English subtitles) An artful, intelligent, heartfelt fiction film from the director Laurent Cantet about modern French identity and the attempt to transform young students of all sizes, shapes and colors into citizens through talk, talk, talk. (Dargis) 
 'THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON' (PG-13, 2:47) A hothouse blossom of romance, intrigue and breathtaking digital effects from David Fincher (''Zodiac,'' ''Fight Club''). Brad Pitt stars as a man who ages backward, but it is Cate Blanchett who provides the film's delicate, graceful emotional center of gravity. (A. O. Scott) 
 'DOUBT' (PG-13, 1:44) Adapted by John Patrick Shanley from his stage play, this drama about a Roman Catholic priest suspected of child molestation stars a tamped-down Philip Seymour Hoffman as the accused and an energetic, often wackily comic Meryl Streep as his accuser. (Dargis) 
 'FROST/NIXON' (R, 2:02) It's twinkle (Michael Sheen) versus glower (Frank Langella) in Ron Howard's amusing, facile edition of the Peter Morgan theatrical smackdown.

 (Stephen Holden)
 'GRAN TORINO' (R, 1:56) Once again Clint Eastwood shows everyone how it's done, with a sleek muscle car of a movie set in that industrial graveyard called Detroit about a racist who befriends a besieged Hmong family next door. (Dargis)'HOTEL FOR DOGS' (PG, 1:40) Children and dogs: those two magic words distill the appeal of this cuter-than-cute, sweeter-than-sweet family film about animal-loving kids who embark on a crusade to rescue all the stray pooches in a fictional city. 
 (Holden)
 'INKHEART' (PG, 1:43) A movie about books coming to life that never manages to do so itself. (Scott) 
 'LAST CHANCE HARVEY' (PG, 1:38) Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson don't make a lot of sense as a screen couple, but there's something irresistible about watching two people fall in love, even in contrived, sniffle- and sometimes gag-inducing films like this one. (Dargis)
 'LUCK BY CHANCE' (No rating, 2:26, in Hindi and English) This enjoyable Bollywood offering spends a lot of its time wittily satirizing Bollywood itself as it tells the story of two young actors finding and losing romance as they try to find movie fame. Farhan Akhtar is a find as the male lead; Zoya Akhtar, his sister, wrote and directed. (Neil Genzlinger) 'MEDICINE FOR MELANCHOLY' (No rating, 1:27) The day after a one-night stand, two young, black San Franciscans (Wyatt Cenac and Tracey Heggins) muse on matters of love, race and urban life in Barry Jenkins's modest, witty and self-assured first feature.

 'MEMORIAL DAY' (No rating, 1:33) Spring-break delirium is equated with the excesses at Abu Ghraib in this dubious exercise in mock-documentary conceptualism. 
 (Nathan Lee) 
 'MILK' (R, 2:08) Gus Van Sant's film about Harvey Milk (1930-78), the San Francisco City supervisor who was one of the first openly gay elected officials in the country, is less a standard biopic than a sharp, lyrical history lesson, touching not only on a crucial decade in the gay-rights movement but also on the rough and tumble of big-city politics and the tricky ways of love. Sean Penn outdoes himself as Milk, balancing his intense conviction with an unusual and welcome playfulness. (Scott)
 'MOSCOW, BELGIUM' (No rating, 1:42, in Flemish) You may have observed the characters' banal situations in countless other movies, not to mention in your own life, but it is unusual to find them explored with such matter-of-fact truthfulness. (Holden)
 'MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3D' (R, 1:41) Adding an extra dimension to the fondly remembered 1981 Canadian slasher about a rogue slayer in a small mining town, ''My Bloody Valentine 3D'' blends cutting-edge technology and old-school prosthetics to produce gore you can believe in. And if the gas-masked villain is less than terrifying, his pursuit of a naked young woman (Betsy Rue) is inspired. If there were an award for acting full-frontally while wearing sky-high stilettos, Ms. Rue would surely teeter away with it. 
 (Jeannette Catsoulis)
 'NEW IN TOWN' (PG, 1:36) In this flat romantic comedy Renee Zellweger plays a corporate shark from Miami dispatched to an underperforming branch in New Ulm, Minn., where the folksy locals (including Harry Connick Jr.) thaw her frozen heart.
 (Holden) 
 'NOT EASILY BROKEN' (PG-13, 1:39) Directed by Bill Duke and based on a novel by the megachurch minister T. D. Jakes, this story of a marriage under stress is hokey and sometimes clumsy, but anchored in an earnest engagement with the lives of its characters, who have the good fortune of being portrayed by a fine cast. (Scott)
 'NOTORIOUS' (R, 2:02) The legend of Biggie Smalls, the Brooklyn-born rapper who was murdered in 1997, is given the full epic-melodrama-biopic treatment in this uneven, rarely dull film, among whose producers are Smalls's mother, Violetta Wallace, and his friend and mentor Sean Combs. Those two important figures are played by Angela Bassett and Derek Luke, while Smalls is impersonated by Jamal Woolard, whose faithful mimicry compensates for some of his limitations as an actor. (Scott)
 'PAUL BLART: MALL COP' (PG, 1:30) Fat people are funny. Fat people who run into things are funnier. Fat people who run into things and have humiliating working-class jobs? Stop, you're killing me! (Lee)
 'RACHEL GETTING MARRIED' (R, 1:54) Anne Hathaway plays Kym, furloughed from rehab to attend her sister Rachel's wedding. The director, Jonathan Demme, working from a script by Jenny Lumet, takes a fairly conventional family-therapy drama and packs it with exuberant vitality. There is ample sorrow and recrimination at this party, but nonetheless you'll be sorry when it ends. (Scott)
 'THE READER' (R, 2:03) You have to wonder who, exactly, wants or perhaps needs to see another movie about the Holocaust that embalms its horrors with artfully spilled tears and also asks us to pity a death camp guard. Kate Winslet plays the guard; Stephen Daldry directs. (Dargis)
 'REVOLUTIONARY ROAD' (R, 1:59) Sam Mendes directs Kate Winslet and a fine Leonardo DiCaprio in a waxworks edition of the corrosive, furiously unsentimental novel by Richard Yates about an unhappy marriage in the mid-1950s. (Dargis)
 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' (R, 2:00) A modern fairy tale from Danny Boyle (''Trainspotting'') about a pauper angling to become a prince, this sensory blowout largely takes place amid the squalor of Mumbai, India, where lost children and dogs sift through trash so fetid that you swear you can smell the discarded mango as well as its peel. (Dargis)
 'UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS' (R, 1:32) Michael Sheen howls up a storm in this prehistory to the first two ''Underworld'' flicks, which rewinds to when the werewolves rebelled against their vampire masters. (Dargis) 
 'THE UNINVITED' (PG-13, 1:27) Regrets only. (Scott) 'WENDY AND LUCY' (R, 1:20) In Kelly Reichardt's latest film Michelle Williams plays Wendy, a lonely young woman who encounters a run of bad luck while drifting through Oregon and Washington with her dog, Lucy. At first glance the film seems like little more than an extended anecdote, but underneath this plain narrative surface is a lucid and melancholy inquiry into the current state of American society. (Scott) 
 'THE WRESTLER' (R, 1:45) Mickey Rourke, with sly, hulking grace, stars as a washed-up wrestler hoping for a comeback. But like its hero, the movie has a blunt, exuberant honesty, pulling off even its false moves with conviction and flair. (Scott) 
 Film Series
 BREADLINES AND CHAMPAGNE (Friday through Thursday) Film Forum kicks off a monthlong festival of films made during the Great Depression on Friday with Mae West's outrageous 1933 ''I'm No Angel,'' offered at the equally outrageous admission price of 35 cents -- the average price of a Manhattan movie ticket in 1933. On Saturday and Sunday a double bill demonstrates how deeply Hollywood was concerned with the social issues of the day: Frank Borzage's glorious romance ''Man's Castle,'' with Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young as unemployed residents of a Central Park shantytown, and Frank Capra's didactic comedy ''American Madness,'' in which a heroic banker (Walter Huston) resists a run on his establishment. The pleasures continue through March 5, with many of the Warner Brothers titles shown in newly struck prints from the original camera negatives in the Library of Congress. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $11. (Dave Kehr)
 FADED GLORY (Friday through Wednesday) With 35 titles offered, this has to be one of the largest retrospectives of the independent black cinema -- a k a ''race movies'' -- ever assembled in New York. The program begins on Friday at 7 p.m. with a screening of a new 35-millimeter print of Spencer Williams's magnificent work ''The Blood of Jesus,'' a 1941 film that energetically tramples the rules of Hollywood storytelling as it tries to translate the style and substance of a religious revival meeting into cinematic terms. The film scholar Jacqueline Stewart will introduce the program. At 9:30 p.m., there's ''God's Step Children'' (1938), the first of several films in the program by the indomitable Oscar Micheaux, one of the earliest and certainly the most persistent creator of films for African-American audiences. Micheaux's 1925 ''Body and Soul,'' which will be screened at 8 p.m. on Saturday, with musical accompaniment by the pianist Donald Sosin and the bass singer Kevin Maynor, is probably the director's most fully realized work. It is a parable about twin brothers -- one an alcoholic thief, the other a college-educated inventor -- both played by Paul Robeson. Other highlights include Richard Maurice's ''Eleven P.M.'' (Sunday), a rarely screened experimental feature from 1928; Richard Norman's ''Flying Ace'' (Wednesday), a 1926 action film produced by the Florida-based Norman Film Manufacturing Company; Murray Roth's ''Yamekraw'' (Tuesday and Wednesday), a one-reel vision of African-American history, based on James P. Johnson's composition and filmed in 1930 at Warner Brothers' Brooklyn studios; and Edgar G. Ulmer's 1939 ''Moon Over Harlem'' (Sunday and Tuesday), a gangster film shot in a New Jersey warehouse on a budget of $8,000. The series runs through Feb. 19. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $11. (Kehr)

HEADLINE: Recovery Bill Has $1 Billion To Hire More Local Police

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's economic stimulus plan includes about $1 billion to help local governments hire more police officers, which would resurrect a Clinton administration program that had been largely shelved by President George W. Bush. 
 The so-called COPS Program, for Community Oriented Policing Services, aimed to add 100,000 police officers to local departments in eight years. Whether it met that goal is the subject of heated debate in law enforcement and public policy circles.
 Mr. Bush, reflecting a Republican philosophical objection to having the federal government pay for local police salaries, all but eliminated the program.
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said money to hire police officers was an appropriate part of the stimulus bill because it would aid the economy ''as fast as, or faster than, other spending.''
 ''In police hiring, nearly 100 percent of the money goes to creating jobs,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''This is particularly important in the current economic crisis, since many police departments are already reporting increases in crime and cuts in their budgets and their forces.''
 A senior analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, David B. Muhlhausen, who has written about the COPS program, disagreed, saying there was ''no evidence that funding for these kinds of programs will stimulate the economy.''
 Mr. Muhlhausen said that nonetheless, he expected the program to be enacted either as part of the stimulus package or by itself because ''most politicians don't want to be on the record as against a law enforcement program, and everybody likes the idea of bringing home some federal grants.'' 
 Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, an independent nonprofit group focused on improving police tactics, said that ''from an economic stimulus standpoint, if you can use new police to stabilize a neighborhood, consolidate crime-reduction gains, then you can have a considerable impact on the local economy.''
 Michael E. Schirling, the police chief in Burlington, Vt., a city of 40,000, said in an interview that while he expected crime to rise because of the troubled economy, it had not done so yet. But Chief Schirling said that ''the wave of economic troubles surely has the potential to drive not only crime but the stresses that drive people to alcohol and drug abuse, and that increases the volume of calls to law enforcement agencies.'' 
 Unlike the Clinton administration program, which provided 75 percent of salaries for new police officers, the current proposal would pay their full salaries.
 Representative Anthony Weiner, Democrat of New York, who was involved in changing the pay formula, said ''localities like New York and Chicago were hamstrung in using the funds because they had difficulty in coming up with the 25 percent match.'' Such cities were also hurt, he said, because the old program limited them to spending $75,000 per officer over three years.
 Mr. Weiner estimated that New York City would be able to add 400 or more officers if the program was enacted as currently written.
 The stimulus package also includes about $2.6 billion for other law enforcement needs, like overtime for police departments, help with rural drug enforcement and assistance to crime victims.

HEADLINE: The Maker of Twinkies Is Fresh From Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
They survived everything from the Great Depression to the Atkins Diet. And now Twinkies have even endured bankruptcy. 
 After more than four years, their maker, Interstate Bakeries, emerged from bankruptcy protection this week. 
 The private company, which also makes Wonder Bread, Hostess Ding Dongs and Drake's cakes, had at least one powerful fan rooting for it: Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. Mr. Schumer personally appealed to a big lender to help Interstate through its troubles. 
 ''Upstate New Yorkers can now have their Drake's cake and keep their jobs, too,'' Mr. Schumer said in a statement this week.
 Created in 1930, with a banana cream filling, rather than the vanilla of today, Twinkies -- love 'em or hate 'em -- are about as emblematic as junk food gets. With 39 ingredients, 150 shamelessly empty calories and, officially, a shelf life of about three weeks, the Twinkie is a cream-filled symbol of American culture. Their mysterious longevity even earned them a joke in ''Wall-E,'' Pixar's postapocalyptic robot love story. 
 Hostess Brands was acquired in 1995 by Interstate and today employs 22,000 people in 41 bakeries. But Interstate succumbed in September 2004 to various ailments, including the low-carb Atkins and South Beach Diets. 
 Burt P. Flickinger III of the Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm, said Interstate faces stiff competition from rivals like Sara Lee. In light of the recession, even Hostess, the cream in Interstate's Twinkie, might have to lower prices, he said. 
 Craig D. Jung, Interstate's chief executive, said the company was working to adapt to tougher times and healthier snacking. It will expand its line of calorie-conscious snacks like Twinkie Bites, which have 100 calories a pack. 
 ''At end of the day, consumers want to indulge,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Diverse Group of Senators at Center Stage in Economic Debate

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
There's a new gang in town.
 Its members -- a bipartisan group of about 20 senators -- spent Thursday shuttling in and out of a nondescript committee room in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, occasionally ordering staff members into the hallway to allow for more candid discussion on how to broker a political bailout of the economic recovery legislation.
 The group included veteran senators like Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a Republican who is up for re-election next year; Mark Udall of Colorado, a Democrat elected last year; George V. Voinovich, a Republican from the economically hard-hit state of Ohio; both the Democratic and Republican senators from Alaska; and Joseph I. Lieberman, the independent from Connecticut who backed John McCain for president. 
 Their work was modeled on that of the so-called Gang of 14 that cut a deal on judges a few years ago and spared the Senate a showdown over filibusters. But notably absent from Thursday's negotiations was Senator McCain, a linchpin of the deal on judges who has dug in against the stimulus package and on Thursday lost an effort to rewrite it on the floor.
 Leafing through the legislation, members of the coalition, led by Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, searched for ways to trim about $100 billion and make the bill more palatable to Republicans and Democrats who are eager to take some action but are uneasy about the package's price tag of more than $900 billion.
 The group was frustrating the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who was trying to bring the debate over President Obama's economic program and top legislative priority to a close.
 ''I have explained to people within that group, they cannot hold the president of the United States hostage,'' said Mr. Reid, who added that he was willing to work with them if they intended to be constructive rather than obstructive.
 Leaders of the changing cast of mainly centrist senators involved in the negotiations said their work could mean the difference between defeat of the economic plan, a narrow partisan victory, or success with a solid, bipartisan majority. ''I would say to the majority leader that his success depends on the success of this group,'' said Ms. Collins, who was elected to a third term last November in a tough environment for Republicans.
 Ms. Collins and her allies won more time to close a deal as the Senate halted debate late Thursday and planned to resume work on Friday. 
 ''I think there is still hope of a compromise, and we are trying to work it out,'' she said as she headed off the Senate floor to a late-night meeting. ''I am perennially optimistic, and I do believe at this moment we are going to be able to achieve it.''
 The senators involved had different motivations for participation. But in general, Republican moderates wanted to vote for a recovery measure but were nervous that they could face a backlash over spending. Democratic centrists wanted to back Mr. Obama on his first major initiative but think that a measure passed by the House is stuffed with excess spending that will do little to create jobs.
 As they exited for breaks and encountered a crush of television cameras, the leaders acknowledged that they were finding it difficult to weigh the competing interests and ideas of the group. 
 ''This is a Herculean effort,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''Nobody said it would be easy, but it is very difficult to keep together and get agreement on things like this.''
 Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, one of the more conservative Republicans taking part, became increasingly skeptical on Thursday that he could end up backing any compromise. ''Sometimes things don't come together,'' Mr. Martinez said. 
 The aim of the group was to pare the bill to about $800 billion, a figure that Ms. Collins said Mr. Obama told her in a private meeting on Wednesday was the minimum he thought necessary to restart the economy. 
 Lawmakers were trying to jettison education, health and environmental programs they saw as producing few new jobs while perhaps adding spending in public works and other areas that were seen as job creators. They said they were trying to reach a critical mass that would swing wavering Republicans and nervous Democrats behind the bill.
 ''We are trying to hit the sweet spot,'' Mr. Lieberman said.
 Some Democrats argued that Republicans were championing provisions that added to the cost while complaining about the spending. 
 ''Every time we lop off a hundred billion or two hundred billion from the bill, we are lopping off jobs,'' Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said.
 But Ms. Collins said Mr. Obama had offered encouragement. Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, said the work of the group could ultimately be a plus for the president by coming up with a package that cost less and led to more jobs. 
 ''We might be the president's best allies, helping him achieve his objective but honoring the reform message he stands for,'' Mr. Bayh said.

HEADLINE: Boost in Aid For Housing To Help Fix Elevators

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
New York City's strapped public housing agency is expected to receive at least $57 million more in federal aid for capital improvement projects than it received last year, and it plans to use part of that money to overhaul its problematic elevator fleet.
 The agency, the New York City Housing Authority, is expected to receive at least $390 million out of the $5 billion in capital financing set aside for public housing in the economic stimulus package that was being negotiated in the Senate on Thursday. The final number had yet to be determined on Thursday night, said Senator Charles E. Schumer, who pushed for the money to be used for the elevator repairs. 
 Last year, the agency received $333 million in federal capital aid. Housing Authority officials said that in addition to the elevator repairs, they would use some of the money to fix the roofs and brick exteriors of their aging buildings. The money in the stimulus package is in addition to the $107 million that the agency said in October it would spend to replace about 550 elevators at 35 complexes in the next five years.
 Ricardo Elias Morales, the housing authority's interim chairman, said it was too early to determine how much of the $390 million would be used for elevator repairs, though he said it would be ''a fair portion.''
 ''We're working out the details,'' Mr. Morales said.
 Tenants have complained for years that their elevators routinely break down, disrupting their lives and trapping them inside stalled cars. In August, a 5-year-old boy riding in an elevator with his 8-year-old brother fell 10 stories to his death in an elevator shaft at the Taylor-Wythe complex in Brooklyn. The elevator had stalled, and the younger boy, Jacob Neuman, fell while trying to escape.
 That elevator was 21 years old and had failed 8 of 11 inspections since February 2004. The technical problems that led to the accident -- electrical malfunctions that caused the elevator to lose power and allowed the door to open -- were tied to faulty maintenance, according to elevator experts and an accident report by the city's Department of Buildings.
 ''The elevators are in terrible shape,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''The city's budget is in terrible shape. Unless there was help from Washington, there was no guarantee that the elevators would get fixed.''
 Mr. Schumer said he was working to increase the amount of stimulus money from $390 million. Though the total will be set after leaders in the House and the Senate reconcile their bills, $390 million is the minimum the agency would receive.
 Mr. Schumer's announcement addressed two of the agency's most pressing problems -- the safety and maintenance of its elevators and a financial crisis that stems in large part from its decreasing share of government aid.
 The authority, which maintains thousands of low-rent apartments subsidized by the federal government, has an operating budget deficit of $177 million for the 2009 fiscal year. Agency managers say the deficit is largely the result of shrinking aid from the federal, state and city governments.
 The agency has taken a number of controversial steps to bring its finances in order, including eliminating hundreds of jobs, shutting ''underutilized'' community centers and postponing or cutting dozens of capital projects.
 The authority's elevator fleet is one of the biggest in the city -- 3,335 elevators in 2,636 buildings. Even after Jacob's death in August, tenants at complexes across the city said that their elevators continued to pose problems. At the Wagner Houses in East Harlem, which have had the most elevator breakdowns of any public housing complex in the city, with 2,132 in the 2007 and 2008 fiscal years, broken elevators are routine.
 The Legal Aid Society of New York's Harlem Community Law Office has received dozens of complaints from tenants at the Wagner Houses, and the group is planning to file a lawsuit against the Housing Authority for lack of repairs there, including the elevator maintenance problems.
 Housing Authority managers have said elevator safety is a priority, and elevator failures dropped by 7 percent from 2007 to 2008. Mr. Morales said he would release a plan in the coming weeks to improve elevator maintenance and service. ''We're making a concerted effort,'' he said.

DISAPPEARING JOBS
It was impossible to argue with President Obama on Friday when he said that the dismal new jobs report -- the largest loss in 13 consecutive months of decline -- made it all the more urgent for Congress to pass the economic stimulus and recovery package.

HEADLINE: Taxpayers, Beware The Instant Cash

BYLINE: By MATHEW R. WARREN

 BODY:
With tax-filing season at hand and the economy in a tailspin, the temptation to seek tax-refund anticipation loans is growing. New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs has a message for taxpayers: Resist. 
The department's commissioner, Jonathan B. Mintz, announced on Thursday that during the first four weeks of an inspection sweep of 430 tax preparation businesses, it had issued more than 1,200 violations for illegal sales or advertising practices, many of them linked to so-called refund anticipation loans. Such loans, billed as ''rapid'' or ''instant'' refunds, typically charge exorbitant interest rates.
''The truth is this: It takes the I.R.S. about 8 to 10 days to get you back every single dollar of your refund,'' Mr. Mintz said. ''Anyone who promises you a refund sooner than that is probably lying to you about a loan. Just say no.''
About 5.8 million New York City residents use professional tax preparation services, and while many of the businesses are run ethically, others are not, Mr. Mintz said.
The 430 income tax preparers reviewed so far represent a 43 percent increase in inspections over last year, Mr. Mintz said.
One positive, he said, is that compliance rates were up this year, at 65 percent, compared with 56 percent last year. ''Unfortunately, there's also disturbing news: 150 of the 430 businesses that we have inspected thus far were caught engaged in illegal sales or advertising practices,'' he said.
While it is legal to make the loans, tax preparers may not describe them as ''instant'' or ''rapid'' refunds, which the city considers deceptive and misleading.
The city also requires that tax preparers clearly describe the terms and interest rates of such loans, and translate their fee and disclosure information ''into every language in which they do business.''
Tax preparers may not charge based on income, taxes owed or anticipated refund, Mr. Mintz said. He also warned consumers never to sign a blank or incomplete return or one filled out in pencil.
The city has expanded Tax Prep Plus, a pilot project that offers professionally prepared tax returns for $20, to more than a dozen community organizations across the city. The service is eligible to families making $55,000 or less and individuals making $30,000 or less.

HEADLINE: With Grim Job Loss Figures, No Sign That Worst Is Over

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Jack Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Though job losses accelerated last month, the United States has not yet hit bottom.
In a bleak report on Friday, the Labor Department said that almost 600,000 jobs disappeared in January and that a total of 3.6 million jobs had been lost since the beginning of the recession in December 2007. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 7.6 percent, from 7.2 percent a month earlier.
Losing more than a half million jobs in each of the last three months, the country is trapped in a vortex of plunging consumer demand, rising joblessness and a deepening crisis in the banking system.
The contraction in jobs is already steeper than in any recession since at least the early 1980s. But economists warn that several more shoes are about to drop. 
The first is the growing severity of the global recession, which has already started to choke off exports from the United States. Growth in China has slowed to a fraction of its usually brisk pace, leading to brutal downturns in South Korea, Japan and other Asian nations. Much of Europe has slipped into a recession, too.
A second shoe is worker income in the United States. The one seemingly bright spot in recent job reports, including the one on Friday, has been that hourly wages and weekly earnings kept inching upward. But economists say that trend is all but certain to reverse soon and cause further strain on consumers. Consumer spending, which represents a third of economic activity, has slowed drastically as many workers lose their jobs and others worry about their own job security.
The third big shoe is the banking system, which is expected ultimately to report $1 trillion to $3 trillion more in losses tied to the housing market.
The upshot, economists say, is that the United States will face rising unemployment for at least the remainder of this year, even if Congress passes a big economic stimulus bill this week.
In its report for last month, the Labor Department estimated 598,000 jobs were cut in January, and it revised upward the loss for the previous month to 577,000. In addition, the department revised its estimates for the previous 12 months to show that employers shed 400,000 more jobs than originally calculated, pushing the total closer to four million.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate rose to 7.6 percent in January, the highest since 1992. But that number understated the weakness in hiring because hundreds of thousands of people dropped out of the labor force over the last year. On top of that, 3.1 million additional people were working part time because they could not find full-time jobs.
''Businesses are panicked and fighting for survival and slashing their payrolls,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''I think we're trapped in a very adverse, self-reinforcing cycle. The downturn is intensifying, and likely to intensify further unless policy makers respond aggressively.''
Economists found almost no encouraging news in the report, saying each component of the economy, from consumers to employers to lenders, was pulling back out of fear or necessity, and thereby pulling the others down.
''This is a horror show we're watching,'' said Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, an economic research organization in Washington.
As in previous months, employers in almost every industry slashed their payrolls, with health care an exception. Manufacturers eliminated 207,000 jobs, more than in any year since 1982. The construction industry eliminated 111,000 jobs. And retailers, who were wrapping up their worst holiday shopping season in years, eliminated 45,000 jobs.
''The sweep of the losses, the extent of them and the speed are depressionlike, and by that I mean like the 1930s,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Decision Economics, an economic forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass.
Even if the recession proved similar to recent downturns and the economy started to turn up again soon, unemployment would likely keep climbing for many months. That is because employers are usually reluctant to lay off workers at the start of a downturn and likewise reluctant to hire them back at the start of a recovery.
Many economists predict that the United States will lose at least two million more jobs, even though they continue to hold out hope for a shaky expansion to take hold in the second half of this year. Ian C. Shepherdson, an economist at High-Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., predicted that the labor market would continue to shrink until the middle of 2010.
There are few hopes of a turnaround soon. Consumer spending has usually managed to rise during recessions, but has declined sharply for the last six months and shows no sign of a rebound. Indeed, the Federal Reserve reported on Friday that consumers' use of credit declined 3.1 percent, or $6.6 billion, in December. That followed a plunge of $11 billion in November.
Consumers, it seems, are growing more cautious about borrowing. But banks are also less willing to lend, according to the Federal Reserve's latest survey of lending officers.
Adding to the grim outlook is the global economy, with both Asia and Europe in their own downturns.
''Just looking around the world, demand is collapsing,'' said Nigel Gault, managing director at IHS Global Insight in Waltham, Mass. Chinese growth has fallen from double-digit rates to about 6 percent. South Korea's gross domestic product fell 5.5 percent between the third and fourth quarters of 2008 -- an annualized decline of 21 percent. ''This recession is of a different order of magnitude,'' Mr. Gault said. ''We haven't had a crisis that is this global in nature.''
One modest exception to the Labor Department's generally dismal jobs report was in workers' wages. Hourly earnings edged up 0.3 percent in January, and were up by 3.9 percent over the past year. Weekly earnings ticked up as well, and were 2.7 percent higher than one year ago.
But analysts said that trend was an anomaly.
The employment report put added pressure on Congress to reach agreement on a economic recovery package, and Senate Democrats struggled furiously on Friday to hammer out a combination of tax cuts and spending that would total about $800 billion and win enough Republican support to pass.
Many economists said an economic stimulus bill was crucial, regardless of the details, because government spending has become almost the only way to break the vicious cycle between sinking demand and sinking investment.
But many also cautioned that the added spending and tax cuts might not be enough, and might not work in the way past theory suggests. ''We remain firmly of the view that the package now in Congress is the bare minimum required,'' wrote Mr. Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients. But, he predicted, ''it will ultimately prove too small.''
Mr. Sinai, at Decision Economics, warned that this downturn was so different from most others that it was difficult to be confident about how the economy would respond to the government money.
''My model says it will generate three to four million jobs, but I'm not sure I believe my own models,'' Mr. Sinai said. ''We're in uncharted waters here.''

HEADLINE: As Jobs Vanish, Senators Reach Deal on Stimulus: New U.S. Plan To Help Banks Sell Bad Assets

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After weeks of internal debate, the Obama administration has settled on a plan to inject billions of dollars in fresh capital into banks and entice investors to purchase their most troubled assets.
The new financial industry rescue plan, to be outlined in broad terms on Monday in a speech by the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, will not require banks to increase their lending. That is despite criticism that institutions that already received money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, either hoarded it or used the funds to acquire other banks.
The incentives to investors could be in the form of commitments to absorb some of the losses from any assets they purchase, should their values continue to decline. The goal is to relieve the banks of their worst assets so that private investors might then provide more capital. 
Officials hope that that part of the plan is not labeled a ''bad bank'' administered by the government, although they expect that some might call it that.
No matter what it is called, the government would assume some of the risk of declining assets at the heart of the economic crisis. But by relying on a combination of private investors and government guarantees, the administration hopes to reduce its exposure to losses and avoid the problem of having to place a value on assets that the institutions have been unable to sell.
A central element of the plan would be a major expansion of a lending facility begun in November by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York when it was headed by Mr. Geithner. The program, which was initially financed by $200 billion in Fed money and $20 billion in seed capital from the $700 billion bailout fund, lent money to investors to buy securities backed by student, auto and credit card loans, as well as loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.
Obama administration officials say they have rejected nationalizing institutions by taking large ownership stakes. They also will not immediately seek additional money from Congress beyond the $350 billion left in the TARP fund.
With reports of lavish executive pay, extravagant corporate retreats and expensive office renovations at some of the institutions receiving assistance, political support for the program has sharply eroded in recent weeks. And as the White House has put forward a stimulus package of about $800 billion, there is recognition that Congress will very likely balk now at another request for bailout money.
But lawmakers said they expected the administration to seek more money for the rescue program later this year.
The banking plan will involve a close review of financial institutions, possibly including a so-called stress test to measure whether they have enough resources to weather a continued economic decline. It will also enable the government, when it provides a new round of investment, to convert the warrants for preferred stock it has already received from many institutions into common stock. The move, which essentially would swap debt for equity, would help relieve the balance sheets of those institutions, although it would also hurt other existing shareholders by diluting their common stock.
Lawmakers said they were told that Mr. Geithner would not spell out the details of much of the program next week, including how the government would use more than $50 billion from that program to help homeowners facing foreclosure.
For weeks, administration officials have been exploring several alternatives for reducing the wave of foreclosures. One proposal involves Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance companies now under government control, to help further stabilize the housing markets by providing guarantees on low-rate mortgages.
Another proposal, said to be favored by Lawrence H. Summers, the senior White House economic official, would provide incentives to entice investors in pools of mortgages -- and the companies that service mortgages -- to refinance troubled home loans.
An announcement on that part of the plan is expected to be made by President Obama, lawmakers said, possibly as early as next week.
Although critics have blamed the administration of George W. Bush for mismanaging the TARP fund by not pressing the banks receiving assistance to increase their lending, the new round of capital injections is not expected to come with government demands that the institutions provide more loans. But the new administration was expected to take other steps to encourage institutions to increase their lending, as well as to explain how much their lending had increased or decreased each quarter.
Democratic lawmakers who have been given previews on aspects of the plan praised it.
''The plan is very smart,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who declined to provide details of his discussions about the plan with senior administration officials. ''It avoids one-size-fits-all. It will have an overarching effect on many institutions. But it doesn't put all institutions in the same box.''
While some of the elements of the plan are similar to those used by the Bush administration, officials said on Friday that they hoped to overcome the mounting criticism of the earlier effort by lawmakers and economists by making the program more transparent and equitable.
This week's new restrictions on executive pay and last week's announcement of new lobbying rules that banks and other groups seeking assistance must follow have been part of the effort by the Obama administration to restore credibility to the program and regain support in Congress. That effort will be essential if the administration returns to Congress for more money.

HEADLINE: As Jobs Vanish, Senators Reach Deal on Stimulus: PARED-DOWN BILL

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; David Stout contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats reached an agreement with Republican moderates on Friday to pare a huge economic recovery measure, clearing the way for approval of a package that President Obama said was urgently needed in light of mounting job losses.
The deal, announced on the Senate floor, was a result of two days of tense negotiations and political theater. Mr. Obama dispatched his chief of staff to Capitol Hill to help conclude the talks and reassure senators in his own party, and he called three key Republicans to applaud them for their patriotism.
Earlier, when it looked as if a vote might take place Friday night, officials said, a government plane was dispatched to Florida to bring back Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who has brain cancer.
The fine print was not immediately available, and the numbers were shifting. But in essence, the Democratic leadership and two centrist Republicans announced they had struck a deal on about $110 billion in cuts to the roughly $900 billion legislation -- a deal expected to provide at least the 60 votes needed to send the bill out of the Senate and into negotiations with the House, which has passed its own version. 
The pact, which is expected to be approved in the next few days, was concluded just hours after the Labor Department announced that 598,000 jobs were lost in January. The contraction in jobs is already steeper than in any other recession since at least the early 1980s. And economists warn that several more shoes are about to drop, a message that added urgency to the Senate deliberations.
As the negotiations were under way, lawmakers said it was time to stop quibbling about the exact parameters of the legislation -- which mixes safety-net spending, tax cuts and a huge infusion of dollars into federal programs -- and to begin work toward a final agreement that could be sent to Mr. Obama next week.
''Our country can't wait another day for another approach,'' said Senator Ben Nelson, a Nebraska Democrat who is a leader of the bipartisan coalition that worked out the agreement.
The details were negotiated at an afternoon meeting in the office of the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, involving Mr. Reid, other top Democrats and two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. After they came to terms, the senators brought in the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, for assurance that the deal was acceptable to the administration. Mr. Emanuel signaled it was.
''With today's unemployment numbers reaching more than 3.6 million workers,'' Mr. Emanuel said after the session, ''delay and failure were not an option.''
Mr. Obama called Ms. Collins and Mr. Specter, as well as Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, another Republican expected to support the deal, to acknowledge they were acting against pressure from their party and, one official said, to thank them for their patriotism in helping advance the bill at a critical time.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Obama urged Congress to act expeditiously. ''It is inexcusable and irresponsible for any of us to get bogged down in distraction, delay or politics as usual while millions of Americans are being put out of work,'' said Mr. Obama, who has recently shown less patience for Republican resistance to the bill.
Most Senate Republicans remained opposed to the measure, criticizing it as a case study in excessive spending that would do little to lift the economy. Some conservatives indicated Friday night that they would push for time to study the new legislation before any final vote.
''We want to stimulate the economy, not mortgage the future of our children and grandchildren by the kind of fiscally profligate spending embodied in this legislation,'' said Senator John McCain of Arizona, the defeated Republican presidential nominee, who has emerged as a chief opponent of the proposal.
Republicans were clearly irritated at the outcome and faulted those involved in working out the bargain. ''When you say this was the best we could do, I disagree with you,'' Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on the floor. ''This not remotely close to what we could have done if we had sat down in a true bipartisan fashion and found a better way.''
The Senate's proposed cuts took aim at an array of popular spending programs that critics said should not be part of a fiscal recovery bill, even if they represent laudable policy goals, because they would not deliver a quick enough jolt to the economy.
Even Mr. Obama's signature tax cut for middle-class Americans was scaled back as part of the deal. Under the new plan, tax credits of up to $500 for individuals and $1,000 for couples would begin to phase out at lower income levels than first proposed, saving the government $2 billion.
The biggest cut, roughly $40 billion in aid to states, was likely to spur a fierce fight in negotiations with the House over the final bill. Many states, hit hard by the recession, face wrenching cuts in services and layoffs of public employees as they struggle to comply with laws requiring them to balance their budgets.
When debate began this week, the price tag on the Senate version of the stimulus bill was roughly $884 billion, but it grew to more than $900 billion as senators added provisions including tax breaks totaling $30 billion for purchases of homes and cars.
Lawmakers said that by poring over the 736-page bill they had excised about $110 billion, bringing the total cost to about $780 billion -- $40 billion less than the stimulus bill approved by the House last week. Because of consumer tax breaks and spending for health research that had been added in the Senate, the new total for the measure could be about $820 billion. But even the senators behind the compromise were uncertain of the number.
In addition to the large cut in state aid, the Senate agreement would cut nearly $20 billion proposed for school construction; $8 billion to refurbish federal buildings and make them more energy efficient; $1 billion for the early childhood program Head Start; and $2 billion from a plan to expand broadband data networks in rural and underserved areas.
The administration had initially hoped that it could win the support of as many as 80 senators, but that goal disappeared after House Republicans voted unanimously against the measure. As questions were raised about the total spending, getting even three or four Republican senators to sign on became difficult.
Ms. Collins said she believed the changes had significantly improved the measure. Mr. Specter said that while he still had reservations, he had come to accept Mr. Obama's push to enact the economic plan by mid-February. ''I believe we do have to act,'' Mr. Specter said, ''and under the circumstances this is the best we can do.''
But several other Republicans who had taken part in the talks said they could not support the compromise.
''Unfortunately, there was too much in the Democratic counterproposal that was not stimulative,'' said Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio, ''and that did not provide the jump-start our economy so desperately needs.''
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said most Republicans remained unconvinced that the package would reinvigorate the economy.
''You have to balance the likelihood of success versus the crushing debt that we're levying on the backs of our children, our grandchildren and, yes, their children,'' Mr. McConnell said.
Mr. Reid urged Republicans to get behind the plan. ''This is a critical day for this new Congress and our country,'' he said. ''Faced with this grave and growing economic crisis, Republicans must decide today whether they will join the president and Congressional Democrats on that road to recovery.''

HEADLINE: As Auto Sales Plummet, Toyota Sees a Wider Loss

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER and MICHELINE MAYNARD; Martin Fackler reported from Tokyo and Micheline Maynard from Detroit.

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The global downturn is threatening the Toyota Motor Company's most sacrosanct traditions. 
 Toyota, the world's largest automaker, said Friday that it expected to suffer a loss this year, thanks to rapidly declining sales around the world, especially in the United States. The company is expecting its first full-year operating loss since 1937 -- 350 billion yen ($3.9 billion) -- more than double its previous forecast.
 The company's 2008 fiscal year ends on March 31. 
 It widened its forecast for an operating loss on its main automotive business to 450 billion yen, or $5 billion, attributing the larger loss to both steep declines in global auto sales and strong gains by the Japanese currency, the yen, which lowers the yen-denominated value of overseas earnings.
 The global downturn has pummeled global auto sales, but Toyota had appeared somewhat resistant. No longer. 
 The last time Toyota posted a net loss was 59 years ago, when it operated under different accounting rules. Then, Toyota was in a financial crisis that led to the departure of its founder, Kiichiro Toyoda.
 The automaker, which passed General Motors in 2008 to become the world's biggest auto company, recently named Akio Toyoda, the grandson of its founder, as its president, succeeding Katsuaki Watanabe. Mr. Toyoda will take charge in June, when Mr. Watanabe becomes vice chairman.
 In December, Toyota predicted an operating loss for 2008 of 150 billion yen, and said it expected to earn a small net profit, even though most analysts predicted that its operations would end up in the red for the year.
 A net operating loss for 2008 would be the first since the company was founded in 1937 as a unit of the Toyoda family's automated loom company.
 Toyota officials insisted Friday that despite the deteriorating forecast, they would maintain benefits that seem to be a part of Toyota's culture, from lifelong employment to innovations like hybrid designs. For now, Toyota is not planning to cut permanent jobs, although it has eliminated work for some temporary employees. Analysts have been watching closely to see if the company will end its practice of lifetime employment, which it instituted six decades ago.
 ''Of course, any individual could leave voluntarily, but we will never fire those employees against their will,'' Takahiro Ijichi, a senior managing director, told American analysts in a conference call. ''We have never done that.''
 Toyota said it was still investing in hybrid-electric and compact vehicles and expected to introduce a new version of its popular Prius hybrid sedan in May. At the Detroit auto show last month, the automaker said it would start selling the first dedicated hybrid model in its Lexus luxury brand this summer. 
 Sales in the United States have dropped by a third in recent months, but the company is planning new product lineups for regions around the world that it hopes will fare better in the tighter economic environment.
 ''The financial problems have spread directly to the real economy,'' Mitsuo Kinoshita, an executive vice president, told reporters. ''We cannot tell what will happen next year but we hope we are now hitting the bottom.''
 Analysts were not sure that was the case. ''Toyota is going to get worse before it gets better,'' said Tairiku Sakaguchi, an auto analyst at Shinko Securities in Tokyo. ''The question is how quickly they can move to deal with inventory, excess production capacity and other problems.''
 On Friday, Toyota said it was pressing forward with an overhaul guided by a special Emergency Profit Improvement Committee, which the company established in November. 
 Besides cutting costs by 10 percent, the company said it was canceling or postponing the construction of plants worldwide. It has already put off opening its plant in Blue Springs, Miss., that had been scheduled to begin production in 2010. Toyota executives said the factory would not be scrapped.
 Toyota posted a net loss of 164.7 billion yen ($1.8 billion) in the three months ending Dec. 31. In the same quarter last year, the company posted a 458.6 billion yen, or $5 billion, net profit.
 The company said it was particularly hard hit in North America, traditionally its most profitable market. Toyota said vehicle sales in North America dropped 31 percent during the quarter compared with the same period last year to 521,000 units. The sales decline and losses on interest-rate swaps led to an operating loss of 247.4 billion yen, or $2.7 billion, in North America. 
 In Japan, its home market, Toyota posted a 164.2 billion yen, or $1.8 billion, operating loss after vehicle sales dropped 14 percent. In Europe, Toyota's vehicle sales dropped 24 percent, pushing the company to a 43.4 billion yen, or $480 million, operating loss.
 The company said it fared better in China and other developing markets, where it avoided a loss despite declining profits and sales. Toyota said its vehicle sales in Asia fell 8 percent, to 222,000 units. 
 Toyota also lost the top ratings status with cuts Friday from both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: Old Pledges Are Broken, Young Hope Stays Intact

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
''A Father's Promise,'' a documentary on Sunday on MSNBC, at first seems as if its purpose is to finish off a report started more than 12 years earlier. But instead it begins a whole new strand of anticipation, catching three young lives at what seems like a transformational moment. 
 The program, with Al Roker as host, follows up a ''Dateline NBC'' report from 1996 that recorded several births among black women at a Newark hospital and interviewed the unmarried fathers of the children as they earnestly vowed to be there as their babies grew up. The piece was an attempt to look at the alarming rate of fatherless households among blacks.
 It is, of course, a problem that has not gone away since 1996, and Mr. Roker's program tracks down three of those newborns and the fathers who promised to stand by them. That none did -- jail, joblessness, depression and general irresponsibility intervened -- somehow isn't surprising. 
 But what is both heartening and disquieting is the state of the three children, two boys and a girl, all now 12. 
 Each seems well spoken and well cared for -- credit their mothers -- but you also get a sense that each is on the cusp of something, that these young lives could go either way, and soon.
 One bears particularly strident resentment toward his absentee father, but all three have clearly been affected. How they navigate the difficult teenage years would be illuminating to see.
 A panel discussion among black professionals that ends the program is more interesting in the extended version online (msnbc.msn.com), but even edited down, it has moments. Tiki Barber, who grew up without a father in the household, tells a heartfelt anecdote about his last football game. And the Rev. Eugene F. Rivers of Azusa Community Church in Boston explains in very personal terms why he discounts the easy economic explanations that so often get the blame for fatherless households.
 ''I had a child out of wedlock,'' he says. ''That was a bad decision. I can't say capitalism did it to me.''

HEADLINE: Actors' Union, Recast, Prepares to Resume Talks

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The Screen Actors Guild, riven by a mutiny that led to its chief bargainer being thrown overboard in the middle of contract negotiations with the Hollywood studios, appears to be on the verge of righting itself. Whether the ship has taken on too much water to keep from sinking, however, remains a question.
 After fighting off an attempt this week by its president to prevent new leadership from taking over the negotiations, the board of the actors' union is scheduled to meet on Sunday to try to prepare for the resumption of talks with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the group that represents the major Hollywood studios. 
 No formal date has been scheduled for those talks, but people close to both sides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the uncertainty of fast-moving developments, said that bargaining could resume by the middle of February. There have been no negotiations between the two sides since talks with a federal mediator fell apart in November.
 Getting back to the bargaining table or even reaching a settlement is no guarantee of peace within the Screen Actors Guild, however. It has been substantially weakened, by most accounts, by the infighting that has dragged out the bargaining process. Movie studios have delayed film projects and actors have lost millions of dollars working under a contract that expired in June. In addition, television producers have begun shooting episodes of new series under contracts with a rival union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
 All of which leaves the guild and its 120,000 members in a substantially weakened position, from which the union could find it difficult to achieve substantial gains from the ''final offer'' that the studios put on the table in July. The remaining disputes between the two sides center mainly on payment for content when it is either replayed online or created expressly for digital transmission.
 ''The schism within the union is not likely to resolve itself anytime soon,'' said Stephen Diamond, an associate professor of law at Santa Clara University, ''unless there is some agreement on a new perspective from which to address the technological changes that are wracking the industry.''
 One key part of the union's effort to get back on track will be the Sunday board meeting, which will be conducted by teleconference between Los Angeles and New York. At the last meeting, in January, a group representing a majority of the union's board sought to oust Doug Allen, the executive director and chief negotiator. That effort was derailed by a filibuster led by Alan Rosenberg, the union's president.
 The majority group managed to subsequently remove Mr. Allen by ''written assent,'' a sort of petition used for board action between formal meetings. That effort was the subject of a court action by Mr. Rosenberg last week that failed to secure an injunction preventing the union's new executive director and chief negotiator from representing the union at the bargaining table.
 After a California state judge refused to block the new group from taking charge, David White, the interim national executive director who replaced Mr. Allen, said in a statement that he was eager to resume the contract talks.
 ''I'm pleased that we can put this matter behind us and dedicate our complete focus to the needs of Screen Actors Guild members,'' he said. ''There's a lot of work ahead of us.'' 
 Part of the board's work on Sunday is expected to be another attempt at a formal board vote to fire Mr. Allen, as a way of heading off further legal action by Mr. Rosenberg, whose lawyers said Thursday they would appeal the judge's decision. The board could also reverse its previous resolution to seek a strike authorization vote from members. 
 A strike-authorization vote, favored by Mr. Allen and Mr. Rosenberg, was opposed by a coterie of high-profile actors, including Tom Hanks and Sally Field, and opposition grew as the national economy accelerated its decline. That rift prompted much of the recent intramural fighting within the union.
 ''It is probable that some deal will get cut now with the studios,'' said Daniel J. B. Mitchell, a professor emeritus and labor expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''But this fight within the union will probably go on, even if a contract is signed and approved.''
 The Screen Actors Guild elects one-third of its board membership each year, and it now appears likely that the more moderate group, known as Unite for Strength, could pick up additional board seats in the fall, further strengthening its now-slim majority. 
 But the lack of a current contract not only has cost guild members lost wages, it also has led some television studios to favor forging contracts with a rival union for new television shows under development. 
 That union, known as Aftra, shares about 40,000 members with the Screen Actors Guild and typically has represented performers on situation comedies and other programs shot on videotape, while the Guild has represented actors in works shot on film for broadcast networks.
 Those distinctions have been blurring as new technologies, including digital video, provide producers with more options in how to record scenes. The growth of unscripted, or reality programming, has also favored Aftra, as has the rise of cable networks that offer original scripted dramas and comedies.
 The overlap of the two unions has led to some calls for a merger, either for all members, including Aftra's members who work on news programming, game shows and the like, or for just the actor categories.
 ''SAG is now in a weakened position and Aftra probably looks like a very good partner for them,'' said David M. Smith, an associate professor of economics at Pepperdine University. ''Together, they could represent a more unified front for the studios to have to face.''
 But plenty of bad blood exists between the two unions. When Aftra signed a new contract with the Hollywood studios last year, the Screen Actors Guild, under Mr. Allen and Mr. Rosenberg, unsuccessfully lobbied Aftra members to reject the contract.
 The continued schism within the guild over its own leadership could present an even bigger hurdle for those who are hoping to see those two unions join forces.

HEADLINE: Haley Takes Over the Chiefs

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Todd Haley was hired as coach of the Kansas City Chiefs on Friday after helping the Arizona Cardinals reach the Super Bowl as coordinator of one of the N.F.L.'s most exciting offenses. 
 Haley joins a team that went a franchise-worst 2-14 under Coach Herm Edwards, who was fired Jan. 23. Edwards lost all but two of his last 25 games and launched a rebuilding project that made the Chiefs the league's youngest team this season.
 Scott Pioli, hired last month as general manager, said Haley has a ''strong understanding of players and the type of players that create championship football teams.''
 Haley called the job an ideal situation for him and ''a chance to work with someone I have experience with in Scott.''
 Haley and Pioli worked together with the Jets, where Haley's father, Dick, was the personnel director.
 The Chiefs have not won a postseason game since an aging Joe Montana was their quarterback in the 1993 season.
 Haley, who turns 42 this month, helped shape an offense, led by Kurt Warner, that set a franchise record with 427 points, finished third in scoring in the N.F.L. and was second in passing yards.
 Warner, who is considering retirement, said Haley's departure would not be the main factor in whether he returns.
 ''You have to look at the big picture and wherever we're going and whoever is coming in, you just got to make sure you feel comfortable with that and they have the same mind-set,'' he said. 
 BOLDIN STILL UNHAPPY Cardinals receiver Anquan Boldin, still unhappy with his contract, told ESPN at the Pro Bowl in Hawaii that regardless of Kurt Warner's decision on retirement, the chances of his remaining with the team were ''very slim.'' 
 CALDWELL HIRES STAFFIndianapolis Colts Coach Jim Caldwell hired Larry Coyer as defensive coordinator and Ray Rychleski as special teams coordinator. Caldwell also promoted the receivers coach, Clyde Christensen, to assistant head coach. Coyer spent the past two seasons as a Tampa Bay Buccaneers assistant. Rychleski spent last season at the University of South Carolina.
 BEARS FREEZE TICKET PRICES With the economy struggling, the Chicago Bears said they had decided not to raise ticket prices for next season. It will be the first time since after the 2000 season that the Bears will not raise prices in some form.

HEADLINE: It's Not Just the Money, It's the Mind-Set

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
During the boom years, money in America became many things it was never meant to be. It was status. It was identity. It was a magnet for love and friendship. What it rarely was is what it is: a means of exchange. 
 Now that a huge chunk of that wealth has evaporated and sources for its return have dried up, people are reeling. If the salary caps proposed this week by President Obama are adopted for companies receiving government aid, formerly high-earning executives are going to have an even harder time making it back. The net result is a psychological crisis over wealth and self-image. 
 ''This feels absolutely different because it's so widespread,'' said Eric Dammann, a Manhattan psychoanalyst, in comparing this crash to 2001 and 1987. ''It feels like everything is imploding at the same time as well as this sense that there is no light at the end of the tunnel.'' 
 Or as David Darst, chief investment strategist of Morgan Stanley's Global Wealth Management Group, said, ''People around the world are like children with a baby rattle and the market is the adult, and we're gripping that rattle until we have confidence that the adult is going to give it back to us.'' 
 In other words, a lot of wealthy people are scared about what could happen to the money they have left and are willing to go to extremes to protect it. 
 Consider Thomas Ruskin. A retired New York City detective, he is the president of CMP Protective and Investigative Group, and his business is booming. For personal security, he says, revenue is up three times from what it was six months ago. Clients are demanding more protection -- whether or not they actually need it -- and paying upward of $100,000 a month for his services. 
 Divorce investigations have also increased. ''In the last 90 days, we've seen a tidal wave,'' he said. 
 Mr. Ruskin added that the feeling that good times were over had made spouses less tolerant: ''It's mostly for infidelity that has been going on for years and that spouses were willing to accept in better times.''
 Strange behavior is not limited to Wall Street. Brad Klontz, a financial psychologist in Hawaii and partner in Klontz Kahler, a financial therapy and planning firm, said someone he worked with had liquidated his portfolio, put the money into gold and silver and bought a safe to store the bullion. This person, he says, is considering buying an assault rifle to protect his wealth. ''If it really got down to that point it would be total anarchy, and there would be nothing you could do,'' Mr. Klontz said. ''And this is a really smart guy.''
 Talk to enough people who work with the wealthy and the picture that emerges of the upper echelon of American society is borderline feudal: the haves are ensconced in their castles and the have-nots are barbarians to be kept at bay. Yet even though civil society is still functioning and the have-nots are not storming the McMansions, the haves are still struggling to come to grips with the new realities. 
 After writing about the practical steps people need to take to shore up their finances, I realized there was just as great a need to address the psychological mindset of the still-wealthy. This state -- full of anxiety and fear more than depression -- is just as painful as the financial losses they have incurred. 
 Calm the Elephant: Mr. Klontz uses a simple metaphor to explain what is happening to people who are overwhelmed by the crash. The emotional part of the brain is an elephant and the rational part is the guy on its back. When things are going fine, the elephant trudges along and the guy feels in control. But when the elephant gets scared, there is little the guy can do but hold on. 
 ''It's a scary time,'' Mr. Klontz said. ''The emotional part of the brain makes 80 percent of the decisions, and when it really gets activated, it shuts off rational decision-making. It's lemmings going over a cliff.'' 
 Animal analogies aside, the first step in calming your financial fears is no different from what any talk therapy requires -- a recognition of the problem. In this case, people need to realize the stress and anxiety they are feeling is probably overblown. They may have to downsize, but no one is going to beat them up for doing so.
 Identify the Source: The trigger for this collective anxiety is the wholesale collapse of three things in which Americans invest tremendous pride and self-esteem: homes, jobs and investments. But in most cases none is the root of the anxiety. 
 Mr. Dammann, the psychoanalyst, said he had many clients who after losing 50 percent of their net worth still had tens of millions of dollars left.
 To them, lots of money in the bank was not freedom or security. It was who they were. ''As their net worth shrinks, their self-worth shrinks,'' he said. 
 The cure is to get them to understand what money means to them. Why do they feel their lives won't have meaning if they cannot buy expensive clothes, own ever-larger homes and jet around the world on a whim? The answers are no surprise: childhood traumas, fears of inadequacy, a desire to make your success widely known. 
 ''The problem is not the economy,'' he said. ''It's all the stuff it's stirring up.''
 Allow Yourself to Grieve: The toughest thing to get over is the belief that you did everything right, but that someone changed the rules on you. This is an entitlement mentality -- not everyone gets to own a home, let alone two or three -- but the psychological loss is no less real. People need to grieve. 
 ''It's a grieving less about the individual thing,'' Mr. Klontz said. ''It's the loss of a dream. It's how you thought things should be.'' Without the chance to grieve, he said, ''that's when our thinking becomes rigid and bitter.''
 There is consolation for those intent on keeping up with the Joneses. ''I've been telling people that you're just as rich now, because everyone has lost 30 percent,'' he said. 
 Embrace the Worst Case: Is giving up bottle service in nightclubs and cutting out weekend jaunts to Aruba too much to bear? How about getting to the point where you lose everything -- like Bernard L. Madoff's investors -- and have to turn to family members for help? For some the very thought of a life less fabulous is so painful as to be paralyzing.
 Ted Klontz, Brad's father, business partner and a psychologist in his own right, has clients visualize the worst thing they could imagine happening to them. For many, either because of pride or because of bad childhood memories, it is asking their family to take them in. Verbalizing this fear is the key. 
 ''What an incredible opportunity to talk to your wife about, 'What do we do if...,' '' he said. ''It reduces the anxiety and trauma.''
 This might have helped those preparing for the end of days. Mr. Ruskin, the detective, said none of his clients' security fears had materialized, though he was quick to add: ''That doesn't mean it's not there and it's not going to happen.''
 Past as Prologue: Above all, people's psyches are being wracked by what behavioral economists call present-event bias. This is the belief that what is happening now will always be. The same thing happens in bull markets -- values always seem to be rising until they don't -- but it is clearly more painful when wealth is being destroyed. Markets, of course, will go up again. 
 ''Folks have been traumatized and damaged psychologically, financially, emotionally,'' said Mr. Darst, the Morgan Stanley investment strategist. ''I was just in Dubai and Saudi Arabia. I had a distinct impression that there was hopefulness about the size and structure of what's next.''

HEADLINE: Tips Meant for the Waist, but Perfect for the Pocket

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
Tired of advice from finger-wagging financial experts? You've come to the right place, because this week I'm turning to diet and nutrition gurus for advice on your money instead.
 Various studies (and common sense) suggest that eating well pays off in a number of ways. 
 If you eat right, you'll have more energy. That makes you more likely to succeed at work and earn more money. Then, you'll be able to afford better food, stay healthy and spend less on medical costs. And the virtuous circle continues.
 That's the way it's supposed to work. The reality -- reflected in bulging waistlines and debt loads -- is that Americans generally haven't shown much discipline at McDonald's, the mall or in the mortgage market. 
 How do you start getting your financial life in better shape? Below, you'll find four tips drawn from the world of nutrition, intended to make self-control feel a bit less like deprivation. 
 Cut the Cues
 The best book I read all week was ''Mindless Eating.'' The author, Brian Wansink, a marketing professor at Cornell University, also runs its Food and Brand Lab. He argues that you eat what you eat because of what's around you, without even knowing it. 
 So the book sets out to teach people how to change their environment to remove the cues that make them overeat. Food storage containers and plates, for instance, ought to be smaller. 
 And don't clear the chicken bones, since the mess serves as evidence of how much you've already eaten.
 The cues to spend money are more numerous than ever, thanks to the Internet providing instant and constant temptations to shop. One trick might be to keep your favorite retailers out of your e-mail in-box by getting off their newsletter lists.
 Mr. Wansink has taken it a step further in his own life, removing the tools that prompted his response to the cues. As a collector of Herbert Hoover paraphernalia and the owner of several saxophones, he'd developed a bit of an eBay habit over the years. So he got rid of his PayPal account, which made it much harder to buy things from merchants on the site.
 As for Amazon, Mr. Wansink does not have an account. Only his wife does, and he makes a point of not remembering the username and password when he asks to use it. ''Once you make some of these changes, they become so effortless, so natural, that you don't realize that you even made them in the first place,'' he said. 
 Hassle, in effect, overcomes habit. 
 Watch Your Portions
 Another useful idea from the world of nutrition is portion control. Lisa R. Young, who studied economics at Wharton as an undergraduate before turning to nutrition in graduate school, doesn't believe in diets. A diet, she writes in her book, ''The Portion Teller Plan,'' is something you go on and then stop. 
 In her private practice, Ms. Young focuses not on banning the wrong foods but eating the right amount of everything, including treats. ''If you tell people that they can never have sweets, it's like telling people they can never indulge in a Broadway show,'' she said. ''They're not going to be happy because they're not going to have something to look forward to.''
 With clear limits for the portions of grains and starchy vegetables you eat each day, or the amount you spend on restaurants each month, you'll still have the freedom to indulge, mixed with a measure of control. 
 One online money management tool that uses similar ideas is Mvelopes. It's designed to mimic an old-fashioned method of budgeting, where people would stuff cash into envelopes for the month's allocation for food, transportation, entertainment and the like. Mvelopes costs between $7.90 and $13.20 a month, though free services exist from Mint, Wesabe, Geezeo and Quicken that can also help track spending. The Web sites of some major banks have these tools too. 
 Keep Score
 Weight Watchers is perhaps best known for its points system, where all foods have a value based on their calories, fat and fiber. So part of the deal is tracking all of the points you consume.
 This sounds suspiciously like a line-item financial budget, the sort that most people hate keeping. Alas, recording everything you eat or anything you spend is also the quickest way to diagnose the things that are causing you problems. 
 On the money side, it's worth trying this once, at least for a week. The budgeting sites I mentioned above can track credit or debit card spending more easily than every last cash expenditure. As an alternative, you might just tote a notebook, or keep receipts and add them up at week's end. 
 If this feels like too much of a chore to keep up, consider one lesser-known part of the Weight Watchers process, the recording of feelings above and beyond the food points. When you hit your marks, or blow off your goals entirely, how do you react emotionally?
 ''If I decide I should be able to have beer and potato chips and ribs at the Super Bowl party, it's good to be able to evaluate that choice later so I have more information to bring to the next decision I make,'' said Laura Lindsey, a Weight Watchers grop leader in Tampa, Fla. 
 ''When I wake up Super Bowl Monday, and the chips are just a memory, and I feel anxious that I'm not going to weigh what I want to weigh, maybe I'll have just one beer and bring a veggie tray the next time I show up at a party.''
 For Ms. Lindsey, a law firm comptroller by day, the parallels to household finance are obvious. Sure, you can buy the high-definition television, she noted. After all, prices are coming down. But once it's hanging on the wall of your house, will you wonder each time you walk by it how much farther you are from the goal of having a bigger and better house to watch it in?
 Count on Failure
 Most diets don't work. Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, particularly as you age and your metabolism slows, means at least some permanent change in your behavior. This can be hard to do, absent an intense health scare. 
 With money, however, it's actually pretty simple to make some enduring adjustments as long as you're willing to make the upfront effort to put the process on autopilot. Many companies will now automatically increase your 401(k) savings a bit each year if you let them. You can ask your 529 college savings plan provider to pull money from your bank account each month too. Try it with $25 and see if you miss the money, then raise the dollar amount as often as you can. 
 In addition to saving more, automation can also help you pay less. If your credit card company pulls money from you automatically, you won't ever pay late fees. If you pay your mortgage company a bit extra beyond the monthly payment, you'll work off the loan sooner and save on interest costs.
 And with all of those extra savings, you'll probably have a bit more money left over for fresh fruits and vegetables.

HEADLINE: Hurdles (Not Financial Ones) Await Electric Grid Update

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Environmentalists dream of a bigger and ''smarter'' electric grid that could move vast amounts of clean electricity from windswept plains and sunny deserts to distant cities.
 Such a grid, they argue, could help utilities match demand with supply on the hottest afternoons, allow customers to decide when to run their appliances and decrease the risk of blackouts, like the one that paralyzed much of the East in 2003.
 The Obama administration has vowed to make the grid smarter and tougher, allocating $11 billion in grants and loan guarantees to the task in the economic stimulus package passed by the House last week. 
 But it will take a lot more than money to transform the grid from a form that served well in the last century, when electricity was produced mostly near the point of consumption, and when the imperative was meeting demand, no matter how high it grew. 
 Opposition to power lines from landowners and neighbors, local officials or environmental groups, especially in rural areas, makes expansion difficult -- even when the money for it is available. And some experts argue that in the absence of a broader national effort to encourage cleaner fuels, even the smartest grid will do little to reduce consumption of fuels that contribute to climate change. 
 In fact, energy experts say that simply building a better grid is not enough, because that would make the cheap electricity that comes from burning coal available in more parts of the country. That could squeeze out generators that are more expensive but cleaner, like those running on natural gas. The solution is to put a price on emissions from dirtier fuels and incorporate that into the price of electricity, or find some other way to limit power generation from coal, these experts say.
 The stimulus bill passed by the House includes $6.5 billion in credit to federal agencies for building power lines, presumably in remote areas where renewable energy sources are best placed, and $2 billion in loan guarantees to companies for power lines and renewable energy projects. The bill also includes $4.4 billion for the installation of smart meters -- which, administration officials say, in combination with other investments in a smart grid, would cut energy use by 2 percent to 4 percent -- and $100 million to train workers to maintain the grid. 
 About 527,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines stretch across the United States, most installed many decades ago. 
 Everyone agrees that more lines are needed. But some industry experts argue that the problem of making the grid greener goes well beyond upgrading and expanding the existing power lines. The grid, they say, was set up primarily to draw energy from nearby plants and to provide a steady flow of electricity to customers. It was not intended to incorporate power from remote sources like solar panels and windmills, whose output fluctuates with weather conditions -- variability that demands a far more flexible operation. 
 The experts say that the grid must therefore be designed to moderate demand at times when there is less wind or sun available -- for example, by allowing businesses or residential customers to volunteer to let the local utility turn down air-conditioners in office buildings or houses, when hourly prices rise. 
 An even more significant problem is that utilities increasingly face opposition to expansion and must fight for years for permits.
 Jose M. Delgado, president and chief executive of the American Transmission Company, which operates in four Midwestern states, said his firm's last major project, a line of about 220 miles from Duluth, Minn., to Wausau, Wis., took two years to build but eight years before that to win the permits. The federal Interior Department took a year to approve the line crossing a wild river and required a $5 million contribution to a national park, but the one-year delay raised costs by an additional $12 million, for a total of $440 million, Mr. Delgado said. 
 Loan guarantees will not help this problem, he said. ''We have had wonderful access to the private bond market,'' he added.
 The International Transmission Company, a Michigan company, is trying to build a 26-mile line that, had it been in place, would have prevented the great Eastern blackout of 2003, said Joseph L. Welch, president and chief executive. The State of Michigan has approved it, but a homeowner is challenging it in court, Mr. Welch said.
 ''We burn up three years on a line that will take two months to build,'' he said.
 But, he added, ''We absolutely have no problem -- underscore, no problem -- financing our transmission grid.''
 Other companies said the same, although a few said the loan guarantees in the House bill would be helpful. 
 As power lines lengthen, the number of approvals they require increases, the complications of dividing the costs become greater and the difference among national interests and local interests becomes starker, said Dan W. Reicher, a former assistant secretary of energy who was a member of President Obama's transition team.
 Policy makers have looked at various models to resolve the conflicting interests in power-line disputes. In the 1930s, the federal government assumed sole responsibility for approving natural gas pipelines, and as a result, gas moves freely from wells in the Gulf Coast states to other areas of the country, with much of it used to make electricity. Gas pipelines are somewhat less objectionable, though, because they are buried. 
 Another model is the one used to build the Interstate Highway System, with the states using their powers of eminent domain in a system that was centrally planned with state input. But highways were more attractive to many states than power lines would be, electricity officials say, especially if the lines are simply crossing a state without adding much local benefit. A third possibility is a national commission that would present a master plan for thousands of miles of new transmission lines that Congress could approve for the whole country in spite of local objections for individual pieces. 
 Congress tried to solve the problem in 2005 with a law that gave the Energy Department authority to intervene if states did not approve new lines deemed to be in the national interest, but that has not worked well, said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Energy Committee. It was criticized as an assault on the traditional control by the states of land-use decisions.
 The electric industry is at least planning to better integrate different parts of the grid so that if power is needed in Baltimore it can be imported from Chicago. A group of technical experts, mostly from the Midwest, have been meeting for months to map out new lines, in an effort that industry veterans say is unprecedented in its breadth. But the group's aim is simply a map of what such a system would look like; it will not seek permission for such lines, or try to finance them or actually build them. The group is scheduled to make an announcement next week. 
 ''We've got a real political confrontation that's going to take place,'' said Glenn L. English Jr., chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, who had served as a congressman from Oklahoma for 20 years. ''It basically comes down to the question of prioritization. What's more important to you? Do you truly want to maximize the use of renewable energy?''

HEADLINE: A Big Rally Despite Big Job Losses

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Not even the loss of 598,000 jobs could dampen Wall Street's soaring mood on Friday. In a second day of gains, stock markets surged as investors waited for the federal government to detail its latest plans to shore up the banking system.
 With Friday's rally, the major indexes posted their first winning week in a month, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite gained enough to recoup its losses from last month, ending in positive territory for the year. 
 But some analysts questioned whether the Treasury Department's expected announcement on Monday would be enough to meet investors' expectations and whether stocks would fall back if the government's plans turned out to be disappointing.
 ''It's clear investors want to see something bold, something dramatic and something that is viable,'' said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford. ''We've had all these ad hoc, partial solutions. They don't work, and then the market gets depressed. We'll see if this is the one. We'll see.''
 On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 217.52 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 8,280.59. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 22.75 points, or 2.69 percent, to 868.60, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 45.47 points, or 2.94 percent, to 1,591.71.
 Crude oil prices fell a dollar to settle at $40.17 a barrel in New York.
 Analysts said they were cheered that financial markets seemed to shrug off a government report showing that unemployment climbed to 7.6 percent in January as the recession deepened, a sign the job market was still far from hitting bottom.
 ''It's a good sign that we're trading up in the face of bad news,'' said Ed Hyland, global investment specialist at JPMorgan Private Bank. ''That's one of the signs that you look for in the bottoming of a bear market.''
 Although the statistics were grim, the so-called whisper numbers representing the most pessimistic estimates on Wall Street guessed that unemployment could have spiked to 8 percent last month, given the mass layoffs announced by employers.
 ''It's this paradigm: not as bad as it could've been is the new good,'' said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company.
 Analysts pointed to another positive signal: Congress appears to be making progress toward passing an economic stimulus package after Senate negotiators pared down a nearly $900 billion package to about $780 billion. 
 Investors snapped up distressed bank stocks like they were items on a bargain table and bid up basic-materials companies and shares of General Electric, Home Depot and Caterpillar. Retailers, whose shares have been hit by falling profits and reduced outlooks for 2009, rebounded on Friday. 
 Depressed bank stocks surged. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase each posted double-digit gains, and Bank of America rose nearly 30 percent, rebounding to $6.13 a share in regular trading.
 The broad rally lifted even companies that reported pessimistic earnings forecasts. In New York, shares of Toyota rose slightly to $69.38 after the automaker said it expected to post a loss for the fiscal year ending March 31, its first ever. 
 Shares of the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were flat.
 Carmakers in the United States and abroad have been hammered by plummeting sales as financing becomes more difficult and consumers curtail their spending. This week, the Big Three automakers reported that new-vehicle sales fell 37 percent in January, their worst month in decades. 
 The price of Treasury debt fell as investors looked for higher returns on their money and stormed back into equities. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 22/32, to 106 12/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.99 percent, up from 2.91 percent late Thursday, well above its December low of 2.06 percent. 
 Treasury yields plunged last year as losses mounted in the stock and bond markets and shaken investors rushed to find safe investments, but interest rates on short-term and long-term Treasury debt have crept higher in the last few weeks as the credit markets recover and on anticipation of huge government spending and borrowing. 
 Other barometers of the credit market were stable. 
 The London interbank offered rate, a measure of how much banks charge each other to borrow money, was little changed at 1.2 percent. The so-called TED spread, which increases as investors become more cautious about lending money, was 0.97 points, unchanged from Thursday. 
 ''It doesn't sound like a lot, but that's the beginning of a very significant shift in investor appetites,'' said Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer of the Bessemer Trust. ''We're seeing money flow into areas entailing more risk. There's fear out there, but I think it's increasingly being mitigated by the sense that there's money to be made.''

HEADLINE: Those Who Ignore History ...

 BODY:
With the global economy staggering, wealthy countries need to pull together to produce a concerted economic stimulus, protect the free flow of trade and rescue the poor and small countries that cannot possibly make it on their own. What the world is getting -- from the United States Congress and other governments -- is the kind of policy blunders and retrenchment that unleashed the global depression almost 80 years ago. 
 The beggar-thy-neighbor policy-making that spread in late 1920s and early 1930s should provide a bleak warning. The United States first sparked depression across the world when it started raising interest rates in 1928 to curb stock-market speculation, forcing other countries, whose currencies were fixed under the gold standard, to do the same to stem an exodus of reserves. But it spread and deepened as the United States and other countries responded to slower growth and falling exports by erecting trade barriers. 
 World trade contracted 60 percent between 1929 and 1932. Industrial production in the United States and European countries fell by more than 35 percent. Unemployment topped 30 percent in Germany. The price of Malaysian rubber fell 84 percent, and that of Argentine wool tumbled 72 percent. Beginning in 1931, all big Latin American countries defaulted on their debt. Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931. Hitler came to power in 1933.
 The world is different today. Economic links have deepened as companies have set up worldwide production networks. Multilateral institutions, including the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund, police an open economic order. We have learned some of history's lessons. But not enough. 
 Russia and India are already raising tariffs on cars and steel. Anti-dumping tariffs are on the rise around the world. The European Union is reintroducing trade distorting subsidies. And the ''Buy America'' clauses in both the House and Senate versions of the fiscal rescue package are disturbingly reminiscent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs levied by the United States in 1930. 
 Instead of fanning the flames, the United States should be dousing them -- fast. It should cajole other countries, starting with those in the European Union, to spend more than they have been willing. It must work with the I.M.F. to help craft and finance rescue packages for developing countries that are being shut out of capital markets and can't pay for their own fiscal stimulus. 
 First, the Obama administration must free America's stimulus package from its protectionist shackles and ensure that it is big and open -- as large as the crisis that threatens this country and the rest of the world.

HEADLINE: Japan Society Names a New President

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Motoatsu Sakurai, Japan's consul general in New York and the former president of Mitsubishi's American subsidiary, has been appointed to lead Japan Society. 
 Mr. Sakurai, 64, who assumes the job of president on April 7, will be the first Japanese citizen to hold the post. He succeeds Richard J. Wood, 71, who took over in October 2006 after a period of dissension and upheaval within the organization. 
 Mr. Sakurai is not new to Japan Society: he was a trustee there from 2003 until 2006, when he became an honorary director. 
 As the society's president, he will confront the same grim financial picture facing cultural organizations across the country. In a globalized world in which China is ascendant, and economic power and relationships are shifting, he will also have to make the case that a society founded in 1907 to foster the relationship between Japan and the United States still matters. 
 In an interview Mr. Sakurai said he planned to ''stimulate more the Japan side of the Japan Society'' by trying to make Americans as comfortable with Japanese culture as the Japanese have become with American culture. 
 ''I'm kind of a testing case,'' he said in his sometimes halting English.
 Mr. Sakurai said his business background would give him an advantage in coping with the current recession. ''I have certain notions of what kind of contributions corporations should do,'' he said. ''I know it is not easy -- and challenging -- but I think fortunately Japan Society has a very sound base.''
 That base has been eroded in the economic downturn, however. The society's endowment has shrunk 30 percent since last summer, to $60 million from $83 million, and the society has reduced its staff to 46 from 62 over the last few months by laying off 8 people and leaving vacancies unfilled. 
 The society has cut its budget to $12 million from $13.6 million and plans to reduce it to $10 million for the next fiscal year, which starts on July 1. 
 Mr. Sakurai said he might expand the society's so-called corporate program, which now includes conferences, lectures and symposiums enlisting business figures and policy makers to discuss relations between Japan and the United States. But he said it was too soon to discuss any details. 
 His first task will be to meet with staff members -- ''to talk to each individual, to understand their aspirations, their motivations,'' he said. ''After a certain time, I will come up with several ideas.''
 He inherits an organization that has regained some stability since Mr. Wood became interim president in May 2006. A month before that, Frank L. Ellsworth, a former president of Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., resigned as president after a rocky two and a half years in which staff members defected, fund-raising declined, and some exhibitions were canceled. 
 Mr. Wood set about restoring morale and reducing the cost of mounting exhibitions at the society to about $500,000 per show from $1.2 million. 
 ''Krazy!,'' an exhibition dedicated to anime, manga and video games that opens at the society on March 13, will cost $440,000, Japan Society said.
 Mr. Sakurai's previous cultural experience includes organizing Japan Day, an annual festival he started three years ago as consul general. Last year the event attracted some 35,000 people to Central Park for activities including Japanese calligraphy, origami and a costume parade. 
 Mr. Sakurai was appointed consul general in New York in March 2006 after a 40-year career in the private sector. After graduating from Tokyo University's Faculty of Law in 1968, he began working for Mitsubishi and earned a master's degree at Insead, the international business school in Fontainebleau, France.

HEADLINE: Japan's Largest Bank Cuts Earnings Outlook

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, Japan's biggest bank, cut its full-year earnings outlook on Friday, joining several domestic rivals in reporting dismal earnings that exposed the strains to the sector from falls in the stock market last year. 
 While toxic mortgage-related assets have dragged down numerous banks in the United States and Europe, in Japan a shrinking economy and a drop in the value of sizable stock holdings have emerged as the main problem for banks like Mitsubishi UFJ, the Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial.
 Ownership of Japanese companies' helps cement business ties for many banks but the market rout has forced them to lower the value of the assets, eroding their capital bases.
 Although analysts had long cautioned that the sharp fall in the stock market in the last three months of 2008 would have this effect, the third-quarter results by Japanese banks highlighted the scale of the problem.
 The governor of the Bank of Japan, Masaaki Shirakawa, on Friday reiterated that the falling value of the cross-shareholdings represented the biggest risk for Japanese banks. And earlier this week, the central bank aimed to address the point by offering to buy up to 1 trillion yen, or $11.1 billion, of the shares that Japanese banks hold in other corporations.
 The plan, which echoes purchases made by the central bank in 2002 through 2004, is aimed at allowing banks to reduce their exposure to fluctuating markets, which the central bank said represented a critical business challenge.
 Concerns have also intensified that Japan's lenders, with their balance sheets much weakened, will become even more reluctant to extend credit, further entrenching a credit squeeze that has hurt companies that are already struggling thanks to Japan's recession. Small and medium-size companies, especially, are suffering, an issue that has become highly politicized ahead of elections in Japan later this year.
 Mitsubishi UFJ said on Friday that it now expected net income of 50 billion yen, or $555.5 million for the year ending March 31, rather than the 220 billion yen that it had previously forecast. The revision, it said, was mainly the result of write-down of equity securities caused by a drop in stock prices in the October through December quarter.
 The company lost 134.1 billion yen, or about $1.49 billion during that quarter, compared with a net profit of 57.9 billion yen a year earlier. Write-downs on equity holdings totaled about 400 billion yen, it said.
 Mitsubishi UFJ, which last year took a 21 percent stake in Morgan Stanley and raised billions in new funds, also said it planned to issue more preferred shares.
 Separately, Nomura, the largest brokerage in the country, announced Friday that it would raise up to 300 billion yen by selling stock.
 This comes after Nomura last month reported a net loss of 343 billion yen for the quarter through December, in part because of costs related to its acquisition last year of the Asian, European and Middle East operations of the investment bank Lehman Brothers.

HEADLINE: First, Live Debt-Free In Your Head

BYLINE: By M.P. DUNLEAVEY

 BODY:
DEBT is a huge problem, for some people a great deal more than for others. Yet despite reams of literature on the topic, some important guidance is missing.
 Getting out of debt still is couched, typically, as a straightforward money issue. Most advice centers on the mechanics of interest rates and minimum payments, ways to cut expenses and so on.
 But having recently climbed out of a deep hole of credit card debt myself, I'm convinced that focusing on mere dollars and cents gets you only so far. 
 Ditching debt requires dealing with the emotional underbelly of owing money, and coming to terms with a culture that has serious debt addiction issues. Getting out of debt can feel like a battle -- because it is one, on many fronts.
 I'm not referring to mortgageloans here, but to the peculiar stickiness of credit card debt. At least ''sticky'' was the word that kept popping up in my mind, during the five and a half years that my husband and I struggled to pay down $30,000 of combined debt. And there is some evidence that debt, once you're in it, tends to persist.
 Researchers at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago reviewed patterns of debt acquisition for adults born between 1957 and 1984, and what they found in this long-running survey was startling. 
 Regardless of age, those who were in debt early in the survey were more likely to be in debt five or 10 years later -- and their debts were likely to have grown. By contrast, those who started out with no debt of any kind were less likely to have any five or 10 years later. 
 Borrowing money to buy a home or a car, or to complete an education, might be necessary. But carrying credit card debt for months or years is a red flag signaling that you can't afford your life. The cycle is a brutal one. You can't afford your life, and thus fall into debt; so how can you afford to pay your way out of it while still living your life?
 Clearly it's important to address the numerical side of debt. The standard advice to first tally up what you owe and then plug the numbers into an online debt calculator is a sound step for developing a financial plan of attack (I like Bankrate.com's calculator).
 But before you create the mother of all budgets, I recommend putting a lot of time and thought into examining the way you live, how you have mentally calculated what's ''affordable'' or what you ''deserve'' to spend -- and what it would require, financially and emotionally, to live a life based on the money you actually have.
 Here's a way to think of it, which I found useful: to get rid of debt, you have to begin living a debt-free life even before you are. 
 Figuring out what that will look and feel like for you and your family is without question the biggest adjustment that getting out of debt demands. 
 It's a slow shift, I found, but until your thoughts change, your spending won't, not really. A budget is really a belief system, backed up by numbers. Once my husband and I got that -- that we wanted to reclaim our money and put it toward living instead of a stupid piece of plastic -- the whole process became simpler. 
 IT did not get easier. Feeding money into a seemingly bottomless card every month was painful. It took more time and more stamina than we imagined. No one tells you that either: Brace yourself.
 This is another point rarely addressed in the debt canon: talk about money, with your mate, your friends or relatives. Kick aside taboos whenever possible. Ask questions. Start a conversation. I found that just saying, ''We're paying back our debt,'' evoked sympathy and respect. And it took away any lingering pressure to maintain a financial facade: pretense is a good way to stay in debt.
 Being frank tends to create an unforeseen financial benefit: with other people's support, you increase the odds of your own success. And what does success feel like, now that I'm $30,000 out of the hole? It feels like peace of mind.

HEADLINE: Another Push for Better Nutrition for the City

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
Food and nutrition have been favorite issues for the Bloomberg administration. Now, adding to those efforts, Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, is proposing his own plan for residents to eat better. 
 In a report to be released on Saturday, he is calling for the city to make healthy food more widely available by giving farmers' markets and supermarkets tax and zoning incentives, restricting fast-food restaurants and requiring city agencies to buy 20 percent of their food from local farmers. 
 With the report, an outgrowth of a November conference at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, Mr. Stringer becomes the latest official to address the conundrum of why a Granny Smith from New Zealand is often the only apple available at a bodega in Upper Manhattan -- and at a premium price. Adopting the language of food policy experts, Mr. Stringer says the city must examine its ''foodshed,'' the big picture of how food is brought, bought, sold, cooked and eaten in the city. 
 ''If our watershed becomes polluted or broken, the consequences to New York's economy and health are enormous,'' he said. ''Our foodshed is already broken and we need to fix it.''
 City schools, shelters and other agencies would be required to buy 20 percent of their vegetables, dairy products and some other foods locally -- from within 100 or 200 miles, perhaps. 
 In areas in which few stores sell produce or other healthy food, the report calls for ''food enterprise zones'' with tax abatements and zoning incentives for markets, and restricting the number of fast-food restaurants. It also recommends tax and zoning incentives for community gardens, and even backyard and roof gardens.
 Karen Karp, a consultant who has worked with the city on food programs, said that she was glad to see food issues dealt with at a high level of government, but that some recommendations on local food might be unrealistic. ''New York is a Northeastern city, but we need citrus, we need coffee beans, we need sugar all year round,'' she said. ''It's a bigger picture than just apples and carrots.''

HEADLINE: Europe Also Moves to Limit Executive Pay

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
This was supposed to be bonus season for the once-pampered bankers of Europe. Instead, it has become payback time.
 With President Obama telling American executives to curb excessive pay, an increasing number of European banks are limiting or canceling the high salaries and bonuses once seen as an inalienable right.
 Banks that choose not to show moderation -- even the small band of banks that did not receive government help, like Barclays in Britain and Deutsche Bank -- run the risk of angering shareholders, members of the public and politicians who are eager to show that taxpayer money is not lining the pockets of those whom many blame for the financial crisis. 
 ''There's something to be said for bankers piping down a bit and seeing where they went wrong,'' said Frits Bolkestein, a former European commissioner for the internal market, summing up the mood of many in Europe. ''There's a lesson to be learned.''
 ''There's no opposition to giving bonuses or high pay to people who are successful,'' said Mr. Bolkestein, now a professor at the universities of Delft and Leiden in the Netherlands. ''But there should be no extra money for people who have failed.''
 And, in some cases, no jobs. Royal Bank of Scotland Group fired seven nonexecutive directors Friday as part of a restructuring agreement with the British government, which pumped in about $30 billion to rescue the bank.
 On Friday, European governments were encouraged to follow the example of the United States by limiting executive pay at companies receiving government aid.
 ''The commission very much welcomes this kind of limit placed on the pay and bonuses of executives,'' a European Commission spokesman, Jonathan Todd, was quoted as saying by Reuters. Such restrictions could be an extra incentive for banks to repay state bailouts.
 The commission, the European Union's executive body, has approved billions in state aid for European banks since last summer. 
 In Washington, Mr. Obama imposed rules early this week setting a $500,000 cap on cash compensation for the most senior executives at companies receiving aid, curtailing severance pay when top executives leave a company and restricting the cashing of stock incentives until government assistance is repaid. 
 Brussels has no plans for now to propose legislation on the issue, so it remains up to individual European countries to decide on limits for bankers' pay.
 Perhaps still aware of the shock caused by the trading scandals last year at Societe Generale and another large bank, Groupe Caisse d'Epargne, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France used a televised exchange late Thursday to rail against the excessive rewards given to traders.
 Mr. Sarkozy said he was ''more shocked by the system of pay'' for traders than he was for bankers' remuneration. ''That's what you have to forbid,'' he said.
 Paris had announced that banks accepting the 21 billion euros, or $27.3 billion, that it has offered in aid would not be allowed to pay bonuses. The same rules will apply to the French automobile industry, which is awaiting a bailout.
 The French employers' group Medef has published recommendations that include limiting golden parachutes, or negotiated exit payments for executives, and eliminating bonuses for managers who ''played a role in this disaster,'' according to Laurence Parisot, chief executive of Medef.
 Elsewhere in Europe, several banks have moved to limit rewards. BBVA, a Spanish bank, said Thursday that it would freeze the salaries of top executives, while Danske Bank in Copenhagen, said that it had canceled bonuses for its executive board.
 Germany also plans to ban bonuses and has set a 500,000 euro limit, about $641,000, on executive pay at rescued banks.
 In Switzerland, the government has proposed curbs on banking bonuses but no formal agreement has been reached.
 UBS, a Swiss bank that has received state help, has said that its chairman, Peter Kurer; its chief executive, Marcel Rohner; and other members of the executive board would receive only salaries for 2008 and that all other employees would get lower bonuses.
 Norwegian banking executives are taking action ahead of any government-imposed cap, promising to voluntarily freeze their salaries, while the Dutch government has taken steps to limit golden handshakes for executives leaving banking and insurance firms.
 In Britain, the Royal Bank of Scotland has become a test case for the new frugality. Last month, as Prime Minister Gordon Brown introduced the latest bailout of RBS, which increased the state's shareholding to 70 percent, he raged at the ''irresponsible risks'' of its bankers.
 Meantime, speculation has been building that RBS was preparing to pay generous bonuses when it announced 2008 results on Feb. 26.
 But Mr. Brown said Thursday that top executives at the bank had left without severance pay, while no bonuses were being paid to board members and no dividends to shareholders.
 Angela Knight, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, said that as the dust settled after the crisis, the public's attitude toward the sector should soften.
 ''Many banks, even in these turbulent times, are well run and profitable,'' Ms. Knight said. ''The serious problems experienced by some well-known High Street names are having an impact on how people see the industry as a whole but, as we work through the current worldwide economy challenges, the image of banks and bankers is likely to improve.''
 She cautioned on the need for ''proportionate and smart'' regulation of banks. ''We have always said bank pay is a matter for shareholders, and this is particularly the case for those banks where the U.K. government has a stake in the business,'' she said.
 At RBS, those executives who have survived the government-led culls are no longer finding the cosseted life they once had.
 Instead of casually plunking down the company credit card, RBS bankers now must get approval before entertaining clients, and must pick up their own bills for meals on business trips.
 For the moment, some European banks are trying new ideas to retain or attract talent, like deferring bonuses or offering stock options in parent companies.

HEADLINE: Panel to Advise Obama on Economy

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Saying that he wanted to leave no stone unturned in finding ways to put people back to work, President Obama on Friday appointed a team of outside economic advisers to offer suggestions on ways to respond to the nation's recession. 
 The White House Economic Recovery Advisory Board, led by a former Federal Reserve chairman, Paul Volcker, and modeled after the foreign intelligence board created by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, includes advisers from business, labor and academia.
 ''This new institution should send a signal of how seriously I take the responsibility of building an economic recovery that is broad and enduring,'' Mr. Obama said.
 The announcement came a few hours after the Labor Department reported that 598,000 jobs were lost in January and that the unemployment report rose to 7.6 percent. 
 While the president already has a large stable of economic advisers at his disposal, the new board is intended to provide advice from outside Washington. When Mr. Obama first discussed the board after his election last year, he said he wanted to find a way to bypass the ''echo chamber'' of the capital. 
 ''The board will bring a diverse set of perspectives and voices from different parts of the country and different sectors of the economy to bear in the formulation and evaluation of economic policy,'' the White House said on Friday morning. 
 The board also establishes Mr. Volcker as a key member of the president's economic team. He has long been an adviser, but his role in the opening weeks of the administration has been undefined.
 The group includes Jeffrey R. Immelt, chairman of the General Electric Company, and James W. Owens, the chairman of Caterpillar Inc., which announced last week the layoff of 20,000 jobs. William H. Donaldson , a former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, will also serve, along with Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the president of T.I.A.A.-CREF, and Martin S. Feldstein, a Harvard University professor, who was the chief economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan.
 The group includes two labor officials: Richard L. Trumka of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and Anna Burger of the Service Employees International Union. The board, which will meet for two years, will be guided by Austan D. Goolsbee, an economic adviser to the president.
 In his announcement, Mr. Obama urged Congress once again to pass his economic recovery package. He has spent much of the week hearing concerns from lawmakers, but said Thursday evening that the $800 billion range represented ''the scale that we need to deliver for the American people.''
 ''These Americans are counting on us,'' Mr. Obama said Friday. ''All of us in Washington must remember that we're here to work for the American people. And if we drag our feet and fail to act, this crisis will turn into a catastrophe.''

HEADLINE: Why Obama's Energy Savings Estimate May Be Skewed

BYLINE: By BERNIE BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When he ordered the Energy Department on Thursday to set new, mandatory efficiency standards for a variety of household appliances, President Obama projected how much electricity would be saved.
 ''We'll save through these simple steps over the next 30 years the amount of energy produced over a two-year period by all the coal-fired power plants in America,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 But two audits of a prominent 17-year-old program to conserve electricity used in consumer goods, a voluntary effort called Energy Star, have found that such estimates, however rosy, are not completely reliable.
 The Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department, which run the program as a way of encouraging more energy efficiency in furnaces, refrigerators, television sets, computers and so on, have said that Energy Star, whose distinctive logo appears on the labels of qualifying products, saved consumers more than $16 billion on utility bills in 2007 and $14 billion in 2006. 
 But according to the E.P.A.'s office of inspector general, which has released two reports on the program in the last 18 months, those estimates may be misleading, and safeguards to protect the integrity of Energy Star labels could be stronger.
 In December, the inspector general issued a report that said Energy Star's savings claims were ''not accurate or verifiable.'' The report found that shipment data for Energy Star products were not being adequately reviewed and in some cases were based on estimates instead of actual shipping totals. 
 In the other report, in August 2007, the inspector general addressed the integrity of the Energy Star label, noting that ''E.P.A. does not have reasonable assurance'' that the process allowing manufacturers to self-certify their products is effective. 
 Energy Star labels, which show comparative efficiency ratings, can be found on more than 50 kinds of products, and the program's supporters argue that it achieves real and significant conservation, even if exact numbers cannot be nailed down. 
 ''I would challenge people to revisit any product category and say Energy Star hasn't moved the market toward higher efficiency,'' said Noah D. Horowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
 Still, the question is whether the savings estimates are based on solid data, and the issues that inspire that question are not limited to those raised by the inspector general's reports.
 For example, the current estimate of hot water use per household -- 64.3 gallons a day -- was set more than two decades ago, when the composition of households was in many cases much different from today's.
 ''There's a very large uncertainty there,'' said Harvey M. Sachs, a senior fellow at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
 Kateri Callahan, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, said savings claims would be more reliable if Energy Star did its own testing. But that would be expensive.
 Congress is considering adding hundreds of millions of dollars for Energy Star and related programs in the economic stimulus package.

HEADLINE: Environmental Views, Past and Present LAND: The Balance Shifts

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
LAND
 The Balance Shifts
 No single agency was caught up in more scandals in the Bush administration than the Department of Interior. The deputy director was convicted of lying about his ties to the fallen lobbyist Jack Abramoff; another top official resigned after she was accused of running roughshod over agency scientists in endangered-species decisions; and a group of bureaucrats were found to have taken gifts from and engaged in sex and drug use with mining company officials they were supposed to be regulating. 
 But it was the department's management of public lands that received the most criticism from environmentalists. The department manages 500 million acres of public land, a fifth of the nation's surface area, and is responsible for oil and gas leasing, mineral development, forest management and fish and wildlife programs on all of those lands and offshore waters.
 The Bush administration, spurred by Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, set out to explore those lands and waters for resources and to roll back some of President Bill Clinton's environmental actions -- in particular, the rule, adopted in his final year in office, making nearly 60 million acres of national forest off limits to logging and other commercial uses.
 The Bush administration's effort to reopen most of that forest land, opposed in the courts and in Congress, ultimately failed, although it continued right up until Mr. Bush left office. 
 The administration moved to open to potential oil and gas drilling 2.6 million acres of federal land near Desolation Canyon in Utah that Mr. Clinton's interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, had designated as potential wilderness. It also sought to ease oil exploration in areas prized by conservationists, including Vermillion Basin in Colorado, the Jack Morrow Hills in Wyoming, Otero Mesa in New Mexico and 100 miles of the Rocky Mountain Front in northern Montana.
 Acting on the Cheney task force's recommendations, the Interior Department issued 6,000 new drilling permits in 2003-4, a single-year record.
 ''The push for energy went out as a mandate that overruled every other consideration, both offshore and on land,'' Mr. Babbitt said. ''It overrode the Endangered Species Act and virtually every other environmental consideration.''
 Yet the potential damage was limited by economic and political realities.
 In 2004, just before the presidential election, Mr. Bush announced he was shelving plans for drilling in many of those sensitive areas. And leases on tens of thousands of federal acres remain unclaimed because the oil and gas cannot be economically recovered.
 Ken Salazar, the new interior secretary, said his first priority would be to restore the department's political and scientific integrity. And while Mr. Salazar said that the law allowed ''responsible'' extraction of oil, gas and minerals from public lands, the balance had to shift back to preservation. 
 He said he was reviewing the Bush administration's leasing policies, as well as decisions involving endangered species and rules on disposal of waste from coal mines.
 ''We are putting together an inventory of all of those actions,'' Mr. Salazar said. ''Some we will reverse, some we will change and some we may keep.'' JOHN M. BRODER

HEADLINE: Playing With Fire

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
It was good to see the president, ordinarily so cool, so accommodating, exhibiting some real fire the other night. It seems to have done some good.
 With the economy in deep, deep trouble, and Americans suffering by the tens of millions, the Republicans spent much of the week doing their same-old, bad-faith Neanderthal two-step: trying their best to derail the economic stimulus package working its difficult way through Congress.
 ''This bill is stinking up the place,'' said Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina who not only opposed the legislation but wanted to make sure that no one would mistake him for a class act. 
 One of the goals of the package, of course, is to begin cleaning up the holy mess that resulted from the long, dark night of G.O.P. control in Washington. President Obama went out of his way to get a substantial number of Republicans to make a genuine effort to move the economic revitalization process along, but was rebuffed, and in some cases contemptuously.
 On Thursday night, he struck back, attacking Republican intransigence and its failed policies of the past. On Friday morning, with the government reporting that nearly 600,000 more jobs had been lost in January, the president went public again, stressing how irresponsible it would be to do nothing in the face of the growing crisis.
 Neither the job losses nor the president's prodding was enough to prompt much of a response from the Republicans. But by Friday evening, it appeared that a small number of G.O.P. senators, enough to assure Senate passage of a revised (and watered-down) stimulus package by a very slim margin, had come aboard.
 But only a small number. Even as the report of an agreement was being circulated, Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, was bad-mouthing the package on CNN. ''This bill is a disaster,'' he said.
 It's been clear for years that the G.O.P. is a party without a heart. But its pointless obstructionism, its overall lack of any serious response to what is a clear national economic emergency, seems to indicate it's also a party without a brain.
 Republicans in Washington have behaved like a milling crowd standing in the way of firefighters trying to respond to a devastating blaze. The best that can be said for the party is that a few senators seem to have been able part the crowd enough to let the rescuers begin to inch forward.
 President Obama addressed Republican inflexibility on Thursday night when he said at a gathering in Williamsburg, Va., ''Don't come to the table with the same tired arguments and worn ideas that helped to create this crisis.'' He added that without swift action on the stimulus bill, ''an economy that is already in crisis will be faced with catastrophe.''
 The report of January's enormous job losses came roughly a dozen hours later. It was the latest in a long and hideous pattern of employment woes, much of it resulting from the G.O.P.'s obsession with destructive supply-side economic voodoo. 
 On the front page of The Times on Friday was an article that said the number of women on the nation's payrolls is poised to pass that of men for the first time in American history. This is not because women have been doing so well, but because men have been doing so poorly. 
 As I was reading the article, I thought of all the guys who used to listen to Rush Limbaugh while driving to or from work but are now tuning in from their living rooms because the benefits of the G.O.P.'s right-wing, tax-cutting ideology never trickled down to them and they are now jobless.
 ''Since the start of the recession,'' as Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, points out, ''the U.S. economy has shed more jobs than the total population of Chicago.''
 The Republicans still don't get it. Most act as if they don't understand that in this radical economic downturn the demand for goods and services has fallen off a cliff, and that government spending is needed -- and needed quickly -- to replace a large portion of that lost demand.
 The goal is twofold: to alleviate some of the enormous suffering (something that is easily understood if you have a heart), and to revive the battered economy (equally easy to understand by anyone with a brain).
 Senator John McCain echoed many of his Republican colleagues on Friday when he indignantly asserted, ''This is not a stimulus bill; it is a spending bill.''
 It was an objection that had been addressed by an incredulous President Obama on Thursday night. ''What do you think a stimulus is?'' the president asked, his voice rising. Spending, he said -- to laughter from his audience -- ''is the whole point.''

HEADLINE: Environmental Views, Past and Present

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In his first weeks in office, President Obama has dismantled many environmental policies set by the Bush administration. But in some areas, he will be building on the work of his predecessor, rather than taking it apart. 
 Mr. Bush was not known for his concern over the environment. In the eight years of his tenure, he opened vast tracts of public lands to drilling, mining and timbering, earning the enmity of many environmentalists. His critics accused him of easing restrictions on polluters, subverting science and dragging his feet on global warming. 
 But even those who view his environmental record most harshly acknowledge that he also took significant action. He improved air quality, gave renewable energy a large financial boost, left behind the largest marine sanctuaries ever established and started a dialogue that could help lead to the next international treaty on climate change. 
 So far, Mr. Obama has devoted most of his attention to reversing Mr. Bush on a variety of issues. Within days of taking office, he froze a series of last-minute actions by the departing Bush team and ordered regulators to write tough new rules on automobile emissions and fuel economy.
 Earlier this week, he upended Bush administration policies on drilling in Utah and the operation of coal-fired power plants. But as Mr. Obama moves further, a bigger challenge may be to decide how much to preserve of the broad landscape left to him by Mr. Bush -- environmental and energy policies that encompass land, air, water, wildlife and climate.

HEADLINE: Furloughs Take Effect in California, Closing Many State Offices

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Rebecca Cathcart contributed reporting.

DATELINE: CULVER CITY, Calif. 

 BODY:
The drivers pulled into the lot of the Department of Motor Vehicles office here, momentarily stymied by the empty parking spaces, then sprinted through the drizzle toward the door, only to be met with one dispiriting word: Closed. 
 In the starkest example of the intensifying budget crisis befalling most states, more than 200,000 California state workers were ordered to stay home Friday, the first of the semimonthly work furloughs across state agencies intended to trim $1.3 billion from California's $143 billion budget. 
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ordered the unpaid days -- which were upheld last month by a county judge -- to be taken until June 2011. For most workers, for whom the furlough means a 9 percent cut in pay, the days off will be the first and third Fridays of each month. 
 About 15,600 employees who work for elected officials like the attorney general and the comptroller were exempted, though Mr. Schwarzenegger's aides have said they are mulling a lawsuit seeking to include those workers, along with the ones from the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Energy Commission, Food and Agriculture, and various social, mental health and accrediting agencies in the program. 
 ''It's very frustrating not being able to work,'' said Roland Becht, a field office worker for the motor vehicles agency in Chula Vista. ''I am going to have to decide what bills not to pay this month, and that's going to hurt my credit. I am 50 years old, and I am thinking of renting out a room to help pay my bills.''
 California appears to be the only state that has begun a significant worker furlough program, though at least four others are considering similar measures, said Scott D. Pattison, the executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers in Washington. ''It's not surprising,'' Mr. Pattison said, ''given what we have been expecting.'' 
 California has been crushed by the combination of a collapsed housing market, expansive government spending in recent years and the loss of a lucrative automobile tax ended by the governor when he came into office in 2003. The state's unemployment rate, 9.3 percent, is among the highest in the nation. 
 More than 20 states have unemployment rates above 7 percent, according to the latest figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which contributes to lower sales, property and personal income taxes for states and may lead to other furlough orders, Mr. Pattison said.
 Californians looking to renew driver's licenses, take tests for state jobs, file claims or seek many other services found themselves out of luck Friday. By early morning, about a dozen people stood on the sidewalk outside a Los Angeles high-rise where the Department of Industrial Relations is located. Five had planned to take an exam in an effort to register as garment workers. 
 ''Why this office?'' said Lisa Bacaro, 32, who had taken the morning off to take the exam. ''In hard times, why can't they close a different office? This is where people come for help with jobs. I am trying to take this test to start work, better work. I can't believe this.''
 The California Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, and Governor Schwarzenegger, a Republican, have repeatedly failed to come to an agreement over how to plug a $40 billion shortfall in the budget through mid-2010. Among other measures, Democrats and the governor are seeking an increase in the sales tax, which Republican lawmakers reject. California is one of the few states that require a two-thirds majority vote in the Legislature to raise taxes. 
 The state controller, John Chiang, a Democrat, joined labor unions in a lawsuit to prevent the governor from putting the furloughs into effect, arguing that he lacked the authority to do so. But Judge Patrick Marlette of Sacramento County Superior Court rejected that argument last month, calling California's fiscal situation an emergency and citing the governor's order as ''reasonable and necessary under the circumstances.'' Judge Marlette ruled that employees of statewide elected officials were exempt because they were not party to the lawsuit seeking to block the furloughs. 
 The forced work stoppages will most likely do little to ease voters' growing dissatisfaction with the governor and the Legislature, which last summer delivered the latest budget in the state's history, one that immediately had to be retooled in the face of falling revenues. 
 ''I'm really upset,'' said Monique Carter, who tried to renew her driver's license Friday, the day before her birthday. ''I think this guy is playing games, because he thinks Obama is going to give the state money and he's going to get his little percentage. I voted for him, and I am mad now.''

EMILIO FLORES FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) CHART: Weathering the Budget Crises: Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California ordered furloughs on Friday for more than 200,000 state employees, but the state is not alone in taking such moves. Deepening fiscal crises have forced many other states to take similar measures, according to a survey by the National Association of State Personnel Executives.

HEADLINE: In Inaugural Race, a Respite From Legal Acrimony

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand 

 BODY:
For a sport in need of reassuring scenes, the familiar water views provided by New Zealand's ''City of Sails'' seem like the ideal tonic.
 Just being here is a flashback to better times for the America's Cup and the global economy.
 Here, as before, are the ocean currents and sea breeze generating whitecaps on the Hauraki Gulf, with a fair-sized spectator fleet afloat. Here, as before, are the sailors and their public generating plenty of nocturnal energy in the watering holes and culinary hot spots of the Viaduct Basin.
 For the many who have had their fill of litigation, there is even the weird and wondrous sight of the antagonists, BMW Oracle Racing and Alinghi, sharing the same space on the racing and barbecue circuits. Weirder yet, they are sharing the same America's Cup yachts in this inaugural Louis Vuitton Pacific Series.
 The trouble is, with the Cup in its 19th month of legal limbo and more oral arguments scheduled for Tuesday in the New York State Court of Appeals, it feels rather like a mirage. 
 ''Look, Larry and Ernesto are going to court next week, and all the fun and games down here, and the happiness and shared beers, et cetera, is not going to change that fact,'' said Grant Dalton, the managing director of Emirates Team New Zealand.
 For now, Larry Ellison, the billionaire owner of BMW Oracle, is in Auckland and sailing with his team. Ernesto Bertarelli, the billionaire owner of Alinghi, is not expected to arrive until this weekend, if at all.
 Neither Ellison nor Bertarelli played a definitive role in the Pacific Series. Organized in just four months, it is the brainchild of Dalton and Bruno Trouble, a silver-haired Frenchman and former skipper who has long represented Louis Vuitton's stake in the gilded lily of the America's Cup. 
 Like Yves Carcelle, chairman and chief executive at Louis Vuitton, Trouble was frustrated at being relegated to the role of mere sponsor at the 2007 America's Cup in Valencia, Spain. In previous editions, Vuitton had been the organizational and financial impetus behind the challenger series. But for 2007, Bertarelli, whose team held the Cup, restructured the regatta to bring the challenger series and America's Cup match under the same management. ''We were just signing checks last time,'' he said. 
 Dalton, whose team depends on public good will and, to a degree, public financing, was eager to re-energize the base.
 ''We haven't lost the Kiwi public, but they don't know what's going on,'' he said. 
 To cut costs and promote close racing, the matches in Auckland are being conducted with similar, evenly matched pairs of yachts, an important change from the design differences that typically define Cup competition.
 Team New Zealand supplied its pair of boats from the last Cup. BMW Oracle then offered its pair, which Salvatore Sarno, the South African shipping magnate who owns Team Shosholoza, arranged to transport from Spain to New Zealand at a preferential rate.
 Economic forces whittled an initial pool of 17 serious candidates down to 10 teams, including Alinghi, which agreed to compete after Team New Zealand dropped its lawsuits against the Swiss team, Societe Nautique de Geneve, in New York.
 BMW Oracle, however, did not follow suit, continuing to dispute the legal right of a new Spanish yacht club, Club Nautico Espanol de Vela, to be Alinghi's challenger of record for the next Cup. Whatever bonhomie is in evidence here between the teams' sailors is not yet being reflected by the teams' lawyers.
 ''Obviously, this isn't the ideal situation we're in, and it's just good to get some racing going again,'' said Russell Coutts, the BMW Oracle skipper. ''The court case, that's coming up soon, and so it's going to get a result one way or the other, so I think that will be a good thing. Obviously, if we win, we want to negotiate a multi-challenger event.''
 Bertarelli has disputed that, accusing Ellison and Coutts of trying to find a backdoor approach to racing for the Cup instead of going through the rigors of a true challenger series before facing the defender. If BMW Oracle wins in court and negotiations with Alinghi break down again, there is still a chance the two teams will contest the Cup in a one-on-one match later this year in huge multi-hulls.
 BMW Oracle's trimaran, a 90-square-foot leviathan nicknamed Dogzilla, was launched last year, and the team has been training with it in San Diego. Although Alinghi has also been building a multi-hull, team officials confirmed that it had not yet been completed.
 ''Obviously, we're still getting ready for either eventuality,'' Coutts said. ''There are a lot of people who certainly want things settled, and we're definitely in that category.''
 With the court case unresolved, Alinghi has moved ahead with planning for an America's Cup in 2010, signing up 18 challengers -- all the significant teams from 2007 except BMW Oracle -- and agreeing on a revised set of rules as well as a new class of yachts in cooperation with other entered syndicates.
 With Club Nautico Espanol de Vela unable to pay for the trip to Auckland, the British challenger Team Origin has emerged as Alinghi's most significant ally.
 ''We really tried to sit on the fence and share blame between both teams,'' Mike Sanderson, Team Origin's team director, said. ''However, now that the new protocol is out and the new class rule is out, it is in our opinion an incredibly fair event and quite possibly the most fair America's Cup we've ever seen. It's definitely time to get on with it.''
 Dalton has read the protocol and calls it ''improved.'' But though Team New Zealand has signed on, he has deeply mixed emotions. ''It's as simple as this: Morally, we agree with Oracle; financially, we need to survive, and so we want a Cup.''
 The Pacific Series has brought the yachts back to Auckland, where the Cup was contested in 2000 and 2003. For those accustomed to the Cup's edginess, it is a refreshing change, with teams mingling easily.
 ''It's an easy event,'' Trouble said. ''We're not talking about money. Everyone is tired of lawyers. I was a lawyer for 10 years, and I'm tired of lawyers, too.''
 Two preliminary round robins will eventually lead to a challenger final in which one team will advance to face Team New Zealand on Feb. 13 and Feb. 14. Crowds and spectator fleets should be significant, even if the impact on Auckland's economy should be relatively small, at an estimated $7 million.
 Trouble is already talking about doing it again soon somewhere else, but the sailors are not confusing this pleasant, low-stress regatta in familiar waters with the main event.
 ''The sailors all get on really well, so there's no problem there,'' Sanderson said. ''But let's not be under any illusion: these teams are all here in the hope of an America's Cup. I'm sure Louis Vuitton would love to think this is standing on its own two feet, but we're all here because we're trying to get our foot in the door.''

HEADLINE: Entrenched Partisanship Proves a Worthy Foe

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With the Senate on track to pass its version of the economic stimulus legislation, President Obama is widely expected to win final Congressional approval of the plan soon, and thus make good on an assortment of his campaign promises. But in the process, he is confronting the impediments to his most ambitious pledge: to end the capital's partisan warfare.
 Mr. Obama has been frustrated by an array of forces, from an often bitter and personal history of partisanship on Capitol Hill to the near-extinction of Republican moderates in the House to the deep ideological gulf between the parties on economic policy. And as his aspiration of putting aside petty politics has met the necessity of winning legislative votes -- no more than two or three Senate Republicans are expected to support him, which is two or three more than did so in the House -- he has gone through a public evolution that has left him showing sharper edges when it comes to the ways of Washington. 
 Frustrated that debate over the bill was being dominated by Republicans' criticism, and that his overtures had yielded little in the way of support from across the aisle, the president who began the week hosting Republicans for a Super Bowl party had by Friday switched to publicly pressuring them, and rallying fellow Democrats, with a hard-line message about his unwillingness to compromise his priorities.
 Mr. Obama seized on Friday's worse-than-expected jobless numbers to criticize the Senate impasse as Republicans withheld the few votes he needs.
 ''It is inexcusable and irresponsible to get bogged down in distraction and delay while millions of Americans are being put out of work,'' he said. Americans, he added, did not want lawmakers ''to turn back to the same tried and failed approaches that were rejected in the last election.''
 His comments came on Day 3 of Mr. Obama's counteroffensive. As the Senate debated the package this week, he initially stayed above the fray, giving Republicans leeway to add tax breaks and hoping their support for the overall plan would follow. When it did not, he began speaking out on Wednesday, even as he privately kept reaching out to a few Republicans: including, unsuccessfully, Senator John McCain of Arizona. 
 White House aides say that Mr. Obama will continue reaching out, but that bipartisanship should not be measured simply by how many Republican votes the final product gets. The president is ''not alarmed'' by the dearth of Republican support so far, said Daniel H. Pfeiffer, the deputy White House communications director. ''There's a long process of building trust here.''
 That process inevitably raised questions of whether Mr. Obama's reaching out was more style than substance. He has hosted individual Republicans at the White House for cocktails and talks in the Oval Office, and last week made his first trip to the Capitol as president to meet with all House and Senate Republicans, overtures that won him points for style. 
 But the president made plain from the start that he would go only so far in altering an economic plan that embodies much of the agenda that helped get him elected. He told House Republicans, for example, that he would not back down from his proposal that a middle-class tax credit should also go to workers who earn too little to pay income taxes but who do pay payroll taxes. Most Republicans oppose that. 
 Mr. Obama has made some substantive concessions. He called for more tax cuts than many Democrats favored, and agreed to Republicans' proposals for others: adjusting the alternative minimum tax, letting ailing companies deduct current losses against past years' profits, giving a $15,000 tax credit to people who buy homes. He also pressed Congressional Democrats to delete some provisions after Republicans mocked them.
 ''His problem is not his administration. It is the institutional forces around here that have been built up over the years,'' Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said before Mr. Obama chose him to be commerce secretary.
 Those forces are several. First, while Mr. Obama is a relative novice to Washington, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have memories of partisan wars going back to Ronald Reagan's presidency. Partisan habits in Congress are hard to break, and perhaps impossible in the House given its makeup.
 Already, House Democrats are becoming increasingly grudging in their acquiescence toward Mr. Obama's outreach, underscoring the balancing act the president faces. He must make concessions to Republicans without angering Democrats not only in Congress but also among bloggers and grass-roots groups that worked so hard for his election.
 When not a single Republican voted for the House package last week, House Democrats basically told administration officials, ''I told you so.'' Both chambers have fewer of the centrist Republicans that typically cut deals, a consequence of Democrats' election gains in 2006 and 2008. In the Senate, many Republicans are recent House graduates, more ideologically conservative than the Republicans they replaced and schooled in the House's more confrontational ways.
 After eight years under President George W. Bush, six of them with Republicans in control of Congress, Democrats have pent-up demands for domestic spending that they believe the election validated. Republicans, for their part, interpreted their defeats as a sign that they were not conservative enough in opposing spending and pushing tax cuts.
 ''In the end, the Republicans will decide based on politics alone, and he might not get very far,'' Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, a Washington research group, said of Mr. Obama. ''But I think he's making a significant impression with the American public that he is following through on his promise to try and be as bipartisan as he can.''

HEADLINE: Pakistan Frees Nuclear Dealer In Snub to U.S.

BYLINE: By SALMAN MASOOD and DAVID E. SANGER; Salman Masood reported from Islamabad, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Jane Perlez contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
A Pakistani court freed one of the most successful nuclear proliferators in history, Abdul Qadeer Khan, from house arrest on Friday, lifting the restrictions imposed on him since 2004 when he publicly confessed to running an illicit nuclear network.
 Mr. Khan, 73, considered in the West as a rogue scientist and a pariah who sold technology to North Korea, Libya and Iran, is revered as a national hero in Pakistan for his role in transforming the country into a nuclear power. 
 The ruling to set him free seemed as much a political decision as a legal one, intended to shore up support for the government of President Asif Ali Zardari, which has been derided in the Pakistani press as being too close to the United States. The government has been under intense domestic pressure to free Mr. Khan, and that outweighed the backlash that Mr. Zardari knew the action would cause in Washington.
 Issued by a court of limited jurisdiction set up under the previous government, the decision came just days before the Obama administration's special enjoy to the region, Richard C. Holbrooke, was scheduled to visit Islamabad. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry said, ''The so-called A. Q. Khan affair is a closed chapter.'' 
 Mr. Khan, taking to reporters after the ruling, credited the new civilian government of Pakistan for arranging the deal that won his freedom and said ''I don't damn care'' about the international reaction to his release.
 In Washington, officials condemned the move. While it is almost inconceivable that Mr. Khan would again be actively involved in Pakistan's nuclear program, which has created an arsenal of roughly 100 weapons, there was broad concern that he could reactivate an international black-market network that was only partly dismantled. 
 ''He's still a proliferation threat,'' said Robert A. Wood, the spokesman for the State Department. ''We're very troubled by this.'' 
 President Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said the United States wanted assurances from Pakistan that the onetime metallurgist would never be able to sell nuclear expertise or equipment again. 
 But neither the State Department nor the White House would say whether Mr. Obama was prepared to reverse the Bush administration's position and demand that Pakistan allow international nuclear inspectors and the Central Intelligence Agency to interview Mr. Khan about his activities over the past 20 years.
 Those investigators, repeatedly rebuffed by Pakistani officials, who insisted on taking questions in writing and only selectively passing back answers from Mr. Khan, have many questions outstanding. Chief among them is whether he sold uranium enrichment equipment to other countries that he visited as he sold Pakistani nuclear technology from the late 1980s until his detention in early 2004. Of particular alarm is relatively new evidence that computers seized from his network had upward of three different designs for a nuclear weapon, some of Chinese origin and others with substantial modifications made by Pakistan for its own nuclear arsenal. 
 ''The key question,'' one senior Bush administration official said in an interview last year, ''is whether he gave one of his designs to the Iranians,'' a possibility that could significantly shorten the amount of time it would take Iran to produce a weapon.
 The ruling was accompanied by a secret agreement between Mr. Khan and the civilian government, the contents of which were not disclosed, which may continue to place restrictions on him. It was not entirely clear whether Mr. Khan would be free to leave the country. Nor was it clear how his new freedom would make Mr. Khan any more of a threat than his loose house arrest. 
 Washington's concerns were defiantly dismissed by Mr. Khan, who, beaming and smiling, was thronged by supporters and television cameras outside his residence in an affluent neighborhood upon news of his release. 
 ''Let them talk,'' he said. ''Are they happy with our God? Are they happy with our prophet? Are they happy with our leaders? Never, so why should we bother what they say about us?''
 Mr. Khan added, ''I would be more worried about what you say about me, not what Bush says or what Dick Cheney says.'' 
 Over the years, Pakistani officials have been concerned that Mr. Khan might implicate others -- in the civilian government, the military or the intelligence agencies -- as accomplices in the highly profitable network.
 But Mr. Khan also made clear that the decision would not have been made without the support of the Zardari government, with which the Obama administration hopes to build a more productive relationship as it seeks to fight the Taliban and Qaeda networks in Pakistan. ''All this happened because of the keen interest taken by the president, the prime minister and especially Rehman Malik, who has looked into the case, reviewed it, discussed it with the government, discussed it with the concerned authorities,'' Mr. Khan said. Mr. Malik is the senior official in the Pakistani Interior Ministry. 
 The lifting of restrictions served to pacify the powerful conservative lobby in Pakistan that wanted greater freedoms for Mr. Khan, according to Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani Army general. ''This has taken away pressure on the government,'' Mr. Masood said. 
 ''The government will go out of its way to assure the international community and the United States in particular that he will devote most of his time to education and do nothing on nuclear matters,'' Mr. Masood added. ''That's very important for Pakistan's credibility.'' 
 Other analysts agreed. ''A. Q. Khan's release is a good symbolic move that is likely to restore faith in the civilian government's bid to sustain its sovereignty,'' said Rafia Zakaria, a columnist for The Daily Times, a leading English newspaper in Pakistan. ''Something which is essential if Pakistanis are to believe that the war on terror is not just being fought at America's behest and is something in their own interest.''
 In the most recent investigations, the Khan network was found to have trafficked in a tested, compact and efficient bomb design that could significantly shorten the time needed to build a weapon and could be delivered by many existing missiles, like the Shahab-3 in Iran. But in the interviews with local television networks outside his residence, Mr. Khan said his 2004 confession to involvement in proliferation was a ''matter of the past.'' 
 The lawyer for Mr. Khan, Ali Zafar, said the court ruled that he was a ''free citizen'' entitled to fundamental rights. The decision, according to Mr. Zafar, said that Mr. Khan was not involved in criminal or proliferation activities and hence his confinement to house arrest was illegal. The former president, Pervez Musharraf, had pardoned Mr. Khan.
 The ruling also said that Mr. Khan would be given full protection by the state, the details of which were outlined in a secret document, Mr. Zafar said. Pakistani news reports said the implications of the agreement that prompted the court ruling were unclear.
 Mr. Masood said one of the reasons it was unlikely Mr. Khan would travel abroad was because of the threat of abduction by people who wanted his information. According to Pakistani press reports, under the court ruling Mr. Khan must give 48 hours' notice if he wants to leave Islamabad.
 The Zardari government had already eased some of the restrictions placed on Mr. Khan by the house arrest order of the Musharraf era. For example, he was allowed to eat at restaurants, and wrote newspaper articles. 
 Last month, the United States State Department announced sanctions on 13 people, including Mr. Khan, and three private companies that the United States said were involved in the Khan nuclear proliferation network.
 In its announcement, the State Department specified that Mr. Khan and his associates provided Iran and Libya with centrifuge components, designs and, in some cases, complete centrifuges. According to the statement, the United States also believed that Mr. Khan and his associates provided centrifuge designs, equipment and technology to North Korea, though the intelligence agencies have backed away from allegations several years ago that the North used those to build secret facilities.

HEADLINE: Underwater In a Big Way

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
It was, for a brief shining moment, the real estate deal of the century. 
 In 2007, Sam Zell, the billionaire Chicago investor, sold a portfolio of 573 properties he had assembled over three decades, Equity Office Properties Trust, to the Blackstone Group for $39 billion. It was the largest private equity deal in history, but Blackstone did not stop there: it immediately flipped hundreds of the buildings for $27 billion.
 Today, the wreckage of those purchases is strewn across the country, from Southern California to Austin, Tex., to Chicago to New York. Many of the 16 companies that bought Equity Office buildings are now stuck with punishing debt, properties whose values are plummeting and millions of feet of office space they cannot fill.
 Few deals better exemplify the excesses of the commercial real estate boom than the dismemberment of the Equity Office empire, and fewer still better underscore their bitter consequences. 
 Buyers purchased buildings at what, in retrospect, were vastly inflated prices. Lenders provided lavish, even excessive, financing based on unrealistic expectations of rising rents. And now that values are tumbling, vacancy rates are rising and credit has become impossibly tight, many on both sides are struggling against default, foreclosure or bankruptcy.
 The impact could ripple beyond the companies that bought Equity Office buildings and the investment banks that financed them. If the owners cannot make their loan payments, it could create a financial crisis for the pension funds, hedge funds and insurance companies that hold securities based on Equity Office mortgages.
 The list of Equity Office buyers reads like a Who's Who in American real estate. In Stamford, Conn., RFR Properties, a partnership headed by Michael Fuchs and Aby Rosen, who owns Manhattan landmarks like Lever House and the Seagram Building, spent $850 million to buy seven Equity Office buildings that analysts say are now worth less than their mortgages. 
 In Los Angeles, the founder of Maguire Properties, one of the largest commercial landlords in Southern California, was forced to step down last year as the company struggled with crushing debt from buying 24 Equity Office buildings. 
 And in New York, the real estate mogul Harry B. Macklowe lost seven Equity Office towers he bought from Blackstone, along with much of his empire, after he was unable to refinance the $7 billion in short-term, high-interest debt he used to buy them.
 ''Those who bought from Blackstone have not fared well at all,'' said Michael Knott, a real estate analyst at Green Street Advisors. ''Blackstone was a huge winner at the time, although the value of what they still hold has fallen probably 20 percent.''
 Mr. Zell, who became chairman and chief executive of the Tribune Company after selling Equity Office, amassed his supersize real estate portfolio over many years. But the deal to sell the properties to Blackstone, the big private equity firm run by Stephen A. Schwarzman, occurred with lightning speed and what one executive who participated in the transaction called, ''short-form due diligence.''
 Blackstone's purchase of Equity Office in February 2007 began a series of other record-breaking deals in Stamford; San Francisco; Portland, Ore.; Orange County, Calif., and Chicago, as Blackstone quickly sold about 70 percent of the portfolio to 16 other companies. The company still owns 105 Equity Office properties.
 ''These were aggressive acquisitions under the best of circumstances,'' said Paul E. Adornato, a senior real estate analyst at BMO Capital Markets. 
 The buyers found lenders only too willing to finance as much as 90 percent or more of the purchase price, even as profit margins shrank, on a bet that rents and values would continue to rise. The investment banks, including Morgan Stanley, Wachovia, Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, in turn collected their fees as they packaged the loans as securities and sold them to investors. 
 ''It certainly defined a period of time where debt was readily available in large quantities at low prices,'' said Robert S. Underhill, who heads the capital transaction group at Shorenstein Properties L.L.C. 
 Not everyone who bought Equity Office buildings is in dire shape. 
 After looking at Blackstone's Equity Office portfolio in many cities, Shorenstein settled on Portland, where it bought 46 buildings for $1.1 billion. It was the one place where price, initial returns and potential for growth made the most sense, Mr. Underhill said. 
 But elsewhere, problems with Equity Office properties have spread like a virus, weakening and even paralyzing major real estate developers. 
 In Stamford, the crisis on Wall Street and the consolidation of financial services has weakened the market, undermining the RFR Properties' effort to raise rents at its seven Equity Office buildings by 15 percent. The purchase price of $850 million, roughly $515 a square foot, was close to a record for Stamford.
 RFR's Equity Office buildings are now worth less than its mortgages, said Dan Fasulo, a managing director of Real Capital Analytics, a real estate research firm. But the company has not defaulted on its loans.
 ''Some of the rents they projected won't come to fruition for many years,'' Mr. Fasulo said.
 RFR Properties did not return calls seeking comment.
 The market has declined drastically in Chicago as well, and the vacancy rate is climbing at some Equity Office buildings owned by the real estate giant Tishman Speyer, brokers say. The company, which controls Rockefeller Center and properties in China, India and Brazil, bought six Equity Office buildings in Chicago for $1.7 billion. The company almost immediately tried to sell three of its new buildings, but received acceptable offers for only one, which sold for $145 million in 2007. Tishman declined to comment. 
 In New York, Mr. Macklowe made a characteristically aggressive gamble when he bought seven Midtown buildings from Blackstone for more than $6 billion, doubling the size of his real estate empire. He put down a mere $50 million, while lining up $7 billion in short-term financing from Deutsche Bank and the Fortress Investment Group for the acquisition.
 But after the rollicking real estate boom came to an end, Mr. Macklowe was unable to get permanent financing. He narrowly avoided personal bankruptcy and was forced to turn over the seven towers and other properties, including his jewel, the General Motors building, to lenders.
 Deutsche Bank recently sold two of the Macklowe buildings in New York to Shorenstein Properties for an average of $818 a square foot, or 25 percent less than the $1,100 a square foot that Mr. Macklowe paid. Real estate brokers say two other buildings from that portfolio will probably sell for a discount of at least 60 percent.
 Mr. Macklowe's company, Macklowe Properties, declined to comment.
 In Los Angeles, Maguire Properties was already laboring under heavy debts when the company paid Blackstone $2.87 billion for 24 buildings, 22 of them in Orange County, the center of the subprime mortgage industry. From the beginning, the loan payments for the Equity Office buildings exceeded the monthly revenue from the properties, according to the company's regulatory filings.
 The company's vow to raise rents by 25 percent at its newly acquired buildings dissolved quickly as the vacancy rate in Orange County swelled to 16 percent, from 7 percent in 2006, making it harder to make mortgage payments. Maguire sold a number of its Equity Office buildings, some at a loss, and the board forced its chairman and founder, Robert F. Maguire III, to step down.
 ''It was the straw that broke the camel's back in terms of what it did for their operating results and their balance sheet,'' said Mr. Knott of Green Street Advisors.
 In Austin, when the Thomas Properties Group formed a partnership with the California teachers' pension fund and Lehman Brothers, which was also a lender in the deal, to buy 10 Equity Office buildings downtown and in the surrounding suburbs for $1.15 billion, it instantly became the biggest commercial landlord in town. 
 Like many of the other deals, it was highly leveraged and dependent on rising rents. The problem is that rents are now declining in Austin, particularly in suburban areas, where vacancy rates have climbed to 14.4 percent as several new buildings are coming on line without tenants.
 In November, Thomas filed a motion in the Lehman bankruptcy case saying it would ''run out of cash'' in January. On behalf of the partnership, Thomas asked the court to compel Lehman to make good on its commitment to provide a $100 million revolving loan, or allow the partnership to raise new financing elsewhere. The money, it said, was to lease, maintain and market the buildings. 
 Without additional financing, the motion said, there could be a series of defaults ''leading to the threat of foreclosures and bankruptcy.'' 
 The motion has been postponed, but the partnership did make an $18 million property tax payment that was due last month in Austin ''in cooperation'' with Lehman. The partnership is still facing significant liquidity problems.
 ''They're going to face a difficult road because the buildings in the suburbs are getting more and more vacant,'' said Volney Campbell, co-managing partner of HPI Corporate Services in Austin, a real estate company. 
 ''It was the largest single transaction that's ever occurred in Austin. Considering where we are now, it will stay that way for a while.''

HEADLINE: Environmental Views, Past and Present

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER, ANDREW C. REVKIN, FELICITY BARRINGER and CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
 WASHINGTON -- In his first weeks in office, President Obama has dismantled many environmental policies set by the Bush administration. But in some areas, he will be building on the work of his predecessor, rather than taking it apart.
 Mr. Bush was not known for his concern over the environment. In the eight years of his tenure, he opened vast tracts of public lands to drilling, mining and timbering, earning the enmity of many environmentalists. His critics accused him of easing restrictions on polluters, subverting science and dragging his feet on global warming. 
 But even those who view his environmental record most harshly acknowledge that he also took significant action. He improved air quality, gave renewable energy a large financial boost, left behind the largest marine sanctuaries ever established and started a dialogue that could help lead to the next international treaty on climate change. 
 So far, Mr. Obama has devoted most of his attention to reversing Mr. Bush on a variety of issues. Within days of taking office, he froze a series of last-minute actions by the departing Bush team and ordered regulators to write tough new rules on automobile emissions and fuel economy. 
 Earlier this week, he upended Bush administration policies on drilling in Utah and the operation of coal-fired power plants. But as Mr. Obama moves further, a bigger challenge may be to decide how much to preserve of the broad landscape left to him by Mr. Bush -- environmental and energy policies that encompass land, air, water, wildlife and climate.
 JOHN M. BRODER 
 CLIMATE
 The Legacy of Kyoto
 The public view of Mr. Bush's record on global warming was largely set by his blunt rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, his swift abandonment of his campaign pledge to restrict some greenhouse gases and the disclosures of interference by presidential appointees with government climate scientists. 
 But now, with many adherents of the Kyoto climate pact struggling to meet its targets, some climate policy experts say that, in efforts to draw up a new treaty, Mr. Bush may have left useful groundwork behind. 
 Particularly useful were meetings late in Mr. Bush's tenure that brought together a group of rich and poor nations responsible for 80 percent of the human output of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide.
 The idea was to devise partnerships within sectors like transportation and steel-making that could curb gas releases without the complexity of negotiating among nearly 200 countries in the climate-treaty talks.
 Eileen Claussen, the president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the meetings helped frame some steps China could take that might satisfy senators worried about jobs flowing to Asia under a flawed climate deal. 
 Measurable action by China is vital if Mr. Obama is to gain Senate approval for any climate treaty resulting from international talks culminating in December in Copenhagen. China has so far resisted mandatory limits on emissions and is building new coal-fired power plants at a rapid pace. 
 Over all, Ms. Claussen said, Mr. Bush's climate legacy is mainly one of delay and lost opportunities. 
 Through most of his presidency, Mr. Bush largely framed his approach to global warming around two talking points: the uncertainties in forecasts of a dangerously human-heated world and the certainty that economic harm would come from mandatory cuts in emissions of heat-trapping gases. 
 A result was a series of mainly voluntary climate and energy initiatives intended to slow the release of such gases, with no commitment to binding reductions at home or abroad.
 Mr. Obama has taken precisely the opposite tack. He spoke late last month of the specter of ''violent conflict, terrible storms, shrinking coastlines'' and other perils from unchecked warming, while pressing his vision of prosperity rebuilt around clean cars and pollution-free power from the wind and sun. 
 Many analysts say that Mr. Obama must navigate among an array of campaigners, lobbyists and lawmakers with particular interests -- from dependency on coal to aversion to power lines or nuclear plants. But if he makes too many political compromises, he may find that his plan fails on environmental grounds. 
 ''That is why he must educate a public grappling with uncertain science and a grinding recession that work on long-term energy and climate security cannot be deferred until better times,'' said Kimberly Thompson, who teaches risk management at Harvard.
 Aides to Mr. Bush who dealt with the environment and energy insist that they left plenty for Mr. Obama to build on, including greatly increased financing for nonpolluting energy sources and a 30 percent increase in energy-efficiency standards for government buildings.
 James L. Connaughton, the former chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, blamed environmentalists, as well as Congress, for some of the lack of progress on new energy options. 
 Congress failed to provide adequate financing for new power lines to distribute electricity from alternative energy sources, Mr. Connaughton said. And many environmental groups, he added, spoke of concerns about global warming but never dropped their opposition to nuclear power, a carbon-free source of electricity. ANDREW C. REVKIN 
 AIR
 New Direction on Pollution
 The Bush administration's signature efforts to control air pollution revolved around the tiniest and deadliest of pollutants: the fine particles linked to death from pulmonary and cardiac disease. Mr. Bush's actions achieved marked improvement in air quality but fell short of what scientists, and in some cases the courts, demanded. This leaves the Obama administration two options for reducing the number of people exposed to unhealthy amounts of fine particles or other pollutants.
 It can step up the enforcement of existing law -- the administration signaled earlier this week that it would forcefully pursue power plants that skimp on required pollution controls -- or it can focus on reviewing and revising policy. Or both.
 Another sign of the new direction came Friday when the Environmental Protection Agency accepted a judicial demand to regulate mercury emissions from power plants. Power-plant regulation will be central to any new policy.
 Bush administration officials say regulation of diesel engines and other pollution rules prolonged thousands of lives. ''America is going to have the most consequential set of clean-air requirements, on a generational scale,'' said Mr. Connaughton, the former environmental quality chairman.
 Michael Wara, a Stanford law professor and an expert on the Clean Air Act, agreed that the Bush administration ''did some good.'' But, Mr. Wara added, it was '' the least amount that they could, given the scientific realities.''
 A two-front strategy emerged. Diesel-engine pollution was attacked aggressively through controls on engines and new mandates for the fuel itself, to cheers from environmentalists. Power-plant controls, however, became the source of increasing hostility, and eventually lawsuits, between environmentalists and the Bush administration. 
 It was not that the Bush administration took no action. Its diesel controls and its 2005 rule intended to cut major power-plant pollutants 70 percent through the Eastern United States, in principle, did as much to reduce pollution and improve health as all but three previous rules in American history.
 But other accommodations letting old, heavily polluting coal-fired plants expand rather than shut down infuriated environmental groups. They came to believe that the 2005 power-plant rule that did make significant pollution cuts served another purpose: to forestall any additional cleanup requirements as long as Mr. Bush was in office.
 That implicit imperative seemed evident in fall 2006 when the environmental agency ignored its scientists and refused to tighten the national standard for chronic exposure to ultrafine particles, passing up the chance to avoid what scientists said would be thousands of premature deaths. 
 Environmental groups took to the courts. The administration's legal defeats piled up. The biggest blow came in July when federal judges threw out the 2005 power-plant rule, challenged this time by some in the industry.
 The Obama administration must now decide what can be salvaged and forge a new approach to enforcing the Clean Air Act. FELICITY BARRINGER
 WATER
 A Change in Tone
 When Mr. Bush designated as national monuments almost 400,000 square miles of ocean, reefs, atolls, seamounts and surrounding waters, Elliott Norse, president of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute, called his action ''statesmanlike.''
 The monuments, set aside in 2006 and 2008, are home to thousands of species of rare plants, birds and fish. But perhaps their most important characteristic is that they contain few exploitable resources and just about nobody lives there, so there were no major political or commercial objections. 
 ''Part of the calculus for us was to do something really important that needed to be done that would hurt the fewest number of people,'' Dr. Norse said. 
 Mr. Obama will face water-related issues that are far more complex, contentious and costly, in terms of money and political capital.
 He will confront disputes over water rights, especially in the West; estuary preservation and coastal erosion; and a host of issues relating to oceans, including limits on fishing, offshore wind power and the country's place in international marine regulation.
 Shortages of fresh water, which already plague California and the Southwest, are expected to worsen as the climate warms, forcing new consideration of the equity of water distribution programs, some of which were negotiated a century ago in what is now believed to have been an unusual wet spell.
 Offshore issues are focusing new attention on the lack of regulations for the use of federal waters. Perhaps the knottiest issue for Mr. Obama personally is the Cape Wind proposal for an enormous wind power installation off the south coast of Cape Cod, Mass. 
 Though he has not spoken about this plan, Mr. Obama has been an enthusiastic backer of wind power. But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, an early political ally of the new president, opposes the plan.
 As Arctic sea ice recedes, signatories to the Law of the Sea, a United Nations convention, are considering new rules for shipping, fishing and oil exploration there. They are also mulling expanding territorial claims to undersea continental shelves, an issue of potentially great importance to the United States. Mr. Bush supported the treaty, as did the Pentagon, but he never persuaded enough fellow Republicans to agree. 
 Steve Murawski, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said he was heartened to hear Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton support the treaty in her confirmation hearing. And he said he was glad Mr. Obama designated ''a practicing marine biologist,'' Jane Lubchenco, to run the administration. ''I think the tone will change significantly,'' Dr. Murawski said.

 LAND
 The Balance Shifts
 No single agency was caught up in more scandals in the Bush administration than the Department of Interior. The deputy director was convicted of lying about his ties to the fallen lobbyist Jack Abramoff; another top official resigned after she was accused of running roughshod over agency scientists in endangered-species decisions; and a group of bureaucrats were found to have taken gifts from and engaged in sex and drug use with mining company officials they were supposed to be regulating.
 But it was the department's management of public lands that received the most criticism from environmentalists. The department manages 500 million acres of public land, a fifth of the nation's surface area, and is responsible for oil and gas leasing, mineral development, forest management and fish and wildlife programs on all of those lands and offshore waters.
 The Bush administration, spurred by Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, set out to explore those lands and waters for resources and to roll back some of President Bill Clinton's environmental actions -- in particular, the rule, adopted in his final year in office, making nearly 60 million acres of national forest off limits to logging and other commercial uses.
 The Bush administration's effort to reopen most of that forest land, opposed in the courts and in Congress, ultimately failed, although it continued right up until Mr. Bush left office. 
 The administration moved to open to potential oil and gas drilling 2.6 million acres of federal land near Desolation Canyon in Utah that Mr. Clinton's interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, had designated as potential wilderness. It also sought to ease oil exploration in areas prized by conservationists, including Vermillion Basin in Colorado, the Jack Morrow Hills in Wyoming, Otero Mesa in New Mexico and 100 miles of the Rocky Mountain Front in northern Montana.
 Acting on the Cheney task force's recommendations, the Interior Department issued 6,000 new drilling permits in 2003-4, a single-year record.
 ''The push for energy went out as a mandate that overruled every other consideration, both offshore and on land,'' Mr. Babbitt said. ''It overrode the Endangered Species Act and virtually every other environmental consideration.''
 Yet the potential damage was limited by economic and political realities.
 In 2004, just before the presidential election, Mr. Bush announced he was shelving plans for drilling in many of those sensitive areas. And leases on tens of thousands of federal acres remain unclaimed because the oil and gas cannot be economically recovered.
 Ken Salazar, the new interior secretary, said his first priority would be to restore the department's political and scientific integrity. And while Mr. Salazar said that the law allowed ''responsible'' extraction of oil, gas and minerals from public lands, the balance had to shift back to preservation. 
 He said he was reviewing the Bush administration's leasing policies, as well as decisions involving endangered species and rules on disposal of waste from coal mines.
 ''We are putting together an inventory of all of those actions,'' Mr. Salazar said. ''Some we will reverse, some we will change and some we may keep.'' JOHN M. BRODER

HEADLINE: Small Businesses Critical of Stimulus Bills

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
As a huge stimulus package wends its way toward President Obama's desk, business owners say that all they really want is cash in the tills to be able to survive and then help propel the economy out of recession. 
 The $819 billion bill passed by the House last week and a similar measure under consideration in the Senate simply do not go far enough to bolster the small-business sector, owners and those who lobby on their behalf say. ''Small businesses are a job engine for the economy,'' said David French, vice president for government relations at the International Franchise Association. ''Unfortunately,'' he said, the stimulus package offers ''a thimble-full of fuel for this engine.'' 
 By his estimation, only 0.05 percent of the House bill is dedicated to small-business lending programs, and the Senate version is only slightly better. ''It's not a lot of money relative to the scale of the credit market problems,'' Mr. French said.
 Sure, said Victoria Braden, chief executive of Braden Benefits Strategies in Atlanta, some provisions like extending tax credits and accelerated depreciation from last year's assistance package will help. ''But it's not enough to stimulate the kind of growth we need,'' she said.
 Her company, which provides employee benefit assistance to companies with 20 to 300 employees, is reeling from its clients' mass layoffs in early January, she said. ''We still don't know how much income we lost.''
 Job creation is a hot-button topic for the stimulus package. In January, employment among businesses with fewer than 50 workers declined 175,000, the third consecutive monthly decline, according to the ADP Small Business Report released Wednesday. Businesses with fewer than 500 employees lost 430,000 jobs in the month, ADP said, indicating that the recession was hitting the sector hard.
 Companies like MCM Composites in Manitowoc, Wis., a maker of composite molding parts for military contractors and aerospace companies as well as houseware and cookware manufacturers, have drastically reduced operations.
 This month, said Michael J. Fredrich, the owner, there are only enough orders to keep operations running two- to two-and-a-half days a week. ''That's it. That's all we can do.''
 What is not included in the stimulus plan, but could help, is a reduction of the highest tax rate, Mr. Fredrich said. Many owners pay income tax at the personal level, as he does, so it would be money in their pockets to reinvest. 
 ''That would have an immediate effect,'' Mr. Fredrich said, as would a payroll tax holiday, which is also not included.
 Terry McGill, who owns a commercial and industrial painting operation in Omaha, would welcome a six-month payroll tax holiday, something advocated by the National Federation of Independent Business. Mr. McGill said his remaining 30 employees -- down from 60 -- would have extra money in their pockets each week to spend. 
 If the amount equaled 6 percent of a payroll, and a worker made $500 a week, for example, that's $30 more. ''That doesn't sound like much,'' he said, ''but that's $1,560 a year, that's without including any overtime.''
 ''I just think it's a real fair way to do things,'' Mr. McGill added. ''It wouldn't be money hidden away; it wouldn't be a lump sum. If you had 30 bucks more a week, it might be your gas for the week, but as a stimulus, it would get spent. I would certainly spend it, both at home and in my business.''
 To put it in perspective, he said, the profit margin in his industry runs 3.5 percent to 7 percent. ''You're really talking about a break that would exceed what we would consider a good year,'' Mr. McGill said. ''Boy, would that make life better.''
 Meanwhile, banks are still not extending credit readily, eliminating a vital cash outlet for businesses.
 The Federal Reserve's quarterly report on bank lending, issued on Monday, found that the number of banks that tightened their lending policies on all major loan categories over the previous three months ''stayed very elevated.'' 
 The current climate has made owners even more pessimistic than they were last fall, according to the Small Business Research Board in Buffalo Grove, Ill., which is finishing up its latest confidence survey. 
 What is needed is access to capital, said Gregg Steinberg, president of the board. Not only has lending ceased, but the value of business owners' homes is falling, meaning owners cannot tap into home equity for their businesses.
 Mr. Steinberg is advocating that the stimulus bill include an emergency lending vehicle similar to the disaster relief loan program after Hurricane Katrina.
 Local banks could provide the loans with government backing and built-in technical expertise, he suggested, to ensure the program was efficient and effective. 
 Paul G. Merski, chief economist at the Independent Bankers Association, said that the House and Senate had tried to address inadequate lending in their bills. On the appropriation side, the House allocated $500 million to the Small Business Administration's guaranteed loan program to decrease or eliminate fees. The Senate version bumps that up to $615 million. 
 The provision, coupled with a two-year increase in the guaranteed level of loans to 95 percent, from 75 percent to 85 percent, would ''kick-start'' lending, Mr. Merski said.
 The ripple effect could be far and wide, he said. Community banks, which represent about 12 percent of all bank assets, but make 20 percent of all small-business loans and about half of the loans that are less than $100,000, would churn out new loans to small businesses and franchises. Those companies in turn could buy equipment and hire back employees, who could then spend more money as consumers.
 While President Obama wants Congress to move quickly, Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, said more time should be spent examining other ideas. ''I think more than expediency,'' she said, ''it has to be a good bill.'' 
 ''If small-business owners are to shoulder the responsibility for getting our nation back on sound economic footing,'' Ms. Kerrigan said, ''they need something from this package that will encourage them to invest, hire and prepare for growth.''

HEADLINE: This Deal May Need Dissolving

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Last summer, the Dow Chemical Company won a heated auction for a well-run, highly valued specialty chemical company called Rohm & Haas. In agreeing to acquire this Philadelphia-based company, Dow beat out its chief rival in the chemical industry, BASF of Germany. The price it agreed to pay was high: $78 a share in cash, a 74 percent premium, for a total of about $15.3 billion.
 As it was described to me this week by David Bernick, a lawyer at Kirkland & Ellis who is Dow Chemical's chief outside counsel, the deal was part of a two-pronged strategy by Dow Chemical's board and management to reconfigure the company. At the same time it was cutting the deal for Rohm & Haas, it was also entering into a joint venture agreement with the Kuwaiti government that would put more than $9 billion into Dow Chemical's coffers. The new venture was called K-Dow Petrochemicals, or K-Dow for short. The idea was to ''monetize'' Dow Chemical's traditional commodity chemical business, while moving more aggressively into higher-margin, higher-profit specialty chemicals. The idea was also to use some of that $9 billion to help pay for the Rohm & Haas acquisition. 
 Dale Oesterle, a law professor at Ohio State University who writes a business law blog, has described the deal struck by Rohm & Haas and Dow Chemical as a ''very seller-biased contract.'' And why wouldn't it be? When a long-admired company puts itself up for auction, it is going to hold most of the cards. To land Rohm & Haas, Dow Chemical agreed to terms that made it nearly impossible to back out if anything went wrong. 
 The deal was not contingent on financing, for instance -- not that Dow Chemical was worried about financing because it had the Kuwaitis in its back pocket. It couldn't back out if the deal threatened its investment-grade credit rating. It was not dependent on the stock price. Indeed, it included something called a ''specific performance'' clause. That meant that if Dow Chemical tried to back out, Rohm & Haas could go to court and insist that the deal be completed, at $78 a share, as specified in the contract. Monetary damages was not an adequate remedy. 
 Even if you haven't been following this deal closely, you can probably figure out what happened next. In September, Lehman Brothers defaulted, setting off a global financial collapse. The Kuwaiti stock market started to fall as tumbling oil prices sent fear through all the oil-producing economies. In November, the Kuwaitis brought Dow Chemical back to the negotiating table and revised the deal downward -- now Dow Chemical would receive $7.5 billion in cash from the joint venture. And just a month after that -- three days after Christmas, and despite having signed a pretty ironclad contract itself -- the Kuwaitis stunned Dow Chemical by backing out entirely.
 Meanwhile, the chemical business was falling off a cliff. In announcing the company's earnings on Tuesday, Andrew Liveris, Dow Chemical's chief executive, called the fourth quarter ''something none of us have ever experienced.'' Revenue dropped 23 percent, and the company went from a third-quarter profit of 46 cents a share to a fourth-quarter loss of $1.68 a share. Not surprisingly, Mr. Liveris also said he didn't expect things to get better anytime soon.
 And what of the Rohm & Haas acquisition? A few weeks ago, with the deadline just days away, Dow Chemical informed Rohm & Haas that it needed to delay the deal, at least until June. Although Mr. Liveris insisted in a news release that the Rohm & Haas acquisition was still ''consistent'' with the company's strategy, he conceded that Dow Chemical's ability to finance the deal had been hurt by the pullout of the Kuwaitis. 
 Dow Chemical feared that if it went ahead with the $15.3 billion deal -- using a bridge loan that had to be paid off in a year -- the combined entity could be badly damaged, saddled with high-priced debt in a horrible business environment, and a junk bond credit rating. Mr. Bernick said it could resemble one of those highly leveraged private equity deals that were done during the bull market of a few years ago, which are now struggling under the weight of their immense debt.
 How did Rohm & Haas react to this bad news? It sued for ''specific performance,'' demanding that Dow Chemical complete the deal it had agreed to. After all, Rohm & Haas noted in a statement, it had a duty ''to protect its shareholders' interests.'' As it happens, its biggest shareholder is the trust for the Haas family, which owns nearly a quarter of the stock. As for what the combined company would look like after the Haas trust and the other Rohm & Haas shareholders got their money, well, that really wouldn't be their problem anymore, would it?
 To utter something along these lines -- that maybe, just maybe, deals that stop making sense ought to be called off, or at least rejiggered, especially in the middle of a once-in-a-lifetime financial crisis -- invites withering scorn, especially if you say it to someone on Wall Street or in the legal profession. Almost everybody I spoke to for this column thought Dow Chemical didn't have much of a leg to stand on legally. What's more, very few of them thought the company deserved much sympathy. 
 ''They agreed to this deal in July when everybody knew it was crazy not to have a financing out,'' said Steven M. Davidoff, a law professor at the University of Connecticut who has written about the case for The New York Times's DealBook blog in his Deal Professor column. ''The deal is going to hurt Dow because they made a bad deal. But we live in a society where people honor their deals. If I have a house in Michigan that I can't sell now, does that mean I can stop paying my mortgage?''
 Michael Judd, a chemical industry analyst with Greenwich Consultants, was only slightly more sympathetic. ''Dow Chemical is a great company with a great history,'' he said. ''It is a sad thing that Dow is in this situation, but that's the way it is. I think they are ultimately going to be forced to close this transaction. It is a very clear case. It is a contract, and all of the requirements of the contract have been met.''
 All over Wall Street, that's what you hear: a deal is a deal. Tough luck, Dow Chemical. You agreed to a lopsided contract just as we were entering a recession, and now you have to pay the price. Just this Thursday, Rohm & Haas's second largest shareholder, the hedge fund manager John Paulson -- yes, the same John Paulson who made $3 billion in 2007 by betting against subprime mortgages -- sent a letter to Mr. Liveris essentially telling him to stop whining and suck it up. 
 ''Current conditions do not have any effect on your obligation to purchase Rohm & Haas,'' he wrote, and then outlined steps he thought the company should take, including cutting the dividend to a penny, issuing new debt and making an additional stock offering to raise capital. Then again, Mr. Paulson, as a Rohm & Haas shareholder, doesn't have much reason to care what happens once the deal is completed, either. He'll have pocketed his profits and moved on to the next profit opportunity. You don't get to make $3 billion in a year by worrying about other people's problems.
 But shouldn't somebody be worrying about those problems? Dow Chemical employs around 45,000 people; Rohm & Haas employs more than 15,000. The American chemical industry -- which was suffering even before the financial crisis because of the rise of commodity chemical companies in China and elsewhere -- is going to be in a bad place for the foreseeable future. At a time when every job matters, and when the economy is holding on for dear life, does it really make sense that ''shareholder value'' should be the only value that counts? Many of the current shareholders are merger arbitrageurs, who dive into pending deals and bet on their outcome. I hear they're passing around a new joke: ''What is Liveris spelled backwards? Sir Evil.'' That really makes you root for them, doesn't it?
 Howard Ungerleider, Dow Chemical's head of investor relations, said, ''Dow feels there is an overarching obligation to act in the best interest of the combined entity.'' If the deal went through right now, billions of dollars of value would probably be destroyed, especially with the chemical industry in such a wounded state. Yes, the company could take the advice of Mr. Paulson and other shareholder-critics. It could kill the dividend, sell off prized divisions (at fire-sale prices) and raise new equity at the current depressed share price (which also dilutes current shareholders), but those moves destroy value as well. It also threatens the loss of more jobs, and the combined company will struggle for the foreseeable future with its debt burden. 
 As for those comparisons between Dow Chemical and America's struggling homeowners, they wound up striking me as pretty apt. After all, high on the agenda of the new administration is the goal of mitigating foreclosures. Without question, that is going to mean that lots of homeowners -- many of whom struck deals that subsequently became untenable -- are going to get to evade their contractual obligations and get new mortgages with easier terms. Sometimes, the climate really does demand the rules of the game be changed, at least temporarily.
 Even so, Dow Chemical's chances of stopping this deal are not terribly high. The trial, which is scheduled for next month, is taking place in Delaware, and ''Delaware law has been built on the idea that the only thing that counts is the shareholders,'' said Lawrence A. Hamermesh, a professor at Widener's Institute of Delaware Corporate Law. The judge would clearly like the two parties to settle, but Rohm & Haas has very little incentive to do so. Any settlement that leads to a deal will be for a lot less than $78 a share. Any settlement that voids the deal is also likely to depress Rohm & Haas's share price, which closed on Friday at $56.50, well below the agreed-upon acquisition price. Either way, Rohm & Haas shareholders will be fuming.
 Mr. Bernick, for his part, has put forth the argument that the judge should simply set aside the specific performance provision because of the damage it would do to the combined company. There is some slender legal precedent for this argument, and the judge does indeed have the right to do it -- and Mr. Bernick is a persuasive fellow. Still, it's a Hail Mary pass.
 But while it may not ultimately be the winning argument, it does have common sense on its side. Too bad that doesn't count for much anymore.

HEADLINE: Hard Days for a Buff and Shine Man

BYLINE: By JOSEPH HUFF-HANNON

 BODY:
MARCOS SILVA DE PAULA, a 37-year-old Brazilian who moved a decade ago to a Brazilian enclave in Astoria, Queens, can offer a ground-floor view of the city's economic turmoil.
For many years, Mr. Silva De Paula made a decent living in what is something of a throwback profession -- he shines shoes for a living -- but he is now planning to return to Brazil with his wife, Miria, and their 3-year-old daughter, Kimberly. Both Mr. Silva De Paula and his wife, who works part time cleaning houses, have seen their incomes plummet in the past year, and in leaving, they will be following in the footsteps of many Brazilian friends who have already made the one-way trip.
Many immigrants are suffering economically these days, but as the recession deepens, Brazilians are among the few who have the option and incentive to return to their homelands. The reason is that Brazil's economy, while clearly affected by worldwide troubles, has been relatively strong in recent years, so much so that even before the recession, its strength had drawn immigrants home. 
On a recent evening, between bites of a Brazilian farmer's cheese and his wife's homemade cake, Mr. Silva De Paula sat in the kitchen of his two-bedroom apartment and talked about his decision to move back home.
JOSEPH HUFF-HANNON
When I came here in 1999, Brazil's economy was in the pits, and it wasn't too hard to get a visa to travel to the U.S. When I got to New York, I felt at home already. I got work as a house painter, then as a mechanic, then as a driver delivering business documents.
I started working as a shoeshine man in 2004 when a Brazilian friend left for Florida. He sold me his kit, and I took over his business and some of his regular clients. For three years I made good money. I'd take the kit, with the wooden box and my little brushes, and pull it around in a little cart with me, and go to offices in Manhattan, Queens and Long Island.
To tell you the truth, at first I hated this job. Then, after a while, I started to like it a little bit, or at least to hate it a little less. The good part about it is I don't have a boss telling me, ''Do this, do that.'' Shoes never yell at you. And Americans don't want to do this kind of work. When was the last time you met an American shoeshine man?
The mortgage companies were my best clients. I used to visit a lot of mortgage and brokerage offices -- at 46th Street and Park Avenue, in Jamaica, Queens. Most of the people who worked there were young, and they gave nice tips.
The problems began in 2007, when the mortgage crisis hit. I asked my friends who also do this work, because I wondered if it was just me, but they said it was hitting them, too.
At first, people just started cutting back. People who usually got a shine every week, now they'd ask for a shine every two weeks. You think it won't affect you because a shoeshine is only $5, and maybe a $1 tip. But all of a sudden everybody started holding onto their money.
Then, in the beginning of 2008, the mortgage offices started closing down. I used to make regular rounds at 10 different mortgage offices. In the last year, 9 of those 10 closed down. The only one left is just the boss and a few assistants. During the good times I was making $4,000 a month. Now I'm barely making $2,400 or $2,500 a month.
My wife and I started to talk about going back to Brazil last year. The economy there is a lot more stable than when I arrived. If I go back to Brazil, I'd look for work as a mechanic; that's what I'm trained for. My parents want us to come back, partly because they've never met our daughter and they're dying to know her. And everybody is there -- all my brothers and sisters. We've been away a long time. You lose something when you're away from family that long.
The main thing is that now we can't save anymore. We're making barely enough to get by. To live outside of your country and not save anything, it doesn't make sense. Our plan was to wait until the end of the year, but things keep getting worse. Now we're planning to leave sooner.
It's a difficult decision. We've always been in Astoria. We have a lot of little Brazilian markets here, and our friends are here, and our church, Light to the World. We do a lot with the church -- we go every Tuesday and Sunday, and sometimes on Saturdays. The pastor is always thinking about us. One of our friends from church went back home, and she said the thing she missed the most about New York was the church.
And we're used to this work-all-the-time culture. When you're here, there's no way to be lazy. In Brazil, you live with less, but you're not running all the time. Here you see more people working into their 70s, their 80s.
My wife thinks it's better to raise Kimberly in Brazil. Even though Kimberly was born here, Brazil is her country, too. She doesn't want to go, but I think she'll love it.
We took Kimberly camping upstate last year, and she loved it, especially sleeping in a tent. But my city, Belo Horizonte, is right by the mountains. It's very beautiful. We can take her camping there, too.

HEADLINE: Florida's Crossroads of Foreclosure and Despair

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
LEHIGH ACRES, Fla. -- Desperation has moved into this once-middle-class exurb of Fort Myers, where hammers used to pound.
Its straight-ahead stare was hidden amid the chatter of 221 families waiting for free bread at Faith Lutheran Church on a recent Friday morning; and it appeared a block away a few days earlier, as laid-off construction workers in flannel shirts scavenged through trash bags at a home foreclosure, grabbing wires, CDs, anything that could be sold.
''I knew it was coming,'' said Gloria Chilson, 56, the former owner of the house, as she watched strangers pick through her belongings. ''You take what you can; you try not to care.''
Welcome to the American dream in high reverse. Lehigh Acres is one of countless sprawling exurbs that the housing boom drastically reshaped, and now the bust is testing whether the experience of shared struggle will pull people together or tear them apart. 
The changes in these mostly unincorporated areas outside cities like Charlotte, N.C., Las Vegas and Sacramento have been swift and vivid. Their best economic times have been immediately followed by their worst, as they have generally been the last to crest and the first to crash.
In Lehigh Acres, homes are selling at 80 percent off their peak prices. Only two years after there were more jobs than people to work them, fast-food restaurants are laying people off or closing. Crime is up, school enrollment is down, and one in four residents received food stamps in December, nearly a fourfold increase since 2006.
President Obama is scheduled to visit Fort Myers on Tuesday to promote his economic stimulus plan. But residents here tend to view it as the equivalent of an herbal remedy -- it can't hurt but it probably won't heal. Instead, in church groups and offices, people call for ''industry'' and repeat one telling question: ''What do we want to be when we grow up?''
''That's one of the things we struggle with: What is our identity?'' said Joseph Whalen, 37, president of the Lehigh Acres Chamber of Commerce. ''We don't want to be the bedroom community of southwest Florida; we don't want to be the foreclosure capital.''
A Legacy of the '50s
Lehigh Acres, like much of Florida and many suburbs nationwide, was born with speculation in its DNA.
The area got its start in the 1950s when a Chicago pest control baron, Lee Ratner, and several partners bought thousands of acres of farmland and plotted about 100,000 lots. With Fort Myers, 15 miles to the west, developers left little room for schools, parks or even businesses.
What they sold was sun and quiet living.
''They used to bring 20 busloads a day,'' said Bob Elliott, a former salesman for Mr. Ratner's company who struck out on his own in 1982. ''We had 300 customers, seven days a week.''
By 2000, the lots had been sold, but most stayed empty. Only about 30,000 people were living in an area roughly four times the size of Manhattan. The builders really started to arrive in 2004, setting up model homes on Lee Boulevard next to Mr. Elliott's office with the faded wooden sign that said ''$50 lots.''
Bill Spikowski, a city planning consultant in Fort Myers, said that because Lehigh Acres had so many parcels and few restrictions on what could be built, smaller companies battled for customers. From 2004 to the end of 2006, developers completed 13,183 units in Lehigh Acres -- nearly doubling the total stock of 15,216 that existed in 2000, according to Lee County figures.
Residents remember the boom for its noise, with dump trucks lining the streets and power tools heard in nearly every neighborhood. Housing prices doubled, then tripled, and jobs were plentiful, nearly all of them tied to real estate.
Signs of trouble were ignored. ''Sometimes houses would sell three or four times in a few months, and no one would move in,'' Mr. Elliott said.
Then in 2007, it all went quiet. Houses stopped selling. Foreclosures multiplied. The median home price in the Fort Myers area dropped to $215,200 in December 2007, from a peak of $322,300 in December 2005. It had fallen to $106,900 two months ago.
Work disappeared with the profits. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, Lee County lost a higher percentage of jobs (8.8 percent) from June 2007 to June 2008 than any other county in the nation. Unemployment in the county rose to 9.8 percent in November, from 3.5 percent in March 2007.
Lehigh Acres was particularly hard hit because it relied on construction. This was where the carpenters and exterminators of southwest Florida lived because it was more affordable or close to work. And by last spring, life as they knew it had come to an end.
The Downward Spiral
Trinkets for $1 were an early sign of trouble. Early last year, garage sales and estate auctions became more common in Lehigh Acres as families sold what they could to survive. No one seemed interested in buying whole houses, and foreclosures soon gave way to empty homes that became magnets for crime.
Thieves stole air conditioner parts for scrap. And on distant roads with only a few new homes and faded blue street signs from the '50s -- on Narcissus Boulevard, on Prospect Avenue -- drug dealers moved in.
In 2007 and 2008, the Lee County Sheriff's Department shut down more than 100 houses in Lehigh Acres where marijuana was being grown. In 2008, the police confiscated nearly 3,000 plants valued at nearly $7 million.
Last winter, Charlotte Rae Nicely, executive director of Lehigh Community Services, noticed something else. More people were going hungry. Demand was increasing at the food pantry she runs at a nondescript office park, with dozens of new faces appearing week after week, even as the population was declining.
Wondering what other social service agencies were experiencing, she decided to form a group that would coordinate assistance. It was the first sign that Lehigh Acres was fighting the recession in an organized way, and the group's mission appeared in its name: Team Rescue.
The monthly meetings now include about a half-dozen churches, nonprofit groups, business owners and representatives from county government, including the sheriff's office.
Discussion at one recent gathering centered on the host of troubles that follow unemployment -- issues that until recently had rarely been seen in new American suburbs. Hunger was chief among them.
The organizations offering food in Lehigh Acres have seen demand increase by as much as 75 percent in the last year. And the people being served are no longer just the chronic poor.
The line at Faith Lutheran included a mix of ages, races and former income levels.
Luis Oquendo, 38, said he had been showing up for his weekly bread allotment since last fall, after full-time construction work disappeared.
Fred Csifortos, 62, a retiree surviving on $650 a month in disability payments, said the free food left more money for his medications.
Megan Brown, standing in line with her well-dressed daughters, Kayley, 2, and Sydney, 4, had come because she feared the worst. Her husband still had his job, she said, ''but things are getting more and more tight.''
Team Rescue, of which Faith Lutheran is a member, considers itself successful, not just because it has helped more families but also because organizers believe that the links they are forming will be the foundation of a tighter community.
Ms. Nicely said she was especially encouraged by the Sheriff's Department's new ''weed and seed'' program, intended to revive Lehigh's most troubled neighborhoods by involving residents in community policing and cleanup.
And home sales in Lee County are picking up, running roughly even with foreclosures.
''Six months ago, you might get one out of 20 houses with a multiple offer,'' said Kevin Williamson, a real estate agent who has lived in Lehigh Acres for 22 years. ''A couple of weeks ago, I had one with 13 offers.''
But no one here would describe Lehigh Acres as out of the woods. Real estate agents said the homes that are selling here typically go for only about $45,000, a third of what they cost to build. They predict that foreclosures will continue to keep prices low for two more years.
Job growth is also still nonexistent. Randy Burns, 50, the gregarious owner of Lehigh Discount Furniture, says he now receives 15 to 20 calls a week from people asking him to buy their furniture or help them move out of town -- and he said he planned to leave, too.
''Until there's jobs and foreclosures stop,'' he said, ''nothing's going to change.''
The Latest Battle
Creating a community in a deepening recession, many here now say, feels harder than dealing with a Category 5 hurricane. Panic is a powerful headwind.
Voters defeated a proposal last year to incorporate Lehigh Acres, partly because residents feared higher taxes. And Team Rescue, for all its strength as a unified front, is still trying to figure out how to curb the spread of desperation.
Most recently the group has been struggling with a growing wave of families that either visit multiple food pantries using aliases or return the food to supermarkets for money or other items.
Ms. Nicely, at Lehigh Community Services, said that in November she started using a magic marker to blacken UPC symbols on cans so grocery stores would not accept them as returns.
''We even had to do that on the toys for Christmas,'' Ms. Nicely said. Without such limits, she said, the neediest families might not be served.
Still, she often feels torn, saying, ''I can't be sure I wouldn't do the same thing if I was a single parent and my kids were hungry.''
''The needs are so strong now,'' she added, noting that there were more canned peas than peanut butter on her shelves because of growing demand. ''They've never been this big before.''
A similar struggle between cohesion and chaos was also evident at a recent evangelical men's meeting, where 8 of the 15 members said they had been laid off in the last year. Even as the group had helped some of the men cope, others said their families had been broken up by the stress.
And then there is Ms. Chilson. She lost her house partly because of the boom (if not for easy credit, she might not have refinanced her mortgage a few years ago), the bust (which led to her husband being laid off from his pest control job) and overspending (which led to more than $20,000 in credit card debt).
She and her husband had lived in their simple green ranch house for 18 years, and the night they were kicked out, they stayed across the street with an elderly man whom Ms. Chilson had often helped with his medication.
Ms. Chilson put her couch in an old friend's house, her frozen steaks in another. And as she scrambled to find work and a place to rent, she decided to thank those she could.
At one point, she tried to vacuum a neighbor's house as an act of appreciation.
But the vacuum stayed quiet. Ms. Chilson discovered that the electricity had been turned off because the bill had not been paid. Any day now, she said, her neighbor will be leaving Lehigh Acres with all the others.

HEADLINE: New G.O.P. Chairman Defends 2007 Payment to Sister

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Michael Steele, who was recently elected chairman of the Republican National Committee, paid a Maryland company run by his sister more than $37,000 for work related to his 2006 Senate campaign, a payment that Mr. Steele's spokesman said Saturday was entirely appropriate. 
The spokesman issued a statement in response to an accusation included in a confidential federal court document that Mr. Steele's sister had done no work to earn the payment.
Vickie E. LeDuc, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office in Maryland, said Saturday that the office had unintentionally given the document to The Washington Post, which first reported the accusation. Ms. LeDuc would not say if Mr. Steele or his sister was the subject of an investigation.
Mr. Steele did not dispute that his sister's company, Brown Sugar Unlimited, of Bethesda, Md., had been paid $37,262 by his Senate campaign in February 2007, as federal election records show.
Federal law does not prohibit a candidate from hiring a relative, and Mr. Steele said in the statement that the payment was for legitimate work. The federal records indicate that the payment to Brown Sugar was for catering and Internet-related services provided in 2006.
''The questioned transactions were fully disclosed and are completely proper and in full compliance with all state and federal laws,'' said the statement, which was released by Curt Anderson, a spokesman for Mr. Steele.
Monica Turner, Mr. Steele's sister and an ex-wife of the former boxer Mike Tyson, incorporated her company in 2003 and dissolved it in 2006, before the payment by Mr. Steele's campaign was made, according to state and federal records. In a telephone interview late Saturday, she said, ''The check was written to me for legitimate expenses and services I provided.''
In 2006, Ms. Turner, a pediatrician, was featured in a television advertisement for her brother's campaign in which she disputed a claim that he supported limits on stem cell research.
The accusation against Mr. Steele, a former corporate securities lawyer who was lieutenant governor when he ran for the Senate, was made by Alan B. Fabian, his former finance chairman. Mr. Fabian was sentenced in October to nine years in prison for his involvement in a $40 million fraud scheme, unrelated to his work on the Steele campaign.
Before his sentencing, he claimed that Mr. Steele or an aide had transferred more than $500,000 in campaign money without authorization.
Mr. Anderson, in his statement for Mr. Steele, said the source of the accusations -- a felon who had ''tried, and failed, to gain leniency in a desperate attempt to mitigate his nine-year prison sentence by falsely smearing the most prominent person he knew'' -- was more than sufficient reason to disregard them.
Mr. Steele's election last month as the first black leader of the Republican National Committee was heralded as a turning point in the rebuilding of the party, which suffered heavy losses last fall in the Congressional and presidential elections.
On Saturday, Mr. Steele, 50, gave the Republican Party's weekly radio address, criticizing Democrats in Congress for the amount of spending proposed in the economic stimulus package.

HEADLINE: The Downside For Condos In a Downturn

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
DURING the recent boom, buyers who coveted condos for their sex appeal could also make the case that condos were a smarter choice than co-ops.
In theory, you didn't have to prostrate yourself, financially and otherwise, before a board for approval, and you could sell or rent pretty much to whomever you chose, should the need, or whim, arise. You could also put down a lot less money than the 20, 25, or even 50 percent of the purchase price customarily demanded by co-ops.
But as the city's fortunes buckle and heave, these very differences have potentially rendered some of the city's condo buildings dangerously exposed to the downturn. Then there is a distinction many condo buyers probably dismissed as a boring legality: If a condo unit is the subject of a foreclosure, the bank gets first dibs on the equity. With real estate prices way off their peak, that means some condo buildings will collect nothing but dust from residents who have also failed to pay their common charges, leaving the remaining owners to shoulder the burden of higher costs or reduced services.
Defaults on common charges began to spike last fall, according to lawyers hired by increasingly jittery boards to file liens (the first step toward foreclosure) against owners in arrears. 
''We had maybe four or five before October,'' said Adam Leitman Bailey, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, referring to the number of liens his firm filed last year against condo owners in Manhattan and Brooklyn. ''It really got going this fall. We had 28 filings here and 17 in Brooklyn. These aren't in the wealthiest or the poorest buildings. It's the buildings with the younger 30- or 35-year-old professionals buying a $1 million to $2.5 million apartment, who haven't been working for 20 or 30 years and are relying on their job to pay for it.'' Other lien-filing lawyers said the pace had picked up by at least 10 to 25 percent.
''We're seeing more, especially in the higher-end buildings where you never heard of foreclosures,'' said Adam D. Finkelstein, a real estate lawyer with Kagan Lubic Lepper Lewis Gold & Colbert in Manhattan. Starting last quarter, his firm began filing two or three liens a month, up from two or three per year.
According to figures provided by the online research company PropertyShark.com, condo lien filings more than doubled in Brooklyn during the second half of 2008, and the number of filings in Manhattan zigzagged, with 156 in the first quarter, 186 in the second, 154 in the third and 203 in the fourth.
While the aggregate number of liens is still small (47 in Brooklyn and 67 in Manhattan in December, for example), they may be the first sign of trouble: Liens typically lag months behind defaults in common charge payments, and the bottom didn't truly fall out of the city's economy until last fall.
Moreover, barring a swift economic renaissance, lawyers, managing agents and condo boards are bracing for things to worsen significantly this year as job losses mount, severances and savings evaporate, and the new reality sets in.
''The world as we've been living in it for the last several years has changed seemingly overnight,'' Mr. Finkelstein said. ''We're at the very beginning of this.''
While lawyers are reporting a similar rash of defaults among co-op owners, the risk to the building (and by extension to the defaulter's neighbors) is slight by comparison. That's because a co-op building is entitled to its share before the bank can claim anything in the event of foreclosure (the ultimate consequence of nonpayment of maintenance charges).
But in condo foreclosures, the debt priorities are reversed. After a foreclosure process that these days can take two years -- during which unpaid common charges proliferate -- the building gets its due only after the bank is paid in full. And many condo owners have little equity in their apartments.
''I think it's safe to say that the value of any apartment purchased in the last two years is less than its purchase price,'' said David Kuperberg, the president of Cooper Square Realty, a Manhattan property management company. ''The simple calculation is that if you bought an apartment a year ago and financed 90 percent of the purchase price, as many did, and now it's worth 20 percent less, you're upside-down as an owner.''
Even worse from the perspective of the condo building, if an apartment owner defaults on common charges but keeps up with mortgage payments, it falls to the building rather than the bank to pursue the foreclosure action.
In that situation, the building must pay the bank the entire balance owed under the mortgage. This prospect is so onerous in a down market that a vast majority of liens for unpaid common charges never advance to the foreclosure stage, said Aaron Shmulewitz, a real estate lawyer at Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman in Manhattan.
Instead, buildings often sue the owners personally -- looking for other assets and garnishing wages, if there are any. But they are effectively powerless to force the expulsion of a deadbeat owner who has no equity. So far, there hasn't been an uptick in condo foreclosure filings in Manhattan and Brooklyn, according to PropertyShark.com. Instead, owners in financial distress seem more willing to play chicken with the condo board than with the bank, and they appear to have some wiggle room when pressed.
Mr. Bailey said that to date, a majority of defaulting owners had paid up once his firm had filed a lien.
''The owners are hoping we won't file, and then they find a way to pay, whether they're borrowing it from relatives or using their last dime,'' said Mr. Bailey, who observed that the days of refinancing one's way out of debt were long gone. ''Usually they will pay for their home first, before credit cards and health insurance, because keeping a roof over their heads is their family's biggest priority.''
But the biggest priority for condo buildings is preserving cash flow. With smaller reserves dictating a more hand-to-mouth lifestyle than that of most co-ops, many have little choice but to assess owners if defaults grow large enough. Never welcome, increased assessments can push additional owners over the brink and into arrears. That is one reason many managing agents and lawyers have begun encouraging condo boards to forsake neighborly empathy and play hardball.
''It used to be three months and then you'd file a lien, and now at the most it's two months and in many case it's just one month,'' Mr. Shmulewitz said.
Just how long to wait depends on a building's exposure. ''If two people are defaulting in a 200-unit building,'' Mr. Finkelstein said, ''you can probably exercise some leniency. But it's more problematic in a 40-unit building, even though it probably won't kill you. You've got to evaluate your risk. If you know someone has a very low mortgage and there's a lot of equity, you can cut them a little slack, because you can collect if there's a foreclosure.''
While all condo buildings share vulnerabilities putting them at greater risk than co-ops to defaulting owners, condos of recent vintage appear to be in the greatest peril. For starters, these buildings often have less-experienced boards to navigate a crisis.
''The fear is much more acute in newer buildings than in established condominiums,'' said Mr. Kuperberg, the managing agent, whose company has helped about 40 buildings open in the past three years. ''There's a greater likelihood that many apartments were sold for more than they're worth today. And newer buildings have many people who bought with no-income-verification loans and very relaxed criteria. They also have younger owners who may be less established.''
What's more, many of these overleveraged, less well established owners are among the several hundred thousand who bought under the 421-a tax abatement program. As the 10-year abatements phase out in steps every two years, the recipients experience increasingly drastic tax increases -- which many had been counting on income gains to offset.
Consider the following hypothetical situation, provided by Paul J. Korngold, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan, which he said was consistent with many Manhattan units selling in the $1 million to $2 million range under the 421-a program. What starts out as a $1,214 annual tax bill climbs to $4,613 in the third year, $8,012 in the fifth year, $11,411 in the seventh year and $18,209 when the abatement expires.
But those numbers assume that the city doesn't raise assessed values or tax rates. Factoring in what Mr. Korngold called a historically conservative 3 percent combined average increase, the unit owner who begins with a $1,214 annual tax bill owes $10,046 in the fifth year and a staggering $32,887 when the abatement expires.
Nearly 300,000 condo units were constructed under the program in the five boroughs from 2002 through 2007, according to the Department of Finance. That figure includes 132,431 units in Manhattan, where about 22,000 owners are in their fourth year of the program, 31,000 are in their fifth or sixth, and 12,000 are in their seventh. Because 421-a purchases were concentrated in a limited number of buildings, they are potentially destabilizing to these buildings in a down economy.
Mr. Kuperberg sketched out a second chain of events, this one pertaining to new buildings with many unsold units. It unfolds like this: Unable to sell half the units in a building, a struggling developer stops paying common charges and defaults on obligations to the lender. Foreclosure by the lender may take years, while individual unit owners effectively wind up paying double their normal common charges. This pushes some owners, themselves struggling, into default. Meanwhile, they are trapped -- unable to sell, even at a steep loss, because most mortgage lenders won't lend to potential buyers in a building where half the units are in default.
''That is a death spiral that could push a building into bankruptcy,'' Mr. Kuperberg said. ''You basically have a building unable to meet its operating expenses.''
Once the lender succeeds in foreclosing on the developer, there may not be enough money to cover the lender costs and unpaid common charges, forcing the unit owners to permanently swallow the loss. And while the lender must pay carrying costs going forward, it may decide not to throw good money after bad and instead dump the units at auction. The investors who buy them may act against the building's best interests -- renting them out cheaply (introducing a transient population that, among other things, inflicts more wear and tear) and electing boards who defer maintenance and refuse to make improvements.
''We work with a building that's about 50 percent sold and the developer is gone -- they lost all their money and they weren't able to sell,'' said one managing agent who asked to remain anonymous out of concern for the impact on property values in the building. ''The lender took over and pays the common charges but doesn't talk to us and won't return our calls. If you're running a building and 50 percent of the ownership doesn't give you direction, that's a problem. But I'm really nervous about what happens if the lender sells into the vulture market.''
Even condo boards in fully sold buildings have begun to contemplate the once unthinkable: slashing the very amenities that defined the recent boom.
''The boards are starting to talk about cutting things that might be considered a little excessive,'' said Leslie Bogen Winkler, the vice president and director of management at Penmark Realty, a property management firm that has opened 50 condo buildings in the last three and a half years. ''They may reduce health-club hours and maybe scale back breakfast. The biggest amenities that are costly are the health club with a swimming pool. It can run up to $200,000 to $400,000, depending on the size, hours open and operator.''
Staff cuts may also be in the offing at some buildings, though union contracts present significant hurdles. Moreover, said J. Brian Peters, the senior managing director of property management for Rose Associates, which owns or manages about 20,000 apartments in New York, ''you can cut positions, but at a certain level that's devaluing the product. And it's the best product that's going to survive the easiest in this downturn. We're really more focused on increasing revenue.''
To that end, condo boards are considering adopting flip taxes, increasing alteration fees and bumping up sublet fees. They are also easing restrictions on the length of sublets so that strapped owners unable to sell their units can more easily rent them out.
Then again, other condos have the luxury of spare cash and might actually come out ahead in the downturn, Mr. Kuperberg said. ''The recession can be a good opportunity to buy capital improvements and do upgrades,'' he explained, ''because contractors don't have a lot of work and material costs are way down. It's an opportunity to invest not only in cosmetic things like the lobby but in infrastructure that could reduce operating costs.''

HEADLINE: For Your Valentine, Meals With an Intimate Flavor

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER BROOKS

 BODY:
LOCAL lore has it that the lexicographer Noah Webster once summered in the pale yellow Colonial that now houses Pastorale Bistro and Bar in Lakeville. If that association doesn't help you find the right words to express your feelings next Saturday, the French-style fare and appealing decor of a house that dates to the 1700s will probably do the trick.
''Some people fly to Paris to celebrate Valentine's Day,'' said Karen Faveau, the owner of the establishment with her husband, Frederic, who is also the chef there. ''For everybody else there's our romantic little bistro.''
Patorale is one of several area restaurants that combine memorable food with a sweetly intimate atmosphere. While the upstairs dining area features many attractive table settings, including several high-backed booths, the ''red room,'' to the right of the front door, is the more romantic choice. An oversize fireplace, with pillar candles burning in its hearth, is the centerpiece of the space, which seats about 14, and both the vibrant papaya-red walls and luxurious Asian throw carpeting add to the general warmth. 
Consistent throughout the house is the service, which deftly balances professionalism with a casual mien. ''This is not a white-tablecloth restaurant where you have staff standing at attention all around you,'' Ms. Faveau said. ''We're much more relaxed and friendly than that.''
The approach in the kitchen is somewhat different, with Pastorale's various courses arranged on plates in a classical, artistic manner that exhibits great attention to detail. The sweetbread and escargot casserole with wild mushroom reduction, and a goat cheese and leek tart -- two appetizers being offered as specials on Valentine's Day -- reinforce the notion that Mr. Faveau is a formal-minded professional. ''We haven't gone for the idea of foods that are aphrodisiacs,'' Ms. Faveau said. ''But a lot of our appetizers are in the bistro tradition of being very sharable, and that can add a romantic appeal for couples.''
Sharing food with his wife of 18 years is exactly how Riad Aamar sets about celebrating Valentine's Day. ''We like to go with five or six courses, a lot of little hors d'oeuvres, and that's the meal,'' he said. ''For me, food is love, it's everything.''
As the chef-owner of Oliva, in New Preston, Mr. Aamar is clearly biased. But in preparing appetizers that are ample enough to pass as entrees, he makes sampling more than a couple of dishes at his own restaurant very nearly impossible. It is tempting, however, to push one's limits with Oliva's menu, which, while changing regularly, on Valentine's Day will feature Italian and Mediterranean staples like calamari grilled and stuffed with nuts, prunes and spices; sea scallops timbale, with ginger and sun-dried tomatoes; and grilled marinated lamb chops served over tabbouleh.
Like Pastorale, Oliva is housed in a 1700s Colonial, with the seating broken into numerous cozy niches on three levels. The fireplaces on each of those floors flicker with the glow of an electric fire, and real flame burns within Wexford or red glass sconces on every table. Decor is tastefully restrained, with gilt-edged mirrors on some walls, antique serving trays mounted on others.
Mr. Aamar, who was born in the Middle East and learned his trade in Florence, Italy, suggests starting the evening with a glass of Champagne. ''Champagne is just incredible with hors d'oeuvres,'' he said. ''I love it with crab cakes, or a nice little crostini with wild mushrooms, or maybe a mixed-cheese crostata with herbs.''
A Champagne toast and a rose will be included with the purchase of dessert at the Dressing Room Restaurant, in Westport. ''Champagne is definitely the call for the day, first of all because it is so romantic, and secondly, it's versatile and goes with everything,'' said the restaurant's owner, Michel Nischan, who suggests sticking with the bubbly throughout the meal.
The Dressing Room is the snug sort of place that seems as if it was designed with couples in mind. From its large stone fireplace, post-and-beam construction and barn-wood walls to decorative adornments like enormous sugar-pine cones and strings of dried magnolia leaves, the restaurant could pass as a rustic retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyo., or possibly Vermont.
Under Mr. Nischan's guidance, the menu emphasizes down-home cooking with a conscience, which basically means preparing various comfort foods from ingredients that have been grown in a sustainable, often organic way by area farms. The carved roast special for two, scheduled to be on the menu on Feb. 14, exemplifies that approach. ''It's beautifully raised, grass-fed cattle from Stone Broke Farms that marbles very well,'' Mr. Nischan said. ''And we believe that with Valentine's Day as an interaction of love, something that can be shared at the table is really important.''
By contrast, the Firebox Restaurant in Hartford will feature a five-course prix fixe menu that includes Stonington fluke ''crudo,'' duck confit, and house-made gnocchi, for $60. ''With the current economic climate, we're looking to offer a real treat that's still affordable,'' said the chef, Jason Collin.
The Firebox owes its name to a time, more than a century ago, when its red brick building housed the neighborhood fire brigade. Today, the white-washed brick of the interior serves as a backdrop to a sleekly modern setting in which solid oak pillars and beams from the earlier era blend seamlessly with microspot ceiling lights and a gas fireplace positioned, as if it were a work of art, at eye level in the wall of the dining room. Oak tables are draped in white linen and set with weighty, nicely tapered cutlery, along with quality crystal wine goblets.
The restaurant defines itself as contemporary American, with many of its ingredients obtained from area farms. In addition to the grilled Connecticut lamb on the menu, which is draped in a zesty yellow curry sauce and paired with Swiss chard and roasted, locally grown beets, a separate ''farmer's'' dinner of three courses, each composed in part from Connecticut raised plants or animals, reflects that locavore philosophy.
While chocolate ranks high on most everyone's list of Valentine's Day treats, Mr. Collin believes the olfactory effects of certain culinary components may be even more powerful. ''Things like fennel and truffles, or lemon grass, kaffir lime, clove, cinnamon and other spices and herbs -- those can be very visually and sensually stimulating,'' he said.
Gopinath Nair is unlikely to argue with that. As managing partner of Coromandel Indian Bistro in South Norwalk, he presides over a restaurant that makes full use of the kitchen spice cabinet. Yet he takes care to stress that well-seasoned Indian cuisine is not necessarily incendiary. ''Ginger, garlic, cumin, added in the right quantity, bring out the most in meat and vegetables, without being piquant,'' he said.
An orange banquette, red carpeting and colorful place settings endow Coromandel with a festive flair, which is further enhanced by the wall art, patachitra paintings of a blue-skinned Krishna being attended to by a few of his thousands of wives. No less engaging are the thoughtful and attentive waiters. This sensitivity has not been left to chance, Mr. Nair said. ''When we hire, we make sure we get the right attitude first, then we teach and train them to do what it takes to make the guest happy,'' he said. ''After that, everything else will fall into place.''

HEADLINE: Digital Archivists, Now in Demand

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE. 
Fresh Starts is a monthly column about emerging jobs and job trends.

 BODY:
WHEN the world entered the digital age, a great majority of human historical records did not immediately make the trip.
 Literature, film, scientific journals, newspapers, court records, corporate documents and other material, accumulated over centuries, needed to be adapted for computer databases. Once there, it had to be arranged -- along with newer, born-digital material -- in a way that would let people find what they needed and keep finding it well into the future.
 The people entrusted to find a place for this wealth of information are known as digital asset managers, or sometimes as digital archivists and digital preservation officers. Whatever they are called, demand for them is expanding. 
 One of them is Jacob Nadal, the preservation officer at the University of California, Los Angeles. He does not use the ''digital'' modifier because his duties include safeguarding analog materials in U.C.L.A.'s collection, not just preparing them to cross the digital divide.
 ''I don't think there's any day where I would say I'm the digital guy,'' he said. But he concedes that he's not really an analog, ink-on-paper guy, either, and that is increasingly the case in his field. These days, he noted, ''if you want to work in a library, you have to deal in electronic resources.''
 Mr. Nadal and 10 or so colleagues at U.C.L.A. devote much of their effort to organizing and protecting material in digital form. Their duties include licensing and buying digital content from vendors, assigning identification markers called meta-tags so that material can be found easily, researching copyright matters and ensuring that files remain intact whenever new iterations of relevant software or hardware come along.
 Befitting a nascent discipline like digital asset management, Mr. Nadal, 32, said he went into it almost by accident. Unsure of his career ambitions, he began work on various book-scanning and preservation projects as a student at Indiana University, then took them over when the head of preservation left. After that, he said, it ''took a year or two for me to realize my career in preservation had started a year or two past.''
 He reckons that many of his peers have had similar experiences. ''Among librarians, I think that happenstance may be a typical career path,'' he said.
 Some backgrounds are considered better than others for budding digital asset managers. Familiarity with information technology is necessary, but it is possible to have too much tech know-how, said Victoria McCargar, a preservation consultant in Los Angeles and a lecturer at U.C.L.A. and San Jose State University.
 ''People with I.T. backgrounds tend to be wrong for the job,'' she said. ''They tend to focus on storage solutions: 'We'll just throw another 10 terabytes on that server.''' A result, she said, can be ''waxy buildup'' -- a lot of useless files that make it hard to find the good stuff.
 Ms. McCargar estimates that 20,000 people work in the field today -- plus others in related areas -- and she expects that to triple over the next decade, assuming that economic conditions stabilize before long.
 Many work for public institutions, and businesses use them, too, said Deborah Schwarz, chief executive of Library Associates Companies, a consulting and headhunting firm. Especially big employers in this area are law firms, which need experts on digital copyright and other issues tied to the migration of legal documents from filing cabinets to databases.
 One comparative advantage of private-sector jobs is the pay. Digital asset managers at public facilities would do well to make $70,000 a year. Salaries for their corporate counterparts are generally higher.
 ''Compensation varies wildly because it's an emerging area,'' said Keith Gurtzweiler, vice president for recruiting at Library Associates. ''Consultants who can make recommendations on systems can make $150 an hour.'' Those who ''manage them once they're up and running and maintain the machinery,'' he said, make from the $70,000's up to $100,000.
 Michael Doane is an information management consultant at Ascentium, a consultancy in suburban Seattle that employs 100 to 150 digital asset managers in a staff of 500. He said that fresh graduates with master's degrees in information systems management or a similar discipline could ''easily expect $80,000 to $90,000 in consulting and a little less in the commercial world.''
 As much as it might help his bank balance, Mr. Nadal cannot envision leaving U.C.L.A. for a corporate job. He finds the challenge of taming a vast collection of information for a major academic institution too appealing.
 ''We belong to the people of California and hold our collections in trust for them and for future generations of students, scholars and members of the public,'' he said. ''Public-sector institutions just strike me as far, far cooler. They have better collections, obviously, and they are innovative, connected and challenging in ways that seem more substantial to me.''

PREMIUM CHOCOLATE
 The business of luxury is reeling these days. But of course there are many ways to define ''luxury,'' and it would be remarkable if the American consumer did away with indulgences altogether. Consider, for instance, high-end, or ''premium,'' varieties of chocolate. The category has been a bright spot in the chocolate market in recent years, and it appears that it is so far holding up better than many extravagances in this economy. To reconcile the occasional truffle with all the talk of frugality these days, recall ''what chocolate means in the context of everyday life,'' suggests Marcia Mogelonsky, senior analyst at Mintel International, a market-research company. ''It's not like buying a car. You can still scrape together a few dollars when you need that little boost.'' 
 The precise nature of that ''little boost'' is elusive. Mintel surveyed chocolate buyers last year, and 12 percent actually admitted to the motive ''I was sad or stressed.'' But the most popular answers were ''I had a chocolate craving'' and the unenlightening ''No particular reason.'' Maybe there's a factor we don't even recognize prodding us to buy premium chocolate, and it arises not despite the drumbeat of threatening financial news but because of it. Derek Rucker and Adam Galinsky of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University have lately been exploring the relationship between feelings of powerlessness and what they term ''compensatory consumption.'' 
 In one experiment, subjects were divided into two groups and told to reflect on an incident in which they felt powerful or on one in which they felt powerless. Each group was then given a supposedly unrelated task that involved gauging how much each participant would be willing to pay for a variety of products. For items that carry little association with status -- a ballpoint pen, a sofa, etc. -- there wasn't much difference between what the two groups would pay. But subjects who had put themselves in a powerless frame of mind were willing to pay measurably more than the other group for high-status items -- an executive pen, a fur coat, a silk tie. In a more recent study, Rucker and Galinsky found that individuals who felt less powerful showed a preference for clothing with larger and more conspicuous luxury logos. 
 Their thinking is that the little boost of, say, pricey chocolate, might not be solely about mood but about responding to threats to status or competence, Rucker told me. Ideally you would respond to such challenges directly: standing up to a boss who is pushing you around, demonstrating skill to silence skeptics and so on. But often the sources of undermined confidence are more abstract. ''What's happened in modern society under capitalism is that people have found consumer products as an outlet, a safety valve for addressing these threats in a very indirect fashion,'' Rucker contends. 
 Maybe that's a lot of theoretical weight to lay on a bonbon. But considering the consumer mind's remarkable power to invent spending rationales, premium chocolate does seem particularly well positioned to benefit from compensatory consumption in a time of belt-tightening. That's partly because of the relative-affordability factor that Marcia Mogelonsky mentioned. But the way premium chocolate has evolved helps too. 
 The notion of high-end chocolate has taken off in the past five or six years -- Lindor Truffles were an early mainstream example -- but it has no official definition. Mogelonsky says that the category is in effect defined by price ($8 a pound and up) and ''positioning'' (meaning it's expensive and comes in a fancy package). As new offerings proliferated, the previously obscure benchmark of cacao percentage became a nicely empirical-sounding differentiator. That was followed by ''single origin'' chocolates, which are made of beans from a particular region. (Acquiring knowledge and demonstrating expertise, Rucker notes, might be another way to feel a sense of control.) 
 Countering all this supposed rarefaction was an enormous increase in availability: fancy brands like Chuao and Vosges can be found in many supermarkets. I've seen Lindor Truffles at OfficeMax. ''My bank sells chocolate,'' Mogelonsky says. Add in the even more mainstream iterations that aim to suggest something a bit more special than usual (M & M's Premiums come to mind), and chocolate offers a compensatory luxury-ish boost for pretty much every price point.

BYLINE: Reviews by WILLIAM SAFIRE. 
William Safire, a former Op-Ed columnist for The Times, writes the On Language column in The Times Magazine. He is the author of ''Freedom,'' a novel of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.

 BODY:
Begin by resisting a wave of adulation in the deluge of books occasioned by the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth, a bicentennial celebration that follows by only a few weeks the inauguration of America's first black president. We can appreciate the symbolism of Barack Obama's decision to be sworn in on the Great Emancipator's Bible, but we need not canonize Lincoln as our ''secular saint,'' not just murdered but ''martyred.'' 
 His is a life more worthy of detailed study than dutiful reverence. Fortunately, in the dozens of biographies and histories published in the 200th year since his birth, we have excellent new ways to tunnel through the mountain of myth that, even generations ago, had been built around his contradictory personality. His gentle humor and love of anecdotes were overcast with bouts of what was then called ''the hypo'' or melancholia. 
 Though a member of no church, Lincoln meditated profoundly on the inscrutable justice of God. Though a family man and a forgiving soul, he refused to attend his own father's funeral. And despite his modest protestation that he was controlled by events, the best of the Lincoln literature of our time reveals that his strong-willed decisions were driven by the unwavering political purpose of his life. 
 That declared purpose was not to abolish slavery, though he privately abhorred it and campaigned before the Civil War to oppose its expansion westward. For two long years into our national fratricide, he repeatedly disavowed emancipation as his goal because that divisive issue might defeat his overriding purpose: to establish the principle of majority rule in the world's most daring experiment in self-government by insisting that the whole country abide by the results of its national election. 
 For someone who wants to brush up on Lincoln, or who feels an urge to introduce a young family member to the practical world of democratic idealism, where best to start? How do potential Civil War buffs get a handle on what can become an enriching, lifelong enterprise? 
 Before we dive in, a perceptive overview is helpful. James M. McPherson, whose ''Battle Cry of Freedom'' (1988) was awarded a Pulitzer Prize and is the most readable short history of the Civil War, has just written an introductory biography, Abraham Lincoln (Oxford University, $12.95) -- only 79 pages, a speedy narrative but no superficial treatment. McPherson cites an example of Lincoln's skill in molding what he called public sentiment. 
 In the month after Lincoln took office, Confederate leaders demanded withdrawal of the federal garrison from Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. William Seward, the former political rival Lincoln had chosen to be secretary of state, and several other cabinet members urged the president to give in to that demand in hopes that it would preserve the peace and dissuade other slave states -- especially Virginia and Maryland, which surrounded the District of Columbia -- from following South Carolina's lead in seceding. Lincoln's dilemma: Withdrawal from the fort would show a weakness likely to encourage foreign countries to recognize the Confederacy as an independent nation. On the other hand, by sending a shipload of United States troops to shoot their way in to reinforce the garrison at Sumter, Lincoln would be blamed by many in the North -- especially those who did not believe the cause of abolition was worth civil war -- for choosing to start a bloody conflict. 
 ''But Lincoln hit upon an ingenious solution,'' McPherson writes. ''Instead of sending troops, he would send only provisions -- 'food for hungry men.' '' The new president sent a message of assurance to the governor of South Carolina ''that, if such attempt be not resisted, no effort to throw in men, arms or ammunition, will be made.'' Of course, Lincoln was aware that Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, could not accept that seemingly peaceful gesture of sending only food, because that would appear to cede sovereignty of the port to the Union. Davis ordered Southern guns to fire, thereby suffering the blame for starting a war. As Lincoln had figured, his move not only helped keep European nations from recognizing the Confederacy but also united the divided North. 
 Manipulative? Of course. That was Lincoln, in his first major presidential decision, pursuing his strategy of preserving the Union at all costs to ensure the relatively untested experiment in majority rule. As George Washington had been indispensable to independence, Abraham Lincoln was indispensable in seeing that independent Union through its existential test. That is why historians keep digging into both their lives, especially that of the more recent and complex Lincoln, for fresh revelations. 
 Today's buff-to-be needs the story of a life in a single, well-regarded, hefty but manageable book. What's the best one-volume ''life'' in this generation? McPherson recommends A. Lincoln: A Biography, by Ronald C. White Jr. (Random House, $35), as ''the best biography of Lincoln since David Donald's 'Lincoln' (1995).'' White's major new work does cover all the bases, adds newly discovered papers, explores the religious angle and may well be the best ''since'' the best. But no one-volume life published so far beats David Herbert Donald's perceptive and lucid work (still selling in trade paperback). When supplemented with a pictorial dimension now provided in Looking for Lincoln: The Making of an American Icon (Knopf, $50), by three members of the Lincoln-steeped Kunhardt family (with a foreword by Donald and an introduction by Doris Kearns Goodwin), such a combination of Donald text and Kunhardt illustration is enough to ignite a lifelong interest in the era that reveals the most about our history. 
 Most who are beginning that worthwhile journey are probably not ready to undertake Michael Burlingame's two-volume, 2,000-page, million-word Abraham Lincoln: A Life (Johns Hopkins University, $125), a magisterial enterprise by a historian whose mentor was David Donald. (A surprise to me: Burlingame is convinced that the famous letter of condolence to the widow Bixby for the loss of what was thought to be five -- in fact, two -- of her sons was written by John Hay, one of the president's aides.) It is not likely to be soon overtaken in scope or timeliness, however, because it is scheduled to go online in the spring at www.knox.edu/lincolnstudies. This version, the author promises, ''will be updated as mistakes are discovered and new information comes to light.'' (Think of that: a ''life'' that never ends.) 
 To get a glimpse of Lincoln's mind actually at work, peruse the official publication of the Library of Congress's Bicentennial Exhibition, In Lincoln's Hand: His Original Manuscripts With Commentary by Distinguished Americans, edited by Harold Holzer and Joshua Wolf Shenk (Bantam, $35). It contains photos of the original manuscripts of many of his most famous letters and speeches -- often with his handwritten editing, bringing to life his second thoughts -- with brief commentaries by 43 modern contributors. My own assignment in that collection was to examine his editing of his first Inaugural Address, delivered after some states had seceded but before the war had begun. The new president promised ''my dissatisfied fellow countrymen'' of the South: ''The government will not assail you unless you first assail it.'' (Italics his.) But just before delivery, he took Seward's toning-down advice, and drew a line though the bellicose caveat ''unless you first assail it.'' 
 Removing that provocative phrase was wise. He also agreed with Seward about what had been the final, challenging words: ''Shall it be peace, or a sword?'' He scrapped that hard line, too, and we can see in Lincoln's legible handwriting the way he reworked his key adviser's suggestion of a much more fraternal final paragraph. 
 Seward's draft of a peroration began with a stark ''I close.'' Lincoln changed that to a poignant ''I am loth to close,'' as if he hated to tear himself away from his audience. (That was an early spelling of ''loath.'') His longtime rival from New York came up with lines about ''mystic chords'' that could harmonize their ancient music ''when breathed upon by the better angel'' -- Seward crossed out the word ''better'' in his own submission and concluded with ''the guardian angel of the nation.'' That would have been a most acceptable prose peroration. 
 The incoming president then took up that musical metaphor and, in a stunning revision, transformed it to poetry with an image of the chords produced by strings of a celestial harp: ''the mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave . . . will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.'' That was some memorable editing. 
 A publishing industry chestnut is that the three fields readers are most interested in are (1) Lincolniana (2) medical books and (3) books about the care of pets; therefore, one surefire best seller would be ''Lincoln's Doctor's Dog.'' Joking aside, we have a mountain of bicentennial works, many slicing and dicing influences on all the phases of his life and death: relationships with his wife, his admirals, his great and terrible generals, his law partners and secretaries, and supporters and contemporaries, from Frederick Douglass to Stephen A. Douglas -- and an account of his escape from assassination in Baltimore on the way to inauguration. 
 In the blazon of this bicentennial biographical bonanza, several new books are of special interest to readers with a literary bent: one is The Lincoln Anthology: Great Writers on His Life and Legacy From 1860 to Now, edited by Harold Holzer (Library of America, $40). (Besides coediting the aforementioned ''In Lincoln's Hand,'' Holzer is also the author of last year's ''Lincoln President-Elect'' and the writer or editor of more than a score of other works on his favorite subject.) Contemporaries in ''The Lincoln Anthology'' who observed the Civil War president include Walt Whitman and Nathaniel Hawthorne (''His complexion is dark and sallow, betokening, I fear, an insalubrious atmosphere around the White House''), the humorist Artemus Ward and the class-struggling correspondent Karl Marx. (''Hesitant, resistant, unwilling, he sings the bravura aria of his role as though he begged pardon for the circumstances that force him 'to be a lion.' . . . Nevertheless, in the history of the United States and of humanity, Lincoln will take his place directly next to Washington!'') Modern perspectives are supplied by the poets Robert Lowell, Stanley Kunitz, Delmore Schwartz (''Manic-depressive Lincoln, national hero!'') and novelists from Irving Stone to E. L. Doctorow. 
 But what of books not being written about our 16th president? I'd like to see an anthology of ''Lincoln's Greatest Mistakes -- or Were They?'' One chapter: Why did he arrogate to himself the power given to Congress, not the president, to suspend habeas corpus in case of rebellion -- banishing the war opponent Clement Vallandigham, preventing Maryland's legislators from voting for secession, censoring The Brooklyn Eagle and other peaceful dissenters in areas where the courts were functioning? (Defenders' comeback: the challenge to national security was unprecedented, requiring a commander-in-chief ''to think anew and act anew.'') Why did he publicly disavow any intention of abolishing slavery when he had a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation in his desk drawer? (An answer: Putting abolition first might have divided the North, led to a negotiated peace and neither preserved the Union nor freed the slaves.) Why did this humane leader, undoubtedly sensitive to suffering, replace the casualty-avoiding Gen. George McClellan with a Union general willing to accept and inflict huge casualties to destroy the rebel army? (Reply: He had sworn an oath to preserve and protect the Constitution, and nobody realized at the outset it would cost more than a half-million lives in a population one-tenth of America's today.) Why did he draft a letter on Aug. 24, 1864, to Henry Raymond, editor of The New York Times, instructing him to ''obtain a conference for peace with Hon. Jefferson Davis'' -- and then decide not to send it? (Reply: It might have split the North, helped the Democrat McClellan defeat the Republican Lincoln's bid for re-election, probably leading to peace negotiations and a 19th-century two-state solution.) 
 In that regard, how about another controversial publishing project: ''What Would Lincoln Do?'' Look ahead a generation or two. For argument's sake, say that the illegal immigration issue has not been resolved, and a majority of voters of states in the Southwest, feeling inundated and isolated, are moved by a demagogue with a rousing message of secession. If cool reason doesn't work against such unabashed sedition, do you go to war to preserve the Union? 
 Or project a different crisis: if today's moral issues of abortion or same-sex marriage become as nothing compared with the fury of people in the heartland over an explosion of the cloning of human beings in the Northeast and West Coast -- as well as the rage of post-Internet bloggers, echoing the Civil War media giant Horace Greeley, who is supposed to have said ''erring sisters, depart in peace''-- do you dare enforce majority rule at the point of a gun? Or what if a tax-shackled ''Generation No'' rebels against paying entitlements guaranteed to its grandparents? Or if some new human-rights holocaust is raging while the rest of the world turns away, and a defiant majority of one section of the United States point-blank refuses to participate in unilateral American intervention -- do you, as president, defer to that national minority? 
 Never happen, we assure ourselves; such dire scenarios are as alarmist as a notion of global economic collapse leading to Great Depression II. But daring to think such unthinkable thoughts helps put us inside the mind of a president who chose to lead the nation through what he called, in his 1862 letter to Eliza P. Gurney, the ''fiery trial'' of civil war (his reference to martyrdom in 1 Peter 4:12). Times change; faced with the choice of ''peace, or a sword,'' we might not do what Lincoln decided to do; a Lincoln reincarnate might choose otherwise. But by exploring his thought process -- sifting the evidence in books and whatever future electronic platforms give us access to his motives and actions -- our descendants will be better able to deal with wrenching decisions to come. 
 Through the nation's most agonizing crisis, he kept the Union indivisible. He held fast to the majority rule that affirmed the ideal of popular government, which he believed must also lead to the end of human bondage. From examining his shrewd move in molding public sentiment at the approach of hostilities to appreciating his close attention to the weight of each word in his inaugural addresses, we teach ourselves and his successors the hard lessons of political power and moral leadership. 
 Let us, then (he liked that construction), not wallow in worship of a statue looking gravely down on multitudes from a marble monument engraved with famous lines. The way to honor the hero who did most to force us to stay united is to absorb the ever-better histories that illuminate Lincoln's character, his humanity, his genius in expression and, above all, his sure grasp of high political purpose.

HEADLINE: On a Mission to Make Taxicabs Safer

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
 IT will not shock members of Law High School's class of '87 that their classmate Renee Hughes ended up owning a cab company.
 When she wasn't in class, Ms. Hughes could be found behind the wheel of a 1971 Buick Skylark, a black beast with a two-barrel carburetor, a 350-cubic-inch motor and a gas pedal that spent a fair amount of time on the floor. Age, and a diminished tolerance for speeding tickets, have mellowed Ms. Hughes, who now minds the speed limit.
 Which was a good thing on a recent Monday morning, when State Senator Edward Meyer, a Democrat from Guilford, squeezed his 6 foot, 4 inch frame into the back seat of Ms. Hughes's white 2001 Ford Taurus with pink Lucy's Taxi markings. Ms. Hughes had answered my call for a cab when I invited the senator along for a spin around New Haven to chat about taxi safety. 
 It is a topic with which the senator has some personal experience. In the 1990s, Senator Meyer, 73, lived in Chappaqua, N.Y., where he ran a litigation firm in Manhattan and served on the State Board of Regents. His son's fiancee, who also worked in Manhattan, was taking a cab to work when the driver lost control of the car and hit a stanchion. The young woman lay comatose for five months before emerging, but she never fully recovered from her brain injuries.
 Senator Meyer lobbied for improved taxi regulations -- the driver involved in the accident had 17 traffic violations in the prior year -- before retiring and moving to Guilford's coast eight years ago, where he again ran for public office.
 Last year, Senator Meyer learned that cabs in Connecticut undergo fewer inspections than taxis in neighboring states, and taxi companies can choose friendly garages to conduct inspections. He helped push for a study of the industry.
 When the findings were announced in December, two stood out: in a surprise inspection of 43 cabs in August, 41 failed, and six were so unsafe they were towed away for repairs. The report also found that in 2007, Connecticut taxis were involved in accidents four times more frequently than passenger vehicles. The investigators who wrote the report suggested new laws requiring more frequent state inspections, paid for by hundreds of dollars in annual fees for cab companies.
 Senator Meyer mentioned the study's findings to Ms. Hughes as she steered her Tortoise, as she calls the Taurus, into traffic. She hadn't heard much about the state's report, she said, but she could see the wisdom of more frequent inspections. While waiting for fares at the train station recently, Ms. Hughes said she hopped into a colleague's car, only to find the air thick with fumes from an exhaust leak.
 ''That never really happens with my cars,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''I'm just really picky.''
 No kidding. The Tortoise, which has logged more than 128,000 miles, was spotless outside and in, and the car smelled clean and drove smoothly.
 Senator Meyer asked how the proposed new fees might affect her business. ''It'd be hard on us,'' Ms. Hughes said. Connecticut's taxi industry is already under pressure from the faltering economy, she added, and the number of cabs in the state has climbed steeply through the years, leaving fewer fares for each driver. New Haven had 14 cabs running in the late 1980s, according to WilliamScalzi, owner of Metro Taxi, the city's dominant service. Now that company runs 142 cabs here alone.
 Stopped at a light near New Haven's train station, Ms. Hughes glanced at a trip sheet with enough space to log 15 fares. When she entered the business 10 years ago, she could fill two trip sheets in a day. Now she's lucky to fill one.
 Ms. Hughes employs three full-time drivers for the company's two cabs, and she drives full-time and handles most of the repairs. ''Easier stuff,'' she said, ''like brakes, catalytic converters, front ends.'' She takes the cars to an independent mechanic twice annually for inspections, even though the state requires inspections every two years. (New York City cabs are inspected three times annually.)
 Ms. Hughes pays $1,100 in monthly liability insurance for the cabs, but money has been so tight in recent years that she cannot afford health insurance for herself. Bigger companies, like Yellow Cab and Metro, she said, could more easily absorb the costs of the proposed fee increases, and the additional repair costs that could come from more frequent state inspections.
 Senator Meyer shifted forward in his seat. ''The idea would be that taxis would be free to increase their fares to cover those fees,'' he said.
 Ms. Hughes nodded toward the meter, which was already approaching $10 after only a few minutes. ''Yeah, but they're already pretty high, you know?''
 Moments later, the car slowed in front of Atticus Bookstore Cafe on Chapel Street. Before leaving, the senator thanked Ms. Hughes for following a more rigorous inspection schedule than many of her counterparts. 
 Over coffee at Atticus, Senator Meyer said he doubted the legislature would adopt the report's recommendations. The Department of Transportation has its hands full with bigger projects, he said, and Gov. M. Jodi Rell's hiring freeze would prevent the state from recruiting more taxi inspectors. ''I'm worried that it's going to take something tragic to happen before the state pays more attention to this,'' he said.
 Later that week, Ms. Hughes was completing paperwork in her office in West Haven. A space heater hummed near the cinderblock wall. Photos of her German shepherd, Kaos, adorned her desk.
 Ms. Hughes said she hoped the state report would not discourage passengers from hailing a cab. ''But customers probably won't think about the accident statistics unless they're in a vehicle and the driver's really erratic,'' she said. ''Then again, you always have the customers who say, 'Please hurry, I'm in a rush!' ''
 Does she oblige? ''Nah,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''I tell them, 'If you want a faster ride, take the guy behind me.' ''

HEADLINE: Serving Two Cities, Staying True to Each

BYLINE: By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH

 BODY:
ANY arts institution reflects its leader, but it had better reflect local culture too, as the tenor Placido Domingo, the general director of both the Washington National Opera and the Los Angeles Opera, is well aware. ''By nature these are not twin companies,'' Mr. Domingo said in December at the Metropolitan Opera, where he is celebrating his 40th season as a tenor at the top of the roster. ''Each city has its own personality.''
 Nigel Redden, the director of the Lincoln Center Festival and general director of the Spoleto Festival USA, in Charleston, S.C., faces a similar reality. ''New York is an ongoing festival all the time,'' Mr. Redden said recently. ''So you can ask, 'Why do a festival at all?' In Charleston the festival has a stand-alone quality.'' This year's editions of the two festivals have not a single item in common. 
 Serving two masters is not easy. 
 Consider the curious case of Mr. Domingo and Wagner's ''Ring des Nibelungen.'' For most impresarios a single production of this four-evening marathon is the crowning achievement of a career. Apart from generations of Wagners at the Bayreuth Festival in Germany, only a handful climb the mountain a second time. Yet here is Mr. Domingo, overseeing two independent assaults on the ''Ring'' simultaneously.
 In September 2000 Mr. Domingo announced a multimedia ''Star Wars'' ''Ring'' for Los Angeles, designed by Industrial Light and Magic, a division of Lucasfilm. The cycle was to have begun in 2003. The projected cost: an astronomical $75 million to $80 million, $33 million to $40 million for special effects alone. (The figure originally mentioned by Mr. Domingo -- widely understood to be the total -- was $30 million.) With 9/11 the fantasy vanished into thin air.
 In 2006 the Washington company embarked on the ''Ring'' with the director Francesca Zambello, intending to proceed one installment per season. The production, Ms. Zambello said, was inspired by ''American history, mythology, iconography and landscape.'' The San Francisco Opera signed on as co-producer.
 Expedient as it might have seemed for Mr. Domingo to share that ''Ring'' with his own company in Los Angeles, he opted to start fresh there with the German painter and theater artist Achim Freyer, at a price tag of $32 million. Advance images project an aura of satirical fantasy in flamboyant hues sure to appeal to dream merchants and aesthetes. Apart from Mr. Domingo's signature portrayal of Siegmund in ''Die Walkure,'' the casts overlap very little. And the companies' music directors -- James Conlon in Los Angeles, Heinz Fricke in Washington -- are conductors of quite different sensibilities. 
 Both productions remain works in progress. This season the Los Angeles Opera will present ''Das Rheingold'' (opening Feb. 21) and ''Die Walkure'' (April 4); and the Washington National, ''Siegfried'' (May 2). The Los Angeles ''Ring'' is scheduled for completion next season.
 Washington, bowing to economic necessity, will settle for concert performances of ''Gotterdammerung'' next season, postponing completion of Ms. Zambello's vision perhaps until 2013, the bicentennial of Wagner's birth. So San Francisco, which has announced complete cycles of the American ''Ring'' for the summer of 2011, will beat Washington to the finish line.
 David Gockley, who became general director of the San Francisco Opera in 2006 after leaving the Houston Grand Opera, finds a kind of poetic justice here.
 ''Francesca and I had discussed the concept for Houston years ago,'' he said recently from San Francisco, ''but the money wasn't there. She asked me during my last year or so in Houston if I minded her taking it to Washington. I said: 'Hell, no. Go for it.' Then I got to San Francisco and found that the company's great Nikolaus Lehnhoff 'Ring,' which I would have revived in a heartbeat, had been scrapped by my predecessor, Pamela Rosenberg.''
 Here was his chance to realize a dream, at bargain rates. 
 Mr. Domingo is bargain conscious too. ''I think it will be difficult to find a company that makes seasons like ours with less,'' he said, reeling off ballpark figures: in Washington, 50 performances of 7 shows for $30 to $35 million, in Los Angeles 70 performances of 10 shows for about $50 million. ''The 'Ring' will cost extra,'' he added. He noted that in the fall, box office in Washington ran 10 percent ahead of projections. ''I wish we had 2,700 seats at the Kennedy Center instead of 2,200.'' Los Angeles has nearly 3,100.
 For the sake of the Freyer ''Ring'' in 2009-10, the Los Angeles company has postponed the premiere of Daniel Catan's new opera ''Il Postino'' (''The Postman''), a vehicle for Mr. Domingo and Rolando Villazon, to 2010-11. Other than the ''Ring,'' the season includes light bel canto (''L'Elisir d'Amore'' and ''The Barber of Seville''); Handel's ''Tamerlano,'' with Mr. Domingo in a rare excursion into the Baroque; and Franz Schreker's ''Gezeichneten'' (''Those Who Bear the Mark'').
 ''Die Gezeichneten'' -- billed as the first staging of a Schreker opera in the Western hemisphere -- is the next entry in the company's series Recovered Voices, dedicated to composers suppressed by the Nazis, an initiative spearheaded by Mr. Conlon. ''I support this project completely,'' Mr. Domingo said in December. ''I hope the audience will support it.''
 It could prove an increasingly hard sell. In January, Los Angeles laid off 17 staff members and cut salaries 6 to 8 percent. Performances will be reduced from 64 this season to 48. 
 So perhaps ''Tamerlano'' is a harbinger of further change. The production, by Chas Rader-Shieber, originated in Washington. And while Mr. Domingo has never ruled out transfers of productions from one of his companies to the other, they have been rare, for well-considered reasons.
 ''In Los Angeles, being close to Hollywood, I can take more risks,'' he said. Gambles generally thought to have paid off included Vincent Paterson's production of Massenet's ''Manon,'' starring Anna Netrebko in an ingenious tribute to screen sirens of yesteryear, and Mr. Freyer's staging of Berlioz's unclassifiable concert piece ''La Damnation de Faust'' as a phosphorescent carnival of the apocalypse. More questionable ventures included Deborah Drattell's ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' (in which Mr. Domingo played Rasputin) and Howard Shore's remake of ''The Fly'' (which Mr. Domingo conducted).
 ''In Washington,'' Mr. Domingo said, ''people come and go with the party in power. Supreme Court justices come to the opera. Ambassadors and senators come. Over all it's a more conservative public, and I have to be careful what I present. But in the capital of the United States, I think it's a must to have an American opera every season.''
 By the same token he liked giving his Washington ''Ring'' Ms. Zambello's American spin. And the new setting caused her in turn to rethink her production.
 ''In Houston we were thinking of oil, the destruction of the environment, oil as an equivalent for gold,'' she said recently. ''Washington, as the seat of global power, gives you a different overview. Both are relevant to the 'Ring.' ''
 The environmental awareness of Northern California, Ms. Zambello finds, gives her American ''Ring'' an inflection that is meaningful in yet a different way. In Los Angeles, the capital of the American dream, it might have taken on a different, though equally suggestive, coloration.
 What matters everywhere is a sense of place. 
 For Mr. Redden, as for Mr. Domingo, local resonance is paramount. True, Mr. Redden presents attractions imported from all corners of the globe, at Lincoln Center as well at the Spoleto Festival. Yet in both New York and Charleston, the imperative remains to be as site-specific as possible.
 ''At Lincoln Center we have to create series of events that can stand out in the context of everything else in New York,'' Mr. Redden said. ''That can mean big, like the Kirov 'Ring.' Or it can mean unusual, like 'The Secret History of the Mongols' or the complete plays of Samuel Beckett, some of which are seen very rarely, or, in ballet, the Frederick Ashton celebration. Ashton is seen in New York, but not that much.''
 ''In Charleston,'' he said, ''it's the city and the city's history that create the context.''
 Charleston, Mr. Redden likes to point out, was the site of the first known operatic performance in the American colonies, in 1735, inaugurating a lively culture of music, drama and dance that flourished into the second half of the 19th century. An architectural gem like the historic Dock Street Theater preserves the atmosphere of that time. Understandably, the festival has become a destination.
 ''We haven't had any North Dakotans yet,'' Mr. Redden said, ''but this past year, our audience came from 47 states and maybe a dozen foreign countries. My role isn't only choosing works that are wonderful but finding people who will participate by seeing them.''
 What does it take to run two festivals? ''A lot of good stuff in both places,'' Mr. Redden said. ''And for me what it takes is for the programs to be complementary, in that they're not worlds apart.'' He cited Bernd Alois Zimmermann's fiendishly complex opera ''Die Soldaten,'' which the Lincoln Center Festival presented to acclaim at the Park Avenue Armory last summer.
 ''We couldn't have done that in Charleston, because we didn't have the space,'' he said. (Cost would have been a consideration too.) ''But I was thinking about large, open spaces, because we were renovating a big black-box theater in Charleston.'' There Mr. Redden staged ''Amistad,'' Anthony Davis's opera about the capture of a slave ship by the United States in 1839, subject matter sure to resonate in the heart of the old South.
 Occasionally a Spoleto attraction travels to Lincoln Center: Basil Twist's puppet production of Respighi's Sleeping Beauty opera ''La Bella Dormente nel Bosco,'' for instance. But like most Spoleto originals ''Amistad'' would have been virtually impossible to resurrect elsewhere.
 ''To get an audience from around the country we have to do things that are unusual or do things in a way you won't see at the company next door,'' Mr. Redden said. ''This year we're doing Charpentier's 'Louise,' which isn't done often. It has some beautiful music, like the aria 'Depuis le jour,' which people know. But it's a piece that's exciting for a cast and director to do. It's a festival piece. It has to be wrestled with. This isn't 'It's Tuesday, let's do another 'Traviata.' ''
 As a man with two big opera houses to fill, Mr. Domingo is not one to spurn ''La Traviata'' or any other opera with evergreen box office appeal. ''Two things sell,'' he said. ''Names and titles.'' He continued: ''But with the more unusual operas we often have hundreds or even thousands of seats unsold at the start of the run. Then the reviews come out, and at the end there are simply no tickets -- only returns. I wish we could hang out the 'Sold Out' sign at the beginning of the season. My big dream for both coasts is for people to know us and to trust us.''

HEADLINE: What Would Mrs. Astor Say?

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
PERHAPS it is just as well that Brooke Astor, the grand dame of New York society, did not live to see the shriveling of real estate wealth and the loss of confidence now settling in on the elite blocks of the Upper East Side.
 When she died at 105 in the summer of 2007, buyers with what seemed to be bottomless bank accounts were bidding up co-ops on Fifth and Park Avenues and surrounding streets to ever-higher prices. 
 As a new report on the luxury market now makes clear, that surge in conspicuous consumption among the wealthy continued to drive the entire Manhattan real estate market higher in 2008. Even after sales of lower-priced apartments faltered, the sale of co-ops, condos and town houses costing more than $5 million set new milestones.
 The report, released last week by Stribling & Associates, found that records were set last year that are not likely to be repeated anytime soon for co-ops selling for $5 million or more. These included the highest average and median prices; the number and value of sales; and even the highest price paid for a single co-op, $48 million, for a large duplex at 1060 Fifth Avenue facing Central Park at 87th Street. The value of all luxury town house and condo sales also reached new highs. 
 ''It seems too obvious to refer to 2008 as the best of times and the worst of times, but there it is,'' wrote Kirk Henckels, the director of private brokerage at Stribling and the author of the report. 
 Late in the year buyers became wary. Many luxury co-ops priced too high in that hot market have lingered, losing their special luster in a new era of austerity, and at least some would-be buyers lost much of their liquidity in the faltering economy. 
 Asking prices were cut and cut again, including that of Mrs. Astor's 14-room duplex apartment at 778 Park Avenue, with its five wood-burning fireplaces and red lacquered library designed by Albert Hadley. It had been listed with great fanfare at $46 million with Leighton Candler of the Corcoran Group last May, when prices reached their zenith.
 But the listing had some challenges, despite Mrs. Astor's celebrity. The place needed work, and despite the vast space, the apartment designed for her was really just a very, very, very large one-bedroom. Last November, as the real estate market all but collapsed, along with segments of the finance industry, Ms. Candler threw the equivalent of a Hail Mary pass, dropping the asking price to $34 million.
 That 26 percent price cut seemed huge at the time, but as sales continued to stall in the luxury market, large price cuts on luxury apartments became commonplace. Last week the price was cut once again, this time by another 15 percent, to $29 million, and the listing was turned over to a Stribling team: Mr. Henckels and Margaret Furniss.
 Asked why they had received the listing after having been passed over last spring, Mr. Henckels said, ''We were the ones who priced it right in the first place.'' 
 During 2008, the total value of sales of Manhattan apartments declined, cutting into the profitability of many brokerage firms, leading to some layoffs and the closing of some real estate offices. 
 But Mr. Henckels's report shows that the total value of sales of co-ops valued above $5 million rose by about a third, to $1.7 billion from $1.29 billion, in 2007. At the same time, the number of sales increased by more than 20 percent, to 157 from 128 the year before. There were 20 co-op sales for more than $20 million in 2008, compared with 11 the previous year. 
 The report showed a 26 percent increase in town-house sales for more than $5 million, and a review of similar condominium sales shows an even larger increase in sales of new condos, as luxury developments were completed. 
 But the situation turned around sharply in the fall. The report found, for instance, only eight co-ops in contract for more than $5 million as of the middle of last month, compared with 79 co-ops at the same time in January 2008, a 90 percent decline. Lower-priced apartments are now driving the market, brokers say.
 Still, brokers are nothing if not optimistic. In the last week or two, several luxury brokers noted an increase in showings. 
 Last week, a newly listed two-bedroom apartment on the 13th floor of 834 Fifth Avenue was said by brokers to have stirred a bidding war, and a quick deal close to the $30 million asking price. After the deal was done, a buyer came in with an offer above the asking price, one broker said -- just like the old days.

HEADLINE: Leading Men Taking On Operatic Trials

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
BY the time this column appears, George R. Steel will have completed his first week as general manager and artistic director of the New York City Opera. But ''managing'' and ''directing'' hardly begin to describe the salvage operation Mr. Steel faces in trying to stabilize this scrappy, adventurous, financially tottering company, which has been reeling since November, when the board abruptly parted ways with Gerard Mortier, then the director-designate. 
 If the mantra of the Obama administrator is ''jobs, jobs, jobs,'' the mantra of the City Opera had better be ''funds, funds, funds.'' The company is grappling with a $15 million deficit and enduring a nearly moribund season devoid of staged productions. Despite it all, Mr. Steel exudes determination as he takes on what he called ''the opportunity of a lifetime'' in a recent interview. 
 The City Opera board has been widely criticized for what has looked to be a hapless search for a leader. In tapping Mr. Steel it made an intriguing but risky choice. He brought dynamic leadership and adventurous programming to the Miller Theater at Columbia University for 11 years. But that was a university-subsidized venture in an auditorium of just 680 seats. Mr. Steel has no record of raising the tens of millions of dollars that will be needed to resuscitate the City Opera. 
 His three-month tenure as general director of the Dallas Opera, which ended last month when, to be blunt, he abandoned that company to take the City Opera job, offers no indication of his ability to court patrons, promote opera, negotiate with unions and run a house that in recent years has needed an annual budget of some $40 million to maintain its schedule and fulfill its mission.
 Mr. Steel seems undaunted. He effusively described the City Opera as ''the most important company in the world,'' citing its history of championing unusual repertory, making opera accessible, fostering the careers of American singers and ''putting new American works on the international stage.'' Even if he comes across as blindly optimistic, his infectious enthusiasm may serve him well. 
 Paradoxically, the most sobering news Mr. Steel has heard since accepting the City Opera post could be the recent disclosure from the Metropolitan Opera that it too is facing ominous financial challenges. The Met's enviable endowment of $300 million has lost a third of its value. The situation is a potential ''disaster scenario,'' in the words of its general manager, Peter Gelb, unless budget cuts can be found and the company's unions make concessions.
 The Met's challenges, while daunting, seem not nearly severe enough to threaten its future, but the City Opera's very existence is at stake now. Whatever the case, in the coming months the Met and the City Opera will be courting a dwindling pool of hard-strapped patrons. 
 So how will the Met's financial challenges affect the City Opera, and vice versa? And what might we expect from Mr. Steel?
 Mr. Gelb, 55, has lifted the Met's profile and generated enthusiasm for opera through a range of multimedia ventures that have become models for companies everywhere. But he has also spent a huge amount of money since he took over in August 2006. Some of that, it turns out, has gone toward his own salary, which was raised by some 30 percent to more than $1 million--though this was done, Mr. Gelb said, 19 months ago, before the dimensions of the recession were clear. Last month he took a voluntary and immediate pay cut of 10 percent, and the rest of the senior staff will follow suit at the end of the season.
 In increasing the Met's publicity and outreach efforts, you could argue, Mr. Gelb was following a standard business practice: investing in the future. The Met's innovative high-definition live broadcasts to movie theaters, for example, which are being emulated by several international companies, lost money at first. But now they are paying for themselves and are hugely popular. The City Opera has long claimed a mantle as the ''people's opera.'' But the Met's HD broadcasts are starting to look like the real people's opera.
 As one indication of the success of this venture, PBS, which steadily lost interest in broadcasting performances from the Met over the years, will present all 11 of this season's HD broadcasts as part of its series ''Great Performances at the Met.'' 
 To deal with the budget woes Mr. Gelb has had to pull back plans and offer less costly substitutions for several promised revivals of important works. The Met's 2009-10 season, to be announced on Tuesday, includes a long-scheduled new production of Puccini's ''Tosca,'' directed by Luc Bondy and starring Karita Mattila, and a Met premiere production of Janacek's ''From the House of the Dead,'' directed by Patrice Chereau and conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen in his company debut. 
 But revivals of Graham Vick's gritty 1994 production of Shostakovich's searing landmark opera ''Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District'' and of Herbert Wernicke's enchanting 2001 production of Strauss's masterpiece ''Die Frau Ohne Schatten'' are being replaced by two familiar Strauss works in solid old affordable productions: ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' and ''Elektra.'' In another disappointment, a revival of John Corigliano's 1991 opera, ''The Ghosts of Versailles,'' a Met commission, is being replaced by Franco Zeffirelli's grandiose staging of Verdi's ''Traviata.''
 Losing those revivals is painful, Mr. Gelb said in a recent interview. That a planned revival of Berlioz's ''Benvenuto Cellini,'' which James Levine was eager to conduct again, has also been scrapped is especially disappointing. ''It was important to Jimmy,'' Mr. Gelb said. ''I wanted it, and the orchestra was looking forward to it.'' Still, he promises that the new season will be artistically rich and adventurous. ''What would not help us in surmounting this challenge,'' he said, ''is to eliminate or cut what it is that has been driving the revival of the Met.''
 If Mr. Steel hopes to lure new audiences with unusual repertory at the City Opera, he will first have to win over opera buffs. He engendered ill will in Dallas from understandably miffed opera lovers and critics who had expected him to usher the Dallas Opera into what looks to be a splendid new home, the Winspear Opera House, next fall. Mr. Steel was the Dallas Opera's third director in 10 years.
 He has also taken hits on Web news sites and opera blogs from commentators who question his basic knowledge of opera. If he had any interest in the standard opera repertory, he certainly didn't show it during his years at the Miller Theater. Speculation over whether Mr. Steele could name the main characters in the five most popular operas made it into the Dallas press. Asked about this, Mr. Steele simply said, ''Opera is not Trivial Pursuit.'' There is something to be said for bringing in outsiders with fresh perspectives, even at a time of crisis; maybe especially at a time of crisis. 
 Mr. Steel, 42, talks a good game in describing the potential for the City Opera, and talking a good game is a big part of a managing director's job. It is more important than ever that the City Opera stake out an exciting artistic vision for itself, and it will be Mr. Steel's task to articulate that vision and galvanize support. 
 He has a crushing financial crisis to deal with. Still, it is fun to hear him fantasize. In researching the significant operas of the last 50 years, Mr. Steel said, he was struck by how often the City Opera had done pioneering productions of those works. Ginastera's ''Don Rodrigo,'' an opera Mr. Steel is excited about, had its American premiere at the City Opera in 1966 in a production starring an emerging tenor, Placido Domingo, to inaugurate the New York State Theater (now the David H. Koch Theater).
 Mr. Steel is determined to bring back Hugo Weisgall's ''Esther,'' a City Opera commission. This craggy, fitful, atonal opera, a work of audaciousness and integrity, received a tumultuous ovation at its premiere in 1993 but has not been heard since. He is looking at novelties like Chausson's ''Roi Arthus.'' 
 He will also be sifting through the company's warehouse, where sets for dozens of productions of standard works lie idle. Mr. Steel could not say when he would be able to announce the 2009-10 season, which will almost certainly be abbreviated. The delay makes the City Opera woefully late in a field where singers are typically booked years in advance.
 Meanwhile Mr. Steel and Mr. Gelb must sit down with unions and reach agreements in these perilous economic times. They are not alone. The Los Angeles Opera has announced a 17 percent reduction in staff. The San Francisco Opera is cutting back on the ambition of its future programming. Eve Queler's intrepid Opera Orchestra of New York has canceled the remainder of its current season.
 ''Things are tough,'' Mr. Steel said.

BYLINE: Interview by DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
At the age of 80, you're about to bring out a new book, ''Bold Endeavors: How Our Government Built America and Why It Must Rebuild Now,'' an ode to the Erie Canal, the transcontinental railroad and other legends of American infrastructure. I think this is a very important subject. At the same time, because it's not Marilyn Monroe with the wind blowing, it's not so easy to write about. 
 Until now, infrastructure has not been seen as the sexiest issue. That's right, because it's such a terrible word. 
 Perhaps we need to revive the term ''public works'' or come up with a new coinage. I've tried. I thought of calling my book ''Rebuilding America.'' That is kind of yuck.
 You could also use a better name for the National Infrastructure Bank, which you're trying to create, and which is not a bank. I'll be speaking about that on Feb. 22, at the National Governors Association conference in Washington. 
 We should point out that you're the investment banker credited with solving New York's fiscal woes in 1975 and saving the city from bankruptcy. The New York City crisis was less dangerous than the current situation. Maybe for the first time in history, the U.S. is faced with doubts about its destiny. In less than 50 years, we have gone from the American Century to the American Crisis. 
 What do you make of President Obama's $800-billion-plus stimulus package? I totally support Obama, but I would argue in favor of a greater amount of infrastructure investment and probably fewer tax cuts. There should be less concern about rapid liquidation and greater emphasis on long-term investments. 
 The emphasis now seems to be on shoring up levees and making repairs to crumbling structures instead of building new ones. Repairs are very important, as is new construction, and there should be a mix of both. If we have a major nuclear program in the next 25 years, for instance, then we have to do something about the infrastructure that goes with that, from creating an energy grid to dealing with nuclear-waste disposal.
 Are you concerned about the number of students who have forsaken engineering for business school? They'll go back to being engineers after they've discovered that business school doesn't make them millions of dollars. They'll see the stock market doesn't do them much good, so they might as well do something constructive. 
 Which country do you think has the best infrastructure? France has a very good infrastructure. You get on the train in Paris to go to London, and two and half hours later you're there, and you haven't even felt a vibration. 
 In the '90s, you served as U.S. ambassador to France, where you lived as a child. Were your childhood years there happy? No. The early years of my life were very, very traumatic. It was scary, because any child knew that death was sort of lurking around Europe as far as Jews were concerned. When Hitler invaded France, we had to leave.
 What was the hardest part? Trying to get out of France. Getting to the Spanish border with my mother and my grandmother -- the border was closed. We turned around; the road was so narrow we almost couldn't turn the car around.
 How old were you then? It was 1940, so I was 12.
 You had a precarious childhood. I did have a precarious childhood. 
 I wonder if your passion for infrastructure is rooted in a fear that everything around you is about to collapse. That's possible. 
 It's unusual to write a book on infrastructure if you're not an engineer. Unless your objective is to bore people to death.

HEADLINE: Education Is All in Your Mind

BYLINE: By RICHARD E. NISBETT. 
Richard E. Nisbett, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, is the author of ''Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count.''

DATELINE: Ann Arbor, Mich. 

 BODY:
 AS Department of Education officials consider how best to spend billions from the economic stimulus plan, they would be wise to pay attention to which programs actually help children's achievement -- and keep in mind that sometimes very small influences in children's lives can have very big effects.
 Consider, for example, what the social psychologists Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson have described as ''stereotype threat,'' which hampers the performance of African-American students. Simply reminding blacks of their race before they take an exam leads them to perform worse, their research shows. 
 Fortunately, stereotype threat for blacks and other minorities can be reduced in many ways. Just telling students that their intelligence is under their own control improves their effort on school work and performance. In two separate studies, Mr. Aronson and others taught black and Hispanic junior high school students how the brain works, explaining that the students possessed the ability, if they worked hard, to make themselves smarter. This erased up to half of the difference between minority and white achievement levels. 
 Black students also perform better on an exam when it is presented as a puzzle rather than as a test of academic achievement or ability, another study has shown. These are small interventions that have big effects.
 Here's another example: Daphna Oyserman, a social psychologist at the University of Michigan, asked inner-city junior-high children in Detroit what kind of future they would like to have, what difficulties they anticipated along the way, how they might deal with them and which of their friends would be most helpful in coping. After only a few such exercises in life planning, the children improved their performance on standardized academic tests, and the number who were required to repeat a grade dropped by more than half.
 Geoffrey Cohen, a psychologist at the University of Colorado, found still another way to improve black students' test performance. He asked teachers at a suburban middle school, at the beginning of a school year, to give their seventh graders a series of assignments to write about their most important values. Afterward, the black students did well enough in all their courses to obliterate 30 percent of the difference that had existed between black and white students' grades in previous years.
 Small interventions can make a big difference even as late as the college years. Dr. Cohen and another psychologist, Gregory Walton, who is now at Stanford, hypothesized that worries about social acceptance -- which are common among all college students -- would be especially great among black students on majority-white campuses. 
 So the researchers gave a group of students at a Northeastern university a detailed report of a survey showing that most upperclassmen had once worried about feeling accepted but had ultimately come to feel at home on campus. Black students who were given this information reported that they worked harder on their schoolwork than others did, and contacted their professors more. The payoff in grade-point average erased most of the usual difference between blacks and whites at the university.
 These experiments may help explain the ''Obama effect'' on the test performance of African-Americans. Adult subjects in a study (still unpublished) answered comprehension questions from the verbal sections of the Graduate Record Examinations before and just after the presidential election. The black participants who were tested before the vote performed worse than whites; those tested immediately afterward scored almost as well as whites. 
 If simple interventions can have big effects, one might assume that bigger interventions would always be even better. But the truth is that some big interventions in education have had only minimal effects. Head Start, which places 3- and 4-year-olds in supposedly enriched classroom settings, and Early Head Start, which works with 1- to 3-year-olds, for example, have been found to have only modest effects on the children's academic achievement, and these often fade by early elementary school. Likewise, ''whole-school interventions,'' in which teams of education engineers descend on a school and change its curriculum, introduce new textbooks and train teachers -- often at great expense -- typically produce little in the way of educational gain.
 Some bigger programs have worked well, however. The Perry Preschool, which was set up in Ypsilanti, Mich., in the early 1960s, is a good example. In this school, highly trained and motivated teachers worked with groups of only six black preschoolers in educationally intensive sessions intended to help the severely disadvantaged children develop both cognitively and socially, and the teachers visited the children's families for 90 minutes every week. 
 By the time these students reached high school, almost half of them scored above the 10th percentile on the California Achievement Test, compared with only 14 percent of students in a control group. Almost two-thirds of the students who had been in the program graduated from high school, compared with only 43 percent of control students. And by age 27, one-third of the Perry children owned their own home; only 11 percent of the control students did. 
 James Heckman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the University of Chicago, has estimated that for every dollar spent on a prekindergarten like Perry, $8 has been gained in higher incomes for participants and in savings on the costs of extra schooling, crime and welfare.
 Similarly, a program called KIPP (for Knowledge Is Power Program) is having remarkable success with poor minority children in middle schools. KIPP students attend school from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., their term is three weeks longer than normal, and every other Saturday they have classes for half a day. The curriculum includes sports, visits to museums and instruction in dance, art, music, theater and photography. During one academic year, the percentage of fifth-graders at KIPP schools in the San Francisco Bay Area who scored at or above the national average on the reading portion of the Stanford Achievement Test rose to 44 percent from 25 percent. And while only 37 percent started the year at or above the national average in math, 65 percent reached that level by spring.
 Such creative programs must be tested to ensure that they work as they are meant to. The United States Department of Education's What Works Clearinghouse, which was established by the Bush administration, has the job of making public all significant evaluations of educational interventions. The Obama administration should heed the Clearinghouse's reports. Stimulus money should be spent only on programs that work well -- and on creating new programs, which in turn should be properly tested for effectiveness. 
 President Obama is in a position to not only inspire black youngsters by his example, but also make an enormous difference in their schooling -- as long as he supports successful educational interventions, from the smallest to the most ambitious.

 BODY:
THE CONSCIENCE OF A LIBERAL, by Paul Krugman. (Norton, $15.95.) Like the book by Barry Goldwater whose title it evokes, this one argues for a fundamental ideological reorientation -- in the opposite direction. Krugman, a Princeton economist and New York Times Op-Ed columnist who won the Nobel Prize last year, argues that the extreme inequality in the contemporary United States results from political choices, not economic laws. The book's strongest chapter makes the case for universal health care. Krugman ''discusses complex economic questions with rare lucidity,'' Peter Beinart wrote in The Times, and his arguments for ''fundamentally changing -- or changing back -- the relationship between America's government and its citizens'' will ''prove vital'' to the new administration. 
 SONG YET SUNG, by James McBride. (Riverhead, $15.) Set on Maryland's Eastern Shore -- Harriet Tubman territory -- this novel about antebellum fugitive slaves has a heroine reminiscent of Tubman. This is the second novel by McBride, who is best known for his memoir, ''The Color of Water.'' In the Book Review, Madison Smartt Bell praised McBride's ''dispassionate tone'' as ''a radically new way of telling this old story.'' 
 THE STAR MACHINE, by Jeanine Basinger. (Vintage, $18.95.) ''The importance of stardom has diminished over time,'' Basinger, the chairwoman of the film studies department at Wesleyan University, writes in this sprawling book. She examines the gears and levers of the old Hollywood studio machine, focusing on the careers of several stars whose experiences illustrate its operation. 
 LONG TIME LEAVING: Dispatches From Up South, by Roy Blount Jr. (Counterpoint, $15.95.) Blount, who grew up in Georgia and now lives in Massachusetts, writes that ''I hover between Southern and Northern'' and that ''part of being an American is feeling like the child of a broken home.'' This collection of essays reveals his love of language and music, his impeccable comic timing, and what short'nin' bread really is. 
 LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS: The Debates That Defined America, by Allen C. Guelzo. (Simon & Schuster, $17.) Lincoln's debates with Stephen A. Douglas in the summer and fall of 1858 have the status of myth, but they were, William Grimes wrote in The Times, ''part of an often dirty political campaign, not a series of Socratic dialogues.'' Guelzo presents the debates in context, bringing them ''back down to earth,'' Grimes said. 
 THE BEST AMERICAN HISTORY ESSAYS ON LINCOLN, edited by Sean Wilentz (Palgrave Macmillan, $16.95), collects 11 scholarly classics, including Richard Hofstadter on Lincoln and the self-made myth, and an excerpt from Edmund Wilson's ''Patriotic Gore.'' The essays, assembled for the Organization of American Historians, illustrate ''how historians' approaches to Lincoln have evolved in recent decades,'' Wilentz writes in the introduction. For more on the Lincoln literature, see William Safire's essay, beginning on this issue's cover. 
 OBEDIENCE, by Will Lavender. (Three Rivers, $13.95.) This first novel is an academic puzzle mystery, and ''it's a genuine, if slightly perverse, kick to follow every byzantine clue in this bizarre game,'' our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, said. 
 THE WAGNER CLAN: The Saga of Germany's Most Illustrious and Infamous Family, by Jonathan Carr. (Grove, $16.95.) ''The Wagner tale is a matchless mirror of Germany's convulsive rise, fearful fall and resurrection over nearly 200 years,'' Carr writes in this lively retelling, tracing the Wagners' connections to nationalism, anti-Semitism and the Fuhrer himself, as well as the recent struggle over the direction of the Bayreuth festival. 
 RECONCILIATION: Islam, Democracy, and the West, by Benazir Bhutto. (Harper Perennial, $15.99.) Bhutto finished this book days before she was assassinated in December 2007. In it she presents her vision of Islam as ''an open, pluralistic and tolerant religion'' hijacked by extremists, and her belief that Islam and the West need not find themselves on a collision course. In the Book Review, Fareed Zakaria called this a ''book of enormous intelligence, courage and clarity'' and said it ''contains the best-written and most persuasive modern interpretation of Islam I have read.'' 
 THE GREAT DERANGEMENT: A Terrifying True Story of War, Politics, and Religion, by Matt Taibbi. (Spiegel & Grau, $14.95.) This is Taibbi's nihilistic account of his travels in the months leading up to the election, which took him to Iraq, the halls of Congress, a meeting of the 9/11 truth movement and John Hagee's Texas church. Americans ''more than ever'' are ''hating instead of seeing the big picture,'' he concludes. 
 WHITE HOUSE GHOSTS: Presidents and Their Speechwriters, by Robert Schlesinger. (Simon & Schuster, $18.) The process of White House speechwriting has become much more complex since the era of Franklin Roosevelt, Schlesinger shows in this lively history, although the best ghostwriters are still so in tune with the boss that they sound and think like him. Today, with speechwriters advertising their contributions, ''the White House ghosts'' have ''come fully into view,'' Schlesinger observes.

HEADLINE: Why Television Still Shines in a World of Screens

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SUBSCRIBERS to print newspapers have gone missing, as everyone knows. Book publishers are also wondering where readers have disappeared to.
 And yet television stands out as the one old-media business with surprising resilience. Though we are spending a record amount of time online, including a record amount of time watching video, we are also watching record amounts of very old-fashioned television, according to Nielsen Media Research. Our attachment to the medium, of course, is obscured by the splintering of our attention across so many cable offerings, in addition to the major networks. 
 Why is the newspaper business losing readers at an accelerated rate while television viewership is stronger than ever? Here's a speculative idea: A tipping point has been passed in the competition between print and screen that has been under way since the beginnings of broadcast TV and now continues with video and other media. 
 Consumers are increasingly avoiding newspapers -- and books, too -- because the text mode is now used so infrequently that it can feel like a burden. People are showing a clear preference for a fully formed video experience that comes ready to play on a screen, requiring nothing but our passive attention. 
 The video mode has been reinforced by the rise of YouTube. In December, almost 100 million viewers in the United States watched 5.9 billion YouTube videos, according to comScore. Tellingly, YouTube has not cannibalized TV viewership -- it has instead carved out another chunk of our leisure time for video on a screen.
 As enamored as advertisers are with the interactive potential of digital advertising, they know that online is a complement to offline, not its replacement. ''With television, it's easier to get a large audience in one fell swoop,'' said Shane Ankeney, an executive with the advertising agency TBWA/Chiat/Day. 
 Consider that the average American household consists of 2.7 persons and contains 2.9 television sets, in front of which we sit for record-setting spells, according to Nielsen figures. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, the typical American watched 142 hours of television monthly, up about five hours from the same quarter the previous year. Internet use averaged more than 27 hours monthly, an increase of an hour and a half, according to Nielsen.
 We are so smitten with screens that we often can't bear to choose one over another: 31 percent of Internet use occurs while we're in front of a TV set. We are also taking an interest in watching video on our phones: 100 million handsets are video-capable. 
 You now hear talk in the advertising trade of our ''three screens'': television, the Internet and mobile devices. When I asked representatives of major ad agencies about how they chose the optimal mix of media for clients, I was led back, again and again, to television. That's not just because it remains the one place where an advertiser can gather a truly mass audience for a single commercial message, but also because it provides what advertisers call an ''immersive experience.''
 We used to speak of reading a book as an immersive experience, too, but ''immersive'' now seems shorthand for ''video on a screen.''
 We can also see how the expansion of screen culture entails more than just moving text from a printed page to a screen. It also means less text, more video, less reading and more watching, online or offline.
 Television is not wholly recession-proof. As results for the fourth quarter come in, we'll see ugly numbers. The Walt Disney Company reported its earnings last week, and the news was nothing but bad for ABC, whose operating income dropped significantly because of lower ad revenue. But this seems to be more a result of the disappearance of car dealership advertising in local TV markets than permanent abandonment of the medium by national brand advertisers. .
 Advertisers follow viewers wherever they happen to be. Online, of course, the healthiest category of advertising is search-related. Google's revenue, most of which comes from search, was $21.8 billion in 2008, up 31 percent from 2007.
 But once that special case is put aside, online advertisers have a stark choice: The first option is placing display ads at very inexpensive rates, thanks to an overabundance of supply, but these disappear in the vast ocean of the Web: some 4.5 trillion display ads were shown to United States Internet users in 2008, according to comScore.
 Or advertisers can use ads that resemble television commercials and match those to the online content that most resembles television -- because it actually is television programming. Hulu, which was created by NBC and Fox, offers many TV shows online and had a 57 percent increase in viewership in the last six months of 2008.
 Greg Kahn, a senior vice president for the advertising agency Optimedia International, said news Web sites must sell their advertising space at low rates because ''you can get news anytime, anywhere.'' Hulu, on the other hand, commands rates that are higher per thousand viewers than those paid for the same programming offline, he said. 
 ''Online, the amount of professionally produced video is limited,'' Mr. Kahn said. 
 MARKETERS often cite a quote generally attributed to John Wanamaker, the pioneer department store merchant: ''Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half.'' In the absence of hard data on how many people actually saw an ad in predigital times, advertisers were willing to give print media the benefit of the doubt. That's no longer the case.
 Even if print media could give advertisers all the metrics they desired, they would still struggle to hold on to readers who are required to, well, read. Or perhaps that requirement can be eased. Last week, HarperCollins released its first ''video book,'' a presentation by the author Jeff Jarvis about his just-published book, ''What Would Google Do?'' The downloadable, unabridged audio version of the book runs nine hours and costs $27.99, a bargain compared with the video, which is only 23 minutes and costs $9.99.
 An audible book, however, requires the listener to mentally visualize the narrative. A video, even if no more visual than an author facing the camera, offers the appealing prospect of relief from such heavy lifting. 
 In screen culture, video rules.

HEADLINE: A Condo Toughens Its Stance and Tightens Its Belt

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
GALVANIZED by a rash of arrears, the St. Tropez -- a 34-year-old 301-unit condominium on East 64th Street and First Avenue -- scrambled into battle station mode last year. 
 ''We've had maybe one or two arrearages on a regular basis since 2006 when I got on the board,'' said Marc Held, a member until December. ''And then last year it went to 10 or 12 who were 60 days past due, a five- to tenfold increase. I don't think there was any particular pattern -- they were mostly unit owners who have fallen hard in this economy.''
 Breaking from a longstanding posture of leniency, the board directed its lawyer, Adam Leitman Bailey, to file liens after three months of nonpayment. Almost everyone paid.
 The board also began collecting one or two years' worth of common charges in escrow from buyers with less than stellar credit histories. (One has since defaulted.)
 ''We also found new ways to generate revenue,'' Mr. Held said. ''We found extra space in the basement and created 43 storage bins and rented them out to unit owners. 
 ''We also converted space behind the security desk into office space for a podiatrist, and the commercial rent out of that has been amazing. We changed our bulbs to more energy-saving fluorescent bulbs and took one bulb out of every fixture, which saves us $20,000 a year in electricity. And we changed our managing agent -- they're 35 to 45 percent cheaper than our old one.'' 
 Still, Mr. Held is chilled by what the St. Tropez's arrearages portend for the city at large.
 ''We have some of the lowest common charges -- they range from $400 for a one-bedroom to $1,200 for a three-bedroom -- and so many people here have so much equity in their apartment.
 ''People in other buildings have a lot more taxes, less equity and higher common charges. What we're going through has to be just the cusp of what's going on in Manhattan.''TERI KARUSH ROGERS

HEADLINE: Farm Life, Subsidized By a Job Elsewhere

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
EVER thought of chucking it all and moving to the country? According to the Agriculture Department, an increasing number of Americans are doing just that, by embracing a ''Green Acres'' lifestyle. But few of them are making a living at it: more often than not, their work in the fields is subsidized by an off-the-farm job.
 The Agriculture Department came out with its Census of Agriculture last week, and the headline was that the number of farms increased by 4 percent from 2002 to 2007, with most of the new farms being small, part-time operations. 
 A closer look at the numbers shows that American farming is becoming a story of extremes: of really big farms and really small ones. Consider that about 900,000 of the nation's 2.2 million farms generated $2,500 or less in sales in 2007.
 By contrast, 5 percent of total farms, about 125,000 operations, accounted for 75 percent of agricultural production.
 The new agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, has acknowledged the problem and vowed to do something about it. As a former governor of Iowa, he knows firsthand that farmers with a few hundred acres are being outbid for land by farmers with a few thousand. That consolidation is fueled by farm payments that tend to benefit the largest farms.
 The question is: What, if anything, can he do about it?
 In an interview on Friday, Mr. Vilsack said the agency would encourage income opportunities -- like energy production, carbon sequestration, conservation and ecotourism -- that go beyond just crops and livestock. ''You have to take a holistic approach and create the understanding that the whole thing is diversification,'' he said.
 There's no shortage of farms that could use his help, from the midsize family farm in Iowa to part-time operations trying to eke out a profit, as the census makes clear. 
 While profits were robust for some farmers in recent years, attributable to steep price increases fueled by ethanol and global demand for food crops, only 1 million of the 2.2 million American farms reported positive income from agriculture. The remainder rely on nonfarm income to cover farm expenses and a rural lifestyle.
 The percentage of farmers who had off-the-farm jobs increased to 65 percent in 2007, from 55 percent five years earlier.
 ''We try to dispel any myths that it will be easy,'' said Amy Bacigalupo, program organizer for the Farm Beginnings program in Minnesota, a course for new farmers. She said the costs of land and health care are major obstacles for most would-be farmers.
 The agriculture census comes out every five years, providing a snapshot of rural America. The number of farms in America peaked in 1935, at 6.8 million, and declined for several decades after that. In the last two decades, however, it has plateaued between 2 million and 2.5 million.
 The average farmer today is a 57-year-old white man who farms 418 acres and generates $135,000 in agricultural sales. But American farmers are becoming more diverse.
 From 2002 to 2007, the number of female farmers grew nearly 30 percent, to 306,200. The number of Hispanic farmers increased 10 percent, and the number of black and Asian farmers also grew, but more modestly. The number of Native American farmers more than doubled, a jump that officials attribute in part to better reporting.
 About a third of farms were residential/lifestyle farms, meaning that they generated less than $250,000 in sales and that the farmer had another job as a primary occupation. While most farms raise cattle or grow crops, a growing number are focused on niche areas of agriculture, like selling at farmers markets, creating energy and growing organics. There were about 18,200 organic farms in 2007, compared with about 12,000 in 2002.
 Among the new members of the rural class is Jennifer Miller, who grew up on the outskirts of Chicago and married Andrew Miller, a mushroom expert who now works at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Three years ago, they began raising goats on a 15-acre farm in Sidney, Ill., and are now on the brink of turning a profit. They sell meat directly to consumers.
 Ms. Miller, who is 35 and a veterinarian, said she takes great pride in raising the animals but acknowledges that farm life has its challenges, ''The worst part right now is doing chores at 6 in the morning when it's 10 below.''
 Flowers are what drew Robin Moore to farming a few years out of Macalester College in Minnesota, where she studied French literature. Frustrated by a desk job, she interned at a farm one summer to consider her future and was assigned to tend the flower beds. 
 ''I loved everything about it,'' she said. ''I really couldn't go back to an office after that.''
 Ms. Moore, 35, lives in western Minnesota, where she sells flowers to people in the area and for events like weddings, tends a vineyard and does some blacksmithing to make ends meet. ''I don't make a lot of money, but that's a conscious choice I made,'' she said.
 Mr. Vilsack said he hoped his agency could link small farmers with creative new market opportunities, like institutional buyers and government nutrition programs. He said he also hoped to expand off-farm jobs in rural America. ''There's real opportunities to create a new rural economy,'' he said.

THE WHISKEY REBELS
 By David Liss
 525 pp. Random House. $26
 If you like the idea of ''sin'' taxes as a way for the government to raise revenue, be aware that Alexander Hamilton got there first. In Federalist No. 12, he called for taxing drinkers to help finance the new federal government. A levy on spirits importation, he argued, would also be of benefit ''to the morals, and to the health of the society'' by curbing the ''national extravagance'' of consuming spirits. Sound familiar? 
 As history relates, the scheme backfired badly when Hamilton pushed it through in modified form as an excise. Plausible enough on its surface (no one, after all, is obliged to drink liquor), the tax in practice laid oppressive burdens on the settlers of the western frontier, for whom whiskey was the one solidly profitable article of production, grain itself not being economical to ship east over the mountains. And the same frontier was the section of the new nation where ready money to pay the tax was scarcest. The resulting turmoil, which has come to be known as the Whiskey Rebellion, set aflame the Appalachian region until, in 1794, George Washington marched an army into western Pennsylvania to put it down. The widely evaded tax had collected little revenue, and Congress eventually repealed it. 
 Despite its title, David Liss's latest historical thriller uses the frontier revolt only as a springboard to its real story, the emergence of Hamiltonian finance capitalism back east. As Treasury secretary, in the words of one of the characters in ''The Whiskey Rebels,'' Hamilton ''had single-handedly transformed the country from a republican beacon for mankind into a paradise for speculators.'' Such at least were the views of the Jeffersonians, who bitterly opposed Hamilton's fledgling Bank of the United States and felt vindicated when his restoration of public credit (via repayment of state war debt) led to a bubble of speculation in government securities that was to culminate in the Panic of 1792. Of the financiers laid low in that panic, the most prominent was a high-rolling New Yorker (and, briefly, aide to Hamilton at the Treasury Department) named William Duer, whose double-dealings stank badly even by the relaxed ethical standards of that day. 
 The book's two central characters (also its two narrators) follow separate paths that converge on the Duer scandal. Ethan Saunders, a spy for General Washington during the Revolution, is living in disgrace in Philadelphia after falling under suspicion of traitorous dealings with the British, while his lady love has married one of the book's many villains.Clearing his name and reclaiming her are just a matter of time. Meanwhile, spirited young Joan Maycott and her husband, lured west by promises of land, realize too late that Duer and his cronies have gulled them into a worthless deal. They make a success on the frontier anyway in whiskey distilling, but lose everything to a landlord of fabulous rapacity. Bent on revenge, Mrs. Maycott, along with other ruined farmers, returns east in search of Duer,their aim to ''destroy him and save the nation from Hamilton.'' As the panic nears, the stories merge in a single hard-to-follow tangle of intrigue. 
 You may have noticed a problem here: the Whiskey Rebellion climaxed in 1794, too late for its leaders (even in a novelist's fancy) to have instigated the Panic of 1792. To solve that problem, Liss pulls his characters back from the frontier action halfway through the book and never returns to it, thus missing out on a great mass of colorful detail from the real-life Whiskey Rebellion (mobs of men disguised as women, the threatened pillaging of Pittsburgh). Instead, following his bent for financial chicanery in earlier novels like ''A Conspiracy of Paper'' and ''The Coffee Trader,'' he indulges in a fascination -- which I doubt will be shared by most readers -- with the arcana of bond issues, collateral, short-selling and discount rates. Equally numbing, Liss's jackhammer ''capitalism is not your friend'' social commentary comes across like Naomi Klein without the light touch. Most of his speculators and big landlords are so dastardly that they'd need to be nuanced up before even an old-line Maoist would let them into a rewrite of ''Red Detachment of Women.'' 
 To leaven the dough, there's plenty of action: ambushes and roadblocks, code-breaking and party-crashing, trailing of suspects through city streets, errant wives, nasty landladies, assumed identities and on and on. (Just as on TV, it's a good bet that the question ''Who sent out the cutthroat assassins?'' will turn out to have as an answer ''The respectable businessman.'') And yet the real-life Hamilton is presented in an oddly colorless fashion (as is Washington, in a cameo), perhaps because Liss appears unsure about how closely to associate these figures with the overall gangland atmosphere. 
 Finally, though, the book's peculiar aftertaste doesn't derive from its anachronisms (I don't believe 1790s speakers used words like ''parameters'' or ''womanizer'' in their modern sense, and I know they didn't boast of reading Macaulay, as does the heroine, since that historian wasn't born until 1800) but from the fact that it traffics in the sort of musty populist caricatures of Hamilton and his era that Ron Chernow laid to rest in his 2004 biography. Another whiskey, please, bartender, and this time, leave off the tax.

HEADLINE: With Credit Frozen, Developers Downshift

BYLINE: By DIANA MARSZALEK

 BODY:
LESS than a year ago, New Rochelle leaders were banking their city's future on a new wave of development, a multitude of projects designed to restore vibrancy to downtown. The plans included apartment towers with brand names like Trump and a Long Island Sound shoreline with high-end housing and canals for small boats.
 Across the county in Yonkers -- where much of the riverfront has been developed only for industry -- local leaders had their hopes pegged to big-name builders' proposals to overhaul the downtown and waterfront, creating neighborhoods with perks like water taxi service to New York City and a minor league baseball park.
 At the same time, White Plains, the epicenter of Westchester retailing, was benefiting from having its large-scale projects completed before the full effect of the current economic crisis hit. 
 ''Most of our primary development, thank God, was finished just under the wire,'' said Paul Wood, the White Plains executive officer. With destination stores from Neiman Marcus to Wal-Mart, a Ritz-Carlton hotel and desirable downtown apartments, White Plains was on a roll and other developers wanted in, officials said. 
 Today, however, such visions of Westchester's future do not look as rosy, primarily because of the financial meltdown that, in some cases, has brought the business of construction to a halt, developers and local leaders said.
 ''It's a mess,'' said Geoffrey Thompson, of the public relations firm Thompson & Bender and a spokesman for Cappelli Enterprises, Core Plus Properties and other developers. ''No one saw anything of this magnitude coming.''
 With banks not lending money readily, retailers facing dismal sales and the housing market woefully hurt, now is hardly prime time for investors to spend millions or billions creating a new vision of Westchester, developers said. 
 Though some large-scale projects, most notably those aimed at turning around sections of New Rochelle and Yonkers, are still working their way through the cities' approval processes, developers say they are more likely now to delay timetables, tweak proposals to better reflect market conditions and hunker down for a while until the financial storm blows over.
 With many projects already delayed by at least a year, the development community is bracing to see what happens this spring, when activity typically picks up after dormant winter months.
 One of the biggest developers weathering the turmoil is Cappelli Enterprises, which is in the midst of repositioning New Roc City in downtown New Rochelle as a retail center more than as an entertainment complex; is pursuing its plan to build office, retail and hotel space at LeCount Square, also in downtown New Rochelle; and is a partner in the $1.6 billion redevelopment plan for downtown Yonkers.
 Having already spent millions of dollars and several years on getting such projects approved, Cappelli is moving ahead as planned, said Joseph V. Apicella, its executive vice president.
 Doing so in these tough times, however, means proceeding cautiously to reduce the risks associated with such projects, thus making them more viable when conditions improve, he said.
 ''Smart money positions itself to be able to withstand the storm while at the same time laying the groundwork for when the storm blows over,'' Mr. Apicella said. 
 Altering proposals to reflect market demand, initiating or financing projects in stages and creating partnerships with public agencies are some of those steps, he said. 
 So is slowing down the process. The developer Forest City Ratner has asked New Rochelle to formally delay approval of its proposed $450 million Echo Bay waterfront revitalization project. That means the mixed-use project will most likely break ground in early 2011 rather than 2010, officials said.
 In White Plains, the developers of three residential projects have asked for extensions, Mr. Wood said. Another, the developer LCOR's construction of 538 apartments, including 100 affordable units, on Bank Street near the train station, appeared to be in jeopardy when its primary investor, Lehman Brothers, went out of business, Mr. Wood said. That project was salvaged by securing financing in stages from other lenders, he said.
 ''It's not that progress and development and new business can't happen,'' Mr. Apicella said. ''It's just more of a laborious process, it's much more expensive and it needs to be approached much more creatively.''
 For Cappelli, that also means making concessions, like accepting tenants at lower rents rather than having no tenants, Mr. Apicella said. After spending $50 million so New Roc City could accommodate tenants like Target and Kohl's, it would be bad business to let the space sit empty rather than get business moving, even if at a reduced rate, he said.
 ''I'd rather get $18 a square foot for the next 10 years than zero for the next two,'' he said. 
 Some sites may stay as they are for the time being.
 For example, the former United Hospital site in Port Chester, a redevelopment candidate, will most likely stay dormant in the immediate future, real estate analysts said. And in New Rochelle, plans to build a condominium tower on the site of a downtown parking garage were scrapped when the housing market crashed, Mayor Noam Bramson said.
 ''We are in the midst of a generational effort to revitalize our economy and have made great progress in the last decade,'' he said. ''We always understand, though, that the pace of progress can quicken or slow based on the overall economic environment, and it is reasonable to expect that the current down cycle will impact us to some degree.''
 Even projects already under construction -- Forest City Ratner's $600 million Ridge Hill development in Yonkers, for example, with shopping, entertainment, office and hotel space -- are facing less certain futures than they were a year ago, real estate analysts said. 
 With the retail outlook bleak, many stores are more apt this year to scale back or close than expand, meaning not only will new space be hard to fill, but there may also be new vacancies in existing space as well, real estate developers said.
 Businesses that do move into new space will most likely pay rents far lower than originally expected, so developers, municipalities and investors may not recoup their investments as planned, some developers said. 
 At the same time, consumers are not spending as much, casting doubts on the premise that new construction will bring jobs, tax dollars and vibrancy to Westchester with it.
 ''The wealth destruction that has taken place has created a black hole that has sucked a lot of purchasing power into it,'' said G. Lamont Blackstone, a Mount Vernon-based consultant and developer who works with municipalities on development issues.
 Still, developers, analysts and municipal officials say they still believe in the merits of development and plan to continue their pursuits once flusher times return.
 In White Plains, Core Plus Properties still intends to start building the Venue, a high-end shopping destination for about 15 tenants, said Frank Gallo, its managing partner. He expects to start construction this spring.
 Chuck Lesnick, the Yonkers City Council president, said that despite uncertain times he was confident that the new space being created by developments already under way, like Ridge Hill, would ultimately be filled, though by which companies and retailers may ultimately be decided by the whims of the marketplace.
 Real estate officials said that despite current economic hardships, models of new development, which create places where people can live, work and play instead of isolated shopping centers and office parks, have already proved themselves in places like White Plains, which has both transformed its downtown and become the area's No. 1 shopping destination.
 In turn, moving forward still makes sense, they said.
 ''To do anything other than that would be just plain bad business,'' Mr. Apicella said.

HEADLINE: Ruling Sets Back Oyster Bay Mall Plan

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
THE Appellate Division in Brooklyn has overturned a State Supreme Court justice's strongly worded order that compelled the Town of Oyster Bay to issue a special use permit, against its will, allowing construction of a long-debated luxury mall in Syosset.
 The appellate ruling, the most favorable yet for the town in its eight-year court fight with the mall developer, Taubman Centers Inc. of Michigan, is a major new hurdle for the proposed 750,000-square-foot mall. Taubman, which acknowledged that the $500 million project faced new delays, called the ruling flawed and said it would seek to appeal. 
 The town supervisor, John Venditto, said the ruling ''moves us back to the fundamental principle here that a lower court should never have substituted its judgment for that of the duly elected Town Board.'' He said the town would contest an appeal.
 Todd Fabricant, the chairman of the Cerro Wire Coalition, an association of 32 civic groups that oppose the mall and intervened in the case, said the end of the fight might be near, with the coalition winning. 
 ''With this decision from the appellate court, the mall is dead,'' said Mr. Fabricant, of Jericho. 
 The coalition, whose members say the mall would clog streets with traffic, lower home values and doom local stores, is named for a former tenant on the 39-acre industrial site next to the Long Island Expressway where the mall would be built.
 If the appellate decision stands, Taubman would be required to perform new environmental studies to augment those it submitted to the town in 2000 for what were then plans for an 840,000-square-foot mall. That would put it back near the beginning of the approval process.
 Stephen J. Kieras, Taubman's senior vice president of development, said in a statement, ''We are disappointed that the mall will continue to be delayed, especially during these economic times when jobs are scarce and tax revenue is so desperately needed.'' 
 Taubman estimated the project would create more than 5,000 construction and permanent jobs and $40 million in annual tax revenues. Its statement gave no hint that the company was ready to abandon it in the face of the current retailing slump. 
 ''We are currently evaluating the impact of this court decision on the company's financial statements,'' said Lisa A. Payne, Taubman's vice chairman and chief financial officer. 
 Taubman has said Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Barneys New York would anchor the mall.
 The town and the Cerro coalition have urged Taubman to support an alternative plan that includes housing for young adults and the elderly, a hotel and retail shops. 
 ''They should abandon their plans for the mall and embrace this alternate development concept,'' said Howard D. Avrutine, a lawyer for three civic associations in the coalition. ''They don't have to go away with their tail between their legs.'' 
 In a unanimous appellate ruling, dated Jan. 27, the four-judge panel said the Oyster Bay Town Board had acted properly in requiring Taubman to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement before the town would consider the special permit.
 It also said the town had properly identified a number of issues not covered in the 2000 environmental impact statement. They included the mall's impact on traffic, residential real estate prices and existing retail businesses in the area.
 The findings overturned a ruling by Acting Justice Jeffrey A. Spinner of State Supreme Court, who last June ordered the town to issue the special permit. 
 Justice Spinner said the town had offered no clear reasons why a supplemental environmental study was needed and had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in demanding one. He also said that the town had engaged in ''continuing obstinacy and persistent obfuscatory obstructionism'' to thwart Taubman and the courts.
 The appellate justices said Justice Spinner had erred in ruling that the Town Board's request for the study was arbitrary and capricious. It also upheld the town's authority to have the last word as the lead agency under the provisions of the State Environmental Quality Review Act. 
 ''Justice Spinner roughed us up, but now the Appellate Division has restored order,'' Mr. Venditto said.

Beyond the Malls
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Our Love Affair With Malls Is on the Rocks'' (Feb. 1): 
 Is it time to focus on new measures of economic progress? 
 Consumer spending beyond our means got us into the current crisis, and now consumer spending beyond our means is supposed to get us out. But shouldn't we redirect our focus from consumption spending to other pursuits?
 Economists have developed a habit of measuring and reporting retail sales, housing sales and consumer confidence as if our lives depended on these measures. As with other self-fulfilling hypotheses, this one has come to pass. To wean ourselves from this dependence, we have to start developing alternative measures of economic progress, and focus on them. What about job creation in green industries, or college affordability? 
 Carolin Schellhorn, Ph.D.
 Philadelphia, Feb. 2
 The writer is an assistant professor of finance at St. Joseph's University.
 To the Editor: 
 There is a middle way for us to approach those seductive shopping malls, and to deal with our shopping habits: by allowing ourselves indulgences that we can actually afford. It's not that hard a path once you become accustomed to it. 
 We can give incentives to our youth to learn personal financial management, perhaps by waiving the learner's permit fee for young drivers if they take a class in basic financial principles. It would cost a lot less than another bailout. 
 The class could teach a few simple principles: that credit card bills do have to be paid eventually, that if something sounds too good to be true it probably is, and that money does grow on trees -- trees called hard work, sensible saving and prudent spending.

HEADLINE: And Baby Makes How Many?

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
THE comment from the photographer at Sears was typical. ''Are these all yours?'' she asked, surveying Kim Gunnip's 12 children.
 ''No,'' Mrs. Gunnip replied, ''I picked some up at the food court.'' 
 But it was harder to find a retort for the man in line at the supermarket, who said within earshot of her youngest children, ''You must have a great sex life.''
 Now her family, like other larger families, as they call themselves, is facing endless news coverage of the octuplets born in California and a new round of scorn, slack jaws and stupid jokes.
 Back when the average woman had more than three children, big families were the Kennedys of Hickory Hill and Hyannis Port, ''Cheaper by the Dozen,'' the Cosbys or ''Eight is Enough'' -- lovable tumbles of offspring as all-American in their scrapes as in their smiles. 
 But as families have shrunk, and parents helicopter over broods tinier yet more precious, a vanload of children has taken on more of a freak show factor. The families know the stereotypes: they're polygamists, religious zealots, reality-show hopefuls or Quebecois in it for the per-child government bonus. And isn't there something a little obsessive about Angelina Jolie's quest for her own World Cup soccer team? 
 ''Look at the three shows on TLC that have bigger families,'' said Meagan Francis, the 31-year-old author of ''Table for Eight,'' which stems from her experience raising four children (she is expecting her fifth next month). ''One is about religious fundamentalists, one has sextuplets, the other is a family of little people,'' she said, referring to, respectively, the Duggars of ''17 Kids and Counting,'' ''Jon and Kate Plus Eight'' and ''Little People, Big World,'' about two dwarfs raising four children, three of average stature, on a pumpkin farm in Oregon.
 ''You get the feeling,'' Ms. Francis added, ''that anybody who has more than three kids is either doing it for bizarre reasons or there's a medical anomaly.''
 In the last several days, the British government's environmental adviser declared it ''irresponsible'' to have more than two children. And Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, asserted that including contraception in the stimulus package could reduce government spending. Ms. Pelosi, herself the mother of five, was arguing against unwanted pregnancies, not families who choose to have big broods. But no matter -- larger families see the attacks piling up.
 On Internet forums and blogs, like lotsofkids.com and largerfamilies.com, the mothers defend themselves against the accusations that they can't possibly give each child enough love or that they are hogging the earth's scarce resources. They resist, and resent, efforts to lump them with the Duggars, the Jon and Kates and the octuplets. 
 Many mothers, in fact, shared the revulsion and the ethical questions about the in vitro fertilization that led to the birth of the eight babies by the unwed and unemployed California mother. Yet they also say that the reaction to her turned harsh only when it was revealed that she had six additional children. Octuplets were amazing; 14 is gross.
 Referring to a news show correspondent who seemed ''disgusted'' by the story, one mother on lotsofkids.com wrote, ''I wanted to bounce her judgmental little head off a wall.'' 
 Ms. Francis, the founder of largerfamilies.com, said, ''I can't imagine having 14 children, but I do think it's possible to raise 14 and do a great job.''
 She continued: ''People feel like they have some say or some ownership over your kids or the way kids are being raised. It's this symbol of who you are and your values.''
 If large families are the stuff of spectacle, it is partly because they have become rarer.
 In 1976, census data show, 59 percent of women ages 40 to 44 had three or more children, 20 percent had five or more and 6 percent had seven or more. 
 By 2006, four decades after the Supreme Court declared a constitutional right to use birth control (and the last year available from census studies), 28 percent of women ages 40 to 44 had three or more children, 4 percent had five or more and just 0.5 percent had seven or more.
 ''Three is still O.K.,'' said Michelle Lehmann, the founder of lotsofkids.com and a mother of eight children who lives outside Chicago. ''When you have four, people start raising eyebrows. When you go to five, people are like, 'No way.' ''
 Beyond 10? ''They think you are lying,'' said Mrs. Gunnip, who also writes two blogs for so-called mega-families, those with eight or more children. 
 Leslie Leyland Fields, a mother of six in Kodiak, Alaska, recalled her boss's response when she announced she was pregnant with her fifth child and resigning as a professor at a state college: ''This is what, your 9th or 10th?'' 
 Ms. Fields, who had four children and then two unexpected but welcome pregnancies in her 40s, said, ''Inevitably, people would come up to me in a patronizing way, sidle me away and whisper, 'Let me tell you how this happens.' '' 
 In a 2006 article, ''The Case for Kids,'' in Christianity Today, Ms. Fields lamented new social norms that assume that multiple children burden the goals of educated, professional women: ''The smart, ambitious, fully realized 21st-century woman chooses career. The ambitionless woman has children.''
 In an interview, Ms. Fields added: ''Choosing to have a large domestic life is often seen as negating the professional and the public. I think it's very healthy and wonderful to have a foot in both worlds.''
 With more children, she had to change jobs, but her career, she said, has become more fulfilling: she teaches graduate students instead of undergraduates now, requiring less time in the classroom, which has allowed her to write three more books.
 ''The criticism feels elitist,'' she said. ''It's coming from educated people, which makes me think, You have no excuse for thinking in such stereotypes.''
 The article in Christianity Today unleashed a flood of hate mail. One reader wrote in all capital letters: ''Did it ever occur to you that if you really want to serve God you should have less children so you'd have more time to serve God?'' (''You can't enter into debate with people who have that kind of rage,'' Ms. Fields said.)
 With anecdotes of a boomlet in larger families in places like the Upper East Side of Manhattan and select pockets of suburbia, large families are presumed to be either really rich, having children as status symbols, or really poor, living off the dole and completely devoid of culture. 
 The hayseed assumption prompts a howl from Barbara Curtis, mother of 12, ages 8 to 39, in Loudoun County, Va. ''They expect me to come crawling in from Appalachia or something,'' she said. In fact, she is a Montessori teacher, and her husband is a commercial accounts manager for an auto company. One son is entering a graduate program in opera, and another was in New York last week auditioning for a theater touring company. Her sixth son was the only National Merit Scholar finalist in his high school class, she said. 
 Mrs. Curtis illustrates one of the many ways that families grow so large: she had two children from her first marriage, then, with her second husband, seven in 10 years. One of those children had Down syndrome, so they adopted another Down syndrome child, believing two would grow up happier together. Since then, they have twice accepted requests to adopt another child with Down syndrome.
 ''Children are a kind of wealth,'' Mrs. Curtis said. ''Just not the kind of wealth our society tends to focus on.''
 Still, for many mega-families, existence is hard. Their homes are usually cramped; college often means community college. Parents work long hours on top of the demands of raising so many children. And while the census does not break out income statistics for larger families, women without a high school diploma have about one more child on average than women with graduate or professional degrees. 
 Mrs. Gunnip is a homemaker in upstate New York, and her husband works as a supervisor in a county sewer department. She says they could qualify for public assistance but choose not to apply, believing others need it more. ''I can't say how we do it, and on paper it looks like we don't do it, but there's always a way,'' she said. ''My kids never go hungry. They do activities they want to do, we go on vacation. We don't go to Disney, but we go camping.'' 
 Many large families are religious, and some follow the QuiverFull movement, which takes encouragement for big families in Psalm 127: children are the gift of the Lord, ''as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man,'' and ''happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.''
 Those beliefs can run headlong into environmental concerns. At 6.8 billion people, the world population has more than tripled in the last century, and demographers expect it to exceed 9 billion by midcentury. 
 ''Every single person has multiple impacts on multiple environmental resources,'' said Alan Weisman, the author of ''The World Without Us,'' which advocates a one-child policy to return the world to early 20th century population levels. ''It's a no-brainer that the more people there are, the more stress there is on an ecosystem that doesn't get any bigger.''
 Parents of large families counter that they have an economy of scale: a light bulb lights a room whether there are 4 people or 14. Their children learn not to take long showers, to share space, to appreciate hand-me-down toys, clothes and books.
 ''Large families are some of the greenest families,'' Mrs. Gunnip said. ''They don't tend to have a lot of money, so they make sure things go as far as they can.''
 And besides, they say, the birth rate in the United States is barely at the level needed to replace the population. Total fertility rate, which predicts the number of children an average woman will have in her lifetime, reached 2.1, considered replacement level, in 2006, but it was the first time it had been that high since 1971. A small percentage of large families, they say, is not enough to tip the balance.
 As for whether their children suffer a poverty of time and attention, parents of large families say they make better parents. For while spending time with each child individually is possible, hovering is not.
 ''You have to let go of a lot of the ideas of the kind of parent you wanted to be,'' Ms. Francis said. ''That's not a bad thing. If you hold on to the idea that you can control everything, well, you can't. They become their own people. With big families, it gets beaten out of you.''
 As for the other pointed questions about large families, defenders have developed standard comebacks, lists of which circulate on the Internet.
 How can you afford so many? ''Lifestyles are expensive, not kids.''
 Don't you know what causes that? ''Oh, yes, I now wash my husband's underwear separately.''
 Do you get any time for yourselves? ''Obviously, or we wouldn't have six kids.''

HEADLINE: Losing the Glint of the Golden Years

BYLINE: By MOINA NOOR

 BODY:
FIVE years after retiring as a pharmacist, Marvin Ganek, 75, is working again. In November, he got a part-time job as a driver for an outpatient health clinic.
 ''I need the extra income,'' said Mr. Ganek, of Parsippany, N.J. He has seen his 401(k) plan lose 30 percent of its value since the stock market crashed in late September. 
 ''I took a big hit,'' he said, explaining why he went back to work. ''I can't twiddle my thumbs and wait for things to get better.'' 
 While the financial crisis is affecting everyone, the recession is hitting older people in a unique way. Many of them, like Mr. Ganek, are on fixed incomes. They saved diligently and were relying on their investments and 401(k) plans to see them through the rest of their lives. Now they are watching those savings shrivel up by the day, knowing that they have fewer years to see those investments recover. 
 ''There is no real precedent for what is happening right now to seniors,'' said Donald Ciosek, president of the Connecticut chapter of AARP. ''Many seniors feel like they did everything right. They worked hard, saved, lived within their means, but still things just seem to be getting worse and worse for them.''
 Some seniors, like Mr. Ganek, are coming out of retirement to return to the workforce, and others who are approaching retirement age have decided that they can't afford to retire. According to an October 2008 survey by AARP, 65 percent of workers at least 45 years old say that if the economy does not improve significantly they will delay retirement and work longer.
 Natale and Mafalda Marini, of Weston, Conn., work at the meat department at Stew Leonard's, a grocery store in Norwalk. They didn't expect to be holding down full-time jobs at this time in their lives. But Mr. Marini, 69, a butcher, and Ms. Marini, 64, who is in charge of display cases, say they decided to put off retirement because they do not want to give up their employer-provided health benefits, which cover more than Medicare. The Marinis, who like working side by side, used to own their own businesses, an Italian deli and a home day care. Like many seniors, they do not have a company pension to fall back on. 
 ''Things are very hard today, you can't stay at home with just your Social Security,'' Ms. Marini said. She met recently with a financial adviser to make sure her investments were secure. 
 ''Seniors are especially worried about the economy because they feel they have less time to make up any losses,'' said Casey Mervine, a vice president with Charles Schwab Corporation who advises the elderly on retirement planning. ''For decades, we saw quick corrections of the market. Not this time.''
 According to the Employee Benefits Research Institute, workers aged 55 to 64 who have been in their 401(k) plans for 20 years saw their plans lose an average 20 percent of their value in 2008.
 Claire Edelman, 82, of Monroe Township, N.J., has seen her savings drop 35 percent in the last few months. ''I get nauseous when I think about it,'' she said. Ms. Edelman, a widow of 44 years, tries not to dip into her savings, which she may need for home care later on. 
 Ms. Edelman, who values her independence, said she received a modest pension from having worked at two state psychiatric hospitals as director of volunteers. For the first time since she retired in 1995, she has started to look for a part-time clerical job to supplement her fixed income. 
 In February 2008, Carol Szalus, 63, of Lake Hiawatha, N.J., lost her job of 20 years as an administrative assistant at Pella Windows. In addition, she estimates that her 401(k) plan has lost nearly a quarter of its value in the last few months. Before her company downsized, Ms. Szalus had planned on taking Social Security at age 66, when she would become eligible for full benefits. However, without a job she had to start taking her benefits early, which means that she will receive smaller monthly checks for the rest of her life. 
 With the unemployment rate at 7.2 percent, many older workers are worried that it will take them a long time to find a job because they will have to compete with younger workers who have more up-to-date skills. 
 It took Ms. Szalus almost a year to find employment. In December, she started a job as a monitor of special-needs children on buses, and makes considerably less now than she used to. Even so, Ms. Szalus says that she plans to work as long as she is physically able. ''I will probably continue working well into my 70s,'' she said.
 When Mr. Ganek decided to re-enter the work force, he was unsure about what kind of job to pursue. He did not want to return to pharmacy work because he did not want to be on his feet all day. For help with his job search, he turned to the Jewish Vocational Service of MetroWest in East Orange, N.J., which has an Older Worker Job Placement program. Leonard Schneider, the service's executive director, said that in the last quarter of 2008 the number of clients 55 years and older had more than doubled.
 ''Many seniors have to change their fields and downgrade their positions. They are worried that they don't have the skill set to even start looking for another job, like using the Internet, doing a resume and interviewing,'' said Mr. Schneider, who recently received a grant from the Grotta Fund for Senior Care, a local charitable foundation, to help job seekers age 65 and older.
 Thomas Alfano, 70, of Ossining, N.Y., worked as a supervisor in the telecommunications industry for 35 years before he was laid off after 9/11. For the past six years, Mr. Alfano has been working in the electrical department of Home Depot in Yonkers. He enjoys his work but says that even with a pension from a previous employer and Social Security income, he cannot afford to retire.
 ''This area is too expensive. I need to keep working to live here,'' he said.
 Older people in general, those employed and those retired, are finding that they have more trouble making ends meet. A survey released by AARP in October showed that during the preceding 12 months, more than 50 percent of workers older than 45 reported having difficulty paying for basic items like food, gas and medicine. 
 On a recent weekday, about 50 seniors gathered at the White Plains Senior Center cafeteria for a pork chop lunch. Frank Roselle, a regular at the center, said that at $2, his lunch was ''the best buy in town.'' Mr. Roselle, 71, a semi-retired corporate trainer, said that he would continue working as long as he could get projects. ''The difference between now and other bad times is that now everything is down.''

HEADLINE: In World of High-Glamour, Low-Pay Jobs, the Recession Has Its Bright Spots

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
Claudia Adamski, a fine art coordinator at Christie's, has started bringing a brown bag to work -- on a recent blustery day, a salad of lettuce, feta cheese, cucumbers and peppers. When a dinner last month that previously would have been catered was turned into a potluck, Ms. Adamski, 24, e-mailed her mother to get a recipe for apple crisp, a favorite. And she now chips in to pay for cupcakes Christie's used to shower on staffers for their birthdays.
 ''One thing we say is, 'Thank God, we don't have kids to support,' '' said Ms. Adamski, a strawberry blonde whom friends call Charlie. ''I'm at a point in my life I can take risks.'' Besides, she added, ''I can always move home if I have to.'' 
 The cutbacks at Christie's, which after a disastrous fall auction season announced last month that it would soon lay off employees for the first time since the dot-com bust of 2001, may sound familiar. 
 But for Ms. Adamski and other young women (they are mostly women) in the glamorous world of New York's auction houses, the downturn has hidden benefits in the form of a social correction that puts them on more equal footing with their friends working -- or formerly working -- on Wall Street. 
 Art professionals said that Ivy Leaguers with master's degrees typically earn $19,000 for a junior position to $50,000 for a midlevel specialist at an auction house, perhaps a fifth of what peers make working in law or banking. Now, with so many who chose the more lucrative paths unemployed, Ms. Adamski and others say there is less pressure to spend, spend, spend.
 ''Now we have an even playing field,'' said Lydia Wickliffe Fenet, an affable 31-year-old who heads special events at Christie's and says she has cut back on the number of nights she goes out and is choosing less expensive places. ''My friends say, 'Let's go have a beer instead of a $40 drink.' ''
 Brooke Lampley, who is 28 and has been at Christie's for four years specializing in Impressionism and modern art, said her college classmates who were laid off from their Wall Street jobs now follow more pedestrian pursuits. Most recently some of those friends went to a rodeo.
 ''I shouldn't say it, but I was jealous of my college friends,'' she said. ''But not anymore. Their choices helped them establish lives, but not the ones they wanted. I'd rather be doing something I like.''
 Working in the auction houses has always been a particular New York experience, a sorority of client-advisers and appraisers who spend weekends flying to Palm Beach or the Caribbean hoping to land a big account -- and, some of them concede, perhaps a husband -- but whose paychecks put them close to the poverty line. Without financial support from their families, many would be unable to have such jobs -- and, with them, entree to a rarefied social sphere and up-close contact with incredible works of art.
 ''It's not that wealth is inherently interesting,'' said Ingrid Dudek, a 32-year-old specialist in Asian contemporary art at Christie's who recently spent a week in St.-Tropez, most of it holed up at a client's house, appraising millions of dollars worth of objects. ''You get to do projects, see collections you never thought you'd ever see. You get a little giddy.''
 But now even those excursions are becoming rare as collectors have become less willing to sell in a market that might offer them only bargain prices for their artwork. 
 Ms. Lampley said the number of appraisals for upcoming sales among Impressionist collectors had fallen, meaning she was seeing fewer personal collections -- previously a big perk of the job. To keep herself occupied, she visits museums during lunch. ''I look for ways to keep myself busy,'' she said. ''I don't like to be bored.'' 
 After a fall in which paintings by the likes of Monet and Warhol went unsold, Christie's announced a plan to reorganize its operations, cutting, according to news reports, 300 of its 2,100 employees worldwide. Sotheby's plans to reduce costs by $7 million in 2009, by cutting jobs and capping some salaries.
 Still even before anyone loses a job, the recession has already faded this gilded world. 
 Christie's used to host about 400 parties a year, like one last May for several hundred people at the Top of the Rock on the 70th floor of Rockefeller Center, serving mushroom risotto, braised short ribs, chocolate souffles and wines from Chateau Latour. Now, the soirees are more likely pint-sized catered affairs with potential buyers invited to collector's homes to view the artwork up close. 
 Ms. Fenet, who grew up in Louisiana and went to boarding school at the Taft School in Connecticut, said she joined Christie's client-advisory team in 1999 after reading a profile in a magazine about the glamorous and mysterious life of auction-house women. 
 ''Then you see how many degrees they live above your life,'' she said of Christie's wealthy clients. That is especially apparent when she is setting up tables and moving chairs around someone else's living room. As little as a year ago, hedge fund managers were awash in money, and eager to buy art to signal their entree to New York's social elite.
 ''People would bid on a $1 million piece of art and someone next to them would bid $20 million, and then $60 million,'' Ms. Fenet recalled. ''Now fewer people are going to raise their hand at $60 million.''
 For the moment, the jobs of Ms. Fenet, Ms. Adamski, Ms. Dudek and Ms. Lampley are safe, according to the company, although each of their departments is being asked to cut costs further. That means fewer international trips and an even more watchful eye on entertaining clients -- their pared-down lifestyles becoming more so by the month.
 Now all eyes are trained on the upcoming May sales which, depending on how eager the buyers are, could portend more layoffs. But, again, auction houses have something going in their favor that other recession-battered industries do not. If the economy worsens, some of their clients may be forced to sell whether they want to or not. Perhaps the free cupcakes could soon reappear.

A WORLD OF TROUBLE
 The White House and the Middle East -- From the Cold War to the War on Terror
 By Patrick Tyler
 Illustrated. 628 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $30
 Viewed through realpolitik's disinterested prism, the central place that the protection of Israeli interests occupies in American foreign policy priorities seems counterproductive, even a liability. Smaller than New Hampshire, with fewer inhabitants than New Jersey, ringed by mostly hostile neighbors, fighting repeated wars like the latest bloody conflagration in Gaza, entangled in an apparently unsolvable territorial dispute, Israel consumes vast amounts of manpower, expertise, and diplomatic and intelligence resources, if not whole presidential careers, as Patrick Tyler demonstrates in ''A World of Trouble,'' an authoritative, richly detailed account of American policy in the Middle East. The Israeli-Palestinian imbroglio warps the United States' relations with the Arab (and wider Muslim) world, Arab leaders faithfully tell every new occupant of the White House. Midwife a meaningful Palestinian state, they claim, and all would be sweetness and light from Rabat to Riyadh. 
 If only the Middle East, as so many American presidents chronicled here seem to believe, were that simple; indeed, the Israeli-Palestinian dispute is a most useful alibi for the region's creaking dynasties and dictators, diverting domestic attention from their own sclerotic economies and dismal human rights records. A democratic Palestine, plugged into the global economy, is the last thing they want, for fear their restive populations will demand the same. 
 George Tenet, the former director of central intelligence, also blamed the Jews for many of his troubles, if the extraordinary scene Tyler describes in the book's prologue is to be believed. He recounts how in 2004 a furious Tenet, dressed in his underwear, drank half a bottle of Scotch, supplied by Prince Bandar bin Sultan at his palace in Saudi Arabia, in a few minutes, while raging at the Bush administration's duplicity. ''They're setting me up,'' he said, but ''I am not going to take the hit.'' The hit that needed to be taken was for the missing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, over which the United States had gone to war. The White House, Tyler writes, expected Tenet ''to fall on his sword to protect the president.'' Tenet raged against the ''bastards'' in the administration and mocked the neoconservatives who supported Israel's right-wingers as ''the Jews.'' He then jumped into the swimming pool and did impressions of Yasir Arafat and Omar Suleiman, the chief of Egyptian intelligence. (Tyler's report is based on the recollections of three witnesses, but Tenet denies making the comments.) 
 ''A World of Trouble'' covers 10 American presidencies, from Dwight D. Eisenhower's to George W. Bush's. An experienced foreign correspondent who has reported from across the Middle East for The New York Times and The Washington Post, Tyler draws on decades' worth of notebooks, numerous interviews and declassified documents. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict runs like a thread through the narrative, but Tyler also ranges much wider, to Suez, the Iranian revolution, the Iran-Iraq conflict and both Iraq wars. He writes vividly, allowing the reader access to White House meetings, huddles in the corridors of power, seats at international summits. 
 There are finely drawn pen portraits of the key players. Few of the presidents impress: Jimmy Carter dithers, Ronald Reagan and his advisers are clueless, Bill Clinton is distracted by the Lewinsky scandal. The local leaders seem more serious: Menachem Begin, who equated Arafat with Hitler; Yitzhak Rabin, who made peace with Arafat; and Benjamin Netanyahu, who -- along with Hamas suicide bombers -- helped destroy any chance of a peace agreement. Here too are crucial Arab figures: the party-loving Prince Bandar, confidant of numerous presidents; the brave but doomed Anwar Sadat; King Hussein of Jordan; the shah of Iran; and Saddam Hussein, the onetime ally against whom America eventually went to war. 
 It may not be a surprise to learn that the White House -- like every government in history -- is always riven by factions, duplicitous advisers pushing their own agendas and secret cabals plotting in the washrooms. But it still makes for delicious reading to discover, for instance, the power of Mathilde Krim, a fiercely pro-Israel Swiss Calvinist married to Arthur Krim, a former member of Begin's right-wing underground, the Irgun. The Krims had the ear of Lyndon B. Johnson, apparently more so than did Dean Rusk, his secretary of state, and Robert McNamara, his defense secretary. On Memorial Day in 1967, while Israel and Arab countries were preparing for imminent war, President Johnson was ''cavorting'' at his Texas ranch with the Krims and other friends. 
 Tyler is especially good on America's relationship with Iran. He dissects President Carter's tortured pusillanimity as he tried to reconcile his Christian beliefs with the need to prop up an American ally, the shah, whose regime was kept in place by secret-police torturers. Not surprisingly, the mix soon turned rancid, especially when the United States backed Iraq in its war against Iran. In March 1988, Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against the Kurdish town of Halabja. Tyler, along with other foreign correspondents, was flown there by the Iranians on a risky mission inside Iraqi airspace. As many as 5,000 civilians perished. Tyler remains haunted by what he saw that day: ''the bodies of a dozen or so small girls who had been playing the day of the attack. They lay like dolls splayed randomly on the gravel bed, eyes open in some cases, staring skyward. The faces seemed to beckon, as if impatient for the living to gather them in.'' At the time, Hussein was an American ally. The Defense Intelligence Agency sent two officers to Baghdad with comprehensive plans for an air war, showing Iranian air defenses and fortifications. The agency knew Iraq was using chemical weapons, but still the intelligence flowed. When Congress protested the Halabja gassing, Republican leaders, including Dick Cheney, blocked the calls for sanctions against Hussein. 
 Despite its 600-odd pages, ''A World of Trouble'' feels unbalanced in places. The chapter on George W. Bush's presidency, which covers the rising threat of Al Qaeda, 9/11, and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, is compressed into 30 pages, while the American entanglement in Lebanon gets almost double that number. When the subject is not the Middle East, Tyler is less confident and makes several errors. He writes that during the Yugoslav wars, President George H. W. Bush was unwilling to commit American troops to Bosnia partly because he feared humiliating ''Gorbachev'' in ''the heart of what the Soviets saw as their sphere of influence.'' In fact, when the Bosnian war started, Boris Yeltsin was the president of Russia and the Soviet Union no longer existed. Tyler also writes that ''a quarter-million'' were slaughtered in Rwanda; the usually accepted figure is 800,000. 
 ''A World of Trouble'' is an important account of the White House's interaction with a volatile and strategically vital region, but it stops too suddenly in 2008. Its episodic structure would have benefited from a thoughtful concluding chapter on the obsessive, self-contradictory relationship between the United States and its friends-turned-enemies-turned-potential-friends-again across the Middle East. Tyler briefly touches on this in the prologue, arguing that the United States' Middle East policy has been consistently inconsistent, ''as if the hallmark of American diplomacy were discontinuity,'' but policy zigzags are common to all newly elected democratic governments. Perhaps the armed, bearded Revolutionary Guard who stopped Tyler at a Tehran roadblock in 1989 said it best: ''Excuse me, sir, but if you were going to select the best American university to study electrical engineering, which one would you choose?''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 15, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A review on Feb. 8 about ''A World of Trouble,'' a study of Middle East policy by Patrick Tyler, erroneously included one former national leader on a list of ''crucial Arab figures.'' The shah of Iran was not an Arab.
A review on Feb. 8 about ''A World of Trouble,'' a study of Middle East policy by Patrick Tyler, referred incorrectly to Arthur Krim, who along with his wife, Mathilde, was a supporter of Israel and a friend of Lyndon Johnson's. It was not he, but Mathilde Krim, who once worked with the Irgun, the underground militia.

HEADLINE: Desperate School Districts Are Eager for Stimulus Money

BYLINE: By JOHN MOONEY

 BODY:
HARDLY alone these days, New Jersey's public schools haven't heard much good news lately about their budgets. 
 Trenton is facing its own budget deficit in the billions, potentially jeopardizing a new school funding formula not even a year old. So grim is the state's overall budget picture that Lucille E. Davy, the state education commissioner, wrote to local districts last month imploring them to freeze all ''nonessential and discretionary'' spending for the rest of the year. 
 Local school officials drawing up next year's budgets are keenly aware that voters who must approve those budgets are facing their own money squeeze in this economic downturn -- even as they are already paying some of the nation's steepest property taxes. 
 So when United States Representative Rush Holt set up a conference call recently with local school officials to talk about the hundreds of millions of dollars that could go to the state's public schools from the federal stimulus bill now awaiting Congressional approval, it drew some interest.
 His office was surprised when more than 100 officials phoned in.
 ''There is absolutely no doubt this will help,'' said David C. Abbott, the school superintendent in Marlboro, who was in on the call. ''We're all struggling out there . . . and all believing it will get even worse.''
 The stimulus bill approved by the House of Representatives -- and a similar measure before the Senate -- could prove a boon for public education. Nationwide, the eventual $900 billion package would include an estimated $150 billion for education, from preschool through the university level.
 Nearly $80 billion would compensate for state and local cuts. There would also be $20 billion in new money for school construction projects, and another $6 billion each for special education and programs to serve disadvantaged students.
 For New Jersey, that would total nearly $900 million in new federal spending over the next two years, according to a Congressional analysis being circulated by the state's school boards association.
 The money would go to a wide range of programs, from broad services for low-income students to specific ones like student tracking systems. Even Mr. Holt was left scrambling trying to decipher it all.
 ''Excuse me while I shuffle through the papers to find everything in it,'' Mr. Holt told the officials on the conference call. ''There is so much in this; it is just huge.''
 Eager for the help, school officials peppered the congressman with questions: Would districts need to apply for the money? Would it come through the state? How soon would they know?
 Mr. Holt had few definite answers, and that left others trying to fill in the gaps.
 ''We're advising districts to be very cautious,'' said Michael Vrancik, chief lobbyist for the school boards group.
 Mr. Vrancik was among those in Washington earlier this week to speak with the state's Congressional delegation, and he said the bills leave much to be encouraged about -- and a few areas of concern.
 One of the latest worries for his organization, he said, is a provision being debated in the Senate that would allow states to get waivers from some of the planned restrictions in the stimulus package, potentially diluting what would go to schools.
 ''That's not something we're looking for, and in fact we'd have a real concern,'' Mr. Vrancik said.
 Another unresolved question for both state and local officials is whether the stimulus will keep alive New Jersey's vast plans to expand preschool for low-income students. 
 All districts have been required to develop full-day programs for their neediest students, starting next fall, with the state footing the bill. The first year could cost as much as $50 million, with the total cost rising to over $300 million in six years.
 But state officials have said federal help will be needed for the program to move forward this year, and there was little consensus on whether the stimulus package would include such funds.
 In the meantime, Dr. Abbott said he'll keep drafting a budget for his Marlboro schools that will be light on new initiatives and, more likely, include some cuts. He'd welcome the estimated $700,000 under the House's stimulus bill, he said, but that's just 1 percent of overall spending in the district of 6,100 students. 
 So, plans to trim late-afternoon busing and middle school sports will proceed, saving about $160,000, the superintendent said. And the timetable for replacing and upgrading computers and other technology may just have to skip a beat. 
 ''That's about $140,000,'' he said. ''We should be doing it every year, but not this year.''

HEADLINE: Does the Tax Code Look Grayer in a Downturn?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the United States tax code contains some 3.7 million words, it leaves lots of room for creative interpretation. And in a severe recession, many people may be particularly motivated to plumb some less-obvious features of the law to minimize the tax hit.
 Those who have lost jobs have not only a financial incentive to do so, but many have the time to seek out areas where they can squeeze a benefit without crossing the line separating legal avoidance from prosecutable evasion. 
 ''In these difficult economic times people should have sharper pencils and be more aware of some provisions of the tax code that can help them weather the storms,'' said Tom Ochsenschlager, a vice president for taxation at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
 Indeed, some experts caution that filing your return just as you did in previous years may prove costly if your circumstances have changed. For example, a taxpayer who has been itemizing deductions but whose income has dropped may find it pays to take the standard deduction, indexed to inflation, instead.
 Although the so-called tax gap -- the amount officially estimated as due but uncollected -- continues to widen, the Internal Revenue Service does not acknowledge any appreciable rise in taxpayer dishonesty during recessions. ''There doesn't seem to be a tight correlation between compliance and enforcement activities and the economic cycle,'' said Bruce Friedland, an I.R.S. spokesman. 
 But with many taxpayers scrambling just to keep food on the table, accountants and other tax professionals predict that more people, one way or another, will be sailing a bit closer to the wind. 
 ''People are more likely to underreport income than to inflate deductions,'' said Cindy Hockenberry, tax research coordinator for the National Association of Tax Professionals and a preparer herself for the past 25 years. Not only is more money typically involved, but not reporting income is a passive act, requiring no asserted claim.
 The practical boundaries are not always clear. Failure to report selling an item from your attic onlineis technically a violation, but few would regard an isolated transaction as putting you anywhere close to engaging in a trade or business. 
 And some income isn't subject to tax. For example, you are allowed to rent your home without tax consequence for up to two weeks a year.
 Even with diligence and the best of intentions, it is not always possible to determine, say, the cost of securities bought decades before the computer age. Form 1099s often include only the price at the time of sale, and you may be forced to guess. 
 One common deduction that seems to invite some stretching of definitions involves job-search expenses. The rule is that you can deduct certain costs in looking for a new job -- whether or not you get it -- in your present occupation, but not if you seek work in a different one.
 But what constitutes such a change? Could a bank teller qualify if, say, she goes to Florida and interviews for work as purser on a cruise ship?
 ''That's a very slippery area,'' Mr. Ochsenschlager said. American workers have been switching jobs at a faster pace in recent years, in many cases applying existing skills in different, perhaps emerging, fields.
 Are you on a weight-loss regimen? Deductions are allowed for physician-diagnosed treatment of disease, including obesity, so long as you don't claim the cost of low-calorie food, according to Ernst & Young, which publishes an annual tax guide.
 If you are a victim of a Ponzi scheme, it's clear that you can take a deduction for theft. But you should not be so aggressive as to claim the loss before determining -- after any eventual, long-delayed recoveries -- how much it actually is.
 And what about situations where there is no doubt that the deduction is legitimate in principle, but technically not permitted? Let's say you visit relatives at Christmas and toss a $20 bill in a church offering plate. You might be tempted to take the deduction even though you have no documentation, on the grounds that the government was losing nothing to which it was entitled.
 ''I think people are going to try to beef up their charitable contributions'' in tough times, Ms. Hockenberry said.
 And is there no wiggle room in the requirement of ''regular and exclusive use'' of a home office for business? Is it disqualified if it serves as a coat depository for an occasional dinner party?
 Or what if you have a factory and bought raw materials whose prices then collapsed, as they did in the final months of 2008? Depending on the accounting method you have chosen, you may value this inventory at the lower of cost or market. But the price in a depressed, possibly inactive, market ''can be very tough to ascertain,'' said Michael O. Calahan, tax partner at the Blackman Kallick accounting firm in Chicago.
 Anthony Burke, an I.R.S. spokesman, acknowledged that in many cases, ''rational, well-meaning people can come to very different conclusions'' about specific tax issues, even among the agency's own auditors and revenue agents.
 If challenged -- and only about 1 percent of returns are audited -- most people may grumble but still pay the specified additional tax and interest. If the amount in dispute is sizable enough, there is an appeals process involving the I.R.S. Appeals Office, where you may bargain, or, ultimately, the United States Tax Court.
 The I.R.S. is well aware of the acute hardships for many taxpayers this year. In her annual report last month, the national taxpayer advocate, Nina E. Olson, who heads an independent body with the agency, made three main recommendations aimed at easing taxpayers' burdens.
 These were to simplify the rules on tax liabilities arising from canceled debts, to protect delinquent low-income Social Security recipients from automated tax levies, and to negotiate installment or partial agreements in distressed cases.
 ''You can't get blood,'' said Kenneth J. Drexler, spokes- man for Ms. Olson, ''from a turnip.''

HEADLINE: Plan B

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
Remember the old Plan B?
 Until our economy went kerflooey, it was a whimsical reverie about the life that you could swap for the one that you were leading. It was a six-room bed-and-breakfast in Vermont that you bought and spruced up and managed into your dotage. Or a record deal, with tour support and 80 percent of the gate. Or some gadget you devised in the basement that was going to be huge. 
 It took many forms, the old Plan B, but it's getting harder to conjure up any of them in detail. The idea of it is fading from our memory, obscured under the pile of bad news about layoffs and bank failures, beneath the letters with your 401(k) returns, which you learned to stop opening. 
 Instead, we have the new Plan B, which can be summarized this way: the best you can make of a worst-case scenario, the deal you cut with a fate you might be unable to avoid. Under the new Plan B, the fortunate merely hunker down. The less fortunate slide, against their will, into a lower tax bracket and sometimes into jobs they don't want. 
 As badly as our economy is tottering, the number of Americans actually living the new Plan B is still small compared to those who are not. What is slowly spreading is worry about the new Plan B. It is becoming part of our interior monologue, the anxious static in our collective heads, one of the ordeals of this downturn that doesn't easily lend itself to measurement, like the G.D.P. or the Dow. It is not part of the economy's visible damage, like boarded-up stores or those recession-inspired eBay listings that start with ''Hate to let these go!'' or some variation on that theme.
 But it's palpable. It is part of the awkward conversation with your kids about why you can't chip in for college, or why you might not be leaving them much of an inheritance, if you leave them an inheritance at all.
 The old Plan B was a lark that you could enjoy even if you never got past the dreaming phase. The new Plan B is a menace you can fear even if you're fully employed. It's a threat rather than an option.
 It can be foisted upon you in the way that it was foisted on Damian and Simone Lopez of Bakersfield, Calif. A UPS driver for 15 years, Mr. Lopez lost his job not long ago and today he welds aluminum tanks for a truck company. It's solitary work, which isn't his style, and it pays less than half the $75,000 he earned with UPS. The house he built with his wife, Simone, was foreclosed upon and will soon go up for auction. 
 ''We're hoping that whoever buys our house will rent it back to us,'' said Mrs. Lopez, a mother of three who works at a career counseling center. ''But we're not sure we'll be able to afford the rent.''
 The Lopezes had a very different Plan B last year. It involved tuition money for a daughter in college, and a lot of golf outings in Arizona. ''My husband used to collect all these golf guides,'' Mrs. Lopez said. ''I'm not even sure where he got them.''
 We have questions for those forced into the new Plan B because these people seem like pioneers in a mental realm where we're all headed. Is it as gruesome there as we fear? And how quickly are you forced to give up the stuff you don't actually need (like Showtime and dinner out) and surrender the stuff you shouldn't live without (like health care)? 
 And here's a hopeful question: does the new Plan B have any upsides? For many, the primary goal of the old Plan B wasn't riches. It was a means of exiting the H.O.V. lane of a career you might no longer have enjoyed. Or it was about finding ''fulfillment,'' a word that is nearly impossible to say without irony at the age of 21 and accumulates meaning later on.
 Steve Maslow, a corporate headhunter in Manhattan, says some job candidates he has placed in the past now ''see the writing on the wall'' and have started to segue into work that they actually prefer. Like the lawyer who at night runs a florist business out of his apartment, or the derivatives products controller at a Wall Street firm who has opened a furniture show room in the basement of her house in New Jersey.
 But these are exceptions.
 ''Just about everyone I work with is trying to figure out Plan B,'' Mr. Maslow says, ''but most people think of it as a stop-gap measure, a way to stop the bleeding, a place to go every day. It used to have the flavor of once-upon-a-time, the thing I'll do when I'm 55 and have a nest egg. That's pretty much over.''
 It died, it seems, along with the nest egg. Part of the old Plan B was an imagined sit-down with a professional accountant who would run the numbers and tell you, yes, this will work, as long as you spend ''X dollars'' per year, and nothing more. Without the nest egg, there are no numbers to run. There are only extravagances to jettison.
 ''I got rid of everything luxurious,'' says Bob Hunter, 52, a real estate investor in Miami, whose $8 million in holdings have plunged in value since the downturn. ''I drive a Ford pickup truck. I used to drive a BMW 5 Series, and I was going to upgrade from there, to the 6 Series convertible.''
 The old Plan B for Mr. Hunter was a two-day workweek, with the management of his properties handled by nephews, and lots of trips back to Pittsburgh to see family. Plus fishing. Now, he works seven days a week. The downturn has outlasted his savings, so the only money coming in is from rentals and the occasional sale of property, for below what he paid.
 ''I buy shoes if the old ones are worn out,'' he says. ''We don't go shopping and we don't go on vacation.'' 
 Unlike the old Plan B, the new one doesn't involve a lot of plane tickets. Unless you are one of the recently laid off employees of IBM, who, under a program called Project Match, can remain on the Big Blue payroll if they move to a developing country where the company has openings, like India, China or Brazil. 
 Worrying about the new Plan B is part of life across such a wide range of industries that it's getting harder for anyone contemplating a leap to figure out where to land. Poonam Mahtani, who works in a Manhattan fashion house that she'd rather not identify -- ''Just put that I'm really happy to have a job''-- says that layoffs in her field are so rampant that everyone she knows is working on Plan B. 
 ''I've been thinking about business school,'' she says. ''Or bartending, maybe yoga instructor. I don't know. What is safe out there?''
 The new Plan B relies heavily on improvisation. Rob Hall left his job with Wachovia Bank last year when he passed on his company's offer to relocate him from Richmond, Va., to St. Louis, as part of a restructuring. He looked at a bunch of franchising opportunities and wound up owning a mobile pet-grooming business. 
 ''If you'd told me two years ago that I'd own an Aussie Pet Mobile, I'd have thought you were insane,'' Mr. Hall says. He also started a consulting firm with a few former Wachovia friends, not all of whom were pleased that he'd taken on two very different projects. ''Maybe it seemed like I was hedging my bets,'' he says.
 Which he was. Because in the fragile economy of the new Plan B, hatching Plan C seems like a pretty good idea.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 15, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about people who are rethinking their Plan B life and work options in the face of the economic downturn misidentified the subsidiary of Wachovia Corporation that a Virginia man left because he did not want to relocate as part of a corporate restructuring. The man, Rob Hall, left Wachovia Securities, not Wachovia Bank.

HEADLINE: A 485,000-Acre Resort for the People

BYLINE: By GAIL BRACCIDIFERRO

DATELINE: EAST HADDAM 

 BODY:
 BOB JOHNSON said he is uncertain how he will feel when summer arrives and he will not be greeting hordes of vacationers, as he has done for more than 50 years, first as a bellhop and later as the owner of the Sunrise Resort here.
 At least he knows that the 93-year-old family-owned resort will not be turned into an office park or housing development now that Gov. M. Jodi Rell announced last month that the state has purchased the property for $3.2 million and added it to Connecticut's sprawling holdings of public open space.
 Families have been coming to Sunrise for years, to enjoy the group canoe rides, themed dinners and other family activities in and around the picturesque village of Moodus, a part of East Haddam near the Salmon River. When the state takes over in the summer, visitors will still be able to rent the cabins near the river at Sunrise and enjoy other simple amenities. 
 The purchase of the 143-acre resort moves the state closer to its ambitious goal of owning and preserving about 10 percent of Connecticut's overall area as public recreational space in the next 14 years. 
 Cyndy Chanaca, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Environmental Protection, said that the state's overall open-space goal is to protect 21 percent, or 673,210 acres, of Connecticut's land by 2023, with private and municipal land trusts and environmental groups owning what the state does not. She said that the state was 72.1 percent of the way toward its goal, with 485,817 acres having been designated as state or local open space. 
 The purchase of the Sunrise property is the state's fourth major land acquisition since January 2008. Last month, the Environmental Protection Department also announced the purchase of 48 acres in Guilford that would enlarge the 138-acre East River Marsh Wildlife Area. In June 2008, the state bought the 134-acre Bogus Farm in Bethel, adjacent to the Collis P. Huntington State Park, and in January 2008, it bought the 308-acre Francis M. Deluca property in Cornwall and Canaan, expanding the Housatonic State Forest.
 Connecticut is the only New England state that has set a specific acreage goal and a timeline for achieving it, said Whitney Hatch, the New England regional director for the Trust for Public Land, a national group that advocates for land protection. 
 ''Connecticut's done very well over the years,'' Mr. Hatch said. ''It's chugging along with the best of them.''
 One disadvantage Connecticut has, however, is the relatively high value of land in the state. 
 ''It costs a lot more to protect an acre of land in Connecticut than an acre in northern Maine,'' Mr. Hatch said.
 He could not compare, state by state, acquisitions or money spent because each state measures things differently, he said. 
 Connecticut officials say they are committed to open space and recreational land purchases, although the state's budget woes -- it could be facing a deficit of more than $8 billion in the next two fiscal years -- could slow down the program.
 Thomas Morrissey, chief of outdoor recreation for the State Department of Environmental Protection, said that acquisition of the 550-acre former Connecticut Yankee nuclear plant property on the Connecticut River, not far from the Sunrise Resort land, is a high priority. The state and the property's owners are still holding discussions. 
 The money to buy the Sunrise Resort property came from a variety of sources. The Recreation and Natural Heritage Trust, a program financed by the State Bond Commission and administered by the Environmental Protection Department, gave about $1.85 million. More than $1 million came from the federal Department of the Interior's Land and Water Conservation Fund, and the George Dudley Seymour Trust, a historic preservation organization, provided about $250,000.
 The purchase means the state now owns 443 contiguous acres in the area by Machimoodus State Park.
 Ms. Chanaca, the Environmental Protection Department spokeswoman, said that no money is currently available in the Recreation and Natural Heritage Trust program. The State Bond Commission is responsible for replenishing the program's funds. 
 As for the Sunrise property, visitors will still be able to stay in the rustic cabins, swim in the pool and use the campground, Mr. Morrissey said. But state officials have not decided whether to make available other amenities Sunrise offered when it operated among the 50 or so Catskill-style resorts in the region. 
 At one time, the camps and lodges there offered family cookouts, picnics, canoeing, horseback riding, themed dinners, music by local bands, bingo and swimming, recalled Mr. Johnson, 71, who began working as a bellhop at the resort in the 1950s when it was owned by his aunt. At that time, it was called Ted Hilton's.
 ''It was just strictly about family,'' said Mary Madaglia of Long Island, who said she vacationed at Sunrise for about 44 years and had not missed spending a summer week there in the past 25 years. ''We enjoyed the fact there was no TV, no phones. We were separate from the rest of the world for a week.''
 Sunrise may become more of a bare-bones retreat, like the state-owned Salt Rock Campground in Baltic, where 71 tent and recreational vehicle sites are available for rental. Salt Rock also offers bathrooms, showers, fishing in the Shetucket River, hiking trails and a swimming pool.
 East Haddam First Selectman Mark B. Walter said that although it was difficult for the rural community to lose the $75,000 in property taxes paid annually by the resort, especially in the current economic downturn, he and other local residents supported the state's purchase.
 ''It's more important to preserve this land,'' he said. ''It's right on the Salmon River, and it's amazing how beautiful it is.''
 While state and local officials praised the Johnson family's decision not to sell the land for private development, Mr. Johnson and his sons, Larry, 40, and Jim, 43, said that hundreds of former guests were mourning the loss of the resort they knew.
 As for the area, in recent years, more travelers sought exotic and far-flung destinations and dazzling theme parks, forcing most of the Moodus resorts to close. At the same time, the increasing cost of liability insurance forced the Johnsons to eliminate popular amenities like water-skiing, horseback riding, a high-dive board and go-carts.
 Even as the resort cut back on those features, Jim Johnson, who began working there when he was 13, said the Sunrise had 60,000 guests annually, including those who attended special music festivals or visited with school groups.
 ''In spite of it all, we could have gone on and on here,'' Larry Johnson said.
 There is, however, at least one aspect of the resort that Bob Johnson said he is certain he will not miss. He is looking forward to more restful summer nights now that his bedside telephone will no longer jangle him awake with calls in the middle of the night from would-be guests expecting to reach a night clerk or a recording.

HEADLINE: When Diners Pick Up Stakes, And Vintage New York Is Lost

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
Hey, Alabama, you want a piece of us? 
 Olde New York, that is.
Now that an Alabama couple have purchased the Cheyenne Diner on Ninth Avenue and 33rd Street, they say they are eyeing the historic Ridgewood Theater in Queens, which played movies from 1916 until it closed last year.
 La Barge, Wyo., snared an even more revered restaurant, the Moondance Diner, which sat near the Holland Tunnel and was New York's oldest diner. 
 A Sicilian town is taking an East Village video store's legendary collection of 50,000 movies. 
 And from Pakistan came interest in another New York icon: the Astroland Rocket at Coney Island.
 No, it's not the faltering economy that's putting venerable New York up for sale and shipment. It may be just coincidental that there is a flurry of outliers who are in a New York state of mind and want a part of it.
 ''We're not taking anything from New York -- the diner needed saving,'' said Cheryl Pierce, who with her husband, Vince, bought the Moondance in 2007 for $7,500. They spent $40,000 to move it 2,125 miles to La Barge in western Wyoming, where it opened on Jan. 12 after a delay to replace a roof collapsed by snow.
 It is hardly a new phenomenon, of course. New York has been exporting its bounties, willingly and unwillingly, since the days of Peter Stuyvesant and marauding redcoats.
 More recently, according to the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, cast-iron eagles from the old Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal have turned up at suburban estates, a kiosk from the 1939 World's Fair is now a restaurant in New Jersey, parts of an 18th-century ship found at 175 Water Street were sent to the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Va., and old subway cars are swimming with the fishes as artificial reefs off the Delaware coast. 
 Many years ago, when New York saw no more need for all of its elevated lines, it sold the iron for scrap to the Japanese, who were particularly happy to receive it, said Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx County historian. ''Put it this way,'' he said, ''we got it back in the form of artillery shells and kamikazes.''
 And it goes both ways -- as evidenced by the French lady with a lamp in the harbor. But it is the loss of the two diners in quick succession that has amplified the effect. 
 The Cheyenne Diner, which opened in 1940, is destined for an area east of Birmingham, where the buyers, Joel Owens and Patti Miller, expect to move it within the next few weeks with a 965-mile highway journey requiring two traffic lanes.
 ''It needs permits from every state we're going through,'' said Ms. Miller, who declined to disclose the purchase price or the transportation cost.
 But she said the diner was just the beginning of an entertainment district they were envisioning near the Talladega Superspeedway.
 Making money is not their object, Ms. Miller said. ''It's about giving something back,'' she said. ''We're even thinking 1940s prices. Or maybe just putting out a bucket with a sign: 'Did you have a good time?' ''
 Also on their list of possible acquisitions, she said, is the Ridgewood Theater on Myrtle Avenue, where Queens and Brooklyn meet.
 ''We might take it,'' said Ms. Miller, a publicity manager. Mr. Owens is an auto dealer and financial planner. 
 The 93-year-old movie house, designed by Thomas W. Lamb, who was considered the king of theater architects, never missed a day of showings until it closed last March, making it the longest-continuously operated cinema in the country, according to the Theater Historical Society of America. 
 Ms. Miller said that she and Mr. Owens learned of the theater's uncertain fate from Michael Perlman, a local preservationist who has rallied supporters in efforts to save the theater and recently got the preservation commission to consider designating it for protection. In any case, only the facade would be granted landmark status. Of the 25,000 landmark buildings in New York, only 125 are protected inside as well. 
 Mr. Perlman, 26, who has a graphic arts business and collects vintage postcards, said that the relocation of the seats and other furnishings of the Ridgewood Theater to Birmingham would be ''bittersweet.'' But he said, ''At least it would allow future generations to cherish it.''
 In its new home in La Barge, the Moondance Diner, which opened in New York in 1933 and stood on Avenue of the Americas at Grand Street, is packing them in, Ms. Pierce said. It is drawing 150 to 215 customers a day, she said -- a quarter to a third of the town's population of 600, although many customers are transients.
 Often, she said, they order the Moonburger, a slab of beef with pepper jack cheese and jalapeno peppers, served with French fries at a decidedly un-New York price of $7.50.
 ''Everyone is plumb tickled with an eatery in La Barge,'' Ms. Pierce said by telephone. ''Everybody has been very positive that we're bringing to life something that may not have had an existing life in New York City.''
 It's not just vintage diners leaving town. After Yongman Kim closed his movie rental store in the East Village a few months ago after 22 years, he found an improbable buyer for his trove: the Sicilian town of Salemi.
 In addition, parts of New York's greatest seaside playground are also up for grabs. 
 ''Everyone wants a little piece of Coney Island for their backyard,'' said Charles Denson, the executive director of the Coney Island History Project, which is trying to save the area's birthright from souvenir hunters.
 When a signature piece of the old Astroland -- the rocket -- was recently put up for sale, offers streamed in from all over the world, Mr. Denson said. (Ultimately, the family that owned the rocket donated it to the city.)
 ''Australia wanted all of Astroland intact,'' he said. But one offer from an amusement park far away stood out. 
 ''Please inform what do you think about sending it to us,'' wrote the prospective buyer, Waheed-uz-Zaman Khan, the executive director of a company called Dreamworld Resort in Karachi, Pakistan.
 Mr. Denson had his doubts, just imagining, he said, ''if Homeland Security had to approve that through Customs.''

HEADLINE: Portrait of a Library Testing the Art World

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Plainfield 

 BODY:
 THE public library here dates to a gilded era when the grand mansions on the neighboring blocks were home to a concentration of wealth -- tycoons, industrialists, financiers -- almost unmatched in the state, and the walls were hung with the art they bequeathed to it.
 The original library has been gone since 1968, replaced by a low-slung, glassy pavilion where the heaviest traffic now is at the computer terminals used mostly by unemployed patrons looking for jobs. 
 Plenty of art remains, hanging in conference rooms, offices and hallways, but the most valuable works in the collection have long been all but invisible: an oil painting and a watercolor by Winslow Homer that were donated to the library in 1931 and have been crated and stored for many years on a gray metal shelf in a basement bank vault, their worth silently growing as the dust bunnies multiplied alongside them. 
 ''It was sort of a lose-lose situation,'' said Joseph Da Rold, who grew up in North Plainfield and has been the library's director for 15 years. The cost of the insurance and security that would be required to display the Homers in public was more than the library could afford, he said. ''It would have been way too expensive even to bring them out of the vault, much less to hang them here.'' 
 But then the Art Institute of Chicago came calling, asking to borrow the Homer watercolor for an exhibition last year. That set off a chain of events that occasioned a long discussion at the library about its history and its mission; raised its hopes about how it might finish some long-delayed projects; led it into rarefied precincts of the fine-art auction world; and ultimately gave it a sobering glimpse of what happens in the stratospheric reaches of the economy when even the wealthy start tightening their belts.
 The first surprise came when the Homers were appraised before the watercolor traveled to Chicago. Based on earlier appraisals, the library's entire art collection was insured for $2 million. But while the paintings were hibernating in the bank vault, prices for American art had been climbing. Now, the library learned, the watercolor was valued at $2.5 million, the oil at $5 million; these two paintings combined could be worth five times the library's annual budget. The insurance bill jumped to $25,000 from $3,800 a year.
 ''There was an awful lot of soul-searching,'' said Anne Robinson, the president of the library's board, who moved to one of those grand neighboring mansions from Manhattan after 9/11. ''What are our needs and what are our resources, and how do we balance them?''
 It's a question that many other institutions have wrestled with -- most recently and prominently Brandeis University, which last month abruptly announced that it would close its art museum and sell its entire collection -- and the library's trustees consulted with several of them. The board discussed its options at its regular meetings for six months last year in the conference room beside the library's extensive archives of local history. 
 ''What do we do with a painting that costs us $25,000 a year to insure, that we can't display, that nobody has ever seen, that wasn't painted by a Plainfield artist, that wasn't painted in Plainfield, that isn't a scene of Plainfield, and is worth millions of dollars?'' Ms. Robinson asked. ''Shouldn't we use that for the betterment of Plainfield?''
 The paintings, as well as a lithograph that is much less valuable, were owned by Benjamin M. Day, who had lived in North Plainfield and died in 1905. His widow died in 1930, and the next year their only child, Benjamin M. Day Jr., gave the Homers to the library, where they had previously been exhibited at least once before.
 ''It's literally just two lines in the minutes,'' Ms. Robinson said about the record of the donation. A lawyer's review of all the Days' wills found no mention of the gift, and no restrictions upon it, she said.
 The library's trustees were fond of the watercolor, ''Looking Over the Cliff,'' by far the best known of its Homers, and the prevailing sentiment was to keep it, Ms. Robinson said. When they considered the oil, though -- ''Winding Line,'' a fisherman in oilskins sitting on the edge of a boat on a pebbly beach -- and then looked around at all the pending improvements the library had patiently awaited, they decided to sell it, and put the proceeds into an endowment. The vote by the seven-member board, last June, was unanimous.
 And so the painting was dispatched to Sotheby's, and scheduled for auction in December, with a minimum price of $2 million. ''And then what happened is the stock market went south, and took the art market with it,'' said Mr. Da Rold, who attended the auction with several trustees.
 Nobody bid. ''We were stunned,'' Ms. Robinson said. ''Here we thought we had one little cash cow named Winslow Homer, and then it doesn't sell.''
 The library did make some money from other items it had also decided to sell -- $150,000 for a marble bust of George Washington by Hiram Powers; and $123,000 so far for some colonial currency and old coins that had been sitting for decades in a safe-deposit box, and that the library has been selling through another dealer. After the auction, Sotheby's had 60 days during which it could sell the Homer to a private buyer for $2 million. A few bargain-hunters came calling, but the clock ran out last week with no takers. 
 ''I'm happy that there's a reprieve,'' said Nancy Piwowar, a member of the city's cultural heritage commission who would like to see the painting remain in a city that has already lost too much of its history. ''People need to respect what people have given in the past. I don't know what it is, but he had to have a reason why he left it to Plainfield.''
 Under its agreement with the library, Sotheby's cleaned the painting, and will store and insure it for the next three years; the library is also scheduled to receive a hand-painted reproduction that it plans to hang inside the entrance. If the art market rebounds, the trustees may decide to put it up for auction again. As the economy has faltered, library usage has climbed -- computer usage was up by third last year, circulation was up 10 percent, and more people keep signing up for literacy classes -- and the list of needed improvements keeps getting longer.
 ''Jobs, jobs, jobs -- that's the main thing here,'' said Wayne Hunter, a library employee who helps patrons on the 19 computer terminals occupied all day long. The computers look out over the children's room that fills up as soon as school lets out, and the atrium the library would like to fill with more floor space. 
 One of the patrons was Kalief Rowan, of Plainfield, who had a job cutting grass last summer, but has been looking for work since the weather turned. ''Something in painting or construction,'' he said. He hadn't found anything yet, but he kept scrolling down the screen as patiently as the fisherman in Homer's painting has been winding up his line all these years.

HEADLINE: Two Unions In Marriage Now Face Divorce Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
With the economy in crisis and a new labor-friendly president in the White House, this should be a time when labor unions pull together.
 But one of the nation's best-known unions, Unite Here, which represents nearly 400,000 apparel, hotel, restaurant and casino workers, is doing anything but that. 
 ''This union is engaged in a civil war,'' said Bruce Raynor, president of Unite Here. 
 The hostilities have grown so serious that violent confrontations erupted last month when one faction ousted the union's top official in Michigan. 
 With great fanfare in 2004, Unite -- formerly called the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees -- merged with Here, the larger Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union. But now Mr. Raynor and many of his supporters think the merger should be undone.
 ''This union has irreconcilable differences,'' Mr. Raynor said. ''The union should have a divorce.'' 
 On paper, the marriage made sense, besides making for the catchy Unite Here name. Unite -- the descendant of two illustrious New York unions, the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union -- had lots of money to organize workers, but few workers left to unionize because so many apparel jobs had moved overseas. At the same time, Here was starved for cash, but saw an ocean of hotel and restaurant workers to unionize. 
 The idea was that once the unions merged, Unite's ample treasury -- it owns Amalgamated Bank, the only union-owned bank in the nation -- would underwrite a surge in organizing. 
 But Mr. Raynor said that the two unions separately organized more workers per year before the merger than after, and that the unions' cultures have proved vastly different. Unite was long a top-down, centralized union, working out of its headquarters in the Garment District in Manhattan; Here was probably the nation's most decentralized union, with three separate headquarters and robust rank-and-file committees at many hotels.
 ''The merger has failed,'' Mr. Raynor said.
 But the two warring camps cannot agree on even that.
 John W. Wilhelm, who was the longtime president of Here and is now the president of Unite Here's hospitality division, insists that the merger has worked, but with some inevitable bumps. Mr. Wilhelm says there is just one factor behind the dispute. 
 ''The fundamental problem is that Bruce Raynor does not believe he's accountable to the elected leadership of the union,'' Mr. Wilhelm said. ''He has made it crystal clear that if the majority of the union does not give in to him, he will destroy the union.''
 The fight is led by two hyperarticulate heavyweights, both Ivy League graduates, each using his decades of experience in battling corporations to clobber the other. 
 Mr. Raynor, 58, a Cornell graduate and chairman of the Amalgamated Bank, led the 17-year organizing drive at J. P. Stevens, the Southern textile giant, which inspired the film ''Norma Rae.'' 
 Mr. Wilhelm, 63, is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale, where he helped lead the unionization of its clerical and technical workers. He was also the top organizer and strategist in building Here's Las Vegas local, helping it unionize 40,000 hotel and casino workers over the past 30 years to become what is often called Nevada's most powerful political force.
 Mr. Raynor has filed a federal lawsuit in Brooklyn against Mr. Wilhelm and other Here leaders, accusing them of using their majority on Unite Here's executive board and executive committee to usurp some of his powers as president. The lawsuit argues that Here leaders violated the union's constitution by having the executive committee make budgetary decisions, in part to move more of the union's money and Amalgamated Bank's dividends to finance Here operations. 
 ''We're not going to allow them to hijack the resources that were put aside by generations of ladies' and men's garment workers,'' Mr. Raynor said. ''We'll do whatever we have to do to show that we can't be held captive by a bunch of thugs.''
 Mr. Wilhelm said the executive board and committee had followed the union's constitution.
 ''The notion that the merger should be disbanded because Bruce Raynor can't be a dictator is a proposition that may make sense for Bruce Raynor, but it doesn't make sense for the workers in our industries,'' Mr. Wilhelm said.
 On Jan. 30, Andy Stern, president of the powerful Service Employees International Union, wrote to Mr. Raynor and Mr. Wilhelm saying their merger had failed and suggesting that Unite Here or either of its original halves merge into his union. 
 But Mr. Stern's own union has been riven by dispute. He has ousted the leaders of a local representing 150,000 health care workers in California, and they responded by founding a rival union that is trying to get many of those 150,000 workers to secede from the service employees and join them.
 In the Unite Here dispute, Mr. Raynor, like Mr. Stern, accused his opponents of focusing on getting good wages and benefits for current union members and doing too little to organize and help nonunion workers. 
 Mr. Raynor's critics, like Mr. Stern's, accuse him of being too willing to trade gains for current union members in exchange for getting companies to make it easier to organize their nonunion employees.
 Specifically, Mr. Raynor faulted Here for having too few recent unionization successes, despite Unite Here's $48 million organizing budget. 
 Mr. Wilhelm said organizing drives often took years and acknowledged that unionization successes had dropped off. Pointing out that Here had huge successes in Las Vegas and Atlantic City several years ago, Mr. Wilhelm said, ''Organizing in the gaming industry is cyclical.'' 
 Probably the ugliest episode in the Unite Here dispute occurred last month when Mr. Raynor's allies forcibly ousted Joseph Daugherty, the president of the union's main local in Detroit, from his office. 
 ''It's terrible to have these civil wars going on right now in what are among the most dynamic unions in the country,'' said Joshua B. Freeman, a labor historian at City University Graduate Center in New York. ''It's a terrible waste of energy and undercuts tremendous possibilities.''
 In the view of Here's leaders, Mr. Raynor's strategy is to create such havoc that the union's Here-dominated board will grow so eager to end the tensions that it will agree to undo the merger -- perhaps with the help of a large payment by Unite. Here officials say the dispute should by resolved by elected leadership bodies and the union's convention this June. 
 On Friday, James R. Thompson, a former Illinois governor and the chairman of the union's public review board, asked the federal Labor Department to investigate whether the Raynor forces were maneuvering to prevent the convention from being held. Mr. Thompson pointed out that Mr. Raynor's allies walked out of a union conference in Toronto in November to prevent a quorum and stop any business from being conducted. 
 Last Wednesday, the 38 Here members on the 61-person board said in a statement, ''Our union is not the personal property of Raynor,'' adding, ''We will not permit Raynor to split the union by creating chaos and internal destruction.''
 One option is for Mr. Wilhelm and his allies to use their majority to unseat Mr. Raynor at the convention. They would not say who might succeed him, although it would most likely be Mr. Wilhelm or D. Taylor, secretary-treasurer of the Las Vegas local. But such a move could prompt individual Unite locals to secede.
 For his part, Mr. Raynor says, ''Theresponsible thing to do, since we can't resolve our differences, is to go our separate ways.''

HEADLINE: In Tough Times, Spas Stress Stress

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
IN late November, a couple of months after the global financial crisis leaped to the top of news reports, spa lovers browsing at Spafinder.com were showing new interest in a concept fit for jittery times. Along with the usual search terms, like ''day spas'' and ''massage,'' a newly prominent word was typed into the site's search engine three times more often than it had been in the summer. That word was ''stress.''
 Interest hasn't waned since, said Susie Ellis, president of SpaFinder Inc., the New York travel and marketing company that runs the Web site. Not only is ''stress'' still showing up often in the site's searches, but weekly traffic to its ''stress management'' category has doubled since the summer months. 
 When the economy was good, taking a spa vacation was largely about pampering yourself. It didn't matter that the afterglow of that $165 carrot-and-sesame body buff lasted only until your next shower. Now, with the sinking economy on most people's minds, a trip to the spa has become something else -- an investment of sorts, in well-being. 
 People are ''giving up the fluffy gold and caviar facials,'' Ms. Ellis said in an e-mail message, ''but honing in on core stress busters like therapeutic massage, etc. Especially if the price is right.'' 
 Yoga class attendance is up at the Emerson Resort and Spa in Mount Tremper, N.Y., for example, while pricey treatments like the $185 Abhyanga Scrub and Soak are down. And more guests are opting for the least expensive spa treatment -- a 30-minute back, neck and shoulder massage for $55. 
 The shift in mood is not lost on spa owners, who have long been savvy marketers, convincing people of the purifying qualities of sweat lodges and persuading them that a nightingale cleansing mask, made from sanitized bird droppings, was truly worth $109. 
 Miraval, the spa resort company based in Tucson, Ariz., is offering a new De-Stress Me package designed for ''these trying times,'' according to Tracey Anne Latkovic, the vice president of sales and marketing. The Eldorado Hotel and Spa in Santa Fe, N.M., is running a Stress Bailout promotion to attract travelers looking ''to escape the nonstop coverage of the economy,'' according to a press release.
 And under the usual New Agey marketing jargon that flashes across the sleek home page of Canyon Ranch, the destination spa company that was luring guests for body poundings and weight-loss regimens before the modern spa proliferation was a gleam in marketers' eyes, there is a new message straight from its founders, Enid and Mel Zuckerman. ''Has there ever been a time when you could have used an escape to Canyon Ranch more?'' it reads, under the caption ''The Vacation You Need'' and a proverb about health, hope and happiness. 
 ''No?'' the pitch continues. ''Then book your healthy, revitalizing getaway today and let us help you re-establish your balance. In times like these, nothing -- nothing at all -- is more important than taking care of yourself and on focusing on what really matters: Health, hope, love and a tranquil mind.'' 
 During past economic downturns, Mr. Zuckerman said in an interview, business had been ''very strong, because people need to get away to deal with stress, deal with fear, go to behaviorists, do life management, protect their health.'' So far, Canyon Ranch's revenues are ''holding up very nicely'' this time, too, he said, despite a dip in occupancy of about 10 percent in Tucson and Lenox in 2008. And the company opened a new luxury spa in Miami in December, just when the recession was proving itself entrenched.
 Of course, a little financial incentive also helps. To battle the uncertain economy's dampening effect on leisure spending, spas are marrying their new emphasis on stress relief with a flood of discounts and deals.
 Rancho La Puerta, just over the California border in Tecate, Mexico, explains its decision to keep prices at 2008 levels -- starting at $2,795 a person for seven nights, double occupancy -- this way on its Web site: ''We feel that in these tumultuous times a destination spa vacation is more important than ever.'' It has also been running Bring a Friend weeks that allow a guest staying Feb. 21 to 28, for example, to double up and share $1,500 to $2,200 in savings. 
 Miraval's Authentic Remedy package, which starts at $399 a person a night -- more than 40 percent off regular rates -- includes extras like organic wine tastings and cooking classes. Mii amo, at Enchantment Resort in Sedona, Ariz., is holding rates at 2008 levels and offering a $740 discount on its seven-night themed journeys in February. 
 Not to be outdone, the Golden Door in Escondido, Calif., has rolled back weekly rates to 2007 levels of $7,750 a person through May 24, down from $8,275 originally planned for this year, and is offering special rates like $6,000 a person for Presidents' Day week or a $500 saving if you bring a friend.
 Even Canyon Ranch, which has never lowered its published rates -- ''I could never compromise our standards or cut our programs because we no longer could be who we are,'' Mr. Zuckerman said -- is tinkering with pricing. 
 Canyon Ranch in Tucson is offering credits of up to $350 for stays of at least four nights (which start at $3,770 a person, based on double occupancy) to out-of-towners, to help offset airfares. Its sister property in Lenox, Mass., has a fifth-night-free deal through April -- in effect a discount of as much as $1,000 depending on accommodations and time of week -- and is also offering 15 percent in savings when two guests who have never stayed at a Canyon Ranch resort share accommodations.
 Last year, at the second-annual Global Spa Summit in New York, Ian Schrager, the trendsetting hotelier who is designing a new spa brand for Marriott, suggested another way spas could improve business -- add spaces where spagoers can hang out. 
 ''These are places where people can meet and socialize before or after spa treatments,'' he said in a keynote address. ''People feel good when they come out of the spa and spas can take advantage of that.''
 Spa owners have no more insight than anyone else into how long tough economic times will last. ''I have no idea whether we got another year or two or three years ahead of us,'' Mr. Zuckerman said. But in the last few weeks, Canyon Ranch bookings have been picking up ever so slightly, he said, which he takes as ''the message that people still want and need what we have to offer.''
 For the nail-biting stress victim who still has enough money left to relax at a spa at all, this may not be entirely the worst of times.

HEADLINE: Is More Relief Ahead For Small Business?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
WITH the economy in terrible shape, owners of small businesses could use a break. The tax code offers many to choose from, including some recent additions, and others may be on the way.
 Businesses received a batch of concessions late last year, when several measures that expired in 2007 were extended to cover 2008, said Barbara Weltman, a lawyer and author of ''J. K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes.'' These include a 20 percent credit on research expenditure and a provision that allows businesses that lease office or other space to recover the costs of improvements over 15 years instead of 39.
 A separate break, introduced as part of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, was a doubling, to $250,000, of the amount of equipment and other purchases that businesses could write off immediately, instead of a bit at a time through depreciation formulas, she noted. 
 The figure may go even higher. J. D. Foster, a researcher in tax and entitlement policy at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, pointed to ''a consensus in Congress to extend and expand small-business expensing.''
 It would help redress an inequity that pervades the taxation of business, he said: the fact that income is generally taxable immediately, while many costs -- the other side of the ledger -- must be deducted only over time, often a very long time.
 A more liberal expensing regimen ''seems to be something that has broad consensus politically and is certainly helpful for small businesses,'' Mr. Foster said. Just how valuable a benefit it is in a time like this, though, is debatable. 
 ''It doesn't do any good if you don't have enough income to use the deduction,'' he pointed out.
 Ms. Weltman agreed, saying that the same applies to many other breaks. Doing even less good for small business are changes in some states that are seeking ways to shore up their depleted treasuries. She advised vigilance for ''piddling kinds of tax increases that can impact small business.''
 One change to federal tax rules that could be useful in today's climate, especially for businesses that were on a winning streak before slamming head-on into the recession, is found in the stimulus package now snaking its way through Congress. 
 A provision would allow businesses that had a loss last year to offset it against profits earned as far back as five years. Businesses could immediately recoup tax paid on the profits that the 2008 loss wiped away.
 ''Ordinarily when a business suffers a net operating loss, it can carry back the loss two years,'' Ms. Weltman explained. Lawmakers ''want to extend that to five years, so if you have a very big loss, you're going to be able to get a refund now. They're trying to let businesses get some money back so they can use it to survive.''
 The amount that can be carried back is limited to 90 percent of the loss; the rest is forfeited. This piece of the provision is known as ''Rangel's wrinkle,'' she said, a reference to Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the panel that oversees budget matters.
 Deductions and accounting devices won't prevent some businesses from being unable to pay their full tax bill. As with individual taxpayers, the Internal Revenue Service is willing to show businesses some leeway, a spokeswoman for the agency said. Debt collections may be postponed if matters have gone that far, and leniency may be granted when payments are missed under installment agreements.
 Whether or not they get a hand from Congress or the I.R.S., owners of small businesses can give themselves a break by structuring their affairs in a tax-efficient way. Fred Freifeld, an accountant in South Florida, tells fledgling entrepreneurs that they can reduce their liability by incorporating, but that doing so can also make tax matters more complicated, with more kinds of taxes to pay and more frequent payments.
 Small-business owners must make payments of estimated personal and, if relevant, corporate income tax, as well as self-employment tax, the equivalent of Social Security and Medicare taxes paid by employees and employers. That requires discipline and, of course, cash, which can be hard to come by when a business is new or operating in a weak economy.
 ''Don't get behind the eight ball as far as taxes go,'' Mr. Freifeld said. ''You're not used to estimated tax payments; you're used to being an employee and having taxes withheld. Taxes have to be paid quarterly, and there are penalties if you don't. A lot of times people who start their own businesses don't think about it.''
 IT is not as though business owners have nothing else to occupy their thoughts. The complexities of taxation and a concentration on other aspects of running a business may mean that new tax breaks are not as beneficial as these owners hope.
 ''The tax code is a pain in the neck,'' Mr. Foster said. ''My sense is that small-business people have very little time or inclination to follow the threats or opportunities developing in Washington. If there were a proposal to reduce tax rates on small businesses, it would be more eye-catching.''

HEADLINE: War's Lingering Scars Slow Bosnia's Economic Growth

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina 

 BODY:
During the three-and-a-half-year siege of Sarajevo in the 1990s, Brano Vujicic provided Internet access to thousands in Bosnia, braving Serbian grenades thrown under his window and countering the constant electricity cuts by hacking into the Bosnian president's power supply.
 ''Doing business was an act of defiance and escape,'' said Mr. Vujicic, who managed to send e-mail messages to friends and clients twice a day during the height of the siege. ''We needed a way out of Sarajevo and a way to communicate with the world.''
 Fourteen years later, Mr. Vujicic -- who is part Serb, part Croat -- leads Ping, a computer and software engineering company that serves clients in the banking, food processing and pharmaceutical sectors and has $2.5 million in annual revenue. 
 These days, his chief challenge is finding skilled computer engineers and drumming up business in a country where government bureaucracy absorbs a staggering 50 percent of the gross domestic product and the average monthly wage is about $450. Even with 25 percent unemployment, he complains, it is hard to find qualified employees since the best engineers have left.
 Bosnia, a former Yugoslav republic, was already struggling with the transition from communism to capitalism when it became mired in a war from 1992 to 1995 that killed 100,000 people and decimated its infrastructure.
 Today, the country known as Bosnia and Herzegovina has a new class of young entrepreneurs, a growing influx of tourists and new shopping malls selling everything from luxury ski equipment to mango bathing gel. But the country remains weighed down not just by a bloated bureaucracy, but also by a national brand inextricably linked with ethnic violence and an economy overly dependent on foreign aid.
 With fears rising about political tensions and a renewed determination in Europe and the United States to bring stability to the region, Bosnia's ability to develop a sustainable economy has become a crucial test. 
 Business people complain that navigating a byzantine regulatory system remains a hassle. While the Dayton accords ended the war, they also created two autonomous regions within Bosnia, the Muslim-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serb republic. The result is a bloated public sector, presided over by 160 government ministers.
 Bosnians joke that if you go to Marshal Tito Street in the center of Sarajevo, the capital, and shout ''minister,'' 50 people will turn their heads. ''This overabundance of public sector officials is impeding growth,'' said Irena Jankulov, an economist in Sarajevo with the International Monetary Fund, which monitors the country's economic performance.
 Nihad Imamovic is president of ASA Prevent, an important exporter that produces upholstery for the global car industry, sells Volkswagen cars and employs 3,500 people in Bosnia. The plucky, fuel-efficient Volkswagen Golf has ''war hero'' status in Bosnia because when fuel supplies were scarce during the war, Sarajevans managed to power Golfs using cooking oil and oil from power stations.
 Mr. Imamovic, president of the Bosnian Employers' Association, said political instability was undermining the economy, along with unnecessary duplication of agencies in the two regions: 11 health funds and 11 employment agencies in the Muslim-Croat federation alone, for example. A bloated bureaucracy is also hampering business. It takes 60 days to start a company in Bosnia, according to the World Bank, compared with 5 days in Hungary or 9 days in Afghanistan.
 Social costs for employers are also punishing, with more than 40 percent of gross wages in the federation going toward social security, health care and taxes. Added taxes to support the forestry and tourism sectors cost ASA Prevent $1 million more a year.
 Bosnia, with a population of 4.5 million, has not been immune to the global crisis. In the past two months, more than 6,500 people have lost their jobs, straining the country's already overburdened benefits system. That followed panicked hoarding in October, when tens of thousands of people lined up at banks and demanded their deposits; such was the frenzy to store cash that people in Sarajevo struggled to find unrented vaults and safes. 
 Ms. Jankulov of the monetary fund said the reaction was a hangover from the war and the Yugoslav era, when Yugoslav banks collapsed and inflation jumped to 1,000 percent. But she was quick to add that confidence had since been restored.
 Kemal Kozaric, governor of the Bosnian Central Bank, said growth was expected to halve to 3 percent in 2009. But he emphasized that the economy's foundations were solid, including foreign-owned banks with a high degree of liquidity.
 Mr. Kozaric said Bosnia's economic potential was in aluminum and steel production and, in the long term, in energy, particularly hydroelectricity and coal. The government plans to build eight hydroelectric plants to transform Bosnia into a regional energy hub, with a surplus for export.
 But the country's current dependence on Russian natural gas became all too apparent during the recent cut in supplies that left 100,000 households shivering and required an aluminum plant, Birac, and Bosnia's largest steel maker, ArcelorMittal Zenica, to partly suspend production.
 Business people in Sarajevo say the economy will get a lift if Bosnia succeeds in joining the European Union. But European officials lament that progress is flagging because of infighting between the country's regions, along with corruption and organized crime.
 Lacking the benefit of the European Union's borderless travel, Mr. Vujicic, the computer entrepreneur, said that a recent business trip to Ancona, Italy, required him to stand in lines for hours at the Italian Consulate and present ''half a kilogram of papers'' to obtain a visa. 
 An economic gulf also appears to be growing between Bosnia's two regions, with privatization of state-owned industries in the Muslim-Croat federation proceeding slowly compared with the Bosnian Serb republic.
 At the same time, a surge in Russian investment in the Serbian republic is fanning fears in the West that the entity is becoming a vassal of the Kremlin. In April, the Serbian prime minister, Milorad Dodik, sold majority stakes in the country's sole state-owned oil refinery, a lubricant producer, and a fuel retailer to the Russian state oil firm for $155 million. 
 While ethnic tensions continue to poison politics, some business people remain hopeful that economics could trump nationalism. Ljubo Kovac, the Serb owner of Rubin, a wood-processing company in the Bosnian Serb republic that which makes door and window frames, said his clients included dozens of Muslim Bosnians and Catholic Croats.
 ''Business is going on between the disparate ethnic groups,'' he said. ''It is the politicians who create all the problems.'' 
 But Mr. Vujicic, whose company is based in Sarajevo, which has a Muslim majority, said he had given up bidding for contracts in the Bosnian Serb republic because he always lost out to Serb-run companies.
 Despite those and other difficulties, he said, Bosnia's most pressing need was an image makeover that help attract more foreign investment.
 ''The war brand attached to us remains a problem,'' he said, ''because people who want to invest here still can't get over the past.''

HEADLINE: Now If Only We Could Mint Lincoln Himself

BYLINE: By THOMAS VINCIGUERRA

 BODY:
On Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday this Thursday, most Americans will probably continue to consign the penny that bears his whiskered profile to their change jars, toss it into public fountains and otherwise treat it as an annoying trifle.
 Shame on them. Humble though its copper-coated zinc corpus may be, the Lincoln cent represents a triumph of American iconography in miniature. Before its debut in 1909, no actual person had been depicted on a regular-denomination circulating United States coin. 
 This was no accident. Emperors, kings and other authority figures had long projected their power by stamping their faces on loose change. In 1791, Congress was set to follow their example by impressing the likeness of our first head of state, George Washington, on our metal money. Succeeding presidents would appear on coins struck after they were elected.
 But Washington argued against the idea, deeming it too ''monarchical.''
 ''It smacked of royalty,'' said David W. Lange, director of research for Numismatic Guaranty Corporation in Sarasota, Fla. ''It was not a good omen for a new republic.''
 So the Mint Act of 1792 mandated that there would instead ''be an impression emblematic of liberty'' on our standard coinage. On the front, this usually constituted an idealized, goddess-like figure. The solution was practical and patriotic enough to hold sway through the 19th century.
 Unfortunately, this familiarity bred contempt. Artists at the United States Mint took the liberty motif so much for granted that some of their designs grew dowdy and uninspired. In 1892, one newspaper declared that the liberty image that Charles Barber, the mint's chief engraver, had put on the country's new dime, quarter and half-dollar resembled ''the ignoble Emperor Vitellius with a goiter.''
 President Theodore Roosevelt had his own thoughts. In 1904, he complained to Secretary of the Treasury Leslie Mortimer Shaw, ''Our coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness.'' 
 In 1908, Roosevelt suggested that the Lithuanian-born sculptor Victor David Brenner, who had created a Lincoln plaque that the president admired, replicate his handiwork on a circulating coin. Early in 1909, Mr. Brenner wrote to the mint's director, Frank A. Leach, that an image of Lincoln would ''compose very well'' on our one-cent piece. 
 And it did, with little if any official objection. Indeed, when it was released to the public on Aug. 2, 1909, the Lincoln cent was a hit. At banks and Treasury buildings in New York, Washington, Boston and other cities, long lines formed to snap the coins up. In Philadelphia, some entrepreneurs sold them for as much as 25 cents apiece.
 So much for Washington's ''monarchical'' concerns. 
 ''Lincoln was quintessentially a man of freedom,'' said Douglas Mudd, curator of the American Numismatic Association Money Museum. ''So there couldn't be much question about it from that standpoint. Also, Lincoln was dead at that point. He was an icon. It wasn't as if Teddy Roosevelt had suggested putting himself on the coin.''
 Q. David Bowers, author of ''A Guide Book of Lincoln Cents,'' said, ''The Lincoln was the first coin in the hands of the public where they said, 'Hey, I know who that is.' It was new and exciting.''
 Not everyone was excited. Confederate veterans naturally grumbled. The New York Times inveighed against the coin's ''rather poor design'' and called it ''another ill-considered freak of Mr. Roosevelt's will.''
 Today, the complaints about the Lincoln penny are quite different. Thanks to rising metal prices, the cost of making it (1.4 cents) exceeds its face value. Critics also charge that counting out pennies during purchases and parceling them into 50-cent rolls for deposit in banks costs companies more than $300 million annually in lost productivity. A small but persistent chorus wants to scrap the cent entirely.
 They face an uphill battle. This year, the mint is releasing a series of four new images on the reverse of the Lincoln cent, each one depicting a different stage of Lincoln's life. Mint officials hope that the novelty might generate some of the popularity that greeted its recent 50 State Quarters program.
 Mr. Bowers said he thought that the economy, the new administration, and other current events have overshadowed this radical redesign.
 ''If the timing had been different,'' he said, ''the news about the Lincoln reverses would have been on the front page of USA Today.''

HEADLINE: In Japan, New Jobless May Lack Safety Net

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: OITA, Japan 

 BODY:
Koji Hirano said his ''mind went blank'' with disbelief when he and other workers at a Canon digital camera factory in this southern city were suddenly called into a cafeteria in late October and told they were being laid off.
 The shock turned to fear when they were also ordered to vacate their employer-provided apartments, a common job benefit here. With no savings from his monthly take-home pay of as little as $700, he said, he faced certain homelessness.
 ''They were going to kick us out into the winter cold to die,'' said Mr. Hirano, 47.
 The current economic crisis has spread joblessness and distress across the world, and Japan has been no exception -- with output plunging at historic rates, the unemployment rate leapt to 4.4 percent in December from 3.9 percent the month before. But what has proved more shocking has been the fact that so many of those laid off have been so vulnerable, with hundreds and perhaps thousands finding themselves cast into the streets. 
 Mr. Hirano and the others laid off by Canon are part of a new subclass of Japanese workers created during a decade of American-style deregulation. As short-term employees they have none of the rights of so-called salarymen or even the factory workers for Japan's legions of small manufacturers.
 To make matters worse, they can expect little in the way of unemployment or welfare benefits. In Japan, a country with little experience of widespread unemployment until recently, there is an inadequate safety net for laid-off workers.
 According to the Labor Ministry, about 131,000 layoffs have been announced since October. Of those, only about 6,000 were culled from the majority of Japanese workers who hold traditional full-time jobs, which are still often held for life. The overwhelming majority -- some 125,000, the ministry says -- are so-called nonregular workers, who are sent by staffing agencies or hired on short-term contracts with lower pay, fewer benefits and none of the legal protections against layoffs of regular full-time employees.
 Mr. Hirano and other former temporary workers at Canon were allowed to stay in their apartments for a few extra months after a public outcry reached all the way to the prime minister. But others have not been so lucky. Over the New Year holiday some 500 disgruntled former temporary workers made homeless by layoffs built an impromptu tent city in a Tokyo park adjacent to the Labor Ministry.
 As never before, the global downturn has driven home how a decade of economic transformation has eroded Japan's gentler version of capitalism, in which companies once laid off employees only as a last resort. 
 ''This recession has opened the nation's eyes to its growing social inequalities,'' said Masahiro Abe, a professor at Dokkyo University who specializes in labor relations. ''There is a whole population of workers who are outside the traditional support net.''
 Until a decade ago, nonregular workers accounted for less than a quarter of Japan's total work force, and included subcontractors and others outside the lifetime employment system as well as students or homemakers working part-time jobs at restaurants or convenience stores. 
 But the number of nonregular workers took off after an easing of labor laws in 1999 and again in 2004 allowed temporary workers to work on factory lines and in other jobs once largely restricted to full-time workers. During Japan's economic recovery in this decade, companies added millions of less expensive temporary employees while continuing to reduce overall numbers of full-time staff. 
 Today, 34.5 percent of Japan's 55.3 million workers are nonregular employees, including many primary breadwinners for households, according to the Internal Affairs Ministry. 
 Under the nation's traditional company-centered social welfare system, created after World War II, companies were expected to look after employees until retirement and beyond, serving as the main conduit for pensions and other benefits, and keeping jobless rosters empty by not laying off workers. 
 Even the limited government job-loss benefits were devised with lifetime employees in mind. To receive unemployment insurance, for instance, workers must have held the same job for at least a year, effectively excluding most temporary workers, whose contracts can be as short as two months. This has left at least half of Japan's 17.8 million nonregular workers ineligible for unemployment aid, say labor experts and Labor Ministry officials. 
 According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Japan spends about 0.3 percent of its gross domestic product on unemployment benefits, far below Western European countries and about the same as the United States, which tolerates far more social dislocation and poverty than Japan.
 According to labor experts and Labor Ministry officials, Japan needs to revamp the system to fit a more dynamic labor market in which not all jobs are held for life, and to prevent layoffs from being so financially devastating. 
 ''Japan's social safety net has failed to keep up with changes in the labor market,'' said Yusuke Inoue, a section chief in the Labor Ministry's bureau of stable employment. ''We must build a safety net that suits this more deregulated working environment.''
 After a public outcry, Tokyo has promised to expand unemployment benefits to those who have worked six months or more. The government has also tried to shore up the traditional system by pressuring companies to elevate more nonregular workers to full-time status, with Prime Minister Taro Aso telling companies in December that ''regular employment is best.''
 Some of the first layoffs to gain national attention were at two Canon factories in Oita, where some 1,100 temporary workers were let go, including Mr. Hirano.
 As a temporary worker, Mr. Hirano was technically the employee of a staffing agency, and not of the factory where he worked. As a result, Canon executives even refused at first to accept a letter written by him and other laid-off temporary workers asking for their jobs back, Mr. Hirano said. After 30 minutes of discussion in front of the factory's gate, the executives finally took the letter, he said. He said he never got a response.
 In a written response to questions from The New York Times, Canon said it had underestimated the difficulties faced by the laid-off temporary workers in the current economic downturn and would offer them more aid, including help in staying longer in their apartments. 
 Mr. Hirano and other laid-off temporary workers said their annual pay was about $22,000 a year, below what many labor experts call Japan's poverty line of $25,000 a year.
 To make ends meet, even when employed, Mr. Hirano said he usually cooked a small stew of cabbages and carrots every night in the tiny kitchen in the corner of his one-room apartment. He added chicken to the stew only on days it was on sale at the supermarket, he said.
 Mr. Hirano and others said they had applied for a dozen jobs each, with no luck in the current market. With their meager savings running out, they said, they had applied for welfare a half dozen times in two months, only to be rejected by officials who said they were not trying hard enough to find new employment. The officials said the former workers were ineligible for unemployment support because they had worked at Canon less than a year.
 Just in case he gets kicked out of the apartment suddenly, Mr. Hirano has packed most of his belongings in a half dozen cardboard boxes that sit in a corner of his room, next to an unmade futon and a table covered in resumes.
 Mr. Hirano and his co-workers said they felt betrayed. They said that they had believed that if they worked hard, Canon would reward them with an offer of direct employment, at higher pay.
 ''We did our best, so Canon should have taken care of us,'' said one 32-year-old laid-off worker who was so ashamed of his situation that he asked that only his family name, Murakami, be used. ''That is the Japanese way. But this isn't Japan anymore.''

HEADLINE: New Tax Breaks Add Value To a Home

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN. 
Expanded tax tips are at nytimes.com/business/yourtaxes.

 BODY:
HOME is not only where the heart is. Increasingly, it is also where the tax breaks are, and not just the all-important deductions for mortgage interest and real estate taxes. Recent provisions offer breaks for home sales and purchases, for example.
 Of course, these provisions are but a few aspects of the nation's complex and ever-changing tax code. There are many other possibilities for saving on taxes -- or for being tripped up. 
 The new first-time homebuyer credit can reduce a couple's taxes for 2008 or 2009 by up to $7,500, or a single filer's by up to $3,750. Actually, the name is a bit of a misnomer. A ''first-time homebuyer'' is a person or couple who had no ownership interest in a principal residence in the United States during the three years ended on the purchase date of the residence for which the credit is claimed. Thus, someone who formerly owned a home, then rented for several years, could qualify. The purchase must be on or after April 9, 2008, and before July 1, 2009. 
 Homebuyers who qualify are allowed a one-time credit of 10 percent of the purchase price, up to the $7,500 or $3,750 limit, against their income tax for the year of purchase. Although it is termed a refundable tax credit in a 2008 law, it is essentially an interest-free loan that must be repaid in equal amounts over 15 years, starting the year after the credit is claimed. The credit is available to joint filers with modified adjusted gross income below $150,000; it phases out once income exceeds $170,000. For single filers, the numbers are $75,000 and $95,000. 
 ''I think it's a good deal,'' said Barbara Weltman, a tax lawyer in Millwood, N.Y., who is also a contributing editor of ''J. K. Lasser's Your Income Tax 2009,'' (Wiley, $18.95). ''My daughter bought a home in October,'' she said, and will benefit from the credit. And one proposal for tax legislation now being discussed in Congress is to eliminate the repayment requirement, making it an even better deal. 
 Widows and widowers who sold homes last year may also get a new tax break. Previously, couples were generally entitled to exclude gains of up to $500,000 when they sold a principal residence in which they had lived two of the previous five years, but for single filers the exclusion was limited to $250,000. Effective in 2008, a surviving spouse may exclude up to $500,000 if the sale occurs within two years of the other spouse's death. 
 ''This can make a huge difference,'' said Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and certified public accountant, citing the example of a widow in her 60s whose husband died in October. Under the previous law, she would have had to sell her house, the couple's main asset, in just over two months to get the maximum exclusion. But given the state of the housing market, as well as emotional, family and estate issues, that would have been almost impossible. Now she has two years to sell. 
 Residential energy credits of 30 percent of the cost of certain improvements are available to homeowners, Ms. Weltman noted, with caps of $500 to $2,000, depending on the improvement. They include qualified expenditures on equipment for solar electric power, solar water heating, fuel cells, wind energy and geothermal heat pumps, and for their installation. More traditional energy-saving improvements, like increasing insulation to use less heating oil or natural gas, do not qualify. 
 Homeowners may also qualify for a plus-size standard deduction. Traditionally, taxpayers have had a choice of whether to itemize their deductions on Schedule A or to take the standard deduction. ''Now people have to pay more attention as to whether they might be better off with the standard,'' said Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y. 
 The reason is that a 2008 law allows homeowners who take the standard deduction an additional standard deduction for state and local property taxes. It is $500 for single filers and $1,000 for joint filers. ''People may want to plan ahead -- take the standard deduction one year and itemize the next year,'' he said, bunching outlays like charitable gifts and certain miscellaneous itemized deductions in the years they itemize.
 Those who don't own homes should also watch for potential savings and pitfalls. 
 DEDUCTING SALES TAXESPeople who itemize deductions have another choice, Mr. Block said: whether to deduct state and local income taxes or sales taxes. Congress originally enacted this option to put taxpayers in states like Texas and Florida that do not levy a state income tax on a par with those in other states; it has been extended for 2008 and 2009. 
 But even in a normally high-tax state like New York, some people may benefit by deducting sales taxes, Mr. Block said. That may be true if they have made a big purchase like a car or a yacht, or if they are retired, because ''their New York state liability may be nominal or zero.'' The state does not tax income from Social Security, pensions from state and local governments or the first $20,000 of other pension income. 
 MILITARY BREAKS Military personnel and their families may qualify for a number of tax breaks, said George Jones, a lawyer who is senior federal tax analyst in the Washington office of CCH, which publishes books and software for tax professionals. Combat pay, for example, is not taxable up to the highest rate of enlisted pay, which was $7,100 a month in 2008. For income that is taxable, he said, members of the armed forces have ''the flexibility of extended deadlines to file and pay, and that is really significant.'' 
 The Internal Revenue Service has ''done a good job of grouping benefits together on its Web site,'' he said. It offers an article at irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=97273,00.html. And Publication 3, ''Armed Forces Tax Guide,'' is at irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3.pdf. 
 UNEMPLOYMENT The loss of a job also has implications at tax time, Mr. Jones pointed out. Unemployment compensation is taxable for 2008, but there has been talk in Washington of changing that, he said, ''so keep an eye on it.'' Expenses incurred in the search for a new job in the same line of work are deductible.
 On a related note for people who are hard-pressed financially, he said, ''the I.R.S. promises to be a little more flexible in approving requests for installment payment plans'' for their taxes on Form 9465. Requests involving less than $10,000 may be approved automatically for taxpayers who have not entered into installment agreements in the past five years. 
 THE KIDDIE TAX This tax, formerly applied to income from investments held in the names of younger children, is now also levied on the unearned income of full-time, dependent students up to age 24. The tax makes interest, dividends and capital gains taxable at the parents' rate instead of the children's. 
 Ms. Weltman said that this did not mean the children's income had to be reported on the parents' return, where it would increase adjusted gross income -- a number that ripples through the return and may reduce various benefits. Generally, it is advantageous to file separate returns for the children and simply pay the tax on unearned income at the parents' rate. If the children also have earned income from summer jobs, for example, that is taxed at their own rates. 
 I.R.A.'S Eligible taxpayers still have a way to cut their 2008 taxes -- by contributing to a deductible I.R.A. And more people are now eligible than may realize it, Mr. Kess said. What is more, the contribution limits rose to $5,000 for 2008 and later, plus anadditional $1,000 for people who were age 50 or older by the end of the year. Contributions for last year may be made until April 15. 
 ''Even an active participant in a retirement plan can contribute,'' he said, if income is not too high. Single filers whose adjusted gross income is below $53,000 can contribute the full amount; the deduction is phased out as income rises to $63,000. For married people filing jointly, the income limit is $85,000, phasing out at $105,000. 
 A nonworking spouse or a spouse who works but is not a participant in a qualified retirement plan may contribute if A.G.I. on a joint return is less than $159,000, phasing out at $169,000. 
 MILEAGE DEDUCTIONS These deductions generally rose last year because gasoline prices rose, Mr. Kess said, but the deduction depends on the type of eligible driving and when it occurred. One set of rates applied until June 30; then they rose for July 1 through Dec. 31. 
 For unreimbursed business use of a personal vehicle, the rates are 50 1/2 cents a mile and 58 1/2 cents a mile. For medical or moving mileage, the rates are 19 cents and 27 cents, but charitable use is limited to 14 cents a mile, a rate set by Congress in 1997.
 THE 0 PERCENT RATE The best 2008 change for some taxpayers is undoubtedly the zero rate on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, applying to those in the regular 10 percent and 15 percent brackets, but Ms. Weltman said she keeps getting calls from people who don't believe it. It seems too good to be true.

 CORRECTION:
The ''Tax Tips'' article in the special Your Taxes report last Sunday, about help for homeowners, misstated the amount of the new 2008 tax credit for a single person who is buying a home for the first time. The buyer may claim a credit of up to $7,500, the same as married couples; they are not limited to $3,750. (Married taxpayers who file separately may claim no more than $3,750 each. For 2009, the tax credit is being revised as part of the new stimulus legislation.)

HEADLINE: As Pipeline to Wall Street Narrows, Princeton Students Adjust Sights

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Princeton, N.J. 

 BODY:
 There must be a screenplay in the fabulous Schoppe twins, Christine and Jennifer, Princeton University juniors from Houston.
 They had the same G.P.A. and SATs in high school, where they became Gold Award Girl Scouts, sort of the female version of Eagle Scouts. They live together and take all the same courses, wear identical necklace rings given to them by their grandmother and share the same goal -- the kind of high-energy, high-paying job on Wall Street that recent generations of Princeton students have seen as their birthright. They're smart, precociously mature and, as a friend says, ''ambitious, but not in an evil way.''
 Maybe the story line (think identical brunet Reese Witherspoons) will tell how the Schoppe twins descend on Wall Street and drill both business sense and common sense into the fat-bonus, $35,000-commode crowd. 
 First they have to get there. Despite being in the rigorous Operations Research and Financial Engineering program, they are still struggling to land interviews for summer internships amid the financial meltdown.
 ''I'm committed to pursuing this until the last person says, 'No,' '' said Christine (I think). Her sister agreed.
 Many in that fat-bonus crowd got where they were from Princeton, where vast armies of Wall Street recruiters have traditionally taken over the historic Nassau Inn nearby to woo not just Operations Research and Financial Engineering whizzes but innocent art history majors as well. Jobs for all! That was then.
 There are still plenty of strivers, like the Schoppes, committed to staying the course. But even on the Masters of the Universe track at Princeton (full disclosure: I taught a journalism class there last year), the world looks a lot different. 
 ''People feel there's less long-term potential for a career in investment banking; it won't be as financially rewarding, perhaps there's less prestige attached to it,'' said Merritt Hummer, a junior and one of the last Princeton students to do an internship at Lehman Brothers.
 ''People at Princeton are very competitive,'' Ms. Hummer continued. ''They like to be with the best and at the best place. In light of recent events, banks don't have quite the same appeal as they used to.''
 Of course, plenty of Princeton students would kill for a Wall Street job. Doug Eshleman is a junior whose mother was recently laid off by JPMorgan Chase after a 30-year career. He has an internship there this summer and hopes it leads to a full-time job, though he says, these days, his dream employer would be Apple.
 ''I worry about the job security, and I know the amount of money is not going to be there in the future,'' he said. ''When you look at this kind of work, my mother left home at 5:30 in the morning and got back at 11. It's a huge number of hours. If I'm going to work those kind of hours, I expect to be paid well.''
 Wall Street is not going away. Perhaps in five years the storm will have passed and the recruiters from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, if they exist, will overrun the Nassau Inn, their luster restored.
 And then, maybe not. James Tate, a junior from Satellite Beach, Fla., is an investment whiz who made money (''enough to buy a Mustang'') trading stocks during the market collapse. He's still a bear on the market and on Wall Street jobs.
 ''The world has definitely changed,'' he said. ''For the seniors and people in my class who planned to head to Wall Street, they'll keep trying. But in the classes beyond, they're going to be looking for something new, maybe technology, maybe consumer services. Maybe they'll go back to blue chips like Procter & Gamble or McDonald's. A lot of people will go to grad school. But I don't see those Wall Street jobs coming back in the next decade.''
 If so, it might not be all bad. It's not that the lowly history majors or aspiring poets resented their peers getting rich on Wall Street (well, not all of them resented their peers getting rich). But those not on the Masters of the Universe track say the world might be better off, and graduates even happier, without the huge vacuum cleaner sucking everyone to Wall Street.
 Consider Daphra Holder, a 2007 Princeton graduate, who took the customary ride to Wall Street. When she got there, she found the hours long, the work uninteresting, the environment unfulfilling. After a year, she took a pay cut and left for a nonprofit, DonorsChoose.org, that finds ways for people to donate needed items to public school classrooms around the country.
 ''Without Wall Street as the default position, I think people will be forced to think outside the box in their career choices, which is a good thing,'' she said. ''I just got an e-mail from a friend at UBS who said, 'I didn't get a bonus this year, and I don't want to be here anymore.' Hopefully, there will be a flood of talent to nonprofits and technology companies and places other than Wall Street. I just know I'm a lot happier. I wake up every morning excited to get to work.''

HEADLINE: Nets Try Different Ways to Sell Tickets in Tough Economy

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

 BODY:
Amid a sagging economy and declining turnstile counts felt across the N.B.A., it is hard to argue that the Nets are not being proactive. 
 But it is also hard to determine if their innovative marketing techniques are falling on deaf ears or empty pockets.
This season, he Nets have offered free tickets to unemployed fans who offered their resumes for job placement; announced that companies can enter a basketball tournament, with the winner receiving free sponsorships for the first two months of next season; and sold tickets at a bulk rate to a Web site that offers comparison pricing for household utilities. 
 The Nets entered Saturday's game against the Denver Nuggets with an average attendance of 14,750, which is 24th among the N.B.A.'s 30 franchises. The number of tickets sold are incorporated into the average instead of turnstile count, and on some nights, the Izod Center's attendance appears to fall far short of the average. 
 The Nets recently announced a ticket exchange with the N.H.L.'s Florida Panthers, where northern transplants in Florida with season tickets to the Nets can exchange them for hockey tickets. Panthers season-ticket holders can do the opposite. 
 ''It's a challenge out there,'' Brett Yormark, the Nets' chief executive, said. ''One, the economy and disposable income has been somewhat reduced. Wherever people spend their money, they need to make sure they're getting their investment back. We're thinking about that every day.''
 For Yormark, the exchange with the Panthers was a natural idea. His twin, Michael, is the Panthers' president and chief operating officer. 
 ''There are a lot of people from Florida that are transplanted from New Jersey,'' Yormark said. ''For me and for him, times like now call for value creation and how you can create more value for your ticket holders.
 ''If this works, I want to look to align myself with other venues. If they're missing a Nets game, that's O.K., they can turn that into collateral somewhere else.''
 In December, Saveology, a consumer comparison Web site for household utilities, purchased 100,000 ticket vouchers at a bulk rate from the Nets. Some of the tickets were donated to charities and hospitals. The rest were distributed in the New Jersey area to people who provided personal information to Saveology.
 The vouchers, to be redeemed through Ticketmaster, are available for four remaining games. For example, when the Nets host the Charlotte Bobcats in April, the voucher can be used to sit in the lower bowl of the arena in an area usually priced from $81 to $120 for the convenience charge of 75 cents. 
 ''These are the type of partnerships that you are going to see more and more of,'' Yormark said.
 In the struggle for relevancy, Yormark said actual bodies in the Izod Center are down only 3 percent this season. Last season, the Nets' average attendance was 15,656, but their team included Jason Kidd until his midseason trade, and Richard Jefferson, traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in the off-season. 
 At the Izod Center, the Nets are in a lame-duck situation, having alienated some of their New Jersey fans with their stated intention to move to Brooklyn, though that move is snarled by legal issues and the economic turbulence.
 Still, there is basketball to be played. And there are tickets to try to sell; in these times, that calls for a bit of innovation. 
 ''We fight for it every night,'' Yormark said. ''In good times, in bad times. We're the underdog in the marketplace and we need to prove ourselves everyday. We need to prove it even more now.''

SPADE & ARCHER
 The Prequel to Dashiell Hammett's ''The Maltese Falcon''
 By Joe Gores
 337 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $24
 As is customary when a publisher wants to be extra-helpful, the early review copies of ''Spade & Archer: The Prequel to Dashiell Hammett's 'The Maltese Falcon' '' include a ''conversation'' with the author, Joe Gores. The book, Gores tells his deferential interlocutor (identified only as ''Q''), was chiefly inspired by the Hammett scholar Richard Layman's remark that ''The Maltese Falcon,'' serialized in 1929-30, was ''America's first existential novel'': ''I thought, yes, that's exactly right. You don't know anything about the past of these people; they just appear full-blown, as if they sprang from the head of Zeus.'' It makes you wonder, not only about the freshness of Gores's metaphorical invention, but also about his common sense: in the process of inventing back stories for Hammett's characters, isn't he de-existentializing the very imaginative vision that drew him to the project in the first place? 
 True, Gores does a more convincing job for Hammett than some writers have done for themselves -- surely no reader of Rex Stout, for instance, really believes that Nero Wolfe was ever a lithe mountain lad from Montenegro. It's plausible that Hammett's amoral yet moralistic detective Sam Spade might have fought in World War I, as Gores tells us he did, and that Dundy, Spade's blustering, ineffectual antagonist on the San Francisco police force, might once have been a strikebreaker. It's even plausible that Iva, the wife of Spade's worthless partner, Miles Archer, might have jilted Sam when he went off to war. But do we care? In ''The Maltese Falcon'' we already know these people perfectly well. They are, an existentialist might say, what they do -- and, a writer might add, how they talk. 
 Perhaps the most un-Hammettlike moment in Gores's book comes when Spade's lawyer, Sid Wise, tells him: ''You're a very different man from that 27-year-old kid who shoved a crumpled-up newspaper into my hand in our old office building over Remedial Loans. Harder. Colder.'' ''A lot has happened to both of us,'' Sam replies. ''We grew up.'' But that's wrong. Sam Spade has always been hard, cold and grown up, or he wouldn't be Sam Spade. 
 Still, if anyone had to write this book, Gores would be the guy. Hammett's surviving daughter must have thought so, since she picked him to do this first-ever spinoff. Like Hammett himself, a onetime Pinkerton man, Gores has worked as a private investigator; he's won three Edgar Awards; and his 16 previous novels include ''Hammett,'' in which the father of modern detective fiction rises from his typewriter to hunt down a murderer. Gores doesn't call himself a Hammett scholar, but he's clearly an obsessive -- and for a writer of the 21st century, this obsession isn't entirely wholesome. 
 Hammett's most annoyingly antiquated tic is his felt obligation to give every character, even the walk-ons, a wearisomely full physical description, clothes and all, and Gores feels obliged to do the same. ''The Marin County sheriff's deputy who met them at the dock was long and lank with an unexpected watermelon potbelly under a gaudy yellow-and-green checked woolen shirt. He wore a black wide-brimmed fedora and a heavy tan corduroy jacket and black denim jeans over muddy boots, one of which was partially unlaced.'' ''She was perhaps 22, tall and full-bosomed for a Chinese woman, Western in bearing. Her hair, of indeterminate length, was jet-black, worked into a large bun at the back of her head. She wore an untrimmed felt hat, a tan tailored frock with a contrasting pongee collar and a matching silk ribbon tie. Her shoes were the latest flat-heeled style.'' 
 Some of these details may be telling, but which? More knowing writers leave readers room to visualize on their own, and keep the clutter down to the necessary, strategically selected minimum. When it comes to Spade himself, Gores is stuck with Hammett's own impossible-to-visualize description: ''The steep rounded slope of his shoulders made his body seem almost conical -- no broader than it was thick -- and kept his freshly pressed gray coat from fitting very well. . . . The smooth thickness of his arms, legs and body, the sag of his big rounded shoulders, made his body like a bear's.'' Gores renders this baffling image more economical-- ''His powerful, conical, almost bearlike body kept his gray woolen suit coat from fitting well'' -- though it's hard to see how ''woolen'' helps any, except to suggest that it gets chilly in San Francisco. And of course Gores has to work in the familiar locutions: ''That's no way to act, Sam.'' ''He clinked his glass to hers. 'Success to crime.' '' ''Sid says his client is getting up on his hind legs.'' In ''The Maltese Falcon,'' these were fresh and striking; in ''Spade & Archer,'' they stick out as if they were in italics. They call for applause on recognition, like the opening notes of a favorite song. 
 Anyone who undertakes to impersonate a beloved and highly mannered writer has such problems. When Robert Goldsborough channels Rex Stout, his Nero Wolfe naturally has to say ''pfui'' and ''satisfactory.'' And at least Gores doesn't attempt any radical innovations, as Mark Winegardner did in continuing the ''Godfather'' saga, when he made Fredo Corleone a closeted homosexual. Nevertheless, Gores is pushing it when he has Sam Spade allude to George Sand, and it's hard to believe that in 1925 Spade would be reading ''The Great Gatsby'' -- which had just been published -- or whistling Louis Armstrong's newly recorded ''Gut Bucket Blues.'' How does a working detective (who, as far as we know, doesn't own a radio or a phonograph) find time to keep up? 
 These details display Spade's character less than they do Gores's research, of which he's distractingly proud. No locale goes untriangulated (''Ralph Toomey's ornate corner office at Matson Shipping looked kitty-corner across the 200 block of Market to the old Hansford Building''), no meal goes unpriced (''Dinner was 45 cents''), no topical allusion goes unexplained. ''That sounds straight enough,'' Spade says at one point. ''The Chinese Exclusion Act bars all Chinese except teachers and students and diplomats and the clergy from entering the country from China.'' As this speech suggests, Gores hasn't mastered the art of smooth exposition. His characters are always being told things they already know. (''You were assigned to the Seventh Battalion of the Second Infantry Brigade,'' Spade's old boss announces to him, ''and saw action in the trenches of the Lens-Arras sector of France. You were wounded. You got a medal.'') And they often sound as if they're reading from a guidebook. (''The founding members were journalists and artists and musicians and writers,'' a member of the Bohemian Club tells Spade, ''who lamented the lack of culture in post-gold-rush San Francisco.'') Some of this ham-handedness just comes with the genre: Stout's Archie Goodwin, like Conan Doyle's Dr. Watson before him, reads newspaper reports aloud to get his boss,and the reader, up to speed on the crime in question. Some of it, though, is due to Gores's own clumsiness. Almost 80 pages after Spade delivers his speech about immigration restrictions, another character echoes it nearly word for word. 
 When Hammett, in the original ''Maltese Falcon,'' had to let us in on the long history of his bejeweled golden bird, he put it in the mouth of Casper Gutman, the ''fat man,'' and made the five-page dose of exposition go down as easily as possible by contriving a distinctive voice. ''Well, sir, what do you think of that? . . . These are facts, historical facts, not schoolbook history, not Mr. Wells's history, but history nevertheless.'' Such a voice and such a character -- whose ponderous bonhomie and autodidactic grandiloquence simultaneously mask and reveal his ultimate coldness -- are far out of reach for Gores. He's smart to keep his criminal mastermind offstage for 276 pages: this mysterious figure turns out to be ''a slender, slightly stooped whipcord man'' whose idea of a menacing line is ''We meet again, Spade.'' Hammett's fat man has no personal history to explain away his archetypal grandeur; Gores sedulously equips his archvillain with a back story, which diminishes him to a small-time grifter who's gotten above his raising: ''My old man was a tent-show minister in the Midwest. . . . The sanctimonious bastard.'' 
 Gores does manage to out-Hammett Hammett in one respect: his MacGuffin plot is even more elaborate, and even less memorable. ''Spade & Archer'' has three separate episodes, set in 1921, 1925 and 1928. We get a gold heist, a bank fraud, a scheme to blame union members for a series of thefts, and machinations involving money that once belonged to the Chinese political leader Sun Yat-sen. If your attention wanders as the characters sit around explaining the various twists and turns, you won't have missed much; but hang around long enough and you'll get to see the corpse of a woman who's been murdered and ''violated.'' Why does the killer, who, whatever his faults, never shows a sign of sexual pathology, also rape his victim? It can only be his sheer noir-ness. The bigger mystery is why the man behind all these malefactions seems so easily discouraged the first time he tries to kill Spade (seven or eight years seems like a long time to permit your nemesis to go around thwarting you), but if he'd gotten down to business, ''Spade & Archer'' wouldn't outbulk ''The Maltese Falcon'' by a hundred or so pages, and there'd be far fewer characters to describe and clothe. I have to admit, though, Gores got a nostalgic smile out of me twice. Once was when Sam Spade adopts the alias Nick Charles, the protagonist of Hammett's novel ''The Thin Man'' (a much better-written novel than ''The Maltese Falcon,'' by the way). The other was at the end, when Gores reprises -- well, I'd better not say, but I wasn't smiling just because the book was over at last.

HEADLINE: For Dodgers, Ramirez Is Still the Top Priority, but Not the Only Option

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
The names of Jose Guzman and Greg Hibbard are mostly lost to baseball history. In 1993, they combined to win 27 games for the fourth-place Chicago Cubs. Two years later, they were out of baseball for good.
 In that 1993 season, Guzman and Hibbard together earned about $5 million. Greg Maddux, whom the Cubs had allowed to leave as a free agent, earned $5.875 million for the Atlanta Braves. Maddux won the National League Cy Young Award that season -- and the next and the next -- and now has the most wins of any pitcher alive.
 Scott Boras was Maddux's agent. Ned Colletti was an official in the Cubs' baseball operations department -- though, as he said last week in a telephone interview, it was not his decision to let Maddux leave. 
 Boras and Colletti are locked in another showdown over Manny Ramirez, as the Los Angeles Dodgers face a decision similar to the Cubs' with Maddux.
 As the general manager of the Dodgers, Colletti traded for Ramirez last July and watched him hit .410 over 61 games, including eight in October. Yet Ramirez is still unsigned after rejecting the Dodgers' one-year, $25 million proposal last week. With spring training nearly upon them, the Dodgers' question is whether to raise their Ramirez offer or spread the money around to several free agents.
 With so many good players still looking for work -- including outfielders Bobby Abreu and Adam Dunn and second baseman Orlando Hudson -- Colletti has options. He signed starter Randy Wolf on Friday but said the Dodgers' priority was still to sign Ramirez.
 ''We're continuing to talk to the other players' agents to know what our other options are,'' Colletti said. ''At the same time, we need to be sure Manny doesn't want to play for the Dodgers and that we're not going to make a deal. When we know it's time to go, we'll go.''
 Boras's position is clear. He has long used the Maddux precedent as a reason teams should keep elite players instead of using the same money to fill multiple holes. And, he said, Ramirez is prepared to wait for the right offer. ''Talent doesn't have a wristwatch,'' Boras said.
 Boras is well known for protracted negotiations, but he has often secured lucrative deals with much greater ease. The Dodgers have been especially eager to sign his clients, no matter their ownership. Fox Group spent wildly for pitchers Kevin Brown and Darren Dreifort, and Frank McCourt has enriched outfielders J. D. Drew and Andruw Jones.
 None of those deals worked as the Dodgers hoped, but Ramirez has proved his value with his staggering production late last season. Even in his stormy final month in Boston, when he forced a trade from the team he led to two titles, Ramirez hit .347. He draws fans to the ballpark and captivates them on television.
 ''This is not someone you add to your payroll,'' Boras said. ''This is someone who pays for himself.''
 Ramirez is a free agent because he and Boras required the Dodgers to drop his two option years, at $20 million each, before accepting the trade from the Red Sox. There was reason to be confident that Ramirez could command more on the open market, even though he turns 37 in May.
 The Dodgers started negotiations with an offer of $45 million for two years, with a $15 million option for 2011. Boras ignored that proposal, but it remains the largest reported offer Ramirez has received. The Mets, the Yankees, the Los Angeles Angels and the Washington Nationals have insisted they are not interested in him.
 Besides the Dodgers, who continue to negotiate with Boras, only the San Francisco Giants are known to be involved.
 One major league official, who was granted anonymity so he could speak candidly about another team, said he was baffled that the Giants' new owner, William H. Neukom, had not pursued Ramirez more aggressively.
 ''Neukom wants to make a statement,'' the official said. ''They must have money because they were talking about C. C. Sabathia, and they know the effect of a great hitter from having Barry Bonds. Plus, they could hurt L.A. and win the West. You can't rule them out.''
 Boras has used competing bids effectively this winter, steering pitcher Derek Lowe to Atlanta for $60 million over four years and first baseman Mark Teixeira to the Yankees for $180 million over eight years. But there seems to be nothing to spur the Dodgers.
 ''All you can do is look at the other teams and see if their outfield is set,'' Colletti said. ''Or, if it's an American League team, are they looking for a D.H.? And you try to guess how deep they'd be willing to go.''
 Boras knows precisely what the Teixeira bidders offered in that negotiation, and he could be waiting for one of those teams to shift attention to Ramirez. But that has not happened yet, even from the Angels, who need a big bat and revel in tweaking the Dodgers.
 Angels Manager Mike Scioscia praised Ramirez in a December radio interview, but he is perceived as being a bad match with a combustible star. In his stormy exit from Boston, Ramirez had a physical altercation with the traveling secretary, complained of a knee injury the team disputed and took three strikes against Mariano Rivera in a sleepwalking role as a pinch-hitter.
 ''That's not Mike Scioscia's kind of guy,'' said one general manager, whose team is not interested in Ramirez. ''The biggest thing about Manny in Boston is they didn't know if he was going to play. Nothing is worse for a manager. The guy is the greatest right-handed hitter we've ever seen, but he's a time bomb. Why do it if they have alternatives?''
 That is the question the Dodgers are debating. At stake is the balance of power in the National League West, and the future home of a prodigious hitter.

HEADLINE: Master Craftsman Carries On an Old-Fashioned Art

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

DATELINE: TARPON SPRINGS, Fla. 

 BODY:
The family clad in Pittsburgh Steelers jerseys watched Nicholas Toth walk by. In his calloused hands, he held a diving helmet he had made from scratch, a 38-pound brass and copper tribute to his grandfather.
 In a place populated by the descendants of Greek immigrants, Mr. Toth, 54, carries on the tradition of a family and a town. He is a master maker of diver's helmets. And here, he is the only one left. 
 ''I'm probably the last person in the world who makes these helmets, one person, beginning to end,'' Mr. Toth said. ''I make them the old-fashioned way that has been handed down from generation to generation.'' 
 Greek divers arrived here in the 1890s, recruited by an entrepreneur intent on harvesting the sponge beds off the coast. Anthony Lerios arrived in 1913. He found dirt roads and mud streets, pigs and chickens running loose. He considered moving back to Greece.
 There he had built steam engines, but here he found his calling. An older man taught him to make helmets for sponge divers, and when that man died, Mr. Lerios took over. The helmets have not changed since the mid-1800s. They are built with brass, copper, leather and quarter-inch plate glass. Mr. Lerios's grandson, Mr. Toth, was born in 1955. He often followed his grandfather to the sponge exchange, where boat captains held auctions in the town courtyard.
 After graduating from the University of Florida with a degree in political science, Mr. Toth wanted to go to graduate school and then start a career in law or politics. Instead, he found himself drawn toward home. 
 Together, Mr. Toth and his grandfather built a booming business, played club soccer in the afternoon and grew as close as two people can. Ten years passed -- gone, just like that. Mr. Lerios died in 1992. He was almost 101. For five years, Mr. Toth could not look at helmets, much less make one. He took on jobs fixing boats or houses.
 Eventually, he returned to the shop and sat at the machines. ''As soon as I started doing it again, I felt him there,'' Mr. Toth said. ''Everything was flowing. I was an artist again.''
 Down by the docks, Mr. Toth pointed to restaurants named after Greek islands like Santorini and Mykonos, places that border the old exchange, which was converted into shops nearly 30 years ago. Some still carry sponge, wool sponge and yellow sponge and grass sponge from the nearby waters.
 Divers remain, but in smaller numbers. None of them use Mr. Toth's helmets. Mr. Toth still sells the occasional helmet, but mostly he makes his living doing odd jobs.
 As the population grew and artificial sponge elbowed its way into the market, the town changed from the sponge-diving capital of Florida to a tourist destination. Mr. Toth's grandfather's shop, which once attracted divers, has been battered by hurricanes and sits in disrepair. The only way to get in is to crawl under a garage door that does not fully open. Down the street, a once famous tapas restaurant called the Riverside Cafe sits empty.
 As the town changed, starting in the 1960s, it clung, like Mr. Toth, to its history. An old sponge-diving boat, built in 1935 from cypress and pine, dominates the square. 
 Mr. Toth said: ''There aren't too many places like this, in Florida or in the country. The historical value is tremendous. And that's the charm of it.''
 Mark Diclemente paints that history on local buildings. Residents call him Marcus Angelo. 
 For 14 years, Mr. Diclemente has watched the economy head south. Murals of sponge divers and sponge boats that he once painted for $20,000 now go for $8,000.
 ''Everyone's had to downsize,'' he said. ''Everyone's losing their jobs. But in this community, everyone's sticking together, keeping each other alive.''
 Mr. Toth believes he can accomplish that by continuing tradition, by building diving helmets the same way his grandfather did. 
 Building one remains tedious work that requires more than 200 hours spread over two to three months ''depending on the helmet gods.'' The helmets cost $10,000. Mr. Toth once made five in a single year, but as business declined, so has his production. He views this work as an art form, albeit a dying one. He hopes that it evokes an emotional response; he believes that this is what his grandfather would have wanted.
 In 2000, the Library of Congress inducted Mr. Toth and his grandfather into the American Folk Life Center. In 2003, he received the National Heritage Fellowship, the highest honor in the folk and traditional arts field. 
 ''The tradition here acts as the backbone, the spine of this place,'' Mr. Toth said. ''If you just opened a waterfront with tourist shops, which a lot of places in Florida do, there's no soul there. The diving tradition, the helmet making, the history that we have, that is the real soul of this city.''
 Dark, ominous clouds gathered overhead, as tourists scrambled into the Greek restaurants and shops. Mr. Toth grabbed the helmet from its resting spot on a nearby bench -- the first he made after his grandfather died, the one he will never sell. Two tourists stopped and pointed.
 ''What's that?'' one of them asked.
 ''A sponge-diving helmet,'' Mr. Toth said. ''I've been making these for a long time.''

HEADLINE: It's No Time For Protectionism

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He was an adviser to President Bush.

 BODY:
WHAT approach will the Obama administration and the Democratic majority in Congress take on international economic policy? It is too early to say for sure, but the signs so far are worrying.
 Just before his confirmation as Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner turned up the heat on the Chinese regarding the dollar-yuan exchange rate. President Obama, he said, ''believes that China is manipulating its currency. Countries like China cannot continue to get a free pass for undermining fair-trade principles.''
 Like many economists, I cringe whenever I hear the term ''fair trade.'' It is not that I am against fairness -- who is? -- but the word ''fair'' is so amorphous in this context as to defy definition. Most often, the slogan ''fair trade'' is little more than a rallying cry for protectionism. 
 Just days after Mr. Geithner pointed his finger at China, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, pointed his own finger right back. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr. Wen blamed the United States for the economic crisis the world is now experiencing. He talked in particular of ''the failure of financial supervision.''
 Most likely, Mr. Wen was aware that one of the important players in the United States supervisory system has been Mr. Geithner, who until recently was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In that role, Mr. Geithner was, for example, the primary federal regulator for Citigroup. Mr. Wen may have been suggesting -- quite rightly -- that the new Treasury secretary should focus his energy on fixing problems a bit closer to home.
 But timing aside, is Mr. Geithner right about the currency question? Are Americans hurt by China's exchange-rate policy?
 Critics of China say it is keeping the yuan undervalued to gain an advantage in the international marketplace. A cheaper yuan makes Chinese goods less expensive in the United States and American goods more expensive in China. As a result, American producers find it harder to compete with Chinese imports in the United States and to sell their own exports in China.
 There is, however, another side to the story. The loss to American producers comes with a gain to the many millions of American consumers who prefer to pay less for the goods they buy. 
 The situation is much the same as when the price of imported oil falls, as it has done in recent months. Domestic oil producers may see lower profits, but American consumers are better off every time they fill up their tanks. Consumers similarly gain when a cheap yuan reduces the prices of T-shirts and televisions imported from China.
 Mr. Geithner and other China critics might also want to ponder how the Chinese keep the yuan undervalued. The essence of the policy is supplying yuan and demanding dollars on foreign-exchange markets. The dollars that China accumulates in these transactions are then invested in United States Treasury securities. 
 So when the Treasury secretary complains about the undervalued yuan, his message to the Chinese boils down to this: Stop lending us money. 
 Not surprisingly, after Mr. Geithner made his remarks about the Chinese currency, the prices of Treasuries fell and yields rose. If China took him seriously, long-term interest rates would rise even more. As the United States embarks on a path of unusually large budget deficits, the nation's chief financial officer should pause and think carefully before turning up the heat on one of its biggest creditors. 
 Perhaps the oddest thing about Mr. Geithner's move is that his complaint seems out of date. The yuan-dollar exchange rate has moved considerably in recent years. After a long period of completely fixing the exchange rate, China allowed its currency to start moving in July 2005. Since then, it has appreciated by 21 percent. 
 Mr. Geithner might think that the yuan needs to move more, but why shine a bright light on the issue at this particular moment? Olivier Blanchard, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, had it right when he said: ''It is probably not the right time to focus on the Chinese exchange rate, given that it is not a central element of the world crisis. There are many other things we should be thinking about.'' 
 DIRECTING attention to the China currency issue amid a worldwide recession and growing fears of depression is more than a distraction. It is downright counterproductive. Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, have long proposed dealing with the yuan undervaluation by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. The Treasury secretary's comments risk stoking those protectionist embers.
 Indeed, protectionist influences seem to be finding their way into the stimulus bill winding its way through Congress. The bill passed by the House included a provision banning the use of foreign iron and steel in infrastructure projects. The Senate has adopted a somewhat more flexible restriction (after voting down an amendment by John McCain to strip the ''Buy American'' provision from the bill).
 Despite having hired many first-rate economists with impeccable free-trade credentials, the president has been only tepid in his public opposition to this creeping protectionism.
 This may be a good time to recall the legacy of Senator Reed Smoot of Utah and Representative Willis Hawley of Oregon, both Republicans. The 1930 tariff bill that bears their name did not cause the Great Depression, but it contributed to a plunge in world trade and undoubtedly was a step in the wrong direction.
 As we sort through the wreckage of our own financial crisis, a retreat into economic isolationism is one mistake we want to be sure not to repeat.

HEADLINE: Afghan Leader Finds Himself Hero No More

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS; Abdul Waheed Wafa contributed reporting from Kabul, and Peter Baker from Washington.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
A foretaste of what would be in store for President Hamid Karzai after the election of a new American administration came last February, when Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, sat down to a formal dinner at the palace during a visit here. 
 Between platters of lamb and rice, Mr. Biden and two other American senators questioned Mr. Karzai about corruption in his government, which, by many estimates, is among the worst in the world. Mr. Karzai assured Mr. Biden and the other senators that there was no corruption at all and that, in any case, it was not his fault. 
 The senators gaped in astonishment. After 45 minutes, Mr. Biden threw down his napkin and stood up. 
 ''This dinner is over,'' Mr. Biden announced, according to one of the people in the room at the time. And the three senators walked out, long before the appointed time. 
 Today, of course, Mr. Biden is the vice president. 
 The world has changed for Mr. Karzai, and for Afghanistan, too. A White House favorite -- a celebrity in flowing cape and dark gray fez -- in each of the seven years that he has led this country since the fall of the Taliban, Mr. Karzai now finds himself not so favored at all. Not by Washington, and not by his own. 
 In the White House, President Obama said he regarded Mr. Karzai as unreliable and ineffective. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said he presided over a ''narco-state.'' The Americans making Afghan policy, worried that the war is being lost, are vowing to bypass Mr. Karzai and deal directly with the governors in the countryside. 
 At home, Mr. Karzai faces a widening insurgency and a population that blames him for the manifest lack of economic progress and the corrupt officials that seem to stand at every doorway of his government. His face, which once adorned the walls of tea shops across the country, is today much less visible. 
 Now, perhaps crucially, an election looms. Mr. Karzai says he will ask the voters to return him to the palace for another five-year term. The election is set for Aug. 20, after what promises to be a violent and eventful summer. In a poll commissioned by a group of private Afghans, 85 percent of those surveyed said they intended to vote for someone other than Mr. Karzai. 
 Meanwhile, the Obama administration will have to decide what it wants from Mr. Karzai as it tries to make good on its promise to reverse the course of the war. Or whether it wants him at all. 
 With the insurgency rising, corruption soaring and opium blooming across the land, it perhaps is not surprising that so many Afghans, and so many in Washington, see President Karzai's removal as a precondition for reversing the country's downward surge. 
 ''Under President Karzai, we have gone from a better situation to a good situation to a not-so-bad situation to a bad situation -- and now are going to worse,'' said Abdullah, a former foreign minister in Mr. Karzai's government who may now challenge him for the presidency (and who, like many Afghans, has only one name). ''That is the trend. 
 ''So let us say Karzai stays in power through the summer and that nothing serious happens and then he wins re-election,'' Dr. Abdullah said. ''Then there will be two scenarios, and only two scenarios -- a rapid collapse or a slow unraveling.'' 
 People close to Mr. Karzai say the man is exhausted, wary of his enemies and worried for his physical safety. He feels embattled and underappreciated, they say, but is utterly determined, in spite of it all, to run again and win. In recent weeks, the growing American dissatisfaction with Mr. Karzai, coupled with a simmering frustration among Afghans over what they regard as the reckless killing of civilians by American forces, has prompted extraordinary reactions from Mr. Karzai. 
 At a news conference on Tuesday at his marble-floored palace, Mr. Karzai appeared side-by-side with Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general. Mr. Karzai wore his signature outfit of fez and cape, but his visage was wan and slack. Asked by an Afghan reporter about his relations with American leaders, Mr. Karzai sprang to life, accusing unnamed people in the American government of trying to ''pressure'' him to stay silent over the deaths of Afghan civilians in attacks by Americans. 
 ''Our demands are clear -- to stop the civilian casualties, the searching of Afghan homes and the arresting Afghans,'' Mr. Karzai said of the Americans. ''And of course, the Americans pressured us to be quiet and to make us retreat from our demands. But that is impossible. Afghanistan and its president are not going to retreat from their demands.'' 
 Mr. Karzai did not touch on larger frustrations, which Afghan and Western officials here say he harbors, about the overall American effort, namely, the relegation of Afghanistan to second-tier status after the invasion of Iraq. Many Afghans and Western officials here believe that it was the Iraq war, more than any other factor, that deprived Mr. Karzai of the resources he needed to help the Afghan state stand on its own, and to prevent the resurgence of the Taliban that Mr. Obama is now vowing to contain. 
 Yet for all the doubts about Mr. Karzai -- and for all the strains he labors under -- he remains by far the strongest politician in the country. He commands the resources of the Afghan state, including the army and the police, and billions of dollars in American and other aid that flows into the treasury. 
 In his seven years in office, Mr. Karzai has successfully presided over the transition of the Afghan state from the devastated, pre-modern institution it was under the Taliban to the deeply troubled but largely democratic one it is today. Perhaps most important for his future, Mr. Karzai has assembled a team of senior administrators whose competence and experience would be difficult for any challenger to match. 
 Perhaps for that reason, of the many prominent Afghans who have hinted that they may run against him, including Dr. Abdullah and a former finance minister, Ashraf Ghani, only a handful of Afghans have so far declared their intentions. Some Afghan leaders say they will announce their candidacies soon, but it seems just as likely that they are waiting to see if Mr. Karzai stumbles. 
 As for the members of Mr. Obama's team, they may yet discover that Mr. Karzai is the man they will be forced to deal with, whether they like him or not. 
 At the palace news conference, Mr. Karzai acknowledged his own unpopularity, and then offered a vigorous defense of his record. He declined to be interviewed for this article. 
 ''Well, I have been in government for seven years. It's natural that I would not be as popular now as I was seven years ago,'' Mr. Karzai said. 
 ''The institutions of Afghanistan have worked very well,'' he added. ''The Afghan people participated in the election for president. They participated in elections for Parliament. The parliamentary system has been functioning a lot better than some established parliaments in the world. They have been making laws, approving laws. The government institutions are increasingly in progress -- the economy, the national army, the growth of education. We went from almost two or three universities in 2002 to 17 universities, to the freedom of the press, hundreds of newspapers and radios and all that. I and the Afghan people are proud of our achievements.''
 And, he might also have said, six million Afghan children attending school, a quarter of whom are girls, whose education was prohibited by the Taliban.
 One of the people with the most generous words for Mr. Karzai is William Wood, the American ambassador. Under the ambassador's former boss, President Bush, Mr. Karzai enjoyed a favored personal status, even if his state did not. That special relationship was symbolized by the videoconferences in which the two men participated regularly. 
 ''The guy works very hard,'' Mr. Wood said of Mr. Karzai. ''He faces a problem set every day that would daunt anyone. He's got an insurgency based outside the country, and a level of poverty and criminality inside the country that feeds the insurgency. He's got an army that had to be built from zero following the ouster of the Taliban. He's got a police force that had to be reformed. 
 Speaking in an interview at his office in Kabul, Mr. Wood added: ''Yeah, I think he's tired. And I think frankly that everyone -- the international community, the United States, the United Nations, Western Europe, the international press -- were unrealistically optimistic about the problem of Afghanistan following the ouster of the Taliban.''
 Mr. Wood will soon be replaced by Lt. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry, a former commander of American forces here. 
 In his last tour, which ended in 2007, General Eikenberry enjoyed good relations with Mr. Karzai. Given Mr. Karzai's mood these days, that is probably a good thing. 
 At a ceremony last month for the first graduates of Afghanistan's National Military Academy, Mr. Karzai stood and addressed the assembled 84 cadets as well as a group of diplomats, including Mr. Wood. Mr. Karzai turned the occasion into a populist barnburner. 
 ''I told America and the world to give us aircraft -- otherwise we will get them from the other place!'' Mr. Karzai roared, prompting applause. ''I told them to give us the planes soon, that we have no more patience, and that we cannot get along without military aircraft! 
 ''Give us the aircraft sooner or we will get them from the others!'' Mr. Karzai roared again. ''We told them to bring us tanks, too -- otherwise we will get them from other place!''
 Mr. Karzai never said what the ''other place'' was.

HEADLINE: The Sky Is Falling for Carmakers, Again

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
NOW that President Obama has signed an executive order instructing the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider its refusal to allow California to enact tough tailpipe greenhouse-gas standards, the auto industry and groups close to it are publicly feeling the pain. 
 Speaking to NPR, Charles Territo of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said that the industry was concerned that the California regulations would ''create chaos, not only for consumers, but also for dealers and manufacturers.'' 
 David E. Cole of the independent Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., said that if they were put into place today, the standards ''would basically kill the industry.'' 
 History shows that the carmakers have been down this road many times. For many safety and environmental innovations over the last 40 years, the industry has predicted doomsday. ''They make Chicken Little look like a moderate,'' said Steve Hinchman, staff lawyer with the Conservation Law Foundation, a nonprofit based in Boston. 
 A federal judge, William Sessions III, in 2007 threw out the automakers' lawsuit opposing the California law, declaring in part: ''History suggests that the ingenuity of the industry, once put in gear, responds admirably to most technological challenges.''
 There are ample precedents for the judge's statement. In 1971, Lee A. Iacocca, the president of the Ford Motor Company at the time, was heard on President Nixon's secret taping system complaining about the planned introduction of shoulder belts and head restraints, calling them ''complete wastes of money.'' He added, ''We are on a downhill slide the likes of which we have never seen in our business.''
 Fighting to delay the onset of catalytic converters, Ford said in 1972 that too quick an introduction ''would shut down a major portion of the automotive industry and wreak havoc upon the American economy.'' 
 Earnest Starkman, a G.M. vice president, told Congress that year that if the industry had to install converters on 1975 models: ''An unreasonable risk of business catastrophe and massive difficulties with these vehicles in the hands of the public must be faced. It is conceivable that complete stoppage of the entire production could occur, with the obvious tremendous loss to the company, shareholders, employees, suppliers and communities.''

HEADLINE: Is It Time for a New Approach to Iran?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''The Other Tehran'' (column, Feb. 2), Roger Cohen provides an excellent discussion of how we should approach Iran in the Obama era. 
 As Mr. Cohen points out, Iran is a proud and ancient state that is at the same time modern and fundamentalist, democratic and Islamic. Iranians, whatever their ideology, want to be treated by the outside world with respect. Given this, most Iranians can live with the United States and want to live with the United States.
 I would add, though, that we should not be too quick to accept Mr. Cohen's advice to concentrate our diplomatic efforts on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ''because he decides.'' Formally, he should not be bypassed. But we should also remember that the Iranian political regime contains many factions. We should not ignore any of them, for we may find that opening other doors may be more rewarding as we attempt to rebuild what has been a very damaged relationship.
 Raymond D. Gastil Deep River, Conn., Feb. 2, 2009 
 To the Editor:
 Roger Cohen talks of Iran's ''past support to terrorist organizations'' without acknowledging the millions of dollars that it continues to provide to Hamas and Hezbollah. 
 By calling Iran a ''vibrant'' democracy where ''both words in its self-description -- Islamic Republic -- count,'' Mr. Cohen suggests that America and Iran share political values. Yet he later argues that America should engage first with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei because he holds the true power. Vesting power in a theocratic authority who does not answer to the public is certainly not the common definition of a democratic republic.
 Joshua Galun Arlington, Va., Feb. 2, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Stephen Rademaker (''Talk to Iran. Then What?,'' Op-Ed, Feb. 2) says that it is not enough for the Obama administration to talk to Iran. It must have something to say. We agree. 
 He is also correct that the American policy of zero enrichment has failed and will continue to fail, putting the United States and Iran on a collision course.
 We have proposed that Iran's enrichment program be transferred to multinational ownership and operation (see the Feb. 12, 2009, and March 20, 2008, issues of The New York Review of Books). 
 Mr. Rademaker does not offer a proposal, but asserts that ours will lead regional governments to want multilateral enrichment. Given the current credit crunch and economic costs, they are unlikely to do so. (Similar efforts failed in the past despite more favorable and urgent conditions.) 
 Successful negotiation must begin with a realistic proposal. Mr. Rademaker does not offer one. We do. 
 William Luers Thomas R. Pickering Jim Walsh New York, Feb. 4, 2009
 The writers are, respectively, president of the United Nations Association of the United States of America; a former under secretary of state for political affairs; and a research associate in the M.I.T. Security Studies Program.
 To the Editor:
 Roger Cohen offers a saner approach to Iran than does Stephen Rademaker, who exhorts the new administration to continue America's belligerent hostility to Tehran's nuclear program. 
 Mr. Rademaker, in arguing that the United States has a right to determine which nations can or cannot enrich uranium, would have us continue our failed Bush-era policies of bullying threats. 
 The Iranian government has good reason to fear United States aggression against its sovereignty and would be wise not only to maintain its nuclear program full tilt, but also to start building nuclear arms, since that is, in fact, the only way it can protect itself against constant American and Israeli threats. 
 If Israel can be permitted to have nuclear arms with full United States approval, why shouldn't Iran protect itself in the only way that is possible against two fiercely aggressive, nuclear-armed powers?
 Steve Kowit San Diego, Feb. 2, 2009
 To the Editor:
 President Obama should consider suggesting a nuclear-free Middle East. Iran might be willing to abandon any attempt to develop nuclear weapons if Israel, as part of a nuclear-free Middle East, destroyed its nuclear weapons and halted any nuclear weapons program. Israel is strong enough to defend itself without nuclear weapons. Besides, it has the backing of the United States.
 Harmon Groveneur Lewis New London, N.H., Feb. 3, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Roger Cohen is right: Iranians want to move forward. Since the 1970s, they have recognized the need for transition from the wasteful use of oil. Iran ordered five large nuclear power plants from the United States and was promised important fuel cycle technology that was later denied. Furious, Iran's leaders canceled the orders with the United States and placed them with France and Germany.
 The Islamic Revolution interrupted Iran's plans for nuclear power but not the recognition of its need. Lessons learned from earlier experiences and the planned size of the nuclear program support Iran's use of gas centrifuges to produce low-enriched uranium that is needed for nuclear power but cannot be used for weapons.
 More than a ton of low-enriched uranium would have to be withdrawn from fully safeguarded inventories for further enrichment to produce enough material for a weapon. That would be easily detected by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.
 There is no credible threat of nuclear weapons in Iran.
 Clinton Bastin Avondale Estates, Ga., Feb. 3, 2009
 The writer, a retired chemical engineer and nuclear scientist, worked at the Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Energy.
 To the Editor:
 In addition to Roger Cohen's pragmatic suggestions to approaching negotiations with Iran, the Obama administration should consider reaching out directly to the Iranian people. 
 An important first step should be a significant and targeted easing of the American visa policy toward Iranians. The State Department should announce a major initiative to issue large numbers of visas for academics, journalists, artists and athletes, as well as for visits by family members. 
 Such a policy could be directed to individuals unaffiliated with the Islamic government and institutions and could be coordinated with sponsorship from major American universities and research centers. 
 Such an indication of friendship and respect for the Iranian people, which should not wait for bilateral government-to-government negotiations, would go a long way to strengthen the generally pro-American attitudes of the Iranian public and create a strong constituency for improved relations. 
 Karim Pakravan Northbrook, Ill., Feb. 2, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Iran Launches Satellite as U.S. Takes Wary Note'' (front page, Feb. 4):
 News that the Iranians have launched a satellite could be the occasion for reconciliation between the United States and this great culture, which sees itself as the heir of ancient Persia. 
 We should use the moment to welcome the Iranians to the global community and to invite them to participate in talks about the future of the world.

HEADLINE: Bank Bailout, Redux

 BODY:
The Obama administration rightly concluded last week that unless bailed-out bankers were forced to take pay cuts, public support for a continuing bank rescue would never materialize. But the pay curbs are minor in the grand bailout scheme, which will ultimately put hundreds of billions of tax dollars, if not trillions, on the line.
 Clearly, the bailout has to start putting taxpayers first in vastly more significant ways than it has since President Bush started it last year. On Friday, the Congressional overseers of the bank bailout reported that in a few months last year, the government overpaid for banks' troubled assets by some $78 billion -- a redistribution, in effect, of taxpayer dollars to the banks and their shareholders. And for what? The system was rescued from collapse, but has since edged up to the abyss again. Whether the Obama administration has figured out a better way -- one that will protect taxpayers and clean up the mess as quickly as possible -- will be clearer on Monday, when it unveils its new and improved plan. 
 Putting taxpayers first means that in exchange for shoring up the banks, the government must receive ownership stakes that reflect the level of support it gives. For the neediest banks, that would likely work out to a majority interest; de facto, taxpayers would own the bank.
 In those cases, existing shareholders would be virtually wiped out and the government, as the owner, would assume responsibility for restructuring the bank. Contrary to stereotype, in countries that have successfully weathered serious bank crises, including the United States, such a takeover is preferable to leaving firms in the hands of those who have so badly mismanaged them. 
 Done properly, it fosters transparency and restores confidence by allowing for a prompt disclosure of expected losses and an attempt to assign realistic values to the assets that feed those losses. It does not mean putting a government careerist in charge or stacking the bank board with federal officials. Safeguards are needed to avoid political interference in lending and other banking decisions, and rules are needed to determine when and how the government should end its ownership. 
 Early word on the administration's bailout plan is that it rejects taking control of deeply troubled, too-big-to-fail banks. But the alternatives may be even less appealing. 
 The government is likely, for example, to guarantee banks' assets. But unless a significant equity stake for taxpayers was the quid pro quo, the arrangement would in effect shift most of the risk of the banks' bad bets onto taxpayers. Think that couldn't happen? It already has. Last November, when Citigroup was at death's door, the government agreed to cover losses on up to $306 billion worth of the banks' troubled assets if those assets fell by more than 10 percent. If the assets perform better than expected, there is a modest upside for taxpayers; if they perform worse, the wipeout could far exceed whatever gain taxpayers could ever have hoped to realize. 
 And such guarantees were presented as generally low cost and low risk. Which they are, until they aren't. 
 Which brings us back to the huge sums it will eventually take to repair the banking system. The United States will need to do enormous borrowing for economic stimulus and the bank bailout. The danger is that sooner or later, lenders will demand higher rates, perhaps sharply higher, to continue making loans. The best way to try to retain lenders' confidence is to get a firm grip on the system's losses so that officials can make frank and credible upfront estimates of the bailout's expected total cost. Serial bailouts with rising price tags are to be avoided at all costs. 
 When the bailout plan is announced on Monday, look for evidence that policy makers understand that saving the banking system does not mean saving all of its bankers and shareholders. 
 Warding off a catastrophic failure means protecting depositors and those who provide the short-term debt that is crucial for day-to-day operations and is a mainstay of money market accounts and funds. It may also mean protecting banks' bondholders. And it should do so while getting a fair deal for taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Slumdogs Unite!

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
SOMEDAY historians may look back at Tom Daschle's flameout as a minor one-car (and chauffeur) accident. But that will depend on whether or not it's followed by a multi-vehicle pileup that still could come. Even as President Obama refreshingly took responsibility for having ''screwed up,'' it's not clear that he fully understands the huge forces that hit his young administration last week.
 The tsunami of populist rage coursing through America is bigger than Daschle's overdue tax bill, bigger than John Thain's trash can, bigger than any bailed-out C.E.O.'s bonus. It's even bigger than the Obama phenomenon itself. It could maim the president's best-laid plans and what remains of our economy if he doesn't get in front of the mounting public anger. 
 Like nearly everyone else in Washington, Obama was blindsided by the savagery and speed of Daschle's demise. Conventional wisdom had him surviving the storm. Such is the city's culture that not a single Republican or Democratic senator called for his withdrawal until the morning of his exit. Membership in the exclusive Senate club, after all, has its privileges. Among Daschle's more vocal defenders was Bob Dole, who had recruited him to Alston & Bird, the law and lobbying firm where Dole has served as ''special counsel'' when not otherwise cashing in on his own Senate years by serving as a pitchman for Pepsi and Viagra. 
 In New York, editorial pages on both ends of the political spectrum, The Wall Street Journal and The Times, called for Daschle to step down. But not The Washington Post. In a frank expression of the capital's isolation from the country, it thought Daschle could still soldier on even though ''ordinary Americans who pay their taxes may well wonder why Mr. Obama can't find cabinet secretaries who do the same.''
 As Jon Stewart might say, oh those pesky ordinary Americans!
 In reality, Daschle's tax shortfall, an apparently honest mistake, was only a red flag for the larger syndrome that much of Washington still doesn't get. It was the source, not the amount, of his unreported income that did him in. The car and driver advertised his post-Senate immersion in the greedy bipartisan culture of entitlement and crony capitalism that both helped create our economic meltdown (on Wall Street) and failed to police it (in Washington). Daschle might well have been the best choice to lead health-care reform. But his honorable public record was instantly vaporized by tales of his cozy, lucrative relationships with the very companies he'd have to adjudicate as health czar.
 Few articulate this ethical morass better than Obama, who has repeatedly vowed to ''close the revolving door'' between business and government and end our ''two sets of standards, one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks.'' But his tough new restrictions on lobbyists (already compromisedby inexplicableexceptions) and porous plan for salary caps on bailed-out bankers are only a down payment on this promise, even if they are strictly enforced. 
 The new president who vowed to change Washington's culture will have to fight much harder to keep from being co-opted by it instead. There are simply too many major players in the Obama team who are either alumni of the financial bubble's insiders' club or of the somnambulant governmental establishment that presided over the catastrophe. 
 This includes Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary. Washington hands repeatedly observe how ''lucky'' Geithner was to be the first cabinet nominee with an I.R.S. problem, not the second, and therefore get confirmed by Congress while the getting was good. Whether or not this is ''lucky'' for him, it is hardly lucky for Obama. Geithner should have left ahead of Daschle.
 Now more than ever, the president must inspire confidence and stave off panic. As Friday's new unemployment figures showed, the economy kept plummeting while Congress postured. Though Obama is a genius at building public support, he is not Jesus and he can't do it all alone. On Monday, it's Geithner who will unveil the thorniest piece of the economic recovery plan to date -- phase two of a bank rescue. The public face of this inevitably controversial package is now best known as the guy who escaped the tax reckoning that brought Daschle down. 
 Even before the revelation of his tax delinquency, the new Treasury secretary was a dubious choice to make this pitch. Geithner was present at the creation of the first, ineffectual and opaque bank bailout -- TARP, today the most radioactive acronym in American politics. Now the double standard that allowed him to wriggle out of his tax mess is a metaphor for the double standard of the policy he must sell: Most ''ordinary Americans'' still don't understand why banks got billions while nothing was done (and still isn't being done) to bail out those who lost their homes, jobs and retirement savings.
 As with Daschle, the political problems caused by Geithner's tax infraction are secondary to the larger questions raised by his past interaction with the corporations now under his purview. To his credit, Geithner, like Obama, has devoted his career to public service, not buckraking. But he still has not satisfactorily explained why, as president of the New York Fed, he failed in his oversight of the teetering Wall Street institutions. Nor has he told us why, in his first major move in his new job, he secured a waiver from Obama to hire a Goldman Sachs lobbyist as his chief of staff. Nor, in his confirmation hearings, did he prove any more credible than the Bush Treasury secretary, the Goldman Sachs alumnus Hank Paulson, in explaining why Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail while A.I.G. and Citigroup were spared. 
 Citigroup had one highly visible asset that Lehman did not: Robert Rubin, the former Clinton Treasury secretary who sat passively (though lucratively) in its executive suite as Citi gorged on reckless risk. Geithner, as a Rubin protege from the Clinton years, might have recused himself from rescuing Citi, which so far has devoured $45 billion in bailout money. 
 Key players in the Obama economic team beyond Geithner are also tied to Rubin or Citigroup or both, from Larry Summers, the administration's top economic adviser, to Gary Gensler, the newly named nominee to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a Treasury undersecretary in the Clinton administration. Back then, Summers and Gensler joined hands with Phil Gramm to ward off regulation of the derivative markets that have since brought the banking system to ruin. We must take it on faith that they have subsequently had judgment transplants.
 Obama's brilliant appointees, we keep being told, are irreplaceable. But as de Gaulle said, ''The cemeteries of the world are full of indispensable men.'' You have to wonder if this team is really a meritocracy or merely a stacked deck. Not only did Rubin himself serve on the Obama economic transition team, but two of the transition's headhunters were Michael Froman, Rubin's chief of staff at Treasury and later a Citigroup executive, and James S. Rubin, an investor who is Robert Rubin's son. 
 A welcome outlier to this club is Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman chosen to direct Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. But Bloomberg reported last week that Summers is already freezing Volcker out of many of his deliberations on economic policy. This sounds like the arrogant Summers who was fired as president of Harvard, not the chastened new Summers advertised at the time of his appointment. A team of rivals is not his thing.
 Americans have had enough of such arrogance, whether in the public or private sectors, whether Democrat or Republican. Voters turned on Sarah Palin not just because of her manifest unfitness for office but because her claims of being a regular hockey mom were contradicted by her Evita shopping sprees. John McCain's sanctification of Joe the Plumber (himself a tax delinquent) never could be squared with his inability to remember how many houses he owned. A graphic act of entitlement also stripped naked that faux populist John Edwards.
 The public's revulsion isn't mindless class hatred. As Obama said on Wednesday of his fellow citizens: ''We don't disparage wealth. We don't begrudge anybody for achieving success.'' But we do know that the system has been fixed for too long. The gaping income inequality of the past decade -- the top 1 percent of America's earners received more than 20 percent of the total national income -- has not been seen since the run-up to the Great Depression. 
 This is why ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' which pits a hard-working young man in Mumbai against a corrupt nexus of money and privilege, has become America's movie of the year. As Robert Reich, the former Clinton labor secretary, wrote after Daschle's fall, Americans ''resent people who appear to be living high off a system dominated by insiders with the right connections.''
 The neo-Hoover Republicans in Congress, who think government can put Americans back to work with corporate tax cuts but without any ''spending,'' are tone deaf to this rage. Obama is not. It's a good thing he's getting out of Washington this week to barnstorm the country about the crisis at hand. Once back home, he's got to make certain that the insiders in his own White House know who's the boss.

HEADLINE: California Work Program For Young Is Threatened

BYLINE: By MALIA WOLLAN

DATELINE: MOUNT TAMALPAIS STATE PARK, Calif. 

 BODY:
An hour before sunrise, Jason Prue, a shaggy-haired member of a California Conservation Corps work crew, stood scrubbing a breakfast dish in the rain, shaking off a night of sleeping in a wet tent and loving every minute of it. 
 ''I like working in the rain,'' Mr. Prue, 21, said on Thursday. ''It's beautiful. And it's a free shower.'' 
 But Mr. Prue, who joined the corps after living in his car for a stint, and hundreds like him could soon be jobless. A budget crisis has put the California Conservation Corps, the country's largest and oldest work program for mostly hard-luck teenagers and young adults, on the chopping block. 
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to eliminate the program as the state struggles with a $42 billion budget deficit. Under the governor's proposed budget, the state would take back the $34 million in general funds it spends on the corps each year, though some money would be funneled into work corps programs run by local governments and nonprofit groups.
 ''The expense of the program did not justify keeping them,'' said Sandy Cooney, a spokesman for the state's Natural Resources Agency, which oversees the corps. ''This is about making hard decisions.''
 That the governor might gut the corps even as President Obama's new administration evokes themes of public works, national service and overcoming odds galls some youth advocates, who say the program serves as a model for the type of ''green collar'' jobs promised by the Congressional stimulus package. 
 ''To cut off the opportunity for disadvantaged kids to get their feet on the first rung of the ladder to future green careers is criminal,'' said Van Jones, author of the best-selling ''Green Collar Economy'' and founding president of the Oakland-based nonprofit agency Green for All.
 Mr. Jones said the California program was the prototype for at least 13 similar corps in other states and an inspiration for conservation work programs being considered by the Obama administration. 
 ''How can you be a green governor and be taking the tools to green the state out of the hands of young people?'' Mr. Jones said. 
 California's program is modeled on the Civilian Conservation Corps, which put three million young, unemployed men to work from 1933 to 1942. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ''tree army'' or ''soil soldiers'' planted more than two billion trees, restored eroding soil in the Dust Bowl states, developed 800 new state parks, erected one million miles of fences, and built bridges, roads and 13,000 miles of hiking trails in places like Yosemite and Grand Canyon National Parks. 
 ''This was without a doubt the most popular New Deal program; it radically transformed the landscape of this country,'' said Neil Maher, an associate professor of history at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University and author of ''Nature's New Deal: The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Roots of the American Environmental Movement.''
 Each year the California corps -- whose motto is ''Hard work, low pay, miserable conditions ... and more!'' -- employs more than 1,300 young people between the ages of 18 and 25 for a year of hard labor in far-flung corners of the state. They restore salmon habitat in the redwoods, clear brush from highways and build trails in state parks. Most are unemployed young men hailing from poor urban neighborhoods, and nearly half have not graduated from high school. 
 Though he has a high school diploma, Mr. Prue said he was living as a drifter in an old Dodge Intrepid with a dog named Buddy before joining. ''I decided I needed to do something, to find a job I loved,'' he said, standing on a muddy slope, surrounded by the pinging sound of pickaxes hitting rock. ''This is it.''
 Plans to terminate the program have united an eclectic group of advocates, including those who benefit from the corps' work, like off-road-vehicle enthusiasts, hikers, firefighters and sport fishermen. They are writing to the governor to urge that the program not be eliminated. 
 Last week, four former governors signed a letter urging the same, including Attorney General Jerry Brown. Mr. Brown founded the corps program as governor in 1976 because, he said, ''kids need to get out of the concrete of the urban world and encounter the complexities of nature.''
 While legislators continued to wrangle over what to cut and where to tax, a corps crew under a canopy of oak and fir trees on Mount Tamalpais hauled rock, rolled wheelbarrows brimming with dirt and hacked at stumps, carving a wheelchair-accessible trail in the mountainside.
 ''I'm not that good a planner,'' Mr. Prue said, his face smudged with dirt. ''If this goes down, I don't know what I'm going to do.''

PERSON: Jerry Bruckheimer 

HEADLINE: A Man of Action Walks In Someone Else's Heels

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif. 

 BODY:
 JERRY BRUCKHEIMER was standing quietly in his office here in late January, flanked by a display of body armor from ''King Arthur'' and a liquor cart stocked with an alarming amount of Scotch. After some chitchat about his plans to attend the Super Bowl and a sore shoulder (the one he injured playing hockey), he sat down for a serious talk about ... shopping.
 Mr. Bruckheimer's next film, the romantic comedy ''Confessions of a Shopaholic,'' finally arrives in theaters on Friday after eight years of development. Based on two of Sophie Kinsella's five ''Shopaholic'' novels, it focuses on an aspiring journalist who shops and shops (and shops some more), racking up extreme credit-card debt. Isla Fisher (''Wedding Crashers'') co-stars with a mountain of Manolos and Hugh Dancy (''Ella Enchanted'').
 The movie, directed by P. J. Hogan, has a lot of people collectively wincing. A film that celebrates shopping as sport? At a time when nationwide unemployment is nearing double digits and the retail sector has fallen off a cliff? Paging Marie Antoinette. 
 Mr. Bruckheimer, best known for special-effects-laden extravaganzas like the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' and ''National Treasure'' movies, conceded a few pre-release jitters -- ''I always worry that my films won't do business,'' he said -- but he insisted that awkward timing was not remotely a concern. He explained his reasons to Brooks Barnes, as well as offering some thoughts about the inherent humor in high heels and why this film is not that big a departure for him. These are excerpts from their conversation.
 Q. The economy is circling the drain. Isn't this movie a little out of place?
 A. The title is perhaps a little misleading in terms of what the story is really about. It's about her coming to terms with her problems. She loses everything and has to figure out how to get it back, which is a narrative that a lot of people can identify with these days. Here's a girl at a dead-end job, she has all of this credit-card debt. She gets a better job, erases her debt and falls in love. It's an uplifting story, but you have to see the movie to know all of that.
 Q. So you seriously don't think the economic crisis will hurt the film's box-office chances?
 A. We did a movie a long time ago called ''Top Gun.'' Two months before the release some planes were shot down over Iran, and it was all over the front page. We all said: ''Oh no, this is the end of that movie. What terrible timing.'' As it turned out, people didn't care at all. They responded to a good story, and the movie was a success. I think the same thing will happen here.
 Q. I was surprised that the central character doesn't cast off her materialistic ways. The message seemed to be that it's O.K. to get in a catfight over a pair of Prada boots as long as you have the money to pay for them.
 A. She does come to terms with her shopping. She solves her problem, which is unbelievable credit-card debt and living beyond her means. By the end she's a recovering shopaholic. When this whole financial crisis hit, the movie was pretty much finished. So we couldn't change much of anything even if we wanted to. But I think it worked out to our benefit because of how she has a wake-up call at the end.
 Q. There were reshoots. Did you go in and push up the volume of her wake-up call?
 A. Every movie that we do has reshoots. In fact we budget about a million dollars for reshoots in every one of our films. It's really rare not to have them, and in this case it was all routine. There was no changing of the story. 
 Q. There's a scene toward the end where John Goodman, who plays the frugal father, says, ''Your mother and I think that if the American economy can be billions in debt and still survive, so can you.''
 A. That was always there.
 Q. Oh, come on -- seriously?
 A. It was. I will show you the script if you don't believe me. The only thing we picked up was a coda at the very end as the credits go up. The audience wanted closure on her. They wanted to know what happened to her. Did she get a job? Did she end up with Luke? Did she truly conquer her spending habits? We decided to add some posters during the credits to make all that clear.
 Q. Isn't this movie a little girly for you?
 A. People forget that 25 years ago I made a little movie called ''Flashdance,'' which was certainly a chick flick in a lot of ways. More recently we made a movie called ''Coyote Ugly,'' which was about a girl's journey. So every once in a while we will hit that button. I just look for really good movies that I want to go see.
 Q. What appealed to you in this case?
 A. I just loved the idea of the character and her journey. We wanted that kind of fun, zany character who does outrageous things, but you still love her. She's smart, she's funny, she can't control herself. Her internal monologue is hysterical.
 And Isla is such a movie star. She's Lucille Ball. She's got physical comedy. She's smart. When Isla met with Patricia Field, the costume goddess who worked with us on the movie, the only thing she asked was for the highest heels possible.
 Q. Why?
 A. Because it's awkward and funny. She wanted to be wobbly. Isla actually went to clown school in Paris when she was young. I think it turned out great.
 Q. You've got so much on your plate -- ''G-Force,'' ''Prince of Persia,'' ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' the ''Lone Ranger'' remake, ''Pirates of the Caribbean 4.'' And that's just the movie side of your company. [His television productions include all the ''CSI'' shows and ''Without a Trace.''] To what degree are you actually involved with a movie like ''Confessions of a Shopaholic''?
 A. I'm extremely involved on every movie. I'm on set every day if it's here in town. If it is out of town, I'm there about every 10 days. I was working on ''Shopaholic'' right down to the wire, trying to improve this or that. On the television side, I'm involved in the pilot, the casting of the principal characters, and we are heavily involved during the entire first season. But after that I can back off a little. I still read every script and watch every episode of everything we do, though.
 Q. Are studios looking for something different these days because of the economy? 
 A. They're gravitating toward more comedies and things that make people feel good. Don't tell the critics, but the No. 1 movie for the last two weeks has been an easy comedy called ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop.'' Most people don't go to the movies to see dark and depressing, especially now. Which bodes well for ''Shopaholic,'' don't you think?

HEADLINE: My Children Made Me Do It

BYLINE: By STEPHEN AMIDON. 
Stephen Amidon is the author, most recently, of the novel ''Security.''

DATELINE: Greenfield, Mass. 

 BODY:
 MY father didn't leave me much when he died. 
 Although he was at one time a fast-rising executive in a multinational company, a combination of corporate skullduggery and his own personal demons meant he had little in the bank when he died in 2001, a few days before his 70th birthday.
 There was nothing for his four children except a small array of personal items, including a particularly sturdy hairbrush I was astute enough to claim. I still own it, in fact, and use it daily to tame my rapidly thinning hair, which is probably coming unglued due to worry about what sort of inheritance I will be able to provide my own four children. 
 I got to thinking about that brush when I read that a colleague of Tom Daschle had said that his tax woes -- not to mention the lucrative private-sector temptations he gave into -- may have stemmed from his desire to make enough money to lay a fat nest egg for his children. 
 It is hard to see how riding in a free limo benefits future generations, but even if I give Mr. Daschle the benefit of the doubt, I cannot help but note the paradox here. A man's desire to provide his progeny with a big score has resulted in him saddling them with a very different sort of inheritance -- a legacy of embarrassment. 
 Instead of being remembered as the savior of the nation's health care system or even as just a middling health secretary, their father will now forever be known as the guy who hitched a ride with some private-equity hot rodders and then neglected to chip in for the gas. Most sons and daughters I know would gladly forgo a portion of their birthright in order to be invited to pool parties at the Obama White House and not to have a dad serving as fodder for late-night television wisecracks.
 Inheritances can be tricky things. Even those given with the best of intentions can often go awry. Just ask King Lear. He simply wanted to turn Britain over to his daughters so he could enjoy the medieval equivalent of retirement in Boca Raton, but wound up starting a bloody civil war that brought ruin on his family. 
 On the other end of the ancestral give-and-take, there's Richard Carstone, who appears in Dickens's ''Bleak House.'' Richard was a nice enough boy who caused his own destruction by obsessively pursuing a share of a disputed legacy. 
 At the bottom of the barrel, there's Bernard Madoff, who is reported to have planned to dispense a desk full of booty to his relatives to keep the family fortune one step ahead of the law. Sure, everybody wants to get a surprise bequest from their Uncle Bernie, but probably not if it comes with a co-conspirator rap attached.
 Granted, it's hard to spend much time worrying about setting something aside after a month in which the economy shed nearly 600,000 jobs. Most parents these days are too wrapped up in staying afloat to be able to capitalize their children's futures. 
 Still, those moments when I contemplate how little I've socked away for my offspring cause me no small amount of anxiety. In fact, the one thing that is sure to get me thinking I should do something I really do not want to do -- or perhaps even something I should not do -- is the desire to endow my brood. All manner of behavior that would otherwise be considered contemptible seems to be justified in the name of inheritance. Saving for your loved ones, not patriotism, is apparently the last refuge of a scoundrel.
 One way I manage this anxiety is to ponder those friends and colleagues who have been well provided for, and to wonder if I really want to leave that sort of feathered nest for my children. Because there is often something not quite right about these fortunate sons of the baby boom. 
 I am not talking about trust-fund brats who get arrested for throwing hissy fits on Sunset Boulevard. I'm speaking of those perfectly well-mannered folks whose parents left them enough to ensure they never have to lie awake at night worrying about college tuition or second mortgages. 
 The young family who can afford the brownstone without ever enduring cramped life in an apartment, the couple who are able to jet away on holiday while the rest of us sit in traffic on the way to the local beach, the household whose teenage children are never asked to help out -- there is something missing here, the sense of accomplishment derived from patient effort. It is hard not to think that their parents have done them as much harm as good by installing an express escalator on the uphill sections of their lives.
 Perhaps this skepticism is just my way of rationalizing an inability to provide my own children with an anxiety-free future. No one wants to struggle and worry; a little help is always appreciated. And in the end, it is up to each of us to figure out how much is enough to leave behind, and how much is too much.
 For me, the answer lies with my father, who wound up dragging his weary bones around the country in a series of lousy jobs at a time in life when many of the men who had once worked under him were perfecting their golf swings. 
 One of the main reasons he continued to work so hard, I believe, is that he was mortified at the thought of being a burden to his grown children. Leaving behind an inheritance of debt would have been a disgrace, his own version of not paying taxes on a freebie. 
 He was, for all his faults, an honorable man. It was a quality that sometimes held him back, especially during the 1980s, when many of his colleagues were eviscerating their corporation to create the private fortunes that they would one day leave to their own children. My father refused all that because he was more concerned with maintaining his good name. 
 That sense of decency, his good name, is what he passed on to us. Looking at some of the shamelessly greedy men he worked with, it is an inheritance I am happy to have.
 Though I'm also glad I got the brush.

HEADLINE: COMPETING BILLS ON THE STIMULUS DIVIDE CONGRESS

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate agreement on a roughly $827 billion economic stimulus bill sets up tough negotiations with the House, primarily over tens of billions of dollars in aid to states and local governments, tax provisions, and education, health and renewable energy programs.
 Congress is racing to try to finalize the legislation this week.
 The price tag for the Senate plan is now only slightly more than the $820 billion cost of the measure adopted by the House. Both plans are intended to blunt the recession with a combination of tax cuts and government spending on public works and other programs to create more than three million jobs. 
 But the competing bills now reflect substantially different approaches. The House puts greater emphasis on helping states and localities avoid wide-scale cuts in services and layoffs of public employees. The Senate cut $40 billion of that aid from its bill, which is expected to be approved Tuesday. 
 The Senate plan, reached in an agreement late Friday between Democrats and three moderate Republicans, focuses somewhat more heavily on tax cuts, provides far less generous health care subsidies for the unemployed and lowers a proposed increase in food stamps. 
 To help allay Republican concerns about the cost, the Senate proposal even scales back President Obama's signature middle-class tax cut. The Senate plan also creates new tax incentives to encourage Americans to buy homes and cars within the next year. 
 Republican opponents continued to rail against the stimulus plan on the Senate floor on Saturday, though it appeared they would not have the votes to stop it. 
 The negotiations in Congress will test whether Democrats, who say they won a mandate in November to pursue their goals, are willing to give up some favored long-term policy initiatives to win over more Republican votes. 
 The talks will also test whether any but the most moderate Republicans will be willing to support the Obama administration, or whether they will simply recoil in an opposition stance. 
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was in Williamsburg, Va., on a retreat with her fellow House Democrats on Friday, called the emerging Senate cuts to the stimulus program ''very damaging'' and said she was ''very much opposed to them.'' But after the Senate reached a deal, Ms. Pelosi expressed resolve to complete the legislation in the days ahead. 
 Mr. Obama, who has made the economic recovery effort the centerpiece of his agenda, is expected to take a stronger hand in the negotiations and will embark on an aggressive public lobbying campaign. 
 He will hold a meeting in Indiana on Monday, followed by a formal White House news conference, the first of his term, in prime time on Monday night. He will pitch the plan again on Tuesday in Florida and on Wednesday in Virginia. 
 In his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday, the president praised the Senate deal and urged quick passage of a final bill. 
 ''The time for action is now,'' Mr. Obama said. ''If we don't move swiftly to put this plan in motion, our economic crisis could become a national catastrophe.'' 
 Also on Monday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is expected to announce the broad outlines of a rescue plan for the financial industry. The administration hopes that the announcement will quiet some critics in Congress who say not enough is being done for the housing sector. 
 After Senate Democrats reached their deal with moderate Republicans on Friday, Republicans who are more conservative refused to put the legislative process on a fast track. 
 Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, insisted that the deal required careful deliberation and said he would spend the weekend reviewing it, even though it was all but certain that he would not support the measure. 
 As a result, the Senate met for a rare Saturday session, and Republicans delivered some of their harshest criticism of Mr. Obama since he took office, suggesting that he was pressing Congress to act irresponsibly by warning of imminent catastrophe. 
 ''In discussing with the American people his approach to the stimulus of our economy, he has first really used some dangerous words,'' said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican. Mr. Kyl added, ''It seems to me that the president is rather casually throwing out some careless language.'' 
 The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said Congress would move quickly to get the bill into conference, in hopes of sending the bill to the White House by the week's end. 
 As it stands, three Republicans are expected to join the 58 Democrats in favor of the bill, and the negotiations may tilt slightly in the Senate's favor as officials try to keep that coalition in place.
 Both the House and the Senate must vote again to approve the final legislation, leaving a chance of unexpected pitfalls. 
 The main fight is likely to be over the Senate's proposal to cut $40 billion from proposed aid to states. Such aid does not necessarily lift the economy, but it prevents states from carrying out cuts that could make the recession worse, and the money can be deployed quickly, a challenge in any stimulus. 
 The $40 billion was the largest cut in a paring back of the Senate proposal that helped seal a deal between Democrats and the moderate Republicans, thanks to the efforts of a bipartisan group led by Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska. 
 Another big difference is the Senate's inclusion of nearly $70 billion to protect thousands of middle-class Americans from paying the alternative minimum tax in 2009, sparing them from a system originally intended to prevent the wealthy from claiming too many tax deductions. 
 House Democratic leaders have indicated a willingness to retain that provision even though it could require them to give up tens of billions of dollars in favored spending programs and force them to make wrenching choices. 
 Adjusting the alternative minimum tax is also unlikely to give much extra lift to the economy, because Congress has adopted similar fixes for years and would probably have done so again regardless of the stimulus. 
 Other trims the Senate settled on eliminated $19.5 billion in construction aid for schools and colleges and sliced proposed new aid for the Head Start early childhood program by $1 billion. 
 In some cases, the cuts to the Senate bill brought it closer to the House proposal. For instance, the senators reduced financing to expand broadband data networks in rural and underserved areas to $7 billion from $9 billion. The House has proposed $6 billion. 
 Some of the Senate's changes clearly reflected the personal priorities of lawmakers, especially the moderate Republicans who were instrumental in reaching an accord. 
 The Senate deal, for example, reduced proposed aid to NASA and the National Science Foundation by $200 million each. 
 But it added $6.5 billion for medical research at the National Institutes of Health, favored by Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, one of the three Republicans supporting the plan
 Even with Democrats controlling both chambers, the negotiations are likely to be difficult. House Democrats have shown little inclination to cater to Republican wishes, especially given the unwillingness of Republicans to vote for the bill. 
 So far, Mr. Obama and his aides have strongly resisted any change to his proposal for a middle-class tax cut, which was one of his main campaign promises. 
 It would provide a tax credit of up to $500 for individuals and up to $1,000 for couples, with the credit phasing out for individuals earning more than $75,000 a year and couples more than $150,000. 
 The Senate bill would lower that income cap to $70,000 for individuals and $140,000 for couples, saving the government $2 billion but potentially reducing the effectiveness of a tax break that is intended to lift consumer spending. 
 It is unclear how Congress will deal with two provisions aimed directly at general consumers, including an $11 billion tax break in the Senate bill to spur car sales by allowing buyers to deduct any sales tax and one year of loan interest. 
 The chambers must reconcile competing homebuyer tax credits. 
 To stabilize real estate prices, the House would give first-time homebuyers a tax credit of 10 percent of a home's cost, up to $7,500, with income caps reducing the credit for individuals earning at least $75,000 and couples earning $150,000. 
 The Senate plan includes a more generous credit of 10 percent, up to $15,000, that would be available to all homebuyers, with no income limits. 
 A formal conference to resolve the differences between the two bills is expected to begin by midweek. 
 In the Senate debate, critics of the plan said their main objective was to support proposals that would quickly create jobs or spur consumer spending. 
 But there were Republicans who vehemently opposed some spending programs in the bill, saying the federal government was overstepping its bounds and should not be getting involved in taking up local responsibilities like school construction. 
 Many of the education programs in the bill are top priorities of the powerful chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin. 
 In debate on the Senate floor, many Republicans, including the party's defeated presidential nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, offered amendments to reduce spending and broaden the tax cuts in the plan. The Democrats easily swatted those down. 
 Critics of the stimulus plan say Democrats have packed it not with the most effective short-term proposals to lift the economy, but with favored, liberal spending programs that will drastically increase the national debt and cause long-term fiscal harm. 
 ''A bill that was meant to be timely, targeted and temporary has instead become a Trojan horse for pet projects and expanded government,'' the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, said in a floor speech on Friday. 
 Although Mr. Obama made substantial efforts to reach across party lines, not one of the House Republicans voted for the stimulus measure. They complained that House Democrats shut them out of the process. 
 In the Senate, too, talks proved excruciatingly difficult. In the end, the only Republicans whose support the Democrats won were Mr. Specter, Ms. Collins and Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine.

HEADLINE: 'Mom in Chief' Touches on Policy, and Tongues Wag

BYLINE: By RACHEL SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The government workers greeted Michelle Obama like a Hollywood celebrity, whooping and cheering and oohing and aahing over her slate gray power suit. But when she took to the podium, the nation's self-described mom in chief quickly turned policy wonk.
 The first lady pitched her husband's economic stimulus package, including plans to create 15,000 affordable housing units, weatherize 2 million low-income homes and repair military housing. Such investments, Mrs. Obama told employees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, would prevent ''an increase in homelessness during these tough economic times.'' 
 In her first weeks in the White House, Mrs. Obama has been the gracious hostess and loyal spouse, welcoming visitors to the Executive Mansion and accompanying President Obama to a prayer breakfast and to a charter school to read to second graders. But in a departure from her predecessor, Mrs. Obama has also begun promoting bills that support her husband's policy priorities.
 Last month, Mrs. Obama celebrated the enacting of a pay-equity law with a reception for women's advocates at the White House. Last week, she supported the economic stimulus bill on her visit to the housing agency and another to the Department of Education.
 Mrs. Obama plans to visit all the cabinet-level agencies on her tour to listen to and get to know Washington in the coming weeks, her aides say. They said she relished the chance to serve as one of the president's chief surrogates on critical policy matters.
 ''One of the things she does really well is to highlight the benefits of pieces of legislation,'' said Jackie Norris, Mrs. Obama's chief of staff. ''She's really kind of laying out things that are important to the administration. I think she'll play an active role in supporting the president's agenda.''
 It is a notably different approach than the one embraced by the former first lady, Laura Bush, who like most others steered clear of discussing legislation. Some observers praised Mrs. Obama's foray into the legislative debate, saying the new first lady, who is a Harvard-educated lawyer and a former hospital executive, was eminently qualified to promote the president's policies. 
 Others expressed surprise, saying they had expected Mrs. Obama to focus on her daughters and on the traditional issues she had emphasized in the presidential campaign, like supporting military families and working parents. Her remarks, they said, carried echoes of former first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, though Mrs. Obama has said she will not become involved in policymaking as Mrs. Clinton did.
 ''She went to some lengths to say she was going to be first mom in chief,'' Myra Gutin, a scholar of first ladies at Rider University in New Jersey, said of Mrs. Obama. ''I don't think we ever really imagined her edging toward public policy like this. It's not like she's making public policy. But it's a little less neutral than some of the other things she's talked about focusing on.''
 Marcia D. Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law Center here, countered that Mrs. Obama was successfully balancing her ceremonial role as first lady, her role as a mother and her keen interest in public policy.
 ''It seems like a combination of responsibilities that fit very naturally with who she is,'' said Ms. Greenberger, who attended the signing of the pay-equity law at the White House. ''You don't have a sense that being a mom and being human and being able to understand everybody's daily struggles has to come at the expense of her intelligence, her expertise and her understanding of the issues.''
 Mrs. Obama's aides say she is still feeling her way as first lady. She is meeting regularly with her staff to plan events and hammer out her policy agenda even as she juggles play dates and goes over homework with her daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7. (And yes, Mrs. Obama, like her husband, is keeping her BlackBerry.)
 When Mr. Obama stood alongside members of Congress in a White House ceremony to celebrate the signing of the pay-equity legislation, Mrs. Obama found a seat in the audience with the women's advocates, not on stage with the lawmakers. 
 And in her speech at the Education Department last week, Mrs. Obama quickly corrected herself when she used the word ''we'' to describe the educational investments the president hoped to make. ''I shouldn't say 'we,' but the administration 'we,' '' she said.
 Her speeches to government employees have been warm and rousing, something akin to pep rallies, first lady style, as she has thanked them for their work. ''I'm visiting -- trying to visit all the agencies here to say a few things -- one, to say hello,'' Mrs. Obama said as the crowd roared back, ''Hello!''
 Indeed, Mrs. Obama seems to savor her role as a bridge between the White House and the community. Last week, she took time to hug, shake hands with and speak to dozens of government employees -- from administrative assistants to agency heads -- some of whom said they came close to tears at the sight of her. (''I got a hug!'' one woman shouted jubilantly. ''I got a hug!'')
 Mrs. Obama plans to continue honing her message, her aides say. But she is also eager to get out of the White House and into the city.
 Last week, she took her staff to lunch at Five Guys Burgers and Fries, where she had a cheeseburger, French fries and a Coke.
 And when a little girl at the charter school visited by the Obamas announced that she dreamed of becoming first lady, Mrs. Obama flashed her self-deprecating wit. ''It doesn't pay much,'' she advised.

HEADLINE: Money Manager

 BODY:
Asked how he felt about the current economic landscape shaped during his tenure as chief of the S.E.C., Arthur Levitt said: ''We've all acted foolishly. We've spent too much money on too many frivolous things'' (Questions for Arthur Levitt, Jan. 25). 
 That is precisely why we should consider a return to the top marginal income-tax rates in this country, which varied from 70 percent to more than 90 percent from 1936 to 1980. Those tax rates accompanied unprecedented economic growth, technological innovation, creativity and shared prosperity.
 MIKE HARMAN Saint Albans, W.Va.
 I took offense at Deborah Solomon's questions to Arthur Levitt, arguably the most investor-friendly head of the Securities and Exchange Commission in recent history. Her snide question as to how he sleeps at night blithely overlooks the fact that others were in charge of that institution during the past eight years, when Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme flourished. I resent her implication that Levitt is to blame for this disaster.
 CAROL CORBETT Solebury, Pa.
 On the assumption that Arthur Levitt's answers were not taken out of context so as to make him look totally tone deaf, I can only conclude that's exactly what he is. He doesn't feel right about spending large sums of money right now, but seems to feel that none of his actions or inactions at the S.E.C. contributed in any way to the fact that large numbers of Americans have little or no money to spend on anything. Shame on him!
 MORRY ALTER Charlotte, N.C.
 Being chairman of the S.E.C. is a thankless task -- investors will never give a chairman credit for their gains but are quick to see scapegoats for their losses. Levitt is one of the very few occupants of the post who garners any respect for at least warning of the consequences of companies' accounting malpractice and doing what he could, often against determined Congressional opposition, to limit it. Solomon's tactics, making a financial ''Willie Horton'' of Bernard Madoff and proceeding to spend a quarter of the interview on discussion of him, were despicable. Levitt made some good decisions at the S.E.C. (and he has been honest about his mistakes), but he erred in agreeing to this ambush, as did The Times in printing it.

HEADLINE: Together Off Broadway And Elsewhere

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
WHEN Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard started coming to the Classic Stage Company in the East Village a few weeks ago to begin rehearsals for Chekhov's ''Uncle Vanya,'' they were surprised, marginally flattered and mildly annoyed to find that a phalanx of paparazzi had staked out the theater, flashbulbs at the ready. 
 Then they learned that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, who had taken up residence nearby, were regular visitors to the coffee shop in the theater's lobby and were the photographers' true quarries.
 ''They actually had nothing to do with us,'' Mr. Sarsgaard said with an embarrassed laugh during a recent interview. 
 ''But,'' Ms. Gyllenhaal added, ''they were like, 'All right, as long as you're here.' ''
 ''Two for the price of one,'' Mr. Sarsgaard said. ''Awesome.'' 
 In the constellation of couples who fascinate and transfix -- Tom and Katie, Brad and Angelina, Matthew and Sarah Jessica -- Peter and Maggie are minor lights, their appeal driven not by exotic trappings (private planes, bodyguards, baby photos for sale) but by career paths and indie credentials that have defined them as actors first, boldface names third or fifth. 
 Over lunch at a trattoria near their Park Slope home, Ms. Gyllenhaal and Mr. Sarsgaard come across like a shinier version of That Brooklyn Couple who gave up the hubbub of Manhattan to raise their child in a quieter, tree-lined borough. They paw affectionately at each other's collars and complete each other's sentences; juggle their work schedules to accommodate their 2-year-old daughter, Ramona; and grumble about carrying strollers down subway staircases. 
 On closer inspection, though, that veneer of mundanity starts to unravel: the couple, who have been together since 2001, are not married, live in their own brownstone, refer to each other as lover (at least Mr. Sarsgaard uses the term) and can often arrange their work schedules so that one of them is free to attend their child. They also happen to make their living in front of millions of people; when they perform onstage, the playwright John Guare comes to their previews; and when they travel to work in Montreal, they hang out with the rock band the Arcade Fire. 
 This makes them noticeable enough around New York that they attract attention even for routine conduct -- Ms. Gyllenhaal ignited an online controversy in 2007 simply for being caught by a photographer in the act of breast-feeding Ramona -- which has instilled in them a self-consciousness, as individuals and as a couple. 
 So there is an added frisson to their coming collaboration in ''Uncle Vanya'' (which opens on Thursday and runs through March 8), one of the rare instances when the two will appear together in a professional capacity.
 Mr. Sarsgaard and Ms. Gyllenhaal said they would work together more often if there were more low-risk opportunities like this, at a small Off Broadway theater with an accommodating director.
 ''It is only about the experience of doing it, and with your lover; why would we engage in anything any other way than that?'' Mr. Sarsgaard said. ''Why would we join forces commercially? It would be ----''
 ''Kind of disgusting,'' Ms. Gyllenhaal said, finishing his thought. 
 Their individual resumes explain why the prospect of their acting together is so intriguing. Mr. Sarsgaard, 37, is coming off a widely praised Broadway revival of Chekhov's ''Seagull,'' in which he played Trigorin with Kristin Scott Thomas as Arkadina, to add to a repertory of reserved yet sympathetic characters in movies like ''Shattered Glass,'' ''Kinsey'' and ''Garden State.'' 
 Ms. Gyllenhaal, 31, who was last seen on screen in the summer blockbuster ''The Dark Knight'' (playing a role she inherited from Ms. Holmes), has her own tradition of playing astonishingly raw and unglamorous characters, in films like ''Sherrybaby'' and ''Secretary'' and plays like Tony Kushner's ''Homebody/Kabul.''
 Thus, some coincidence -- and some convincing -- was required for them to come together in ''Uncle Vanya.'' Last summer Brian Kulick, the artistic director of the Classic Stage Company, began assembling the production, hiring the veteran Chekhov interpreter Austin Pendleton to direct and Denis O'Hare, a Tony Award winner for ''Take Me Out,'' to play the titular misanthrope.
 Finding an actress to play Yelena, the young married beauty who inconveniently attracts the affections of Vanya and the melancholy country doctor Astrov, was a months-long process. It was only after another actress turned down the role that Mr. Kulick turned to Ms. Gyllenhaal. 
 And it was she who suggested Mr. Sarsgaard for the role of Astrov, a suggestion that took the play's creative team by surprise. As Mr. Pendleton recalled, ''I said, 'But he's in ''The Seagull.'' ' I didn't even know Maggie and Peter were together.''
 Though Mr. Pendleton did not realize it, what made the bargain unique is that Mr. Sarsgaard and Ms. Gyllenhaal have acted together on only one previous occasion, in the 2007 short film ''High Falls.'' In that movie, directed by Andrew Zuckerman, a friend of the couple, they played a husband and wife who jeopardize their relationship when they each reveal crucial secrets to the same confidant.
 The project was not quite their ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,'' but Ms. Gyllenhaal recalled making the film as a taxing experience. She was about seven months pregnant with Ramona when ''High Falls'' was shot. ''I didn't have an artistic mind at that time,'' she said. ''I hated the feeling of not having the energy to have a point of view.''
 (For his part, Mr. Sarsgaard said, ''I had a great time.'')
 Mr. Sarsgaard and Ms. Gyllenhaal wanted the ''Vanya'' roles, but faced a final hurdle: securing child care for Ramona. They are generally careful to organize their schedules so that one can take care of her while the other is working. 
 (Ms. Gyllenhaal is also extremely circumspect about discussing Ramona in interviews. When Mr. Sarsgaard began to talk about his daughter's penchant for singing songs as she walks down the street, Ms. Gyllenhaal put her hand on his. ''No more Ramona talk,'' she said.) 
 Eventually the two were able to work out a baby-sitting system that involved a nanny, Mr. Sarsgaard's parents, Ms. Gyllenhaal's best friend and her mother, the screenwriter Naomi Foner. ''My mom kept saying: 'Michelle Obama's mom is going to the White House with them. It's fine,' '' Ms. Gyllenhaal said.
 By the time they agreed to do ''Uncle Vanya'' it was December, and previews were four weeks away. That left them little time before rehearsal to pore over the nuances of their roles, but both Mr. Sarsgaard and Ms. Gyllenhaal were willing to admit -- up to a point, in the presence of a reporter -- that they saw certain kinships with their characters. 
 Like Astrov, Mr. Sarsgaard said, ''it is very possible that I could have ended up on 80 acres of land by myself, and fallen in love at a distance with a gorgeous woman I could never have been with.''
 Ms. Gyllenhaal, meanwhile, said she could relate to the undulating tides of scrutiny that Yelena endures from other characters. ''You have some people saying, 'You are a gorgeous woman' in the same breath as 'Can you please not talk anymore?' '' She added, ''It's like going on the Internet.'' 
 They are also awarethat there will be many theatergoers who come to see ''Vanya'' because of them -- and happy to use the preconceptions of such spectators to their advantage.
 ''Those expectations are probably awesome for watching the play,'' Mr. Sarsgaard said. ''It probably fills in an enormous amount that could be lost, and makes each moment where we might interact seem significant, beyond what it should be.''
 Their ''Vanya'' co-stars say that by ceding the limelight to the celebrity couple in their ranks, they will be repaid in other ways. ''In this economic time there's a limited amount of people out there wanting to see theater,'' Mr. O'Hare said. ''What a great boon for us, to have people who have a profile like that, to attract people to come see us.''
 There is also the heightened tension imposed by the design of the play: most of the interactions between Astrov and Yelena in Acts I and II are brief, glancing near-misses. It is not until Act III that the two characters truly collide, in a heated scene in which Astrov aggressively confronts Yelena with his romantic feelings for her. 
 It may be satisfying for the audience to see Ms. Gyllenhaal and Mr. Sarsgaard finally confront each other, but the actors said it was a scene they were still struggling with.
 ''We have never, ever done this one scene without one of us dropping a line,'' Ms. Gyllenhaal said.
 ''Usually just one of us, though,'' Mr. Sarsgaard said, pointing to Ms. Gyllenhaal, who laughed.
 ''In some ways,'' she said, ''that scene is about my completely relinquishing control -- giving into him completely. And so I do. And sometimes I can't remember my lines.''
 Ultimately, Mr. Pendleton said, there was little instruction he could give the actors in this scene. ''I'm not going to tell two people who live together how to work out a physical seduction,'' he said. ''That's just ridiculous.''
 Whether or not the couple perfect that scene by opening night, Mr. Pendleton said, they had already brought a fresh take to ''Uncle Vanya'' with their ''infinitely exploratory'' acting process, which he explained: ''You don't make decisions until you absolutely have to. You just try everything, well into previews. Because of that I think they've inspired the whole group.'' 
 It remains to be seen if performing ''Uncle Vanya'' will make them more comfortable with their grade of celebrity status. Ms. Gyllenhaal said she could foresee a time when their desires to protect Ramona's privacy and lead a more domestic existence would compel them to leave New York. ''Both of us crave a quieter lifestyle lately,'' she said. ''We would probably like to move somewhere greener.''
 Then again, Mr. Sarsgaard said, ''Maggie thought we were moving to the country when we moved here,'' to Park Slope.
 Eventually, they say, they could envision themselves acting onstage together again -- perhaps in Chekhov's ''Three Sisters,'' playing Masha and Vershinin, another tempestuous literary couple. 
 But those fantasies will have to wait for several months at least, while Ms. Gyllenhaal dives back into film projects and Mr. Sarsgaard tends to Ramona for a while. (''The tables have been turned,'' Mr. Sarsgaard said.) 
 Should ''Uncle Vanya'' merely prove a once-in-a-lifetime, let's-never-do-that-again occurrence, the two said it had nonetheless been constructive for their relationship. 
 ''I think you call me a genius in the play, right?'' Mr. Sarsgaard asked Ms. Gyllenhaal.
 ''A couple times,'' she gamely replied. 
 ''Now that she's got that straight in her head, we're cementing it in there,'' Mr. Sarsgaard said. ''I feel like that will give me another five years of clear sailing.''

HEADLINE: Rell's No-Tax-Increase Plan Draws Dissent

BYLINE: By GREGORY B. HLADKY

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
 THE debate has already begun over whether the austere, no-tax-increase budget plan offered by Gov. M. Jodi Rell last week, which calls for cutting at least 400 state jobs and relies on help from the proposed federal stimulus package, can offset Connecticut's rising deficits.
 When she went before the General Assembly on Wednesday, Mrs. Rell called her plan a budget of ''shared pain and sacrifice'' but one that also trims ''the bloat of bureaucracy'' and avoids tax increases. 
 She proposes to close the state's budget gap through consolidation or elimination of nearly two dozen agencies and commissions, and $295 million in state employee concessions, in addition to cutting out jobs. Her budget also calls for $150 million in state fee increases and about $327 million siphoned off from dedicated state funds for causes like energy conservation and farmland preservation.
 A significant element in Mrs. Rell's plan is the assumption that Connecticut will receive more than $2 billion over the next 28 months under the proposed federal stimulus package. But Democrats who control the state House and Senate say that even if all that new federal aid comes through, Mrs. Rell's budget may already be out of date.
 The state comptroller's office now estimates the state's current deficit at a record-setting $1.1 billion, and the predicted budget gap for the next two fiscal years has soared beyond $8 billion. Mrs. Rell's budget is based on smaller deficit projections made last month.
 ''It is not as painful as our current reality would demand,'' said the State Senate's top Democratic leader, Donald E. Williams Jr. of Brooklyn. ''We know the numbers don't add up completely. Things have changed in the last week-and-a-half.''
 State Comptroller Nancy Wyman said projected income tax collections in Connecticut have plunged by $665 million in the past month and sales tax revenue estimates are down by $100 million.
 The co-chairman of the legislature's Finance Committee, State Representative Cameron Staples, a New Haven Democrat, said Mrs. Rell's budget proposal ''is $1.5 billion out of balance.''
 ''It's hard to know how to close the remaining gap without some sort of revenue increases,'' Mr. Staples said.
 The federal aid package being debated in the United States Senate is expected to provide Connecticut with an estimated $357 million in new Medicaid financing before June 30. Governor Rell's administration is counting on more than $900 million in expanded federal Medicaid money over the coming two fiscal years.
 Connecticut is also expected to receive $718 million or more in federal ''fiscal stabilization'' money for education and public services in 2010 and 2011. Proposals under discussion in Congress also include at least $584 million for ''shovel ready'' projects like roads, bridges and mass transit.
 ''I think perhaps the most important part of this package is to provide some funds to the State of Connecticut so it can deal with its huge budget deficit without massive layoffs,'' said United States Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat.
 Mr. Himes, who is serving his first term in the House, said support for the federal aid package within Connecticut crosses party lines. He recalled that, just two hours before the House voted on the plan, Governor Rell, a Republican, telephoned him to ask ''who she could call and what she could do'' to encourage Congressional approval.
 Denise W. Merrill, the state's House majority leader and a Democrat from Mansfield, said the additional federal Medicaid financing would be a ''huge help'' as lawmakers struggle to patch the gaping holes in the state budget.
 Martin M. Looney, the state's Senate majority leader, a Democrat from New Haven, said Connecticut's deficit problems have grown so sharply in the last few weeks that the federal help won't go as far as some have hoped.
 Some Connecticut Republicans are worried the federal plan isn't putting enough money into areas that will actually boost the state's economy.
 ''We need to invest more in mass transit in Connecticut,'' said John McKinney, the Senate minority leader and a Republican from Fairfield. For many hard-pressed cities and towns, the proposed federal aid package will act as a lifeline, said Ron W. Thomas, a spokesman for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
 ''This infusion of revenue will help keep some from going under,'' Mr. Thomas said.
 Large cities like New Haven, Hartford and Bridgeport have already been forced to lay off workers. Bridgeport has chopped its work force by about 25 percent because of its recent budget shortfalls, Mr. Thomas said.
 Officials with the conference of municipalities believe a critical portion of the federal aid plan is financing for local infrastructure improvements. Mr. Thomas said municipal leaders across the state have compiled a list of 568 local projects that could be started in the immediate future.
 Mayor Dannel P. Malloy of Stamford said his community is hoping to use some of that infrastructure money to start building a new energy generation plant. The proposed $60 million plant is designed to use pellets from wastewater treatment as fuel.
 ''We're ready to go,'' Mr. Malloy said.

 BODY:
AND then there was one.
 Three people chosen for jobs in the Obama administration have had problems with their taxes. Two, Tom Daschle and Nancy Killefer, have withdrawn. The other, Timothy F. Geithner, has been confirmed and is already very much on the job as the new Treasury secretary. What made him unstoppable?
 He is, of course, stunningly competent, with tremendous on-the-job experience, thanks in part to his work at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- an important qualification for the hellish job of fixing the nation's battered economy. And it should go without saying that he is also extremely good-looking and has a fresh, manly scent that reminds people of pine forests and freshly printed money. 
 I am definitely not saying these highly complimentary things about this awesomely talented public official merely because it's dangerous to take on a sitting Treasury secretary at tax time. That's a little like begging for an audit, not to mention a cavity search by friendly G-men.
 Not at all. In fact, this is precisely the kind of comedic quien-es-mas-macho challenge that we at the tax-section humor column step up to. Especially because Mr. Geithner, the boyishly handsome brainiac, has a sort of otherworldly intensity, as if he's a space alien observing our species at close range and thinking to himself, ''Pets, or meat?''
 (Ha-ha! Joke! I kid because I love. And I meant the part about boyishly handsome.)
 Let's look at the particulars of Mr. Geithner's tax issues. He failed to pay $34,000 in taxes for Social Security and Medicare when he was a senior official at the International Monetary Fund from 2001 to 2003. He has since paid the Treasury $48,000, which includes interest, and apologized, calling the underpayments an innocent mistake.
 Some people might have viewed the Geithner nomination as deeply embarrassing -- the top official of our tax system failing to pay taxes. They failed to realize that Mr. Geithner has enough crazy-wild mojo for the Senate to be willing to approve him despite his little problem. 
 Of course, part of what Mr. Geithner had going for him is what business types call ''first-mover advantage:'' if you get to the market before the other guys, you might reap rewards. The cascade effect of tax goofs by various nominees threatened to make the confirmation hearings look like a straight-to-video sequel to a movie that wasn't very good in the first place.
 By being confirmed early, before the Obama administration's tax problems started to look as contagious as head lice at a preschool, Mr. Geithner was able to sidestep the unpleasantness that Mr. Daschle, the woulda-been secretary of health and human services, and Ms. Killefer, the mighta-been ''chief performance officer'' at the White House, could not. Mr. Geithner sopped up the good will, and the others were left to the worst fate that can befall anyone in government: becoming a punch line.
 Still, the string of tax problems has given new legs to that wonderful old Steve Martin routine:
 ''You can be a millionaire and never pay taxes. You can have one million dollars and never pay taxes. You say, Steve, how can I be a millionaire and never pay taxes? First -- get a million dollars. Now. You say, Steve, what do I say to the taxman when he comes to my door and says 'you have never paid taxes'? Two simple words. Two simple words in the English language. I forgot.''
 What does Mr. Geithner's triumph over adversity mean for the rest of us? After all, if a bona fide best-and-brightest type like him can mess up and find forgiveness, can't we hold on to a shred of hope?
 If a deficiency is found in our returns, will we be able to say ''I forgot,'' avoid hefty penalties and still get the job of our dreams?
 Let's not be silly. There is no such thing as a ''Steve Martin rule'' in the tax code. Just ask Wesley Snipes. This is merely the latest example of the oldest rule in Washington: ''Do as I say, not as I do.'' 
 So is there anything at all that we could call the Geithner rule, something that takes the news and hardens it into precedent, allowing at least some of us a measure of forgiveness for our own innocent mistakes? 
 I think so, but you'll have to bear with me. It goes like this:
 Mr. Geithner got a pass on his tax problems because we really, really like him. So he gets a highly individualized form of amnesty. Sort of a personalized ''olly olly oxen free.''
 Also, we really, reallyneed him. It's almost like what Princess Leia said in Star Wars: ''You're my only hope.''
 So if there's a Geithner rule, it is extremely narrow. I believe that we should call it the olly olly oxen free, Obi-Wan Kenobi amnesty. If you are the nation's only hope, you might qualify. 
 Here's a simple test: Is your name Timothy F. Geithner? No? 
 See you at the audit.

HEADLINE: This Bailout Needs Some Strings Attached

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
JUST in case you missed it: The Congressional Oversight Panel monitoring the Treasury Department's bailout of broken banks -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- reported last week that Henry M. Paulson Jr.'s team at Treasury paid significantly more for the assets it bought from banks than they were worth when the deal was announced in the fall. 
 ''The panel's analysis revealed that in the 10 largest transactions made with TARP funds, for every $100 spent by Treasury, it received assets worth, on average, only $66,'' the report said. ''This disparity translates into a $78 billion shortfall for the first $254 billion in TARP funds that were spent.'' 
 More taxpayer money down the drain, alas. And all the more reason to focus closely on executive pay restrictions at any bank that receives TARP funding.
 Although our long-running financial despond has produced few real positives, surely this is one: Investors are finally seeing just how regally executives live on their shareholders' dimes. Maybe now they will do something about it.
 During good times, banks either hide or try to justify such perks as fleets of corporate jets and Las Vegas junkets. But as companies run to taxpayers for their bailout billions, they are now being forced to forgo the Gulfstreams, the tee times at Pebble Beach and those sumptuous spa treatments. 
 Could shame, that long-lost American character trait, be making a comeback? Not likely. So it's important to make Washington's plan to rein in executive pay airtight. Loud rebukes against executive excess are amusing, but a $500,000 cap on salary means only that the executives will be paid some other way. And requiring companies to recover compensation only if an executive is found to have lied on financial statements? Good luck with that. 
 ''The bite doesn't match the bark,'' said Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant in White Plains. ''Or, put another way, this looks like nip and tuck in a triage situation.'' 
 Trying to change the entitlement mind-set that drives executive pay practices is a worthy goal, of course. After all, taxpayers are being asked to redistribute their future wealth by putting billions into banks, all in the hopes of getting the economy to stir. 
 But if even some of that money goes to cushy pay and obnoxious perks, then we are pouring water into a very leaky -- and undeserving -- bucket. 
 With that in mind, here are some ideas for how to hold taxpayer-supported executives accountable for their actions, both past and future. Some of these approaches could actually generate money for beleaguered taxpayers. 
 Let's begin with restrictions on severance payouts. According to TARP guidelines put in place last fall, severance is limited to the average compensation received by an executive over the previous five years. 
 At some companies this is no hardship. Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, made $100 million in just salary and bonus from 2003 through 2007, the most recent year for which figures are available. Under TARP, his severance limit on salary and bonus (not counting other compensation, such as stock grants and perquisites) would be $20 million. 
 Mr. Blankfein might find that unbearable, but few others would.
 Here's an alternative approach. How about requiring that any severance pay over $1 million be subject to an excise tax of 20 percent? This is the amount levied on golden parachutes, and it could easily be applied to severance at companies tapping the TARP. 
 Furthermore, why not extract a 20 percent tax on all perquisites exceeding $50,000 that are given exclusively to top executives each year? These include such delectables as cars and drivers, country club memberships and personal use of corporate aircraft. If the government won't bar perks outright, then executives should have to give something back for the freebies. 
 And while we are on the subject of excise taxes, the government should ban the deplorable corporate practice known as the gross-up, in which shareholders pay to cover an executive's tax bills. Rank-and-file employees at these companies, who have been hit hard by the crisis, don't get these deals. Why should anyone?
 (Of course, some executives will try to get around a ban on gross-ups by asking for a special stock or option grant that will cover the tax bill. Directors would have to be on the lookout for these kinds of end-runs.) 
 A final suggestion: While taxpayer money flows, companies should have to freeze all contributions to executives' supplemental retirement plans. These are the lovely pots of gold that grow larger every year, even as employee 401(k) plans plummet. Given that these executive safety nets never fray, their beneficiaries can afford a few years when contributions are frozen if TARP money is tapped. 
 IT is also important for the government to provide as many incentives as possible to get taxpayers' money paid back quickly. So any executive pay restrictions might also state that if TARP funds are returned within a certain period -- say, 18 months -- the penalties can be avoided or refunded. 
 ''Taxpayers need more bang for their buck. We have a right to insist on some accountability,'' Mr. Foley said. ''If you take a meaningful amount of TARP money, you need to tighten your belt.''
 That which does not kill you makes you stronger, as the saying goes. If out of this near-death economic experience, shareholders emerge stronger and tougher on directors about me-first executives, more to the good. 
 But in the meantime, it is the government that must be resolute on taxpayers' behalf. So far, as the Congressional Oversight Panel's report demonstrates, it has fallen short.

HEADLINE: Ominous Words Feb. 1-7

 BODY:
THE NEWS As he urged a gathering of House Democrats to pass his proposed stimulus bill, President Obama warned them, ''If we do not move swiftly, an economy that is in crisis will be faced with catastrophe.'' 
 BEHIND THE NEWS He sketched the kind of calamity he had in mind: ''Millions more Americans will lose their jobs. Homes will be lost. Families will go without health care. Our crippling dependence on foreign oil will continue.'' His impatience grew as the Senate dickered over the plan before reaching an accord Friday night: ''It is inexcusable and irresponsible to get bogged down in distraction and delay while millions of Americans are being put out of work.'' 
 THE NEWS Dire new figures from the Labor Department showing that the economy had lost 598,000 jobs in January and 3.6 million over the past 13 months prompted Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute to say, ''This is a horror show we're watching.'' 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Though economists like Mr. Mishel were appalled at the continuing carnage in the labor market, the dismal figures provided timely ammunition for President Obama to demand urgent action on his stimulus package -- and by seeming to improve the political prospects for huge increases in federal spending, the numbers also cheered Wall Street, where investors bid stocks up sharply on Friday. 
 THE NEWS Former Vice President Dick Cheney said there was a ''high probability'' that terrorists would attempt a catastrophic nuclear or biological attack on the United States in coming years, and that the Obama administration's policies could increase the terrorists' chances of success.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Some opponents were quick to note that Mr. Cheney had thought there was a high probability that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, too. Of the ''tough, mean, dirty, nasty business'' of protecting America from terrorism, Mr. Cheney said: ''These are evil people. And we're not going to win this fight by turning the other cheek.''
 THE NEWSGordon Brown, the prime minister of Britain, used the word ''depression,'' rather than recession, to refer to the world economic slowdown as he answered questions in Parliament, The Times of London reported. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The dire term ''depression'' is usually reserved for only the very worst of downturns, like that of the 1930s. Mr. Brown's office tried to get him back on the rhetorical reservation afterward, saying he had misspoken and did not really think a depression was in the offing. The prime minister has generally been careful in his choice of words, the paper said; he previously referred to a ''financial crisis,'' then a ''recession.''
 THE NEWS Drivers on Interstate 255 in Collinsville, Ill, were warned by an electronic highway sign about ''daily lane closures due to zombies,'' The Associated Press reported; similar signs in Austin, Tex., flashed: ''Zombies in area! Run.'' 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Authorities were puzzled over how pranksters could have reprogrammed the signs, which usually warn of road work or detours ahead -- not to mention who did it or why. The choice of imaginary danger may reflect the hard economic times: last fall, data posted by the science fiction blog io9.com suggested that the number of zombie-themed movies released tends to spike in periods of national trauma.

HEADLINE: 'Put This Plan in Motion,' Obama Urges Lawmakers

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama urged Congress on Saturday to swiftly resolve its differences in the sweeping economic recovery measure and ''put this plan in motion'' to bring fiscal relief and new jobs to all corners of the country.
 ''Legislation of such magnitude deserves the scrutiny that it's received over the last month, and it will receive more in the days to come,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But we can't afford to make 'perfect' the enemy of the absolutely necessary.'' 
 In his weekly radio and Internet address, Mr. Obama tempered the sharp criticism that he has aimed in recent days at Republicans who have criticized the legislation as riddled with spending that will not create jobs. He praised the agreement reached late Friday by a coalition of Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans.
 ''Democrats and Republicans came together in the Senate and responded appropriately to the urgency this moment demands,'' Mr. Obama said. ''In the midst of our greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, the American people were hoping that Congress would begin to confront the great challenges we face. That was, after all, what last November's election was all about.'' 
 The president's sales pitch, though, is far from over. Even as the Senate prepares to vote on the bill in the coming days, sharp differences remain with the House over the scope of the recovery package. The White House is already working to bridge the gap so the legislation can be ready for Mr. Obama's signature in the next week to 10 days.
 ''Americans across this country are struggling, and they are watching to see if we're equal to the task before us,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Let's show them that we are. And let's do whatever it takes to keep the promise of America alive in our time.''
 As Mr. Obama and his family made their first weekend trip to the presidential retreat at Camp David, his advisers worked to build more support for the economic recovery plan. A handful of Republicans have already signed on, but aides said they hoped to attract more to create the image of a stronger bipartisan bill.
 In the address, Mr. Obama pointed to specific states that would benefit from the economic plan, which his economists have projected would save or create more than 3 million jobs over the next two years. In Maine, he said, 16,000 jobs would be saved or created, and nearly 80,000 in Indiana, ''almost all of them in the private sector.''
 ''That's what is at stake with this plan: putting Americans back to work,'' he said. 
 The reference to Maine, which he has been making throughout the week, is aimed at the state's two Republican senators, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins, whose votes are important. The president is traveling to Indiana on Monday to hold his first town-hall-style meeting as president, where he will try to build broader support for the program.
 In Florida, where Mr. Obama is scheduled to visit on Tuesday, 485 schools would be upgraded, he said, which the administration says would create a cascade of new jobs. And in Ohio, he said, 4.5 million workers would receive tax relief of up to $1,000.
 ''The American people know that our challenges are great,'' Mr. Obama said Saturday. ''They don't expect Democratic solutions or Republican solutions -- they expect American solutions.''

HEADLINE: Potomac's Postpartisan Depression

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 Once upon a time, America thought Prince Charming would glide in and kiss her, reviving her from a coma induced by a poison apple of greed, deceit, carelessness, recklessness and overreaching.
 But then the prince got distracted, seeing Lincoln in the mirror, and instead gave the kiss of life to a bunch of flat-lining Republican tax-cut fetishists.
 Somehow the most well-known person on the planet lost control of the economic message to someone named Eric Cantor. 
 (And Larry Summers ended up making Henry Paulson seem riveting.)
 In his first weeks padding around a White House that still has nails on the walls waiting for new pictures, and phone and e-mail kinks, Barack Obama could not locate the bully pulpit and ended up being bullied.
 Republicans, pulled out of their existential lethargy and re-energized by the president's charm offensive, immediately mounted an offensive against him. Just as Michael Bloomberg learned the perils of cuddling a groundhog when it bit him, Mr. Obama learned the perils of coddling conservatives. 
 Pete Sessions, a conservative from Waco, Tex., and the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, warned that they could become an insurgency, having learned more about insurgencies ''because of the Taliban.'' (Yes, that's the same Taliban that was allowed to regenerate by bumbling Republican leaders.)
 Obama advisers are right to crow that the president's civility to Republicans will be popular with the public. But the carrot-stick ratio was way out of whack. Mr. Obama should have written up a kosher (as in pork-free) bill that Americans could trust -- and Republicans couldn't as easily mock -- and jammed it through.
 It's a huge, scary moment, with trillions of dollars and millions of jobs flying out the window. Vice President Joseph Biden, in another Cassandra moment, told House Democrats that even if the White House does everything right, ''there's still a 30 percent chance we'll get it wrong.'' 
 The president and his aides seemed a bit snow-blinded by the White House, overwhelmed and slow to understand that they were losing the high ground and the whip hand. They couldn't even get their pick for commerce secretary, the Republican Senator Judd Gregg, to vote for their stimulus bill; he said he would abstain.
 Those in the president's circle were too caught up in more narrow concerns, like how their relationships with the president and the capital were shaking out; whether they could breathe on this new planet with the rarefied air of cool planes and helicopters; and whether W.'s mind-boggling mountain of garbage would trash Democratic candidates in 2010 and doom Mr. Obama to one term. 
 ''I would rather do the right thing and have one term than be mediocre and have two,'' Mr. Obama told House Democrats at their Williamsburg retreat Thursday night. The lawmakers had been feeling disillusioned that they were carrying Mr. Obama's water on the bill, while Obama aides triangulated and promised that the bill would ''improve'' in the Senate. 
 Nancy Pelosi told her leadership team that she had told the president, ''I don't mind you driving the bus over me, but I don't appreciate your backing it up and running over me again and again.''
 The Obama wizards' tactical skills seemed to desert them. The White House often ends up making its inhabitants tone-deaf (or even nuts), but this was an unusually quick trip into the cognitive third dimension.
 Asked what he had learned from the Daschle fiasco, one Obama official replied, ''Not to rationalize.''
 They knew that the choice of Tom Daschle conflicted with the Obama change message, but they preferred to focus on how much the president owed his friend and how good they thought he would be in the job.
 They wanted him because he was the ultimate insider and they lost him because he was the ultimate insider. Now Daschle's punishment for getting too rich with special interests will be to get richer with special interests.
 Obama aides call the morass a good wake-up call, and the president seems more aware of how the White House weather can cloud your thinking. Maybe that's why he keeps trying to pop out to get a breath of fresh air -- at an elementary school, at the Kennedy Center, at Camp David.
 On Friday, a reporter asked Robert Gibbs if the president was already feeling cooped up.
 ''He's a bit of a restless soul,'' Gibbs said, laughing. ''His idea of a crazy day is to take a long walk.''
 A long walk where? somebody asked.
 ''In solitude and isolation,'' Gibbs replied.
 President Obama doesn't need to leave his new home to be isolated. That's the specialty of the White House.

HEADLINE: America's Scorecard In Iraq

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
-- This is what victory in the war in Iraq was supposed to look like: Fifteen million Iraqis voting in free and fair (largely) elections, emerging from their polling stations with their purple-stained fingers in an atmosphere that was free (largely) of intimidation or violence. 
 When Iraq's regional elections were held last weekend, that was indeed the scene. What's more, when the results were announced, it became clear that parties promising security and national unity, led by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's bloc, had fared better than exclusively sectarian ones that until recently seemed bent on sundering the country. 
 The elections again raised hopes that a stable, democratic Iraq was emerging from the calamity of six years of war, an outcome that could hasten the departure of the remaining 140,000 American troops, as President Obama suggested in his congratulatory calls to Iraqi leaders. 
 But there are other measures of victory in Iraq, and so at this, yet another hinge in Iraq's tortured history, it seems a fair time to ask: Has the war enhanced American strategic interests in the troubled Middle East, as President Bush and the other champions of the war long argued would happen? 
 The answer really is no, or at least not yet.
 The overthrow of Saddam Hussein, whatever the underlying motivation, certainly removed a potential threat to American interests, but a bird's-eye view as the sixth anniversary of the war approaches shows that the Middle East remains as troubling and turbulent as ever. Whatever gains Iraq has brought have to be measured alongside the costs, the casualties and the consequences to America's standing in the region.
 ''We are not necessarily weaker,'' said Marina Ottaway, director of Middle Eastern affairs for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an author of ''Beyond the Facade: Political Reform in the Arab World.'' ''But,'' she added, ''after all these years and the money that we've spent, I'm not sure we're coming out in a stronger strategic position.''
 Indeed, Afghanistan has spiraled deeper into insurgency, perhaps irreversibly, as Pakistan stumbles toward chaos. The democratizing example Iraq was to have set has yet to show itself in countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria, while American influence over them has suffered in ways that will take years to repair. 
 And then there is Iran. America's nemesis for the past three decades has emerged as the Muslim Middle East's unrivaled power, punctuating its ambitions and capabilities with the launch last week of a satellite into space. Its nuclear ambitions appear undiminished, as does its patronage of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, making the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seem as intractable as ever.
 ''The collapse of Iraq -- the army, the government -- created a huge gap in security in the region,'' said Mustafa Alani, a security analyst at the Gulf Research Center in Dubai, reflecting a broadly held worry among Sunni-dominated governments. ''And Iran emerged, by default, as the power in the region.'' Before American troops unseated him, Saddam Hussein, though isolated and crippled militarily, had been a comforting buffer to Iran, in the view of most of the Arab world.
 What recent events like the elections have done is remove Iraq from the top of the list of crises Mr. Obama's new administration has to tackle, and that alone might count for something. 
 Well before last year's election in the United States, President Bush's aides repeatedly said their goal was to make sure that Iraq would not be the first problem on the new president's desk. 
 Now, it turns out, Iraq may have been pushed farther down on the list than they imagined. When Mr. Obama granted his first extended interview as president -- to Al Arabiya, the satellite news channel based in the United Arab Emirates -- he barely mentioned Iraq at all. In fact, he conspicuously omitted Iraq as he offered ''a hand of friendship'' in what he pledged would be a holistic push for regional peace. 
 ''I do think that it is impossible for us to think only in terms of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and not think in terms of what's happening with Syria or Iran or Lebanon or Afghanistan and Pakistan,'' he said.
 As a new president, Mr. Obama has a new chance to refocus American strategy. Iraq's contribution to that, if it has any, would be to become stable enough that an overstretched American military can free up forces to counter the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan. There, the Obama administration has pledged up to 30,000 additional troops, even as the president's envoys redouble diplomatic efforts in the region.
 ''With the Bush administration gone, the Obama administration is sending signals it is willing to start a dialogue'' among the region's leaders, Ms. Ottaway said. ''And with Iraq seemingly more stable, it is possible that there could be some strategic progress.''
 The still unanswerable question is what kind of Iraq the last American troops will leave behind. 
 Mr. Maliki is himself the leader of a Shiite sectarian party, but his crackdown on Shiite militias last year -- followed by the provincial elections -- has somewhat diminished fears, both here and in the United States, that Iran would dictate Iraq's internal politics and external diplomacy. In fact, an emerging sense of Iraqi nationalism -- which is acute among Sunnis, who deeply distrust Iranian influence -- could restore Iraq's historic role in the region as a bulwark against Shiite and Persian expansion. 
 Mr. Maliki, who lived in exile in Iran, is no longer perceived as a weak leader purely beholden to Iran. And Iran, at least for now, appears to have scaled back its overt attempts to undermine the nascent Iraqi government by supplying insurgent groups.
 ''There is the growing self-sufficiency and sovereignty of Iraq, whose leaders, including Iraqi Shia, have shown they do not intend for the new, post-Saddam Iraq to become a satrapy of its neighbor to the east,'' Mr. Obama's holdover defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, told Congress last month.
 That does not mean that Iraq will become a satrapy of the United States either. As Iraqis become more assertive and self-confident, it seems far more likely that it will drift beyond a purely American-dominated foreign policy. 
 In last year's negotiations over a new security agreement, for example, Iraq extracted concessions on political, economic and military control that President Bush had once opposed. Anti-Americanism also remains a potent force among the political parties that did well in the elections. 
 And Iraq might use its oil to draw itself closer to other powers craving access, from Russia to China to Iran. When Iraq begins signing deals for new oil fields later this year, American companies may not dominate the bidding, as critics of the war, and some defenders of it, once thought they would. 
 ''I think the Americans are going too far to think that Iraq will emerge as a major ally in the region,'' Mr. Alani of the Gulf Research Center said.
 For the foreseeable future, Iraq will be preoccupied with consolidating political control and rebuilding its economy, shattered after six years of war and decades of repression before that. It remains fragile, with insurgencies still flaring in several provinces and internal rivalries (involving the Kurds in the north, especially) threatening to undo the progress already made. The provincial elections are only a preview of national elections later this year, when the stakes will be higher. 
 The war is not yet over, but the American part of it is not what it once was. Given the alternatives, today's Iraq might be the best strategic outcome the United States can hope for.

HEADLINE: When Humans Need a Nudge Toward Rationality

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
THE flies in the men's-room urinals of the Amsterdam airport have been enshrined in the academic literature on economics and psychology. The flies -- images of flies, actually -- were etched in the porcelain near the urinal drains in an experiment in human behavior. 
 After the flies were added, ''spillage'' on the men's-room floor fell by 80 percent. ''Men evidently like to aim at targets,'' said Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago, an irreverent pioneer in the increasingly influential field of behavioral economics. 
 Mr. Thaler says the flies are his favorite example of a ''nudge'' -- a harmless bit of engineering that manages to ''attract people's attention and alter their behavior in a positive way, without actually requiring anyone to do anything at all.'' What's more, he said, ''The flies are fun.''
 ''Nudge'' is, not incidentally, the title of the book that he wrote with Cass R. Sunstein -- the Harvard Law professor who has been named by President Obama as administrator of the White House's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. In Mr. Thaler's words, ''Sunstein would be the nudger in chief.'' 
 Mr. Sunstein, who for years was a colleague of Mr. Thaler and of Mr. Obama at the University of Chicago, faces Senate confirmation hearings and declined to comment for this article.
 In their book and in a blog (nudges.wordpress.com), Mr. Thaler and Mr. Sunstein favor nudging people to save more, eat better, weigh less, invest more sensibly, pay down debt, avoid hazardous mortgages, drive safely and wear bike helmets -- a list that expands as new ideas and new problems conducive to nudging emerge.
 In a phone conversation, Mr. Thaler said that carefully applied nudges might help ameliorate some of the problems that led to the financial crisis. Some nudges need to be more forceful than others. For example, rigorous public disclosure of leverage (the ratio of debt to capital) would be a burden. But it might be necessary to induce the people who run hedge funds, insurance companies and big banks to behave more sensibly. 
 ''Disclosure does help at every level,'' he said. ''Maybe it's not a panacea, but that's not a reason not to do it.'' 
 Nudging people for their own benefit in unobtrusive ways is part of what the co-authors call ''libertarian paternalism,'' a seeming oxymoron that links the notions of freedom from constraint and firm, well-intentioned guidance. 
 Mr. Sunstein and Mr. Thaler say that this apparent contradiction is reconciled through what they call ''choice architecture.'' This is the deliberate imposition of structure in an environment -- etching flies in a urinal -- to induce people to make better choices. Consider a cafeteria where healthy foods like fruit and yogurt are placed in a prominent location, while junk foods are relegated to an out-of-the way spot. People are free to choose, but they are being nudged toward healthier decisions. 
 Similarly, Mr. Thaler and Shlomo Benartzi, an economist at U.C.L.A., applied these theories to 401(k) plans with the ''Save More Tomorrow'' program, which gives employees the option of increasing payroll deductions in the future. This arrangement acknowledges the human desire to enjoy life now and put off self-discipline -- a tendency observed by Aesop's fable of the ant and the grasshopper and confirmed through much recent behavioral research. With ''Save More Tomorrow,'' you can have it both ways -- consuming as much as you like now, while automatically increasing your savings rate on the next Jan. 1, and in every successive year.
 Nudging derives from research by Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel laureate in economics; by Mr. Kahneman's late colleague, Amos Tversky; and by Mr. Thaler and others over several decades. Mr. Kahneman, a psychologist, gives Mr. Thaler considerable credit for the birth of behavioral economics. 
 Mr. Thaler has found that people often don't act rationally and in their own best interests, as is assumed by traditional economic models. He calls such idealized people ''Econs,'' as distinguished from ''Humans.'' Econs are walking computers, and behave according to the laws of classical economics; Humans are quirky, like the people you meet on the street. Humans may know that they should eat less and exercise more, but they often miss the mark. They may know that they should save more, but often don't. And so, Mr. Thaler says, most of us would benefit from a nudge.
 DISCLOSURE aimed at enabling people to make more informed choices is often Mr. Thaler's preferred solution for complex issues involving markets. He cites disclosure rules imposed on mutual funds by the Securities and Exchange Commission that, imperfect as they may be, have allowed third-party firms like Morningstar and Lipper to create Web sites comparing fees and performance. The point is to make it ''easier for Humans to make decisions as if they were Econs,'' he said. Such comparisons aren't really possible now when it comes to hedge funds, for which standard, reliable data is not available. 
 In financial markets, where evidence of irrationality has been abundant lately, he says he would increase regulations, but very carefully. There's no evidence, he said, that regulators could actually determine appropriate leverage for specific investments, for example, and ''heavy-handed regulation'' could shut down financial markets and weaken the economy further.
 ''The trick is to try and figure out a way of forcing these firms to disclose more of what they're doing without giving away so much that they can no longer make a living,'' he said. Such information would help individuals decide whether to invest in the funds, and would help regulators assess overall risk imposed on the financial system and the economy. In addition, he said, disclosure itself often has a salutary effect on behavior because people tend to be mindful of the opinions of others. 
 As a principal in the firm of Fuller & Thaler Asset Management, he has applied his own theories, looking for behavioral biases that may affect specific stocks or market sectors. Two mutual funds managed by the firm haven't done very well lately, though, with returns over the last year that have slightly lagged the miserable stock market.
 ''We're not exceptions,'' he said with a chuckle. ''We're just Humans.''

HEADLINE: Changes, Up and Down the Ladder

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 AT least for the next year or so, nearly every household with an income below $500,000 is likely to get at least a tiny tax cut.
 But as President Obama and Congress wrestle with an economic crisis and the legacy of the Bush tax cuts, the most far-reaching changes may be in how much people pay the government but in how much the government pays to people near the bottom.
 Having criticized President George W. Bush for years about showering the wealthiest Americans with tax breaks, Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders are using a seemingly obscure concept -- the ''refundable tax credit'' -- to put money directly into the hands of people at the middle and bottom rungs of the income ladder.
 The idea, not itself new, is to offer credits that can leave people with extra money even if they didn't earn enough to owe federal income taxes. About 57 million Americans have no tax liability. 
 The idea is not without controversy. Republican lawmakers have generally opposed refundable tax credits, arguing that people should not receive tax refunds if they did not pay income taxes in the first place. To Republicans, the credits look like a backdoor way of expanding welfare. But the idea is wildly popular with Democrats, who see it as a way to shift income from the rich to the poor directly through the tax system.
 More than a year before he was elected president, Mr. Obama laid out a surprisingly detailed plan aimed at shifting more of the tax burden from middle-income families to those at the very top.
 His plan called for reversing the Bush tax cuts for families with incomes of more than $200,000, a move that would have meant particularly steep increases for the tiny sliver of taxpayers earning millions of dollars a year. 
 Though that is still part of Mr. Obama's blueprint, the deepening recession and soaring unemployment rate have made the administration nervous about raising taxes on anyone. 
 But the crisis has, if anything, accelerated the introduction of the other part of his agenda: new and expanded tax breaks that get money to people who do not earn enough to owe federal income tax. (They do pay Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes.)
 Several of Mr. Obama's biggest tax proposals have been rolled into the giant economic stimulus bill that Democrats are now pushing to get through Congress. And while the legislation would authorize the tax cuts for only two years, Congress has historically extended ''temporary'' tax cuts for many years and even decades.
 If a stimulus measure is enacted, almost all taxpayers would likely have at least slightly lower taxes. People at the very top of the income ladder would probably get a temporary reprieve from tax increases. But once the economy recovers, Mr. Obama will face huge new fiscal headaches that will make it hard to avoid broader tax increases -- and not just on the very rich.
 The Congressional Budget Office warned in December that the budget deficit for this year would skyrocket to $1.2 trillion, a record both in dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product. And that estimate did not include the stimulus bill, which would add at least $400 billion to the deficit in both 2009 and 2010.
 Despite the budgetary chaos, Obama administration officials and Democratic leaders in Congress say they are still determined to increase ''fairness'' by shifting more of the tax burden from middle-income families to the wealthy.
 MR. OBAMA'S plan, if it became law, would lead to deep changes at all income levels. Because of the complexity of the tax code, there would be winners and losers at almost every level. But in general, the biggest reductions in effective tax rates would be at the bottom of the income scale. 
 Over all, the Tax Policy Center estimated, about 80 percent of all taxpayers would receive a tax cut under Mr. Obama's proposal, while 10 percent would see their taxes go up. 
 According to the Tax Policy Center, people near the bottom, with incomes of $10,000 to $20,000, would see their after-tax incomes rise by an average of 7.1 percent, or $1,019. For people earning $50,000 to $75,000, after-tax incomes would rise 6 percent, or an average of $1,201. Surprisingly, after-tax income would edge upward even for many people with incomes of $200,000 to $500,000. 
 But tax bills would climb for people at the highest income levels. People in the top 5 percent of income, starting at $237,000, would see their tax rates rise 1.5 percentage points, to 26.5 percent, for an average increase of $5,686. People in the top 1 percent, with incomes above $619,561, would see their rates increase 5.7 percentage points, to 34 percent. Their average tax bill would climb $114,238.
 The Bush tax cuts will expire at the end of 2010 unless Congress renews them. Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress would make the tax cuts permanent for families with incomes below $200,000, but eliminate them for people who earn more.
 That would mean that the top two tax brackets would jump back to their levels during the Clinton administration. The 33 percent bracket, which for married couples applies to income above $200,000, would rise to 36 percent. The 35 percent bracket, for income above $357,700, would rise to 39.6 percent. 
 On top of that, Mr. Obama would eliminate the Bush tax cuts on capital gains and dividends for upper-income households. That would have the effect of raising the top tax on capital gains to 20 percent, from 15 percent, and the top tax rate on dividends to 39.6 percent, from 15 percent. He would also preserve the estate tax on inherited wealth at its level in 2009, which is 45 percent for estates above $3.5 million. Both of those changes would hit the very richest families the hardest.
 All told, the top 5 percent of households, with incomes above $237,040, would see their after-tax incomes edge down by 2 percent, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. 
 But the top 1 percent, with incomes above $619,000, would see their after-tax incomes drop 8 percent, or $114,238. And those in the stratosphere, with incomes above $2.8 million, would see their after-tax incomes drop 10 percent, or an average of $651,000.
 For all the partisan political passion over Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, they could end up being a sideshow. Mr. Obama's economic team, led by Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary and Lawrence H. Summers as head of the National Economic Council, is dominated by centrists whose top priority for the next several years will be nursing the economy back to health. 
 Measured in dollars, moreover, the fight over the Bush tax cuts is a fairly small part of the Obama plan. All told, according to the Tax Policy Center, rescinding the tax cuts would raise about $300 billion over 10 years. That pales in comparison with the $1.2 trillion that Mr. Obama would spend on measures to increase tax benefits for people on the middle and lower rungs of the ladder.
 Indeed, the hottest tax issue over the next two years is likely to be the refundable tax credit, a phrase so colorless and technocratic that it does not even appear in a description of Mr. Obama's tax agenda on the White House Web site. Instead, the site simply says the president's plan would provide ''broad-based relief to middle-class families,'' restore ''fairness'' to the tax code and ''restore bottom-up economic growth that creates good jobs in America.''
 But refundable tax credits would be Mr. Obama's primary tool to get more money to the poorest households in the country. 
 A refundable tax credit -- like the $1,000 child tax credit -- provides a ''refund'' to people even if they earned so little money that they owed no income taxes. 
 The $1,000 Child Tax Credit, for example, entitles a family to subtract $1,000 from the tax bill for each child in the household. But under current law, the tax credit was of no use to families with incomes below $12,550, which were too poor to owe any taxes at all. About 6.3 million low-income children were cut off entirely from the benefit in 2007, and an additional 4 million children received only partial credit, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center.
 THE stimulus bill that passed the House on Jan. 28 would allow any family to collect the refund, even if the family had no income. The bill would cost $18 billion over two years. A Senate version of the stimulus bill would refund the tax credit to families with incomes as low as $6,000.
 By their nature, refundable tax credits are anti-poverty measures that take money from those who are more affluent and put it in the hands of people with low incomes. 
 The concept has been around awhile. The Earned Income Tax Credit already pays out more than $40 billion a year, mostly to low-income, working single parents who can receive as much as $4,500 a year. Supporters often call it the federal government's biggest antipoverty program.
 But Mr. Obama would expand such credits and add new ones. One of his signature proposals, the ''Making Work Pay'' credit, would provide up to $500 to most American workers. The House and Senate have included it in their versions of the stimulus package. Over two years, it would cost about $145 billion.
 Likewise, the House and Senate bills also incorporate Mr. Obama's proposals to turn existing tax breaks for college tuition into refundable tax credits.
 When Senate Republicans proposed last week to double the existing tax credit for first-time home buyers, to $15,000, Senate Democrats not only signaled their support but proposed making it refundable, as well. In the end, they decided to make the tax credit not refundable, but available to all home buyers.
 But that comparative harmony is likely to dissolve, especially once panic about the economy subsides and Democrats take a fresh look at repealing tax cuts for people at the top. At that point, the tug-of-war between rich and poor can be expected to resume.

HEADLINE: Mayor and Bishop Announce Plan to Turn 4 Catholic Schools Into Charter Schools

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ; Karen Zraick contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Bishop Nicholas A. DiMarzio of the Diocese of Brooklyn unveiled a proposal on Saturday to convert four Roman Catholic schools singled out for closing into public charter schools, an 11th-hour lifeline meant to preserve the education provided in the buildings and stave off potential overcrowding in city schools.
 It would be the first time such a plan was undertaken in New York and could serve as a model for converting other Catholic and private schools. Mr. Bloomberg framed the plan as an unlikely alliance, the product of creative thinking in a time of economic distress. He said it would ''bring stability and much-needed predictability back'' to families with children at some of the 14 schools in Brooklyn and Queens that the diocese has marked for closing at the end of the academic year because of declining enrollment and rising operating costs. 
 At the same time, it would ameliorate what could be an overwhelming influx of students from closed Catholic schools into crowded neighborhood public schools. The four new schools would have room for 1,000 students; students currently enrolled in the parochial schools would be guaranteed seats. 
 Bishop DiMarzio invoked the story of Noah's ark in describing the ''flood situation'' the church faces financially, comparing the mayor to Noah. ''He's throwing out a life preserver and I'm going to grab it,'' he said at a news conference with Mr. Bloomberg at City Hall. 
 The city would lease the buildings from the diocese, but religious instruction would be banned and religious symbols in the buildings would be covered. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, emphasizing that the proposal was in its early stages, did not disclose the names of the four schools and said the number of schools could shrink or grow. He said leaders of other faiths had also expressed interest in turning their private schools into charter schools. The proposal would require approval by the Legislature because state law bars charter schools from having any ties to religious institutions. 
 On its face, the embrace of charter schools, which are publicly financed but privately managed, seems an odd cause for the diocese to rally behind, but that may be a reflection of the severity of its financial situation. 
 Catholic leaders have uneasily watched the growing popularity of charter schools, worried that they might draw away families who might choose Catholic schools but would be dissuaded by tuition costs -- the average yearly tuition for elementary schools in the Brooklyn diocese is $3,500. At the heart of the educational philosophies in both charter and Catholic schools is an emphasis on high expectations and strict discipline, illustrated by the uniforms students are required to wear.
 Across the country some churches have enacted policies that prohibit selling or leasing space to charter schools. The Archdiocese of New York, which has shuttered 15 schools since 2007 and is considering additional closings this year, has signaled that it is uninterested in renting space to charter schools.
 In Albany, which is home to a large number of charter schools, Catholic school enrollment has plummeted in recent years. Church officials believe the charter schools have played a role.
 ''Our policy is we are very careful about to whom we rent the space,'' Sister Jane Herb, superintendent of schools for the Diocese of Albany, said in an interview last November. ''Charter schools have taken some of the key elements we've prided ourselves on over the years. I'm very concerned about enrollment.''
 Officials at Catholic schools in Albany have made their religious dimension a key selling point in speaking to parents who are considering both types of schools. 
 The Diocese of Brooklyn has avoided providing space in its facilities to charter schools if they would be near enough to compete with existing Catholic schools. Although the diocese, with 1.5 million Catholics in Brooklyn and Queens, remains the fifth most populous in the United States, its parochial schools, like those in other urban areas, have seen their enrollments shrink as demographics shifted. Since 2005, the diocese has closed 32 schools. 
 Bishop DiMarzio said he was eager to support the proposal, saying he believed competition was the best way to improve schools.
 ''Our whole emphasis is the students,'' he said. ''We're looking at a new direction that can be beneficial financially to the city and to the students that we do serve.''
 Nationally, there has been little cooperation between charter and Catholic schools. Washington is an exception; seven parochial schools were converted into charter schools there and opened last September.
 Nelson Smith, president and chief executive of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, said the conversion of the schools went smoothly in Washington partly because charter school officials were careful to maintain elements of the old Catholic school culture.
 ''In Washington, they were very focused on maintaining the sense of high expectations and a well-disciplined environment, and a sense of family at the school,'' he said. ''For the families, I think that's very encouraging.''
 It is unclear what would happen to teachers at the Catholic schools, many of whom are not certified to teach in public schools. If state law is amended, a provision could be added to provide for alternative certification for current teachers, according to officials with the city's Department of Education. Staff members and administrators of the new school may not be allowed to be employed by the diocese. 
 Another potentially thorny issue could be the public schools' fourth-grade health curriculum, which includes discussions of sexual reproduction. In the past, the Archdiocese of New York has objected to teaching the topic inside its buildings, forcing some public schools that lease space in buildings owned by the church to go off campus to teach the classes. 
 Catholic schools have historically been a linchpin for Queens and Brooklyn neighborhoods, home to families who had attended the schools for generations. When the Diocese of Brooklyn announced its plan last month to close 11 elementary schools entirely and merge three others with existing schools, it provoked tears and anger from parents. 
 On Saturday, parents of Catholic school students said they would miss the religious element of parochial schools, though they seemed relieved that some schools might be able to keep their doors open.
 ''We want the religious structure and upbringing,'' said Todd Goodale, a parent of a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old at Our Lady of Angels in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. ''You don't get that in public schools.''
 Mr. Goodale said he would not enroll his children at a charter school if it became an option. 
 Debbie Dagiau said she would feel comfortable sending her seventh-grade son, who is currently enrolled at Blessed Sacrament School in Jackson Heights, to a charter school.
 ''The ideal situation is to keep it the way it is,'' she said. ''But if that can't happen, to me, this is the next best thing.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 15, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A headline last Sunday with a capsule summary about the future of more than a dozen Roman Catholic schools in the Diocese of Brooklyn referred incorrectly in some copies to a proposal for four of them. In an effort to keep them from being closed, New York City has offered to turn them into public charter schools. The city's plan is not to give them help as Catholic schools.

HEADLINE: A Tiny Studio Enters the Third Dimension

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: GLENDALE, Calif. 

 BODY:
 JEFFREY KATZENBERG was sitting under an olive tree in DreamWorks Animation's outdoor cafeteria here last month, eating a taco and making the case that his company has never been stronger. In fact, he argued, things are so good that few other entertainment companies can even compare. So why weren't investors swarming? 
 ''Our stock is woefully underpriced,'' he said. ''This company is a flower that is just beginning to blossom.''
 Cut to Hollywood rolling its eyes. Mr. Katzenberg, who was a co-founder of this 12-year-old animation studio and is its chief executive, is famous for hyperbole. Wall Street took him to task in 2005, saying he overhyped ''Madagascar.'' More recently, he has heralded new 3-D effects used in his movies as a transformative moment for cinema, akin to the introduction of sound. 
 This time, however, he might have a point.
 With its two movies for 2008, ''Kung Fu Panda'' and ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,'' DreamWorks had two of the 10 best-selling movies of the year, generating $1.2 billion in global ticket sales -- an 11 percent increase from the two-film slate it released in 2007. The well-reviewed ''Kung Fu Panda'' was crucial, becoming a third franchise for the company, along with ''Shrek'' and ''Madagascar,'' and indicating that Mr. Katzenberg's new quality-control measures were working. And hopes are high for ''Monsters vs. Aliens,'' a 3-D film that will open next month.
 Moreover, DreamWorks Animation has begun the biggest expansion in its history. A television arm sprouted in recent months, with series built around ''Madagascar'' and ''Kung Fu Panda'' coming to Nickelodeon. ''Shrek the Musical'' opened on Broadway late last year. Theme parks are moving forward in Dubai and Singapore. And the company is making an all-or-nothing charge into 3-D movies, which could add $80 million in profit to a ''Shrek''-size hit because of premium ticket prices. Every DreamWorks film from now on will be in 3-D.
 Still, all of this growth is coming at a time when bigger is not viewed as better among media investors, creating a tough balancing act for Mr. Katzenberg. Indeed, the company, long marginalized as a minor-league player, has started to grab attention on Wall Street for the same reason it was long neglected: its relatively tiny size. 
 AT a time of economic upheaval, DreamWorks Animation, with its output of only two ''event'' movies a year, is not burdened with the same problems as its deep-pocketed, highly diversified media rivals. (In 2004, DreamWorks Animation split from what the industry often calls ''Big DreamWorks,'' the live action studio more officially called DreamWorks SKG, which is home to Steven Spielberg. DreamWorks Animation later went public.)
 The Walt Disney Company, for instance, is weighed down by ABC and its theme parks. Others, like Time Warner and the News Corporation, have atrophying publishing units. Viacom relies on crumbling cable television advertising sales. Even Big DreamWorks is struggling, with Mr. Spielberg pursuing a distribution deal with Disney and making a personal loan to cover costs while he seeks more outside investors.
 Indeed, shares of DreamWorks Animation have held up relatively well over the last year, down just 8 percent, largely because of its niche focus. At the same time, News Corporation stock has lost 65 percent of its value and the overall market has fallen 35 percent.
 But Mr. Katzenberg isn't satisfied, and he sees growth -- done in a very specific way -- as the antidote. Executing growth while not alienating the smaller-is-better crowd will be difficult, in large part because investors no longer care much about long-term strategy. Many hesitate to make big bets on any company, given the depressed economy, and entertainment companies in particular have been rocked by shifts in technology and consumer preferences.
 ''In this market, all investors care about is what's happening right this minute,'' said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities.
 Mr. Katzenberg sees his solid position at a time of huge upheaval as an opportunity to strike, to grow while his rivals are shrinking. ''I see almost no risk to anything we are doing,'' he said.
 The theme parks are essentially large licensing deals, he said, so the company doesn't have to put in any money or operate the parks. The television production unit can generate DVD sales and help keep DreamWorks Animation characters in front of consumers between movies. (Nickelodeon will also put a big consumer products push behind ''The Penguins of Madagascar,'' a spin-off of the penguin characters from the movie, splitting revenue 50-50 with the studio.) The additional cost for making a film in 3-D is only about $15 million, he said.
 DreamWorks puts the cost of ''Shrek the Musical'' at about $25 million -- a budgetary speck compared with the $160 million movies it makes, although marketing and weekly production costs are adding up quickly and ticket sales have slipped. ''Broadway is the most risky but it could return the most,'' he said. 
 One reason Mr. Katzenberg is consumed with raising his share price, friends and colleagues say, is that his archrival, Pixar Animation Studios, sold for $8 billion to Disney two years ago. Discounting the premium Disney paid, that's about three times the value of his company in the marketplace, even though Pixar in the past delivered only one movie a year.
 Mr. Katzenberg declined to comment on Pixar's valuation. But he did say that, in a head-to-head comparison over the last four years, DreamWorks Animation movies outperformed Pixar-Disney releases by more than $1.6 billion at the global box office, according to statistics compiled by his investor relations department. (Other studios say it is more like $1.4 billion.)
 While pleased that Mr. Katzenberg is so devoted, some investors and analysts worry that he is pursuing new businesses because he is more of a bigwig than perhaps DreamWorks needs. With such an intense focus on his work -- it's not unusual for him to book three business breakfasts back to back -- shouldn't this guy be running a Microsoft or a Wal-Mart?
 He certainly appears to have more time to devote to small matters than do other industry titans, parsing the most minor details for each film. For instance, at a weekly two-hour marketing meeting at Paramount Pictures, which distributes the company's films, he routinely frets over matters like catering on press junkets and plane schedules for actors, according to Paramount employees who have attended the meeting. (The irony of this attention to detail is lost on few in Hollywood, where Mr. Katzenberg's brawls with his micromanaging former boss, Michael D. Eisner, were legend.)
 Others worry that the company lacks executives with enough heft to step in should Mr. Katzenberg become sidelined, a worry that grew more pronounced when David Geffen announced his retirement from the movie business last December, stepping down from the DreamWorks Animation board. (Mr. Katzenberg told analysts in a conference call at the time that Mr. Geffen, who retains stock giving him voting power of 22.2 percent, remained the company's ''guardian angel.'')
 Mr. Katzenberg's contract -- under which he notably is paid $1 a year at his own insistence -- expires on Oct. 27. He said he planned to stay put. ''I can focus on the small things because I'm not juggling 500 plates,'' he said, adding, ''There has never been a day over the last 12 years when I thought, 'What elsecould I be doing?' ''
 Bill Damaschke, the company's co-president for production, allows that his boss is ''a force,'' but said the outside perception that Mr. Katzenberg is DreamWorks Animation's sole creative star -- as contrasted with Pixar's stable of prominent directors -- is grossly unfair.
 ''The way this studio nurtures talent is one of the things I am most proud about,'' Mr. Damaschke said, adding that DreamWorks tends to promote the celebrities who lend their voices to its movies -- Cameron Diaz, Jack Black -- while Pixar spends more time promoting its directors. 
 Mr. Damaschke has recently taken on a higher profile, leading the Broadway effort. Additional evidence of the company's bench of talent, a studio spokesman said, came at the International Animated Film Society Awards in late January. DreamWorks took home 15 ''Annies,'' including best picture for ''Kung Fu Panda.'' Disney-Pixar won one Annie Award. 
 Exhibit A of Mr. Katzenberg's newfound corporate footing was a recent investor conference in Manhattan. It was the company's first such analyst day, though not its first attempt at staging one.
 In 2006, the company badly botched a similar event when it invited, and then uninvited, analysts to an investor meeting and tour of its Glendale facility. DreamWorks Animation lawyers had suddenly realized that the company should have been in a quiet period because it was planning a secondary stock offering.
 This time, investors were impressed, particularly when it came to ''Monsters vs. Aliens,'' the first of Mr. Katzenberg's new 3-D behemoths. After viewing clips of it, UBS raised its worldwide box office estimate 10 percent, to $450 million, which would make it the best-ever release in March that was not a sequel.
 But to Mr. Katzenberg's frustration, the company's stock saw no lasting bump. In fact, UBS subsequently downgraded the company, citing softness in the broader DVD market. ''It makes it very hard to recommend the stock when questions of consistency still linger,'' said Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen & Company.
 INVESTORS have reason to be cautious about the TV and Broadway plans in particular.
 DreamWorks Animation's last attempt at a TV series, ''Father of the Pride,'' was a disaster. This half-hour animated show, based on Siegfried & Roy -- Mr. Katzenberg came up with the idea after seeing the Las Vegas act a dozen times over the years -- cost about $2.5 million an episode to produce, at that point one of the most expensive TV comedies in history. But ratings nose-dived and NBC quickly yanked the show from its schedule.
 This time, Mr. Katzenberg points out that the company is building its television efforts around established franchises and teaming with a distributor, Nickelodeon, that knows its way around animated series. Production is also under way on a flotilla of low-risk television specials. (Think ''Madagascar Santa.'')
 ''Shrek the Musical,'' meanwhile, ran directly into the buzz saw of the economic downturn, with a dozen Broadway shows closing in the weeks after it opened. Ticket sales for ''Shrek'' have been weak: for the week ending Jan. 25, ''Shrek'' ranked 10th out of 22 Broadway productions in terms of box office, a poor showing for such an expensive production. Mr. Katzenberg says the company is in it for the long haul and is hopeful that a flurry of coming television promotions and the release of the cast album will improve sales. ''I'm optimistic that it will still work,'' he said.
 The DVD market is a big worry, particularly because the company's profits are so tied to the business. After years of blockbuster growth, DVD sales slumped badly in the fourth quarter because of the downturn and increasing home entertainment options, with some new releases falling 20 percent below expectations and sales over all down about 9 percent compared with the year earlier, according to Adams Media Research. 
 The good news for DreamWorks is that family movies are holding up better than other categories -- ''Shrek'' is still an awfully tempting baby sitter -- and the company's push into 3-D should help control piracy of its titles. (Most pirated DVDs are created by people sitting in the back of theaters with camcorders that won't work with 3-D.) 
 The company is also focusing more intently on creating premium DVD packages. For instance, DreamWorks released a ''Kung Fu Panda'' DVD set that retailed for $21, versus $16 for the movie DVD alone, because it included a second short film, ''Secrets of the Furious Five,'' that explained more of the back story. Mr. Katzenberg said 30 percent of ''Kung Fu Panda'' DVDs sold in the premium-priced sets. 
 Investors, meanwhile, are still chewing over the company's past difficulties with quality. Mr. Katzenberg has openly conceded that certain films -- ''Shark Tale'' in 2004, for instance -- were rushed to market, and it showed.
 But the company says those days are behind it. Animators spent four and a half years working on ''Kung Fu Panda,'' which won critical raves, versus three years for ''Shark Tale.'' The ''Madagascar'' sequel also had better reviews than the original.
 ''Simply being a computer-animated movie is not enough anymore; it's not special in and of itself,'' Mr. Damaschke said, referring to the growing number of computer-generated releases. ''We know our movies have to be the coolest movies out there to be successful.''
 IN the near term, attention will focus on ''Monsters vs. Aliens,'' the story of a top-secret squad of monsters unleashed by the United States government to halt an alien invasion. The monsters are playfully based on cheesy old horror movies.
 As usual, DreamWorks is spending lavishly on marketing. During the Super Bowl alone, the company spent an estimated $5 million to stage a flashy 3-D commercial. The stunt may have succeeded in putting ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' in front of 95 million people, but it didn't ignite much immediate buzz. Afterward, the talk was about ads for Doritos and CareerBuilder, and an informal MovieTickets.com poll showed that more people had remembered ads for ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'' (83 percent of viewers polled) and ''Star Trek'' (79 percent). About 78 percent remembered seeing the ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' trailer. 
 On the other hand, only 48 percent of those polled remembered the Super Bowl spot for ''Up,'' the next film from Pixar. 
 Mr. Katzenberg, digging into a second taco, predicted before the Super Bowl that the response to his commercial would be mixed, given the technological inadequacies of television. But he was certain that audiences would respond positively to the film. ''Comparing the 3-D of the past to this,'' he said, ''is like comparing a Razor scooter to a Ferrari.''

HEADLINE: There's No Short Selling in Baseball

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
We must believe in spring, especially as the economy tanks through the winter. That will not be easy, though, as fiscal gloom already intrudes onto the escapists' fields of play before baseball's opening day. 
 Fed by taxpayer fury, politicians are demanding a name change for the New York Mets' gleaming new stadium to something other than ''Citi Field.'' It is already emblazoned all over the park under the 20-year, $400 million contract with the Mets that Citigroup signed in better days, before it had to tap taxpayers (and Met fans) for $45 billion in bailout support. 
 There are reports the bank may want to chip its name from the Mets' park, fearing endless negative publicity in neon. (Imagine trudging out after a hard loss through that exit announcing ''Citi Field:'' Oh yeah, Beltran just struck out, and here are the bonus bankers who plan to cut 52,000 jobs.) It denies it wants out, and insists the bailout money will not be used to pay the Mets, as if Wall Street has foul lines.
 Money is money, as fans who are facing higher prices to get into the new park know so well. More crucially, people escape to the game to contemplate the repaired Mets bullpen, not the fungibility of TARP funds. Come to think of it, if politicians want to restrict banks from using taxpayer aid at the ballpark, how about also blocking the banks from using it for their influential donations to politicians' campaign kitties? 
 Sorry, that is exactly the sort of subprime woolgathering to be avoided at the ballgame. The Wilpon family, which owns the Mets, wants fans to have a good time and forget about all that fiscal stuff lurking out beyond the home-run walls. Yes, but the Wilpons, aren't they ... Friends of Bernie?
 Court papers detailing Bernard Madoff's $50 billion Ponzi scheme disclosed 13 Mets accounts and principals among the several thousand who are said to be victims. So the task only grows to somehow forget both Citi and Bernie at the first crack of the bat. One of the Wilpons offered reassurance that the Mets have resources enough to survive any Madoff mistakes. ''We have other money from outside of this, from diversity,'' was the comfort extended to baseball reporters. O.K., O.K., Play ball.

HEADLINE: Building on the Abs of Madonna and Gwyneth

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
THIS is the woman responsible for Madonna's arms.
 Tracy Anderson pulls down on resistant elastic bands strung across the ceiling; dances around the room; endlessly circles her arms. She moves her torso back and forth and sideways to strengthen the abdominals, and then lies on her -- of course -- taut belly for a series of butt-toning leg lifts. 
 To spend an hour working out with Ms. Anderson, with an iPod blasting and the heat cranked up, is to get a taste of what it's like to prepare for a grueling concert tour, striving for that sinewy muscle tone. Or so you can tell yourself. Maybe this is how it feels to sweat like Gwyneth Paltrow, bopping around your blond-wood home gym in the Hamptons, losing the pregnancy pounds with Ms. Anderson's mat exercises and dance routines. ''You really are how you move,'' Ms. Anderson said.
 Ms. Anderson, 33, worked out with a reporter recently in a rented space in Midtown, demonstrating her signature muscle strengthening and cardio dancing, which have won her two devoted clients in Madonna and Ms. Paltrow. With those celebrity names lofting her reputation, she is preparing to open a high-end $900-a-month workout studio in TriBeCa. 
 But those who join probably won't be grunting and lunging alongside Ms. Paltrow or Madonna -- Ms. Anderson trains them privately -- and her employees will lead most workouts, not her. 
 Looking as if she subsists on birdseed, the pixie-ish trainer said she actually has ''a big appetite.'' (Don't all thin people say that?) She is partial to cupcakes -- anything with butter cream frosting -- and, while she is now very mindful of nutrition, maintains that when she started out in the fitness business she was still a junk-food junkie, dunking Oreo cookies in containers of Pillsbury icing. ''I was kind of like a doctor who smoked,'' Ms. Anderson said.
 It was about three years ago, while running a studio in Los Angeles, that Ms. Anderson came to the attention of Ms. Paltrow, who then told her friend Madonna. Now the bulk of Ms. Anderson's time is devoted to the two stars: she essentially moves in with one, depending on whose career is in higher gear, while working with the other through video chats and custom DVDs, or by dispatching one of her associate trainers. 
 When Madonna was preparing for her ''Sticky and Sweet'' tour last year, for example, Ms. Anderson lived with her for nine months and then accompanied her on the road. Last summer, she trained Madonna during the day in Manhattan and took the train almost every day to the Hamptons to put Ms. Paltrow through a workout in the evening.
 ''Tracy Anderson is my savior,'' Madonna said in an e-mail message. ''After two Caesareans, three hernia operations and one riding accident that left me with 10 broken bones, she was the only one who could pull my body back together into one piece.''
 Both Ms. Paltrow and Madonna have publicly testified to Ms. Anderson's results on her DVDs and in magazine articles. Ms. Paltrow is also a partner in Ms. Anderson's new 4,700-square-foot studio on Greenwich Street, which is to open in mid-March. 
 ''It's fun because it's not like you're running mindlessly on a treadmill,'' Ms. Paltrow said. ''I guess she learned how to make the muscles do certain things -- it actually works. It's not like you're chasing this dream.''
 People with limited finances may have to keep on chasing. In addition to the monthly dues at the new studio, members must pay an initiation fee of $787.50 for six months or $1,500 for a year. Ms. Anderson's publicist, Julia Cuddihy Van Nice, said that ''the studio is not disclosing any numbers'' but that the response has been positive.
 CHARTER members -- the first 150 people who commit to a year and pay three months up front -- will receive a 30-minute consultation with Ms. Anderson. The other members will work out with her staff. Or you can spend $29.95 to watch Ms. Anderson on one of her three DVDs available on her Web site, tracyandersonmethod.com. 
 Whether this kind of a niche workout studio can succeed in the current economy remains to be seen. Big gyms like Equinox and Reebok (where membership is $215 a month with a $1,200 initiation fee) are hustling for new members. And people who join Ms. Anderson's studio might come with outsize expectations: counting on looking like Madonna or Ms. Paltrow, when those stars are putting in two hours a day, six days a week and have Ms. Anderson personally pushing them to do yet another set of crunches or one more cardio routine.
 Ms. Anderson is well aware that she lucked out in being catapulted to prominence by two such high-profile clients. ''It's been a dream, for sure,'' she said. But she had her dose of struggles along the way. She was forced to close her first studio in her home state, Indiana, because of the financial mismanagement of a business partner, according to her Web site. 
 Ms. Anderson may weigh 90-something now, but at age 19, she was 40 pounds overweight and couldn't slim down, she said. She had just come to New York from Noblesville, Ind., to be a dancer, studying at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. 
 Later, at 23, she struggled with baby weight after giving birth to a son, Sam, now 10. (Ms. Anderson and Sam's father, Eric Anderson -- formerly of the New York Knicks -- are separated but still live together.) 
 Her frustration at being unable to get back into shape prompted her to develop her own workout program. She studied the bodies of swimmers, volleyball players and classical dancers and sought to emulate Jane Fonda, for her hybrid videos of dance and aerobics. ''She was absolutely dead-on,'' Ms. Anderson said of Ms. Fonda. ''You never saw her lifting crazy big weights.''
 Ms. Anderson's method involves focusing on accessory, or smaller, muscles and varying moves so that the body continues to be challenged. Her New Band System has eight elastic bands with different degrees of resistance that she uses for arm strengthening; her Hybrid Body Reformer -- much like the machine used in Pilates -- has a pulley system that works muscles from different angles. This equipment is not available to people exercising at home. 
 She said a woman should never lift more than three-pound weights. ''Most gym programs overwork major muscle groups,'' she said. ''Repetition builds and bulks muscles.''
 Not all fitness experts agree. ''Once a person adapts to the light weight, they will not gain strength,'' said Dr. Michele Olson, a professor of exercise science at Auburn University. ''We should alternate between doing heavy weights with lower reps and lighter weights with high reps if we want our bodies to rest and continue to improve. But, there is no one single approach to exercise that can do everything.''
 Charles B. Corbin, an emeritus professor in the department of exercise and wellness at Arizona State University, has seen one of Ms. Anderson's videos and questions her emphasis. ''Very high volume programs such as the ones on the video -- with very difficult muscle fitness and flexibility exercises -- are not for everyone,'' he said. ''In fact, for many, they can cause more harm than good'' because of the possibility of muscle fatigue and injury.
 Time will tell whether Ms. Anderson's method ultimately works for an audience bigger than two celebrities. On her DVDs, she demonstrates everything, but she does not give much verbal instruction, so it can be difficult to tell exactly what she's doing and whether a home exerciser is following correctly. 
 Just when you think you've nailed one of her dance combinations, the camera shifts from a full view to just her legs. You can lose track of the sequence and what comes next. And her counts for the mat exercises are all over the map -- she lifts her leg back 32 times on the right side, then 26 on the left; does 23 back leg lifts on the right, then 37 on the left, and so on.
 Jessica Matthews, the continuing education coordinator for the American Council on Exercise, said consistency in repetitions is important. ''We want to make sure the muscles of the body stay balanced,'' she said. ''We should be doing the same number on each side.''
 Asked about this later, Ms. Anderson wrote in an e-mail message: ''Ha ha!! I am famous for my horrible counting! Don't worry the results will be the same!!''

HEADLINE: Serving Since 1955, A House Institution

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
America's new president has collided with this old reality: Washington likes some kinds of change more than others.
Consider the institution that is Representative John D. Dingell, a Democrat who has represented Detroit since 1955 and who this week becomes the longest-serving House member in history.
Mr. Dingell applauds President Obama's drive to expand health care coverage, a cause that he and his congressman father before him have championed since Franklin D. Roosevelt occupied the Oval Office. He has less interest in Mr. Obama's quest to purify the political processes of Pennsylvania Avenue, which last week helped trip up the administration's choice to lead health care reform. 
''I'm not one who thinks Washington is an evil place,'' Mr. Dingell said in his suite at the Rayburn House Office Building. ''Bad people do bad things here, but they do them everywhere.''
Rather than trying to change the capital, Mr. Dingell concluded, Mr. Obama stands the greatest chance of succeeding ''if he were to try to make substantive change that would help people.''
Change in the Capital
Washington has changed plenty since Mr. Dingell succeeded his late father in 1955. Congress was comparatively tiny (the younger Mr. Dingell had a single staff member) and was more focused on life in the capital (the 12-hour train ride back to Detroit deterred frequent visits).
A signal change of the past half-century is the growth in both government and Washington's influence industry, which Mr. Obama has now vowed to curb. Mr. Dingell believes that post-Watergate reforms have already proved reasonably effective.
''We're really not doing too bad on process,'' Mr. Dingell said, citing the news media's watchdog role and the ethics disclosures that lawmakers make each year. ''If I lie about it, I've got big trouble.''
More troublesome for Mr. Dingell has been the long-term trend toward ideological polarization, making the Democratic Party less hospitable for members with socially conservative views, like his support for gun rights. When redistricting pitted him against the more liberal Representative Lynn Rivers in a 2002 primary, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California sent $10,000 to Ms. Rivers.
Mr. Dingell survived. But like colleagues in both parties, he has chafed under Ms. Pelosi's speakership at the centralization of decision-making within the House leadership. ''It started under Gingrich,'' he said, ''and it continues today.''
Moreover, the once-mighty seniority system failed to protect his chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce Committee against an intraparty challenge late last year. Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, promising a more energetic advocacy of Mr. Obama's agenda, prevailed in the Democratic caucus over an older rival who had helped enact Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society agenda.
''The curse of this business is that they'll primarily remember you for how long you were here, rather than for what you did,'' Mr. Dingell said. But even now, he added, ''I can do things whether I'm a chairman or not.''
An 11th President
Mr. Obama, born six years after Mr. Dingell entered the House, is the 11th president he has served under. The ''terrifying challenges'' Mr. Obama faces, Mr. Dingell said, may rival those that Roosevelt and John Dingell Sr. confronted when they arrived in Washington after the 1932 election.
Mr. Dingell waved off pundits' conclusions that last week's delay in the economic stimulus legislation reflects miscues by the young chief executive. ''The Senate is the home of trouble for legislation,'' he said. ''I'm impressed with the job he has done.''
Some House liberals still fear that Mr. Dingell, an inveterate champion of the domestic auto industry, will impede Mr. Obama's push to undo America's dependence on fossil fuels. Yet he is an unequivocal ally on expanding health care coverage, a cause his father embraced beginning in 1943.
''The fact that you've been here doesn't mean you're not for change,'' he said. That is why he was dismayed by Tom Daschle's withdrawal as the nominee to become health and human services secretary, which occurred amid a furor over his previously unpaid taxes and the wealth he amassed after leaving office as the Senate majority leader.
''My judgment is it's going to be a substantial blow'' to chances for health care reform, Mr. Dingell said. ''It's going to hurt my efforts.''
But at age 82 he presses on, seeking gains where he can find them. Cane in hand, he left an interview to head to the White House, where Mr. Obama signed legislation extending health insurance for seven million children and making an additional four million eligible.
''Eleven million,'' Mr. Dingell said with a smile. ''It's a nice round number, isn't it?''

HEADLINE: A Roll of the Dice on a Shabby Downtown

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
Travel north on the Strip, past the glittering islands of the Bellagio, Excalibur, Venetian and other resorts, and -- keep going -- it finally appears like a worn-out showgirl at the end of a parade: downtown.
 Here, Binion's, Main Street Station, Four Queens and other casinos -- ''vintage Las Vegas,'' as downtown's promoters like to call it -- beckon the budget-conscious amid wedding chapels, older bars, check-cashing stores and a few newer attractions like an outlet mall. 
 But Mayor Oscar B. Goodman of Las Vegas is determined to give the area a face-lift, and not even a recession will stand in his way. Let the rest of municipal America tighten belts and hunker down. Mr. Goodman, a former mob lawyer whose outsize personality leads him to offer poker chips as business cards, says it is time for the city to join forces with private developers for a project he promotes as a linchpin to downtown's revival. 
 The project would include a new city hall (never mind that the existing one, built in 1973, has an addition only six years old), a casino resort (the first in downtown in some three decades) and office, residential and commercial space (because, the developers of this project assert, the eventual economic recovery will create demand for it).
 The plan includes a complicated land swap and a lease-back arrangement -- ''a college football parlay card, in which everything has to fall into place,'' The Las Vegas Review-Journal said in an editorial. For taxpayers, the bottom line could mean borrowing $150 million to $267 million, with tax revenue from new development paying it back over time.
 Mr. Goodman insists that the project is a sure bet, even as other large developments on the Strip and elsewhere are being scaled back or postponed.
 ''I think we would be cheating our future if we stopped projects because of tough economic times,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''During the Great Depression, three buildings were built in New York City: the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and Rockefeller Center.''
 Mr. Goodman's chutzpah has long received notice even in a town where over-the-top is the norm. He thought little of suggesting that federal stimulus dollars help finance a planned museum -- downtown, of course -- commemorating the mob's role in building up Las Vegas. (After Washington whacked the idea, he said he wanted to use city money earmarked for sewers.)
 But while the city hall project has sailed through the City Council, it is confronting unusually stiff resistance from one of Nevada's most powerful unions, Culinary Local 226.
 The union, which has 55,000 members, calls the proposal ill-advised in hard economic times, when thousands of people have been laid off from casinos that have suffered declines in attendance and gambling revenue. It has collected enough signatures to place two measures on the ballot in June intended to block the plan and give voters a greater say in redevelopment.
 Mr. Goodman, who predicts that the project could yield more than 13,000 jobs, fires back that the union is merely pressuring the developer for a favorable labor contract.
 Both sides promise a vigorous fight over a proposal that even some of Mr. Goodman's supporters question.
 ''Right now might not be the best time,'' said Tracey Horowitz, a Las Vegas glass artist who sometimes sells her pieces downtown. ''It would be a great plan for two or three years ago when things were going great,'' said Ms. Horowitz, who calls herself a fan of the mayor.
 But the plan also has its supporters, like Chris Watkins, a Las Vegas construction worker who has not found steady work for two years.
 ''It sounds like it means more jobs for people like me,'' said Mr. Watkins, who was walking on Fremont Street, where marketers five years ago installed a giant lighted canopy over several blocks to give it more pizzazz.
 Jon Ralston, a columnist for The Las Vegas Sun and other publications who has covered the political scene here for more than two decades, said the fight included the classic Vegas ingredients of land use, casinos and a mayor, in his third term, who is accustomed to getting his way.
 ''Oscar Goodman thinks this is a watershed moment in his career,'' he said. ''This would be a crushing defeat in his political career. And the union is pushing this thing to the max. They are going all out on this.''
 Las Vegas is running out of room to grow within its city limits; most of the Strip is in Clark County territory, not the city, and some of the more viable remaining tracts are downtown.
 The downtown casinos have, however, never matched the allure of the Strip or its gambling and hotel revenue, and the area, though popular with some locals, has long struggled with crime and blight.
 David G. Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said Indian casinos in California and other places had also taken a toll, offering a cheap alternative closer to home for many gamblers not enticed by the resort experience. 
 ''It has been hit harder by Indian gaming than the Strip,'' said Mr. Schwartz, author of a book on the growth of the Strip, ''Suburban Xanadu.'' ''If somebody is flying out for a weekend of gambling from New York, they are probably not thinking of going to an Indian casino in San Diego. But if somebody in L.A. is thinking of playing blackjack they can drive an hour or so rather than stay in downtown Las Vegas.'' 
 Under the plan, the development group LiveWork Las Vegas/Forest City would build the new city hall at First Street and Clark Avenue, lease it back to the city and swap the land underneath for a 6.4-acre property at Union Park, a large mixed-use complex being developed with another partner that will include a concert hall, space for medical research and other components. There, the development group would build a 47-story, 1,000-room high-end casino hotel.
 The land under the existing city hall could be paired with an adjacent lot for 20 acres of developable space, perhaps for an arena to lure a professional sports team, which the mayor has long sought.
 ''Half the people who come to visit come downtown,'' Mr. Goodman said, sitting in his 10th-floor office in the building he wants to implode. ''The trick is to keep them downtown and spending downtown.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 11, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The Las Vegas Journal article on Monday, about efforts to revitalize the city's downtown, referred incorrectly to the financing for a new museum about the mob. The city sought money through sewer fees before -- not after -- it failed to get federal stimulus money. The article also misstated the year a lighted canopy was installed over Fremont Street. It was in 1995, not ''five years ago.''

 EX-IRANIAN PRESIDENT, A REFORMER, ANNOUNCES HE WILL RUN AGAIN
 Former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who favored easing tensions with the West and broadening social and political freedoms at home, said he would run for president. He has broad support and would pose a serious challenge in the June elections to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose aides have said he will seek re-election. PAGE A5 
 ATTACK RESTARTS INDIAN CULTURE WAR
 A mob attack by an obscure Hindu group on women drinking in a bar set off the latest battle in the Indian culture wars. It is unclear if anyone was seriously hurt, but the attack exposed the limits of freedom for young Indian women. It also uncorked a national debate over moral policing (including two weeks of shouting matches on television talk shows). Politicians have also jumped into the fray. PAGE A5 
 AN EX-BAATHIST IN SHIITE COUNTRY
 In the recent provincial elections in Iraq, Majid al-Habboubi, a secularist with government experience and a former Baath Party member, won more votes than the candidates of the religious parties that have controlled Karbala Province, and he defeated the central government's preferred candidates. That is surprising considering that Karbala is dominated by religious Shiites who suffered under Saddam Hussein's Baathist rule. PAGE A6

 On Revitalizing City's Downtown
 Mayor Oscar B. Goodman of Las Vegas wants to revamp the city's aging, much-overlooked downtown.

 Comparing Congress's Two Bills
 Congressional aides were trying to identify differences between the House and Senate economic stimulus packages in advance of final negotiations scheduled to begin after the Senate's expected approval. The Senate version of the plan would cost $827 billion, the House bill about $819 billion. Congressional leaders hope to deliver legislation to President Obama by next Monday. PAGE A11
 A BIG (AND COSTLY) QUESTION
 No one has put a price tag on how much the attempt to plug the hole in the nation's financial system will cost. But it will almost certainly entail a far bigger commitment of taxpayer dollars than the $350 billion left from last year's $700 billion bank bailout program, and probably far more than the stimulus package. But many wonder: will it even work? PAGE A11

HEADLINE: No Welfare, No Work

 BODY:
Unemployment has been increasing sharply, but so far state welfare programs do not seem to be rising to the challenge. Despite the desperate economic times, the number of people receiving cash assistance is at or near a four-decade low. Welfare is a popular political target, but it is also often the last thing standing between poor people -- many of them children -- and destitution. States and the federal government need to do more to ensure that Americans get the help they need. 
 The welfare reform of 1996 ended the idea of welfare as an entitlement. Federal funds were sent as block grants to the states, which were given more discretion over how to spend the money.
 The new model included work requirements and limits on how many years people could receive benefits. With the economy strong, the reforms succeeded in moving many people off the rolls and employment rose. Today, there are few jobs available for people on the rolls to be moved into. Welfare programs should be expanding, but as Jason DeParle recently reported in The Times, they often have not been. 
 Michigan, whose unemployment rate last October was over 9 percent, cut its welfare rolls 13 percent last year. Of the 12 states where unemployment increased most, eight had welfare rolls that held steady or declined.
 The states clamored for the increased discretion. Now, in the worst economic times since the reforms passed, they need to use that discretion appropriately. They should be removing overly onerous obstacles to receiving benefits, rolling back work requirements, and doing better outreach to people in need of assistance.
 The federal government also has to do more. The stimulus plan pending in Congress may make much-needed matching grants available to states that expand their welfare programs. That would be a good start, but Congress should look for other ways to prod states to provide adequate benefits to their neediest residents. 
 It should also expand unemployment insurance so states can cover jobless part-time workers, another sizeable group of people falling through the cracks.
 Ever since Ronald Reagan gleefully campaigned against ''welfare queens,'' welfare has been on the political defensive. The truth is, there will always be people who need to rely on welfare, especially when the economy takes a grim turn. Civilized societies make sure that when people are in desperate need of help, the money is there to take care of them.

HEADLINE: Resilient Strategy for Times Despite Toll of a Recession

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
In a conference call with analysts late last month, Janet L. Robinson, the president and chief executive of TheNew York Times Company, laid out a vision of how the company would survive the downturn that is crippling the newspaper industry. 
 ''As other newspapers cut back on international and national coverage, or cease operations, we believe there will be opportunities for The Times to fill that void,'' she said, for both readers and advertisers.
 But before it can execute what the industry regards as a ''last-man-standing'' strategy, the company has to get there first.
 Unlike much of the industry, the Times Company, which publishes The New York Times, The Boston Globe and The International Herald Tribune, does not carry the kind of crushing debt burden that has led other publishers to default or file for bankruptcy, and it has fared better than most of its peers at holding on to revenue from ads and circulation. 
 But the company reported last month that its newspaper ad revenue fell 14.2 percent in 2008, for a drop of 19.5 percent in the last two years; industrywide, the declines were about 16 percent and 23 percent.
 And unlike almost every other major paper in the country, the flagship Times newspaper has not significantly reduced the size of its newsroom or the content of its pages; its newsroom staff of almost 1,300 people and budget of well over $200 million are easily the largest in the country.
 And perhaps more so than other newspapers, The Times has made a long-term bet on the digital future, integrating its print newsroom with the Web, adding blogs like DealBook and City Room, slide shows and videos, even taking on Wikipedia with its Times Topics pages. The bet was that Internet ads would keep growing fast enough to eventually outweigh the erosion of ink-and-paper revenue. 
 But that bet is still up in the air. The company's digital revenue has leveled off after years of torrid growth -- it actually declined slightly in the fourth quarter -- and it remains just 12 percent of all revenue. And no one is sure of the trajectory for either print or digital ads once the economy recovers.
 The drop-off in ad revenue both online and in print has put a squeeze on the company's cash flow. As a result, the Times Company has been looking to raise money by trying to sell its stake in the Boston Red Sox and arranging a sale-leaseback of its new headquarters building. 
 It slashed its stock dividend by almost three-quarters, and last month, it agreed to borrow $250 million on punishing terms, including an interest rate above 14 percent, from Carlos Slim Helu, a billionaire from Mexico. 
 Newspaper industry analysts say that despite some published alarms to the contrary, the company has positioned itself well to ride out another year of recession, maybe two. The company still operates at a profit, and analysts say it might have gotten by without the Slim loan, but could not afford to take the risk because borrowing could be even harder in six months or a year.
 ''But,'' said Edward Atorino, an analyst at Benchmark, a research firm, ''I think they've put The New York Times out of danger.''
 And there is a feeling among analysts that there is merit to the last-man-standing strategy.
 ''For most newspapers, we view a flattening-out'' of revenue in 2010 or 2011, said Mike Simonton, senior director at Fitch Ratings, ''but it's very murky.''
 By then, he said, ''there could be dramatically fewer newspapers,'' leaving those that remain in a stronger position to compete for readers and ads. ''And then The New York Times should be a survivor.''
 Ms. Robinson; Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the company chairman and publisher of The Times; and other executives declined to be interviewed to discuss the company's track record.
 One of the company's two revolving credit accounts will expire in May, with no realistic prospect of renewal, reducing its capacity for short-term borrowing to $400 million. The company already owes $380 million on the two accounts, leaving little room to maneuver. It also has a $99 million payment on longer-term debt due in November, and $250 million in March 2010.
 Money raised through a sale-leaseback and Mr. Slim's loan are intended to help make those payments and pay down the revolving credit. But the company has also made a long chain of decisions that depleted its cash. Analysts who follow the company for the capital markets say that some of those moves look right even in hindsight, and others seemed right at the time. 
 Under that sale-leaseback deal, the Times Company would sell the 19 floors it uses in the building but not the six floors it leases to other tenants. The Times Company would still occupy and manage its floors and would have the right to buy back the space at a predetermined price when a 10-year lease expired. 
 ''Their decisions probably would have been very different if they had expected this type of revenue environment, but I don't think anybody did,'' said John Puchalla, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service.
 The company's clearest and biggest mistake, analysts say, was spending $2.7 billion to buy back its own stock from 1998 to 2004, despite historic high prices. That figure is more than three times the company's current market capitalization, it outweighs the prices of all the other second-guessed moves combined, and it would be more than enough to ensure the company's security for years to come. 
 Six years ago, the company paid $65 million for the half of The International Herald Tribune that was owned by the Washington Post Company, taking full ownership of a money-losing paper. The Times Company does not disclose The Herald Tribune's performance, but executives say that after significant investment, it still loses money.
 In May 2007, the Times Company raised its quarterly dividend to 23 cents a share from 17.5 cents, though by then, the industry downturn had begun and the first signs of a credit crisis were rippling across the economy. Big investors applauded the move, but ''it was a difficult thing for us to swallow,'' said Mr. Puchalla, of Moody's.
 Last November, the company dropped the dividend to 6 cents. By then, the 2007 increase had cost more than $47 million.
 The biggest recent expense is the company's new Midtown Manhattan headquarters, completed in 2007. The Times spent $600 million on the building, although the true net cost of the project is perhaps half that, taking into account the money the company made on the sale of its old building, income from leasing part of the new building and other factors.
 ''It's tough to say whether the new building was a smart move at the time,'' said John Morton, an independent newspaper industry analyst. ''They certainly would be in better financial shape if they'd stayed in the old building, but how much better you can't say. And the decision looked very different then than it does now.''
 Looking ahead, revenue is expected to keep falling this year, and the company will have to keep cutting costs. Most analysts think it will have positive cash flow in 2009, but not by much.
 Beyond that, the company's future rests on questions no one can answer. When will the recession end? When it does, will the decline of print advertising slow to a modest pace? Will Internet ads make a big comeback?
 Like most publishers, the Times Company is not able to sell all of the potential ad space on its Web sites. It turns much of the remainder over to ad networks, which sell it at a small fraction of the original price. 
 The company does not disclose figures, but industry executives say that online space -- which a major newspaper could sell to an advertiser for $10 or more for every thousand readers seeing it -- often yields the paper less than $1 when sold through a network. 
 Across the Internet, ''we have a glut of unsold inventory every single day,'' said Kelly Twohig, the digital activation director at Starcom, which buys media for clients like Kellogg's and Nintendo. She said that could force major sites like NYTimes.com to cut back the online ad space they offer, to keep prices up.
 ''It's about understanding, really, the efficacy of ads, and understanding how clutter hurts and lack of clutter helps from a branding perspective,'' she said.
 Still, advertisers say that after the recession, The Times will still be an attractive vehicle for them, if perhaps a lesser one.
 Kelly Foster, the managing director of print investment at Mindshare, which plans and buys ads for clients like American Express and Kraft, said that marketers were going to be more tactical and probably would not advertise every day in a newspaper as they had in the past. 
 But, she added, ''the timeliness of newspapers is always going to be there, and there is credibility to a New York Times.''

HEADLINE: Do Medical Records Belong Online?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Your E-Health Records'' (editorial, Feb. 1):
 While it's true that patient privacy and prurient commercial objectives can disastrously collide in electronic health records, the specter of doom camouflages other issues that demand consideration.
 What about the outrageous cost of our health care system and the 45 million uninsured Americans? And the foreclosures and bankruptcy caused by medical bills? And let's not forget that an estimated 100,000 lives are lost each year because of medical errors, and that there are large discrepancies in access to quality care across economic and geographic strata. 
 Electronic health records and patient privacy are not mutually exclusive. We cannot let concerns about privacy morph into paralysis. The stimulus package's financing for electronic records will bring us technology innovation and job creation, better-educated patients, improved health outcomes and advances toward affordable personalized medicine.
 Brent Gendleman Reston, Va., Feb. 3, 2009
 The writer is president and chief executive of 5AM Solutions, a life science software consulting and development company. 
 To the Editor:
 Paper-based medical records present much greater risks to privacy than ''over-the-shoulder glimpses or the occasional lost or stolen files.'' 
 Though every provider's office has its own scandalously incomplete and idiosyncratic version of a patient's history, each has a certain -- albeit chaotic -- integrity that cannot be readily parsed. Because selecting the bits needed by another doctor or an insurer is so laborious, employees usually just send the whole thing. 
 Patients regularly, and often unknowingly, sign away their entire record.
 In a paper-based world, the fact that records are nearly indecipherable is the best guardian of patients' privacy -- though hardly of their health.
 Electronic records pose their own risks, and the most serious will not be mitigated by regulation alone, any more than the narcotics trade is suppressed by harsh drug laws. 
 Competing insurers will always find ways to discover patients' health problems and exclude them from coverage. 
 There is at least a partial solution -- to privacy as well as a host of other health care woes.
 Can you say ''single payer''? Richard Rockefeller Falmouth, Me., Feb. 1, 2009
 The writer, a doctor, is chairman of the United States advisory board for Doctors Without Borders.
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial states that $20 billion spent on e-records will lower costs and improve care by replacing cumbersome records that cannot be easily stored and transmitted. 
 The reason medical records are cumbersome is that Medicare and insurance companies have mandated that we file insanely complicated records. As for transmitting records, a medical practice typically has to transmit a tiny fraction of its records. 
 Doctors now spend almost as much time documenting as they spend examining patients. Patients complain that doctors don't look at them -- they're too busy tapping their computers. 
 If history is any indicator, money spent on e-records will make life harder for doctors and do nothing to improve care.
 A. G. Krohn White Plains, Feb. 3, 2009
 The writer is a doctor.
 To the Editor:
 The public debate about electronic health records usually fails to understand that electronic systems are often incompatible, meaning they can't talk with one another.
 If someone becomes ill in another state or on the other side of town, barriers, born from the proprietary nature of public and private health systems, keep electronic information from helping the doctor treat the patient.
 Health systems construct firewalls to protect insurers, hospitals and doctors, not patients. Privacy, of course, is important, but the Obama administration must also demand ''interoperability'' if we are to realize quality and savings from electronic records. 
 The British National Health Service has a goal of allowing all of its facilities to communicate electronically. In the United States, we still suffer from a commercially driven tower of Babel.
 John J. Frey III Madison, Wis., Feb. 1, 2009
 The writer is a professor of family medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.
 To the Editor:
 Having been in solo practice in rheumatology for 34 years, I know that it's the magician, not the wand, that provides better health care. Although I use electronic medical records in my office, I do it in a way that does not interfere with listening to patients, making eye contact and practicing medicine in the way that I was taught 40 years ago.
 It's not just privacy that's at stake. More often than not electronic records spit out boiler-plate data (often laden with errors) that get transmitted from one doctor to another completely devoid of any semblance of human interaction. 
 My vote is for the better practice of medicine, not the better use of computers.
 Matthew D. Heller Peabody, Mass., Feb. 3, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 The reason electronic records are being discussed in the first place is that so many medical errors could be detected and prevented. Paper records are often illegible, incomplete, unavailable or even unknown by the multiple clinicians who treat a patient.
 The problem is not insufficient privacy protections (many are on the books already) but the anemic rate at which doctors use this life-saving technology. Three years after the Institute of Medicine urged all doctors to eliminate medication errors by prescribing electronically, less than 10 percent have heeded the call. 
 We must ensure that no privacy proposal exposes providers who use electronic records to even more litigation and red tape.
 Mark Merritt Washington, Feb. 2, 2009
 The writer is president and chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association.

HEADLINE: For a Fragmented Market, a Smaller, Feistier Newsweek

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
When US Airways Flight 1549 glided safely onto the Hudson River last month, Newsweek did what news organizations have done for more than a century -- it sent reporters and photographers to the scene. Considerable effort yielded a modest article on Newsweek's Web site, and nothing in the printed magazine.
 If a similar episode happens six months from now, editors say, Newsweek probably will not even bother. 
 Newsweek is about to begin a major change in its identity, with a new design, a much smaller and, it hopes, more affluent readership, and some shifts in content. The venerable newsweekly's ingrained role of obligatory coverage of the week's big events will be abandoned once and for all, executives say.
 ''There's a phrase in the culture, 'we need to take note of,' 'we need to weigh in on,' '' said Newsweek's editor, Jon Meacham. ''That's going away. If we don't have something original to say, we won't. The drill of chasing the week's news to add a couple of hard-fought new details is not sustainable.''
 Newsweek loses money, and the consensus within its parent, the Washington Post Company, and among industry analysts, is that it has to try something big. The magazine is betting that the answer lies in changing both itself and its audience, and getting the audience to pay more.
 A deep-rooted part of the newsweekly culture has been to serve a mass audience, but that market has been shrinking, and new subscribers come at a high price in call centers, advertising and deeply discounted subscriptions.
 ''Mass for us is a business that doesn't work,'' said Tom Ascheim, Newsweek's chief executive. ''Wish it did, but it doesn't. We did it for a long time, successfully, but we can't anymore.''
 Thirteen months ago, Newsweek lowered its rate base, the circulation promised to advertisers, to 2.6 million from 3.1 million, and Mr. Ascheim said that would drop to 1.9 million in July, and to 1.5 million next January. 
 He says the magazine has a core of 1.2 million subscribers who are its best-educated, most avid consumers of news, and who have higher incomes than the average reader.
 ''We would like to build our business around these people and grow that group slightly,'' he said. ''These are our best customers. They are our best renewers, and they pay the most.''
 In the first half of 2008, the average Newsweek subscriber paid less than $25 a year, or 47 cents for each copy -- less than one-tenth the $4.95 newsstand price. Newsweek wants to raise that average to $50 a year, Mr. Ascheim said, adding, ''If you can't get people to pay for what they love, we're all out of business.''
 From their invention, newsweeklies have been under assault by quicker media, forcing them to ease away from the ''what,'' toward the ''how'' and ''why,'' and more recently, to ''here's what to do about it.'' For decades, the magazines evolved quickly enough to keep huge readership and healthy profits.
 But in the last couple of years, circulation and advertising have plunged, and the weeklies have cut news staffs. Time magazine, the nation's first and largest newsweekly, remains profitable, though its sales are down, too, but Newsweek is struggling and U.S. News & World Report has become a monthly.
 Editorially, Newsweek's plan calls for moving in the direction it was already headed -- toward not just analysis and commentary, but an opinionated, prescriptive or offbeat take on events. 
 The current cover article argues that America's involvement in Afghanistan parallels the Vietnam War, and a companion piece offers a plan for handling that country. Newsweek also plans to lean even more heavily on the appeal of big-name writers like Christopher Hitchens, Fareed Zakaria and George Will.
 Starting in May, articles will be reorganized under four broad, new sections -- one each for short takes, columnists and commentary, long reporting pieces like the cover articles, and culture -- each with less compulsion to touch on the week's biggest events. A new graphic feature on the last page, ''The Bluffer's Guide,'' will tell readers how to sound as if they are knowledgeable on a current topic, whether they are or not.
 The magazine will replace its thin paper with heavier stock that is more appealing to advertisers and readers. It will also put more emphasis on photography. Pages of a mock issue that Mr. Meacham displayed in his office on West 57th Street in Manhattan show a cleaner, less cluttered layout that has more open space and fewer pages that seem an uninterrupted sea of words.
 The plan turns on raising the amount, for each reader, that Newsweek can charge advertisers, and attracting more ads for luxury goods. It also promises sharply lower costs for printing, distribution, marketing and customer service.
 Newsweek executives hope they are creating a new niche, but the magazine will not have the terrain to itself. To varying degrees, it will be plying turf already worked by The Economist, The New Yorker, The Atlantic and others.
 Ad buyers to whom Newsweek gave a partial preview of its transformation said the magazine had to try something new, and that ordinarily, they would consider its plans promising. But most advertisers are cutting back, making any change more of a risk.
 ''It's no secret that there's just less money out there, so even if readers react very positively to the changes, it's a difficult time,'' said Scott Kruse, director for print investments at MediaCom US. ''The core categories in the newsweeklies have been automotive, financial, tech and pharmaceutical, and all of those are underdelivering in a major way right now. So they're going to have to bring in new advertisers from new categories, and I just wonder where all those ads are going to come from.''
 Roberta Garfinkle, senior vice president and director for print strategy at TargetCast TCM, who also got a glimpse of the new Newsweek, said, ''I give anybody credit in this difficult environment for saying, 'What we're doing doesn't work anymore and we have to change our model.' ''
 ''Do I think they're on the right track? Probably, and they're certainly on a better track than they were,'' she said. ''Will it work? We have to wait and see.''

HEADLINE: Former Winners Do Not Seem Past Their Prime

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The beagle, the colored bull terrier, the miniature poodle, the bichon frise and the English springer spaniel stood and sniffed together, a gathering of elite old-timers as estimable, dog-wise, as the first class of baseball Hall of Famers in 1936.
 Their best-in-show victories at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show started with J. R., the bichon frise, in 2001, and continued through to Uno, the beagle, last year. 
 This all-century team (minus three colleagues) acted less like retirees and more like active stars ready to trot around breed and group rings on Saturday afternoon, two days before the start of this year's show. None had grown fat from table scraps.
 Before J. R. entered the Affinia Hotel ballroom, across from Madison Square Garden, he performed a nearly lifelong task: he gnawed on the shoes his handler, Scott Sommer, wanted to wear.
 Uno, wearing the collar given to him at the White House, howled regularly, and the leather-chewing J. R. waved merrily with his front legs. James, the English springer spaniel, moved silkily while occasionally whimpering when he could not spot his co-owner Teresa Patton. 
 Rufus, the bull terrier, greeted admirers with a mellow attitude but left the Cat in the Hat costume he wears in therapy work at home in Holmdel, N.J.
 ''Lots of teenage girls and children fall in love with him,'' said Barbara Bishop, one of Rufus's co-owners. Rufus is distinctive for his triangular eyes and football-shaped head. ''These dogs are just cute. They're clowns.''
 Spice, the black poodle, held still at times -- without being asked to strike the show-ring pose -- as if flashing back to a memory of being at the Garden in 2002, awaiting the best-in-show judge's final word.
 ''Spice is being awfully good,'' said Ron Scott, her pleasantly surprised co-owner. ''She's a real dog, a real pet.''
 The gathering of best-in-show winners at a fund-raiser for Angel on a Leash, a nonprofit therapy-dog program, was the largest ever, said David Frei, Westminster's director of communications and the analyst on the show's two-night broadcast (Monday, 8-9 p.m. Eastern on USA and 9-11 on CNBC; Tuesday, 8-11 on USA).
 ''We've done three at a time once before,'' said Frei, whose new television partner is Mary Carillo. ''J. R. was there for that; he'll live forever, so he'll be here the next time.''
 At age 11, J. R., a white fluff ball with expressive black eyes, is the team's most mirthful member (and father to more than 60 champions). Spice is 10; James, 9; Rufus, 8; and Uno will be 4 on May 5.
 Each winner emerges annually from a field of about 2,500. This year, the 170th breed or variety to join the show, the dogue de Bordeaux, will compete in the working group. Also known as the French mastiff, it is the same breed as the dog that appeared in the Tom Hanks film ''Turner and Hooch.''
 Only 44 breeds have won, more than a third of them terriers. The wire fox terrier alone has won 13 times.
 One terrier, Charmin, the Sealyham who won his group last year, is ranked fifth among all dogs heading into the show, according to Dog News. A giant schnauzer, Spirit, is the nation's No. 1 dog, followed by Holly, a pointer, and Taser, an affenpinscher.
 The recession has cut entries to the show by only 30 or 40, Frei said.
 ''People cut back on activities in a hobby, and showing dogs is a hobby,'' he said. ''It's tough to afford four or five days in New York City.''
 He said that ticket sales might be down Monday.
 For Westminster, 2008 was an unusual year because it received a year's worth of publicity from Uno's Beagle Across America tour. The first of his breed to win at Westminster, Uno was a road warrior, appearing at the White House and riding the Peanuts float at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
 He appeared Friday on NBC's ''Today'' show, walked downstairs in Rockefeller Plaza to the NBC Experience store (USA and CNBC are owned by NBC Universal) and posed for pictures for two hours with fans at Saks Fifth Avenue.
 Uno's size (only 28-29 pounds); the willingness of his owner Caroline Dowell to let him travel regularly from his home on a ranch in Austin, Tex., to appearances; his easy temperament; and the popularity of beagles has kept demand for him continual.
 Kellie Fitzgerald, who guided James to the 2007 best in show title, said, ''I don't think James's owner would have sent him off with anyone else,'' as Dowell allowed Frei to travel nationwide as her Uno proxy. 
 ''He's a stud dog,'' she said. ''He had things to do.''
 James is also a therapy dog. A man who died of cancer at 20 had a picture of him with James displayed at his wake to honor the comfort the dog provided.
 ''With children, he's very interactive,'' said Patton, James's co-owner. ''But with Alzheimer's patients, he'll just sit there and be with you.'' 
 Fitzgerald said: ''He's very much in tune with what's around him. When I've watched videos of him doing therapy work, he brings me to tears.''

HEADLINE: A Less Expensive Way to Reach Sports Fans

BYLINE: By JOHN CONSOLI

 BODY:
WHILE most media companies are cutting back, Comcast SportsNet is doing the opposite. It is investing in studio improvements and new programming and revamping its Web sites.
 Ray Warren, who joined SportsNet a year ago as chief revenue officer, said his goal was to make the company's regional sports networks, in cities like New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco, ''the ESPN of local markets.'' He said that SportsNet, owned by Comcast, was bringing in more ad revenue from national advertisers than it was from local advertisers, and he wanted to get more local advertisers to consider the Comcast networks.
 Mr. Warren, who was president of Raycom Sports and more recently served in top posts at the media-buying agencies OMD and Carat, said inroads could be made with national advertisers in categories like fast food, pharmaceuticals, tourism and technology. 
 He said he hoped to persuade some advertisers currently in national pro sports broadcasts to divert money into Comcast's regional broadcasts, while also taking some dollars away from local media like other TV stations, radio and newspapers.
 ''Our ratings are good,'' Mr. Warren said. ''We need to start talking about that with advertisers.'' In 2008, household ratings for Major League Baseball game broadcasts across all 10 of SportsNet's regional networks were up 12 percent over 2007, according to Nielsen Media Research. At Comcast SportsNet Chicago, ratings for Chicago Cubs games were up 19 percent, and Chicago White Sox ratings were up 69 percent.
 At Comcast SportsNet Bay Area, ratings for the San Francisco Giants games were up 18 percent, in the team's first season without Barry Bonds.
 National Basketball Association and National Hockey League ratings were also strong last season over the season before, up 46 percent and 30 percent. And this season, N.H.L. ratings are up 64 percent so far, albeit off a lower viewer base, while N.B.A. ratings are flat.
 Ratings took a hit in some markets, among them Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic, where ratings for Washington Wizards games were down 36 percent last season. And for the Chicago unit, where baseball ratings soared, basketball slipped: Bulls games were down 19 percent.
 But SportsNet executives say they are trying to make their networks more than just places to watch games. Princell Hair, formerly general manager of CNN, joined SportsNet last summer as vice president of news operations, overseeing news, studio programming and Web sites for the 10 regional sports networks. 
 SportsNet has introduced a daily morning sports talk show in Chicago, ''Monsters in the Morning,'' from 6 to 9 a.m. with the former Chicago Bears player Dan Jiggetts and the radio talk show host Mike North. 
 ''As we look at the different markets we are in, each one has different viewer sensibilities, and we are trying to target new programming to meet those sensibilities,'' Mr. Hair said. ''ESPN has their sports talk shows nationally, and we are looking to do what they do nationally on a local level. There is room for both of us.''
 Last year, SportsNet changed its graphics, logo and music to give the regional sports networks a more contemporary look. 
 Mr. Hair said he wanted to expand beyond game broadcasts and produce more programming throughout the day. All told, the company's 10 networks produce about 10,000 hours of local programming a year.
 In addition to its own programming, SportsNet has partnerships with local media outlets. It produces live sports talk shows with daily newspapers in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Washington. It has expanded its news programming. The Bay Area and Boston networks carried the press conference announcing that the former Oakland A's player Ricky Henderson and the former Boston Red Sox player Jim Rice had been selected for the National Baseball Hall of Fame. SportsNet also produced a special about the former Red Sox player Manny Ramirez for its Boston network.
 The company isn't focusing only on television. It recently finished revamping its Philadelphia Web site, with plans to use it as a prototype for others. Mr. Warren said the new programming and Web site changes were ways to increase ad revenue. ''Once you bring sports fans into the house, they will watch and want to see more,'' he said. ''And this will translate into ratings we can then go to the advertisers with.''
 Sue Johenning, executive vice president and director of local broadcast at the media agency Initiative, said her agency considered the SportsNet regional networks part of a media mix. 
 ''We look at them as another local TV station in each market,'' Ms. Johenning said. ''One that offers unique programming directed at local sports fans and one that has attractive ratings. We go where the viewers go, and the more eyeballs they can get, the better.''
 Peter Gusmano, managing partner for local broadcast for the media agency GroupM's Matrix unit, said SportsNet gave local advertisers an affordable way to get into professional sports broadcasts in big markets. And in tight economic times, he said, regional sports networks can offer more attractive pricing.
 ''By investing the money they are to better their product, Comcast is making it an even more attractive buy,'' Mr. Gusmano said. ''All of my clients are extremely receptive to these regional sports networks, and the moves they are making will not fall on deaf ears.''

HEADLINE: Electronic Book Start-Up Finds Partners

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB

 BODY:
Plastic Logic, maker of an electronic book reader, plans to announce partnership deals on Monday that it says will bring a number of major publications to its planned device.
 The company plans to make a device with a 10.7-inch diagonal electronic display, larger than the screens on an Amazon Kindle or Sony Reader, two of the more popular models currently on the market. Plastic Logic says the device will be available early next year. It uses the same technology to display print as its main competitors.
 Amazon is expected to announce a new version of its Kindle Monday. 
 Plastic Logic, a start-up based in Mountain View, Calif., also plans to demonstrate a prototype of its device at a technology conference in New York City on Tuesday. 
 Unlike the other products, the screen of the Plastic Logic Reader is big enough to more closely approximate the look of a printed newspaper or magazine page. 
 The company is hoping that the larger size will interest publishers who think that shrinking a newspaper page onto a small screen does not provide a good reading experience. 
 Users will be able to receive updated versions of the paper over a broadband or wireless connection. But the company did not say how much the device would cost or the price of subscriptions to various publications. 
 Plastic Logic said it had struck deals with The Financial Times, the British business newspaper, and with LibreDigital, a content aggregator that offers electronic versions of The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, USA Today, The Washington Post and other publications on the Internet.
 In addition, Plastic Logic said it would announce a ''direct relationship'' with USA Today.
 Plastic Logic also has content relationships with Ingram Digital and Zinio, distributors of periodicals from such publishers as Hearst, IDG, Hachette Filipacchi, Playboy Enterprises and Ziff Davis.
 As other device makers are doing, Plastic Logic will create an online store for customers to buy books and periodicals. It is offering tools to publishers and individuals that will allow them to format and sell books at the store.
 The New York Times Company has not yet decided if it would make an electronic version of its newspaper available to Plastic Logic owners. ''We're talking with Plastic Logic and LibreDigital, but no decision has been made,'' Catherine Mathis, a company spokeswoman, said.
 Unlike the Amazon and Sony products, Plastic Logic is gearing its device toward business professionals rather than the casual reader. It wants to sell to people willing to pay a premium for the convenience of a large-screen device to store, read and mark up stacks of documents and PDFs using a touch screen, and then forward the documents to colleagues. 
 The additional content that the company will make available will be a secondary reason to buy the product, said Joe Eschbach, vice president for marketing. He said that a number of financial models are being considered for their product offerings, including subscription and per-use fees.
 How the market will look a year from now is unknown. The company had originally planned on selling the product this year, but delayed the start because of the recession. 
 ''The collapse in retail spending makes it really difficult to launch now,'' Mr. Eschbach said.
 The problem, says Richard Doherty, an analyst with the Envisioneering Group, is not the products' appeal, but in figuring out a business model that will succeed. ''I have not interviewed any owner of an ebook device who says that I should not have bought the thing,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Effort to Track Sex Offenders Draws Resistance From States

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH and MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
An aggressive federal effort to keep track of sexual offenders is at risk of collapse because of objections from states and legal challenges from sex offenders and others.
 The effort, approved by Congress three years ago, requires all states to adopt strict standards for registering sex offenders and is meant to prevent offenders from eluding the authorities, especially when they move out of state.
 The law followed several heinous crimes by sex offenders on the run, including Joseph E. Duncan III, who in 2005 fled North Dakota, where he had been registered, and committed sex crimes and murder in three states, ending with the torture and killing of a 9-year-old boy in Montana. 
 An estimated 100,000 sex offenders are not living where they are registered, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which collects the data from the states and provides it to the United States Marshals Service and other federal agencies. 
 But officials in many states complain about the law's cost and, in some instances, contend their laws are more effective than the federal one. The states also suggest that the federal requirements violate their right to set their own policies and therefore may be unconstitutional, at least in part.
 Despite a looming July deadline, no state has been deemed compliant with the law, and some are leaning toward ignoring major requirements. As a result, one of the toughest child-protection initiatives in the nation's history is languishing.
 ''We support the intent, and I'm sure every one of my attorney general colleagues supports the intent,'' said Mark J. Bennett, the attorney general of Hawaii. ''But we believed we couldn't follow every single provision because, legally and practically, some of the provisions didn't make sense.''
 Some sex offenders and civil liberties groups have also taken court action to block the law's provisions. In Ohio, a man convicted 15 years ago of ''gross sexual imposition'' involving a teenage girl is challenging the requirement that he remain on the state's registry of sex offenders for the rest of his life, instead of the 10 years previously required by Ohio law. 
 ''That's not what I want my children to grow up with,'' said the man, Darren L. Coey, 35.
 Members of Congress say they may try to address some of the problems with the law. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said through a spokeswoman that he planned ''to determine whether revisions and improvements can strengthen compliance, and then to quickly make whatever changes may be needed.''
 While some of the law's backers acknowledge that the states have legitimate concerns, they remain fundamentally committed to the law, and suggest that the delays leave a patchwork of differing state laws that keep children unnecessarily vulnerable to predators.
 Even with the spotty compliance and shortcomings, supporters say, the law has reaped benefits. Since its passage, the Marshals Service has brought charges against 615 sex offenders for failing to register or update their registration, an agency spokesman said. 
 ''The single most important thing about it was creating a more consistent, uniform process across the country,'' said Ernest E. Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, an advocacy group. ''There are a lot of states that really don't know where these guys are.''
 The law, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act -- named for a 6-year-old boy whose abduction and murder in 1981 changed how law enforcement agencies look for missing children -- makes it a federal felony to fail to reregister as a sex offender after moving to another state and requires states to toughen their penalties, now often misdemeanors, for failing to register at all. 
 It also requires offenders deemed especially dangerous to register for life and to renew their registration, usually in person, four times a year. In addition, the law expands the number of crimes for which sex offenders must register and requires states to collect more of their personal information and post much of it publicly.
 But legal challenges have been mounted over requirements that juvenile sex offenders appear on public registries, possibly for life, despite research suggesting that young offenders are less likely to commit sex crimes later in life than older offenders. 
 Other lawsuits have challenged the requirement that adults whose crimes were committed before the law's passage appear on public registries for longer than they had been led to expect. Some lawyers say that amounts to changing an offender's penalty after the fact, a potential constitutional breach. 
 There are also concerns that the law does not take into account the individual circumstances of each sex offender, including the likelihood of committing more crimes. Instead, it lumps all offenders into broad levels of dangerousness based on the crime for which they were convicted, allowing, the law's critics say, the worst offenders to blend in with less threatening ones.
 John Walsh, Adam's father and the host of the television show ''America's Most Wanted,'' said the law was vital to monitoring sex offenders but suggested Congress postpone the compliance deadline. Mr. Walsh said the many obstacles -- most recently the recession, which has made it tough for some states to pay for the law's provisions -- need more time to be worked out. 
 He warned, however, that delays come with a cost. Criminals like Mr. Duncan, who has been sentenced to death, are glaring examples of why the law must succeed, he said. 
 ''As long as it isn't fully funded and implemented,'' Mr. Walsh said, ''the bad guys can still float through the country and commit horrible crimes.''
 States can ask to extend the July deadline for one or two years, and officials at the Justice Department, which oversees state compliance with the law, said they had granted seven such requests.
 According to the Justice Department, 20 states have sent materials for review, though in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Andrew J. Harris, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of Massachusetts, the department said in December that only Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana and Ohio had tried to fully comply.
 States that do not fully comply stand to lose part of their federal crime prevention grants. But the grants have shrunk in recent years -- they currently range from $281,000 to $1.1 million a year, based on a state's size -- and many states have calculated that losing the money would be far less expensive than meeting the law's requirements.
 Most states overhauled how they monitor offenders in the 1990s, after federal initiatives like Megan's Law created general requirements for registering offenders and making information about them public. Many states complain that the new federal law disrupts and even clashes with their own carefully created policies for managing sex offenders. 
 ''It's this point in history where states have had many years of developing systems that they feel are working pretty well, and they look at this as a bit of a step backwards,'' said Mr. Harris, who studies sex offender laws.
 For example, opponents say, the federal law's requirement that offenders update their information in person as many as four times a year makes no sense in rural states where they would have to travel great distances. 
 ''That is a huge problem,'' said Richard Svobodny, deputy attorney general of Alaska. ''We have people who live in the village of Eek, Alaska, who would have to fly hundreds of miles to comply.''
 Some top state law enforcement officials said they supported the law in spirit but were shocked by the statutory changes it demands, which some estimated would result in an utter rewrite of their state criminal codes. 
 ''It would shut the justice system down to do this,'' said Buddy Caldwell, the attorney general of Louisiana, a state whose effort to comply with the law last year was rejected by the Justice Department as inadequate. ''And to be quite honest with you, it's bordering on the ridiculous.''
 In California, officials have estimated that even an ''incomplete list'' of costs to meet the federal act would be more than $38 million for efforts that include additional records checks, more frequent reporting to local law enforcement agencies and reclassifying current offenders.
 The legal backlash has also been widespread.
 In Nevada, which passed sweeping legislation in 2007 meant to bring the state into compliance, the public defender's office in Clark County filed suit on grounds that the juvenile requirements went too far. The case is pending in the State Supreme Court.
 In a separate Nevada case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, a federal district judge invalidated the state's attempt at compliance in September on the ground that it violated constitutional protections against retroactive laws. 
 The judge also found that the law violated both the constitutional right to due process, because it did not give sex offenders notice of changes to their registration status, and the contracts clause of the Constitution, because it changed the terms of plea agreements. Compliance in Nevada is delayed while its appeal is pending. 
 In Florida and other states, some federal judges have found that the federal government does not have the authority to punish sex offenders who fail to register as required under federal law. These judges have ruled that under the commerce clause of the Constitution, such punishment is the responsibility of the states, not the federal government. The rulings are under appeal.
 Concerns over the retroactive requirements of the law set off thousands of legal challenges in Ohio, which has tried unsuccessfully to comply, passing legislation in 2007 that included provisions requiring many offenders to stay on the state's registry longer than expected.
 Many such offenders were originally told that they would be on the registry for 10 years, but will now be on it for life. They include Mr. Coey, the convicted offender who has asked a court to block the requirement, and who, with help from the Ohio Justice and Policy Center, earlier succeeded in fighting a residency restriction barring him from living within 1,000 feet of a school.
 Mr. Coey planned to marry Crystal Mullins, the mother of his two young children, once he was off the registry.
 ''I've reached my limit with the changing laws,'' Mr. Coey said. ''I can accept that it was my decision that put my name on a list, but it's not Crystal's fault. I can't do this to them if I'm going to be on that list for life.''

HEADLINE: What's the Cure for Those Depression Blues? Hoofing in Your Scanties

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
If the battered but unbroken stimulus package Washington finally serves up does not turn the trick, perhaps the answer to the country's economic woes could be something a lot simpler. Bring back burlesque!
 In the nostalgia-steeped new musical ''Minsky's,'' which had its world premiere here Sunday night at the Ahmanson Theater, dancing in your scanties while the world trembles is presented as noble service that might help keep a wounded country on its feet. Or better yet rolling in the aisles.
 The puffed-up politician who tries to shutter a theater, a struggling American enterprise offering employment to dozens, is sent packing with appealing dispatch. No droning congressional hearings necessary, just a well-aimed pie in the face.
 A backstage musical set during what may soon be called the First Depression, ''Minsky's'' clearly and dearly wants to be the feel-good musical for the new one -- the Great Recession, or the Calamitous Correction, or whatever grabby handle we ultimately settle on. The book by Bob Martin, who co-wrote and starred in the similarly frothy period show ''The Drowsy Chaperone,'' is stocked with pointed references to the tough times facing Americans then and now. 
 When the musical's hard-pressed hero, the burlesque impresario Billy Minsky (Christopher Fitzgerald), asks his bookkeeper why ticket sales took a dive the other week, the schnook offers hot weather as a possible excuse.
 ''Or could it be on account of nobody's got any money,'' Minsky snaps back genially. ''Did you ever think of that?'' 
 Keeping American toes tapping during rough times is certainly an admirable goal. And the cast and creative team of ''Minsky's,'' directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw and featuring a perky pastiche score by Charles Strouse and Susan Birkenhead, have brought this long-gestating show to life with skill and spirit. (It has been in development for more than 10 years.) 
 But if I may briefly resort to the lexicon of political rhetoric, ''Minsky's'' is a musical comedy that too often seems to be looking back to familiar formulas, dusting off and sprucing up cliches from the showbiz trunk for another repurposing. A show drawing on sights and sounds of eras past can speak to the present and even the future, as the long-running revival of ''Chicago'' spectacularly proved. But ''Minsky's'' seems content to do the old steps in the old style, on the assumption that sentimental escapism presented with gusto and polish can turn the trick one more time. 
 The movie that loosely inspired the show, ''The Night They Raided Minsky's'' from 1968, is no celluloid treasure, padded as it is with long atmospheric passages showing people eating pickles and pastrami on the Lower East Side. Its turns on a shred of plot involving a comedy team (Jason Robards and Norman Wisdom) vying for the love of Britt Ekland, who wanders around looking vague, sweet and beatifically Amish. What the movie has going for it is a keen-eyed, lusty appreciation of the seedy glamour of show-business bottom feeders and the scrapes and scuffles of their lives.
 That's a crucial element missing from the stage version. The shortening of the title, traditional when recasting a book or a movie as a musical, is telling in this case. ''The Night They Raided Minsky's'' zings. The prosaic ''Minsky's'' does not. 
 At one point Minsky complains that Ziegfeld gets away with flesh-flashing on Broadway that would land the burlesque managers in the slammer. But what we see of the Minsky show -- shapely chorus girls doing interchangeable dance routines in sparkly costumes -- seems little different from the kind of pert, pretty hoofing we've seen in ''42nd Street'' and ''Crazy for You'' and the many period valentines-to-self that Broadway has manufactured in the past couple of decades. (Mr. Nicholaw's choreography is fetching and competent but rarely inspired.) They call it burlesque, and the sequins are used a little more sparingly, but it feels a lot like plain-vanilla Broadway. 
 Replacing the movie's scraps of plot with something sturdier, Mr. Martin has borrowed a durable formula from Hollywood romantic comedy in which a seeming mismatch inevitably gives way to true love. In one of the show's funniest scenes Minsky visits a dime-store Freud to figure out why he's not happy. In the office next door is a comely neurotic, Mary Sumner (Katharine Leonard), with similar problems and an identical shrink. Minsky and Mary meet cute after their appointments in a bit involving a blind man and a revolving door. 
 As love begins to blossom, however, Minsky discovers that Mary is the daughter of Randolph Sumner (George Wendt), a city councilman on a crusade against the crude and the lewd who hopes to shut Minsky's down. Through a series of neatly diagrammed comic developments, Sumner is thwarted (and splattered with coconut custard), love triumphs, and the future employment of Minsky's genial team is secured, at least for now. His cohorts include Beth Leavel as his wisecracking dance director, Maisie; Gerry Vichi as the cigar-chomping comic, Scratch; John Cariani as the goofy bookkeeper, Jason; and a poker-faced Rachel Dratch as the talentless chorine Minsky is forced to employ by his backer.
 The short and slightly portly Mr. Fitzgerald makes an appealingly offbeat leading man in the tough-talking but soft-hearted vein, an unusual match for Ms. Leonard's standard ingenue (accessorized with a few decorative neuroses). Ms. Leavel, who appeared as a stage-devouring diva in ''Drowsy Chaperone,'' proves herself capable of commanding plenty of attention in a less bravura role as the company's mother hen (a bizarrely glamorous mother hen, in chic deco dresses by Gregg Barnes). Mr. Vichi, with his smashed-knish face, provides a small dose of the lowdown that really does recall the oily lewdness of burlesque. 
 And Ms. Dratch and Mr. Cariani as the matched misfits almost steal the show with a sour-grapes duet, ''I Want a Life.'' This talentless pair get to deliver some of Ms. Birkenhead's sharpest lyrics in a plaintive song about the allure of the untheatrical life. ''I want a life where pies are dessert,'' Mr. Cariani sings in a nasal drone matched by Ms. Dratch's. ''Where flowers are flowers and none of them squirt.'' 
 The number's a charmer, and they do it proud. On the whole the score is bubbly and pleasant, with an accent on brassy energy. Mr. Strouse, best known for his music for another Depression-era show, ''Annie,'' writes pastiche with real knowledge and affection.
 Fans of traditional musicals will surely warm to the two big numbers led by Ms. Leavel's Maisie. ''Home'' is an anthem espousing the unpredictable but sustaining rewards of the life of the theater, ''where some young girl from Brooklyn/Shows up one rainy day/Gets fitted for a costume/And goes on next matinee.'' 
 Earlier she leads a high-energy dance number, ''You Gotta Get Up When You're Down,'' which reminds us that ''people need something to make their troubles disappear.'' Something, of course, might just be a colorful, ingratiating show like the one we're watching. 
 Those are appealing sentiments to theater lovers. But like much else in ''Minsky's'' they have become faded with frequent use by now. They're practically pieties. For all the vulgar joking and flashing of sequined behinds, you leave ''Minsky's'' not with the tingly sensation of having seen something exciting and maybe a little sinful, but with the feeling that you've attended a comforting church service.

HEADLINE: Free College Has Allure Heightened By Economy

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Afreen Juli, a senior at the Bronx High School of Science, applied early to Cooper Union, a college in Manhattan that specializes in engineering, art and architecture. So did 10 of her classmates, the most ever from Bronx Science, one of the city's most selective public schools. 
 Ms. Juli, who lives in Coney Island, said that she wanted to study film and art; she also applied to the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. But, as she explained in an interview: ''N.Y.U. is pretty expensive and I might not be able to afford it. Basically, Cooper Union is free.''
 Founded 150 years ago by the industrialist and inventor Peter Cooper, Cooper Union is perhaps best known among New Yorkers for its iconic brownstone hall near Astor Place where Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Barack Obama have held forth. But for many high school seniors who are applying to college in the midst of an economic meltdown, Cooper Union's commitment to full scholarships -- regardless of need -- has given the institution an almost mythic allure. 
 Already among the nation's most competitive colleges, with an admissions rate of about 8 percent -- on par with Juilliard or Harvard -- Cooper saw about a 70 percent surge in applications for early decision this year, after annual increases of 5 percent to 10 percent over the last decade. Over all, the school expected to receive 3,300 applications this season for the 265 spots in the Class of 2013, including 750 students vying for 30 seats in the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture. 
 ''I'm pretty confident that the economy played a big role,'' said the dean of admissions, Mitchell Lipton. ''You probably had a lot of parents who said: 'Look, I know you're looking at Cooper Union. You ought to make it your first choice.' ''
 While many of the nation's elite colleges underwrite the education of poor students, Cooper is among a handful of private colleges that are tuition-free for everyone (it does not, however, pay for room and board, though financial aid is available for living expenses, and many students from New York City live with their parents). Some of the free schools are even smaller and more narrowly focused, like Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Mass., with 300 students, and the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, with 160.
 Cooper's applications have climbed steadily since 2000, and really took off this year amid the recession. That has complicated things for the admissions office, which involves faculty members in reviewing hefty portfolios that include take-home tests to determine a student's creativity as well as drawings, architectural models and narrative writing.
 ''The home tests are a series of exercises that are difficult to fake,'' said Anthony Vidler, dean of the architecture school. ''We find it a very good filter for looking for talents that aren't necessarily indicated by grades and SAT scores, even though those numbers are very high.''
 At Fiorello H. La Guardia High School for Music & Art and Performing Arts, 63 of the 556 seniors applied to Cooper Union, 14 of them early. At Bronx Science, 11 seniors applied early decision -- up from 7 last year and 1 in 2006. ''What you hear over and over is that early decision demonstrates interest loud and clear,'' said Darby McHugh, the college coordinator at Bronx Science. ''Combine that with the economy, and it's a perfect storm for Cooper.''
 Paul Shao, 17, a senior at Bronx Science who lives in Hollis Hills, Queens, and plans to study engineering, had his early application deferred. If he gets in, he said, his parents plan on using the money they save on tuition to buy him a small apartment in Chinatown.
 ''It would really help my family out a lot,'' said Mr. Shao, the son of a librarian and an accountant who himself works part time for a test-prep center. ''My sister's a freshman in high school, and my brother is 8. I don't want my parents to pay more than they need to for my college experience.''
 Each year, Cooper Union allots about $35 million to cover tuition. It is a tradition that was easier to sustain when the board of trustees included Andrew Carnegie and J. Pierpont Morgan. ''There were five trustees and at the end of the year they would look at the deficit and divide by five,'' said George Campbell Jr., the college's president. 
 More recently, the college ran multimillion-dollar deficits every year, with its endowment bottoming out at $100 million after Sept. 11. But since then, the college changed its strategy regarding its significant real estate assets, renegotiating the lease on the Chrysler Building, which it owns; signing a 99-year lease on a large parking lot for $11 million; and leasing out its engineering building to a developer for $97 million. Last year, the college had its first positive financial ledger in a quarter century, and the endowment peaked at $608 million.
 And because Cooper is so heavily invested in real estate, rather than the stock market, its endowment has held up better than most, and is currently valued at $594 million. This spring, the school's first new academic building in decades is set to open at 41 Cooper Square. 
 ''Cooper is ranked very highly both for quality and selectivity, and yet it's an institution that has had to manage by its wits,'' said Molly C. Broad, president of the American Council on Education, which represents two- and four-year colleges. ''It is a great example of a set of characteristics that you just don't typically find in American higher education.''
 Yet Cooper Union and the other schools that offer free tuition have become so selective and are so focused that experts caution students and parents against putting too much stock in them. The Curtis Institute of Music received nearly 900 applications for about 40 spots in its incoming class, for example.
 ''It's great that some people can go to these places, but they are few and far between and only the right school for certain students,'' said Sandy Baum, senior policy analyst at the College Board and a professor of economics at Skidmore College. ''And most people won't get in.''
 Those who do will enter an institution rich in history. The Foundation Building, where Mr. Obama gave a campaign speech on the economy in March, was also the site of the N.A.A.C.P.'s first meeting. The American Red Cross was organized there, and Susan B. Anthony had her offices there. It was built with its entrance facing the immigrant neighborhoods of the Lower East Side, symbolically welcoming the poor to a future of opportunity; each spring, graduates exit through another door, pouring out toward Fifth Avenue.
 Ling Jessica Chu, a senior at La Guardia High School whose early application has already been accepted, said she was drawn as much to the small classes and the environmental credentials of the new academic building as the free cost. She planned to keep living with her parents, in Chinatown. 
 ''I wanted to live in a dorm just for the experience, but then again I figured I'd save my parents the money,'' said Ms. Chu, whose mother is a homemaker and whose father is a home attendant. ''My parents were happy wherever I went. But I was pushing Cooper because of this economy.''
 Other students, who come from out of town or out of state, have learned that tuition-free in Manhattan is hardly a free ride. 
 Natasha V. Broodie, a third-year art student from West Palm Beach, Fla., has had to juggle jobs to help cover her living expenses, namely rent on an apartment in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.
 Last semester, she had three campus jobs, working a total of 52 hours a week. Now, she is looking for a fourth. ''My parents don't pay for any of this,'' said Ms. Broodie, who has a 3.6 grade-point average. ''I'm pretty much on my own.''

HEADLINE: In Renewed Hard Times, New Deal Architecture Faces Bulldozer

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

DATELINE: GREENHILLS, Ohio 

 BODY:
When people talk about green architecture as though it were a new movement, Greg Strupe laughs. Mr. Strupe lives with his family in one of the country's first green towns, built during the Great Depression by unemployed men and women and championed by Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. 
 This 1938 village, along with Greenbelt, Md., and Greendale, Wis., was created to move struggling families out of nearby cities and into a healthier, more verdant environment, with shopping, recreation and nearly 200 small modernist apartment buildings and houses surrounded by a forest. 
 ''The houses may be kind of plain looking, not spectacular, but to me at least, they are a treasure,'' Mr. Strupe, 47, who repairs scales, said last week. ''Like my old metal kitchen cabinets -- the landlord asked, but I don't ever want them changed.'' 
 Yet, change has come. Over protests from residents, officials tore down 52 apartments on the National Register of Historic Places, saying they made the village look down at the heels. Signs saying, ''Not for Sale'' and ''Keep Your Hands Off My House'' are taped to frosty windows. 
 Hundreds of buildings commissioned by the Works Progress Administration and Roosevelt's other ''alphabet'' agencies are being demolished or threatened with destruction, mourned or fought over by small groups of citizens in a new national movement to save the architecture of the New Deal. In July, at the Santa Fe Indian School in New Mexico, a dozen buildings built in the Spanish Revival style in the 1930s, including murals with Native American themes, were bulldozed. In Chicago, architectural historians have joined with residents of Lathrop Homes -- riverfront rows of historic brick public housing -- to try to persuade the Chicago Housing Authority not to raze the complex. In Cotton County, Okla., a ruined gymnasium has only holes where windows used to be. Across the country, schools, auditoriums and community centers of the era are headed for the wrecking ball.
 ''It's ironic to be tearing them down just when America is going through tough times again,'' said the biographer Robert A. Caro, who wrote about the W.P.A. in ''The Power Broker,'' his book about the builder Robert Moses. ''We should be preserving them and honoring them. They serve as monuments to the fact that it is possible to combine infrastructure with beauty.''
 Town officials say that appreciation often comes at a high price. Many structures are dilapidated or outmoded, built in a stolid style, with columns and entablature, that they dismiss as ''Greco-Deco.'' 
 The grand, flood-damaged Charity Hospital in New Orleans has been marked for demolition, although a recent engineering study judged it sound.
 Developers often focus on imposing buildings sitting on prime sites: in Robinson, Ill., a striking Egyptian-influenced gymnasium was demolished last fall. 
 In Ocala, Fla., where there is a move to tear down the Deco City Auditorium, an angry official cut off preservationists at a recent public hearing, saying he was not interested ''in what prom somebody went to'' but only in ''how to make this city grow.'' 
 ''Scarcely a week goes by without my hearing of some endangered New Deal site,'' said Dr. Christopher Breiseth, the departing president of the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in Hyde Park, N.Y. ''It's a legacy in jeopardy.'' 
 Professors, authors and architects have formed the National New Deal Preservation Association. State governments from Arkansas to California are compiling lists of W.P.A.-era projects still standing. 
 ''They are redolent of a moment when there was more emphasis on making an integrated community -- not just building houses, but auditoriums, community centers and schools,'' said the architect Hugh Hardy, who restored Radio City Music Hall in New York City. ''It's a better use of energy, in a time of fiscal restraint, to see what we can reuse, remake and renew,'' he added. ''It's monstrous to say you have to tear them down.''
 On a recent day, the air chilly and wispy with snow, parts of Greenhills did look their age, especially the little strip mall with a boarded-up Johnny's Toys warehouse nearby. 
 But other sections were chock-a-block with '30s detailing, the houses freshly painted and very much in use. A small, white pool house with three porthole windows and a curved glass-block facade stood next to a brilliant blue water slide.
 Where the demolished apartments stood, there are now several vacant lots and nine new single-family houses, priced at more than $200,000; many of these are still for sale. Jane A. Berry, the municipal manager, bought one but conceded the new houses were built too close to each other. ''We're trying to attract families,'' she said, ''and there's not even room for a swing set.'' 
 While there are no current written plans to demolish more buildings, the village council reserves its right to do so. And so 10 residents, including Betty Senior, a retired teacher, together bought one of the threatened rundown apartments and fixed it up, just to show what could be done.
 In Depression days, New Deal programs planted three billion trees, constructed 46,000 bridges, and restored 360 Civil War battlefields. Photographers like Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange recorded what suffering looked like; artists created idealistic murals and sculptures. More than 65,000 buildings -- stone monuments in the South, green towns in the Midwest, white clapboard meeting houses in New England -- rose from the hands of previously unemployed Americans. 
 Some, like the Marine Terminal at La Guardia Airport, with its flying fish frieze, and the Immigration Station Ferry House at Ellis Island, with its poignant sense of history, have survived and are among the country's most celebrated buildings. 
 But others have been lost over the decades -- along with the artworks within. 
 ''I consider all the post office murals threatened,'' said Gray Brechin, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has written about the New Deal. ''Since the postal service was privatized several years ago, all this art is in limbo,'' threatened not only with demolition, he said, but by ''slow erosion.''
 Juanita Stevenson has spent 26 of her 56 years in the same apartment at Lathrop Homes in Chicago, a public housing project from 1937. She voices fears that the city's plan to build new housing -- one-third of it condominiums -- will destroy the sense of community. When tenants move out now, the housing authority does not replace them; only 220 apartments of 925 are occupied. Landmarks Illinois is lobbying to have some if not all of the homes retrofitted. 
 Preservationists cite the clever detailing in these and other public projects as a hallmark of the era.
 ''With small budgets, the architects did interesting things: they varied the pattern of the bricks, angled them, put them together to look like a fluted column -- there's a lot of ingenuity in New Deal architecture,'' said Robert Leighninger, a sociologist and author of ''Long Range Public Investment: The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal.'' 
 That ingenuity is present in smaller projects, as well, especially the Civilian Conservation Corps campgrounds built within the nation's system of parks, one of Roosevelt's most cited achievements. From Camp David, the presidential retreat, to the circle of log cabins in a Midwestern wilderness, many of the camps are still operating, serving millions of families every year. But they are significantly underfinanced, said Elizabeth Goldstein, the executive director of the nonprofit California State Parks Foundation.
 In the heart of a forest, the Lost Lake Campground near Rhinelander, Wis., has been the subject of requests for help since the 1980s. 
 Eight log cabins, a little dining hall, a boat landing and two bath houses built about 1935 in the Rustic style, with board-and-batten siding and rubble-stone chimneys, are rotting as the water seeps in. Trent Margriff of the National Trust for Historic Places said, ''It's death by a thousand tiny cuts.'' 
 Mark Bruhy, an archaeologist in the Rhinelander office of the federal Forest Service, says campers still come to the cabins on the secluded, glassy lake. But the current estimate for restoration is $800,000 to $900,000. 
 So far, the money has not arrived. But Mr. Bruhy said he hoped that a new proposal, to be included in President Obama's economic stimulus program, would succeed. 
 ''We have not given up on our commitment,'' he said. ''We have not backed off.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 13, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the demolition or threatened destruction of buildings commissioned by the Works Progress Administration misstated part of the name of the organization for which Trent Margriff works. Mr. Margriff, who bemoaned damage at the Lost Lake Campground near Rhinelander, Wis., is with the National Trust for Historic Preservation; there is no National Trust for Historic Places.

HEADLINE: Music All Over the Map: Leningrad to the Balcony

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
Far from being unified, Franz Welser-Most's programs with the Cleveland Orchestra for three concerts at Carnegie Hall last week seemed almost defiantly antithematic. Along with a new piece by George Benjamin and a contemporary classic by Gyorgy Ligeti, there were big standard works by Strauss, Shostakovich and Janacek; smaller ones by Mozart and Wagner; and, oddly, Debussy's quintessentially Gallic ''Nocturnes,'' left to bob amid heavy Germanic and heavier Slavic seas. Just try to make the connections.
 But a chamber program at the 92nd Street Y on Thursday -- with members of the orchestra and the Israeli pianist Inon Barnatan offering fetching performances of two works by Janacek to punctuate readings from novels by the Czech author Milan Kundera, in honor of Mr. Kundera's 80th birthday -- heightened anticipation of the Cleveland Orchestra and Chorus's performance of Janacek's ''Glagolitic Mass'' on Saturday. 
 Not that the anticipation needed much heightening. This is a thrilling work of immense originality that is too seldom heard, and will probably be heard even less as the recession cuts into orchestras' budgets for large, expensive choral presentations.
 The ''Glagolitic Mass,'' completed in 1927, is named for the ancient alphabet originally used to convey its text in Old Church Slavonic. That text is more or less familiar to fanciers of choral music from a cappella settings by Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff and others for Russian Orthodox services, at which instruments are forbidden. Janacek uses instruments with a vengeance, and brilliantly.
 Leos Janacek (born in 1854) was a late bloomer as a composer, and his characteristic style is intimately related to speech in its rhythms and contours. The exchanges of phrases and snippets between chorus and orchestra in the Mass, and their endless transmogrifications, are wondrous to hear. The music itself foreshadows Messiaen in some of its harmonies and Minimalism and even current sampling techniques in its repetitions.
 Above all this is a work of savage conviction, and Mr. Welser-Most drew an impassioned performance from orchestra, chorus and soloists. The most prominent of the vocal soloists was the soprano Measha Brueggergosman, who projected over the orchestral clamor better than one might have expected after her performance of Wagner's ''Wesendonck Lieder'' on Wednesday (in a concert with Ligeti's ''Atmospheres'' and Strauss's ''Alpine Symphony,'' already reviewed).
 The big piece on Friday night was Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony, which chronicles the German siege of Leningrad in World War II, and its ultimate failure, in broad strokes. New York audiences have heard this piece interpreted often enough by Russian orchestras and conductors (most notably Yuri Temirkanov) to look for a brutal, caustic edge in the playing, often at some cost in refinement. The Cleveland Orchestra -- with a refinement bred in the bone, which served beautifully in the long string lines -- relied instead on sheer magnificent force to create a sense of indomitability if not brutalization.
 Mr. Welser-Most staked a lot on an experiment in this work, stationing brass players high in the balconies and thus enveloping the audience in the performance. This sort of thing is tricky to arrange quickly in an unfamiliar setting, and the effect was not entirely successful.
 Having sat idle through much of the first movement, the trumpeters and trombonists on one side of the balcony made their first entrance at the height of the invasion turmoil and, finally set loose, raced ahead of Mr. Welser-Most and his other troops. Though they quickly fell back into line, some slippage between stage and balcony in other movements kept a listener on guard. But a real payoff came in the final peroration, which set off a mighty ovation.
 The Friday program opened with the New York premiere of Mr. Benjamin's Duet for Piano and Orchestra, with Pierre-Laurent Aimard as soloist. Mr. Benjamin evidently thought long and hard about what the program note calls ''the inherently disparate sound qualities of the piano and orchestral instruments,'' matters that composers have historically taken for granted.
 For various acoustical reasons Mr. Benjamin decided to scrap the violins and emphasize tuned percussion instruments, harp and pizzicatos in the remaining strings. And though the work opens with a cadenza of sorts, Mr. Benjamin largely avoids concertolike opposition between soloist and orchestra.
 What results is an attractive if unremarkable 15-minute piece in a spare post-Bartokian idiom. The structure is loosely episodic with, for example, ominous trombones giving way to sweet stirrings from the harp. Though much of the piano writing sounds fairly rudimentary, there are blistering passages, which Mr. Aimard handled with his customary ease.
 Saturday's program opened with Mozart's Symphony No. 25. Though called the Little G minor, in contradistinction to the later Symphony No. 40 in G minor, this is one of Mozart's great dramatic creations, and it stood up well to the full symphonic weight that Mr. Welser-Most and the 50 or so players gave it.
 Debussy's ''Nocturnes,'' on Saturday, seemed more concerned with sonic clarity and impact than with atmosphere and mystery: a dubious choice in a work that begins with ''Clouds'' and ends with ''Sirens'' (the female variety).

HEADLINE: Running on Fumes No More

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Years ago, when Shai Agassi started promoting his idea of service stations to recharge electric cars, the automotive world barely took notice. 
 At the time, gas was cheap, big pickups and S.U.V.'s ruled American roads, and alternative-fuel vehicles seemed destined to remain a tiny niche for green-minded consumers and technophiles.
 But now nearly every major auto company in the world has committed to building electric cars, and President Obama has made reducing oil consumption a centerpiece of his energy policy.
 The timing could not be better for Mr. Agassi, a former software executive who is drawing upon his Silicon Valley experience as he pursues his vision of building networks of battery-exchange stations in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia to increase the driving range of electric cars. 
 ''There is something meaningful that can be done in the next 15 years with electric vehicles,'' Mr. Agassi said in a recent interview. 
 ''It's about what are you going to do to make the world a better place by 2020?'' he added, providing the context for the name of his company, Better Place. In the last few months, Mr. Agassi, who is 40 and was born in Israel, has become an influential player in the global push toward electric cars. 
 In one recent 10-day stretch, he announced a deal for new switching stations in Canada, closed on a financing agreement in Denmark, then attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he was booked solid with interviews for cable news shows.
 Mr. Agassi's theory is that the key to persuading more consumers to buy all-electric cars -- rather than gas-electric hybrids like a Prius that still create tailpipe emissions -- is to build a network of stations that can replace drained batteries with fresh ones.
 He believes that will ease drivers' concerns that they will be limited to trips close to home, where they can recharge their cars at night. 
 Better Place is just beginning to build its first prototype battery-changing stations in countries like Israel, Denmark and Japan. It hopes to be a critical link in the evolution of the electric-car market.
 ''The battery is a consumable part of the car, just like gasoline,'' Mr. Agassi said. ''Cars in the 1950s only went about 100 miles on a tank of gas, and that problem was solved by installing an infrastructure of gas stations.''
 Mr. Agassi acknowledges that there is much work to do to perfect the mechanics of switching a vehicle battery in a few minutes during a roadside stop.
 The initial Better Place stations are intended for the first electric cars under development by the Renault-Nissan alliance. But Mr. Agassi expects most batteries to become standard in size and located in the same general area under cars. His firm is also working with battery makers on adapting the process for different models. 
 His concept has already won over Shimon Peres, a former prime minister of Israel, and Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of the Renault-Nissan auto alliance. 
 Mr. Agassi also appears to be tapping into the anything-is-possible spirit of the times, after the election of the first black American president. ''I start with the question, how do you run a country without oil?'' he said. ''To get there, you need the number of electric cars coming into the market to exceed the number of gasoline vehicles.''
 Until recently, such a goal would have seemed a fantasy. But auto companies are now spending billions of dollars on electric-car projects, with several vowing to have a model on the market by 2011.
 Advances in lithium-ion battery technology have also increased the range and reliability of prototype electric models. Mr. Agassi is betting that batteries will become commodity products that can be leased and then replaced on demand in the ordinary course of driving.
 Better Place has teamed with governments in several countries to test its switching stations, and has also signed agreements in Hawaii and with a nine-city alliance of communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
 So far, the company is planning for the opening of stations in 2012, and is consulting on how to increase the number of public charging spots for electric cars.
 Part of the challenge is to convert existing sources of electricity -- like municipal light poles -- into charging stations for consumers.
 ''What Shai is doing with these switching stations is taking the worry out of charging your car,'' said Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco. ''It relegates the concern about running out of electricity to the back of one's mind.''
 Mr. Agassi, a former computer programmer, has no previous experience in the auto industry, but has been a devotee of electric cars for some time. He owns one of the 1,500 battery-powered RAV4 sport utility vehicles that Toyota built in the late 1990s for testing.
 He started several software companies with his father, the last of which they sold to the software giant SAP in 2001. He rose to become the chief technology officer of SAP.
 In 2005, Mr. Agassi joined a business forum called Young Global Leaders, and he attended the Davos economic conference. In one session, people were asked to consider ways to ''make the world a better place'' -- a question that stuck with Mr. Agassi.
 He left SAP two years ago and founded Better Place in Palo Alto, Calif., with $200 million from venture capitalists in Israel and the United States. A few months later, he was meeting with Mr. Peres and Mr. Ghosn -- again in Davos -- to complete an agreement to build switching stations in Israel for electric cars produced by Renault.
 He has since signed similar deals in Denmark, Japan, Australia and, most recently, Canada.
 The Better Place system includes software to analyze a vehicle's battery life, and it can direct drivers either to small-scale charging spots or full-size switching stations.
 Mr. Agassi estimates that a single battery-switching station will cost about $500,000 to build. A vehicle parks on a conveyor similar to the track in a car wash, and workers replace its depleted battery with a fully charged one.
 The batteries themselves could be owned by Better Place, with consumers simply buying electric charges as they would cellphone minutes. Mr. Agassi estimates that the cost in kilowatt hours to drive 100 miles in an electric car is less than half the current price of gas. 
 Renault and Nissan have already agreed to make electric cars that use Better Place stations in test markets, and Mr. Agassi has presented his plans to several other auto companies.
 One auto industry analyst said the business model should be particularly appealing to automakers.
 ''Frankly, we are not aware of any reason why they would not sign up for this, as the automakers do not need to commit capital for infrastructure or for batteries,'' an analyst with Deutsche Bank, Rod Lache, wrote in a research report on electric vehicles.
 Mr. Agassi said the first 50 stations would be built in Israel by the end of 2010, the same time Renault's electric cars would be introduced there, and followed by installations in Denmark, Hawaii and elsewhere. 
 Mr. Agassi is reluctant to discuss longer-term plans, but it is not for lack of confidence. 
 ''I am passionate about the fact that we can get to the point where we use zero oil for most of our cars,'' he said. ''Americans need one electric car per household. That's 100 million cars right there. And it can be done.''

HEADLINE: Some Tenants Face an Unfamiliar Squeeze on Their Pocketbooks: An Electric Bill

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Like other New York City renters, tenants at a large apartment complex on Roosevelt Island grew so accustomed to one perk that they tended to overlook it: They never paid separately for electricity because it was included in the rent.
 But that is set to change. Residents of the 1,003-unit complex, formerly known as Eastwood and now called Roosevelt Landings, will receive electricity bills for the first time in April. 
 The concept, called submetering, is a pocketbook approach to energy conservation. Instead of being allowed to use heaters, lights and appliances without worrying about the cost, tenants will have to pay for the power they use, which proponents say provides an economic incentive to reduce energy consumption.
 Yet the rationale for residential submetering and its more complicated reality have started to clash at Roosevelt Landings and other rental buildings around the city where property owners are planning similar conversions, including two of the largest developments in Manhattan, Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town. 
 Last week, managers at Roosevelt Landings, the home of many low-income and working-class families, handed out sample electricity bills. The bills, for a 33-day period from November to December, were based on the readings of submeters installed in individual apartments. 
 Vera Velloso, 40, who lives in a three-bedroom unit with her husband and three children, received a bill for $1,050.43, which was about half of what she pays in rent. Missy Feliciano, 39, who lives in a four-bedroom unit with her mother and three children, was stunned by her bill: $815.51. 
 ''I know people with homes who don't have a bill like this,'' said Ms. Feliciano, a paralegal. ''I almost died when I opened the package.''
 No payment is required for the sample bills. But that did little to temper the outrage among the more than 200 tenants who packed a church on the island on Saturday to complain about the bills. They planned to tape pink sheets of paper to their windows in protest. 
 They said the high bills stemmed not from out-of-control energy use but from what they described as the complex's inefficient baseboard electric heaters and poorly insulated walls. Roosevelt Landings, which used to be part of the state's moderate-income Mitchell-Lama housing program, opened in 1976. 
 Because many of the Roosevelt Landings residents are older, disabled or receive federal housing subsidies, there is a fear that the real bills will force people from their homes or lead to drastic measures by tenants, like using their ovens to heat their apartments.
 The state's housing agency, the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, will offset the costs of the electricity bills by reducing the rent for all tenants who receive subsidies. But elected officials and residents said the rent-reduction formula -- which could result in cuts of as much as $300 per apartment -- would not cover bills as high as $800, $900 or $1,000. Ms. Feliciano, for example, expects to receive a rent reduction of $219. 
 Douglas F. Eisenberg, the chief operating officer for Urban American, which owns Roosevelt Landings, said the sample bills allowed residents to see how much electricity they were using and to make adjustments. 
 ''I think that changing one's habits is a difficult thing to do, and this really takes people being proactive about saving energy,'' Mr. Eisenberg said. ''A lot of these residents have lived in this building a long time. They haven't been responsible for their electric bills. Now they are. I think at the end of the day, I feel pretty good that we're doing the right thing here.'' 
 Tenants' bills varied widely. For three-bedroom apartments, they ranged from $79.26 to $1,050.43, and for four-bedrooms from $147.97 to $974.11. Mr. Eisenberg said the readings were accurate, and added that if tenants had concerns about faulty heaters, the management was eager to correct the problem. ''I assure you that this office is pretty responsive,'' he said.
 Several other owners of residential buildings in the city are seeking approval from the State Public Service Commission for submetering. In October, one of the city's biggest developers, Tishman Speyer Properties, requested permission to install electricity submeters at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, which have a total of about 11,200 apartments, a move that many tenants oppose.
 Submetering is increasingly common in co-op and condominium buildings, where it has become a popular way to cut energy costs. The electricity supplied to submetered buildings is purchased by landlords at bulk rates, which are significantly lower than the rates individual residents pay. But the use of submetering in buildings with subsidized or rent-regulated tenants is more controversial because of the extra expense for low-income families during tight economic times.
 ''If this continues on its course, this is a de facto rent increase on this building,'' said Assemblyman Micah Z. Kellner, whose district includes Roosevelt Island. Mr. Kellner and other elected officials have asked the Public Service Commission to re-examine its approval of the Roosevelt Landings submetering plan.
 James Denn, a spokesman for the commission, said that the agency was looking into the tenants' concerns, but added that submetering is important. Research by the State Energy Research and Development Authority, he said, found that the installation of submeters can lead to a reduction in electricity consumption in individual units by 18 percent to 26 percent. 
 ''The commission has recognized the value of submetering in that it enables residents to be aware of, and take control of, their energy use,'' Mr. Denn said.

HEADLINE: The Destructive Center

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
What do you call someone who eliminates hundreds of thousands of American jobs, deprives millions of adequate health care and nutrition, undermines schools, but offers a $15,000 bonus to affluent people who flip their houses?
 A proud centrist. For that is what the senators who ended up calling the tune on the stimulus bill just accomplished. 
 Even if the original Obama plan -- around $800 billion in stimulus, with a substantial fraction of that total given over to ineffective tax cuts -- had been enacted, it wouldn't have been enough to fill the looming hole in the U.S. economy, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will amount to $2.9 trillion over the next three years. 
 Yet the centrists did their best to make the plan weaker and worse.
 One of the best features of the original plan was aid to cash-strapped state governments, which would have provided a quick boost to the economy while preserving essential services. But the centrists insisted on a $40 billion cut in that spending.
 The original plan also included badly needed spending on school construction; $16 billion of that spending was cut. It included aid to the unemployed, especially help in maintaining health care -- cut. Food stamps -- cut. All in all, more than $80 billion was cut from the plan, with the great bulk of those cuts falling on precisely the measures that would do the most to reduce the depth and pain of this slump.
 On the other hand, the centrists were apparently just fine with one of the worst provisions in the Senate bill, a tax credit for home buyers. Dean Baker of the Center for Economic Policy Research calls this the ''flip your house to your brother'' provision: it will cost a lot of money while doing nothing to help the economy.
 All in all, the centrists' insistence on comforting the comfortable while afflicting the afflicted will, if reflected in the final bill, lead to substantially lower employment and substantially more suffering.
 But how did this happen? I blame President Obama's belief that he can transcend the partisan divide -- a belief that warped his economic strategy.
 After all, many people expected Mr. Obama to come out with a really strong stimulus plan, reflecting both the economy's dire straits and his own electoral mandate. 
 Instead, however, he offered a plan that was clearly both too small and too heavily reliant on tax cuts. Why? Because he wanted the plan to have broad bipartisan support, and believed that it would. Not long ago administration strategists were talking about getting 80 or more votes in the Senate. 
 Mr. Obama's postpartisan yearnings may also explain why he didn't do something crucially important: speak forcefully about how government spending can help support the economy. Instead, he let conservatives define the debate, waiting until late last week before finally saying what needed to be said -- that increasing spending is the whole point of the plan.
 And Mr. Obama got nothing in return for his bipartisan outreach. Not one Republican voted for the House version of the stimulus plan, which was, by the way, better focused than the original administration proposal. 
 In the Senate, Republicans inveighed against ''pork'' -- although the wasteful spending they claimed to have identified (much of it was fully justified) was a trivial share of the bill's total. And they decried the bill's cost -- even as 36 out of 41 Republican senators voted to replace the Obama plan with $3 trillion, that's right, $3 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years.
 So Mr. Obama was reduced to bargaining for the votes of those centrists. And the centrists, predictably, extracted a pound of flesh -- not, as far as anyone can tell, based on any coherent economic argument, but simply to demonstrate their centrist mojo. They probably would have demanded that $100 billion or so be cut from anything Mr. Obama proposed; by coming in with such a low initial bid, the president guaranteed that the final deal would be much too small. 
 Such are the perils of negotiating with yourself.
 Now, House and Senate negotiators have to reconcile their versions of the stimulus, and it's possible that the final bill will undo the centrists' worst. And Mr. Obama may be able to come back for a second round. But this was his best chance to get decisive action, and it fell short.
 So has Mr. Obama learned from this experience? Early indications aren't good. 
 For rather than acknowledge the failure of his political strategy and the damage to his economic strategy, the president tried to put a postpartisan happy face on the whole thing. ''Democrats and Republicans came together in the Senate and responded appropriately to the urgency this moment demands,'' he declared on Saturday, and ''the scale and scope of this plan is right.'' 
 No, they didn't, and no, it isn't.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bank Bailout to Rely In Part on Private Money

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS; Stephen Labaton and Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Wall Street helped produce the global financial and economic crisis. Now, as the Obama administration prepares to unveil a revised bailout plan for the banking system, policy makers hope Wall Street can be part of the solution.
 Administration officials said the plan, to be announced Tuesday, was likely to depend in part on the willingness of private investors other than banks -- like hedge funds, private equity funds and perhaps even insurance companies -- to buy the contaminating assets that wiped out the capital of many banks.
 The officials say they are counting on the profit motive to create a market for those assets. The government would guarantee a floor value, officials say, as a way to overcome investors' reluctance to buy them.
 Details of the new plan, which were still being worked out during the weekend, are sketchy. And they are likely to remain so even after Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner announces the plan on Tuesday. But the aim is to reduce the need for immediate federal financing and relieve fears that taxpayers will pay excessive prices if the government takes over risky securities. The banks created those securities when credit and home prices were booming a few years ago. 
 Besides devising a way to bring private investors into the bank bailout, the Treasury plan is expected to inject more capital into some banks and to give many homeowners relief from immediate foreclosures. 
 It also is expected to increase financing for a Bush administration program intended to encourage investors to finance such things as student loans and credit card debt.
 The Treasury Department had intended to unveil the plan on Monday. But on Sunday Mr. Obama's economic advisers said they would wait another day, to keep the focus on winning Senate approval of an economic stimulus program. Mr. Obama plans to promote the stimulus package in a televised news conference Monday night. 
 The stakes for the Obama administration's bank bailout proposal are high, economists say. Regardless of the specifics of the differing economic plans pending in Congress, no spending stimulus is likely to have much long-term effect unless the bank bailout works.
 ''The simple truth is that a self-sustaining expansion in a capitalist economy absolutely requires a functioning banking system,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, an investment advisory firm. There is a general agreement that previous efforts have yet to succeed.
 When the Bush administration introduced its original $700 billion bank bailout plan last fall, the government was supposed to be the primary buyer of the damaged assets -- the securities tied to subprime mortgages and other dubious loans whose value plunged as the financial crisis intensified. The idea was to pay more than private buyers were willing to spend, but less than the assets might eventually be worth after a recovery.
 After it turned out that the banks were in even worse shape than thought, the Bush administration decided it was more important to invest directly in the banks.
 It was also unclear how the assets would be valued, raising political questions about whether the purchase prices would be fair both to the banks and to the taxpayers. But as those assets have remained on the banks' balance sheets, they have continued to decline in value, producing more multibillion dollar losses.
 The securities are complex and hard to evaluate, and there is little public information about precisely which assets are owned by each bank. And some prospective purchasers say banks are not making many available for sale, or have refused to accept the prices being offered. 
 The Obama administration, in proposing its plan, will be seeking to spend the remaining half of the original $700 billion in bailout money. 
 By trying to bring in private sector buyers to set prices for the distressed assets, and to take some but not all of the risk that the asset value will continue to decline, Obama officials evidently hope to restore confidence in the banking system. They will also try to avoid the politically perilous course of having the government directly buy the assets at prices that could turn out to be far higher, or lower, than their eventual value.
 The assets were the product of a market that grew rapidly in the past two decades, in which loans made by banks, and sometimes by others, were packaged into investment securities with varying levels of risk. 
 Because of the hedging of risks, some were presented as safe, even if the underlying loans were risky. When these securitized assets were being created, federal regulators declined to regulate this rapidly expanding shadow financial system. Alan Greenspan, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, argued that the complex securities were improving the safety of the banking system by transferring its risks to outside investors. 
 It turned out that he was wrong, as became clear when the crisis spread last year. 
 A possible model for the way the new Treasury plan could work arose in a deal last July that had no government involvement. In that case, Merrill Lynch sold $31 billion in securities for 22 cents on the dollar. The buyer, the Lone Star group of private equity funds, put down only one-quarter of the purchase price and had the right to walk away, forfeiting only the down payment, if it later turned out the securities were worth even less than it had agreed to pay. 
 Thus Lone Star stands to receive the upside profit if the securities prove to be more valuable, but has only a limited downside risk if they do not. 
 In such a deal under the Obama administration's plan, it would be the government that stood ready to absorb losses if they were too large, while also providing some of the financing for the purchases.
 Any government-assisted deal would probably need much more public disclosure, some economists say, than was made by Merrill and Lone Star, which did not reveal exactly which securities were involved. Presumably, too, the government would want such packages to be shopped widely to get the best price. 
 ''They must disclose fully exactly what the government is buying, or insuring, or providing financing for,'' said Simon Johnson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. ''Congress is really hypersensitive to this issue right now. Believing you can get away with the opaque deals we saw in Citigroup or Bank of America would be a misconception.''
 In those deals, in which the government either assisted a takeover or tried to shore up an institution's balance sheet, the government provided insurance against further losses on portfolios of assets, but did not disclose details of the assets.
 The securities that Merrill sold last July, known as collateralized debt obligations, are indicative of the type of assets that helped create the current crisis. They are not backed directly by mortgages, but by securities that in turn are backed by mortgages. Thus their eventual value depends, indirectly, on how many loans are repaid. And that in turn, will be affected by how successful the Obama administration is at repairing the financial system and stimulating the economy.
 When they were created, probably from 2005 to 2007, the Merrill securities were rated AAA, the safest rating there is. The fact Merrill was eventually willing to sell them for less than a quarter of face value indicates how far off those ratings were.
 If investors previously underestimated the risks of such mortgage-backed securities, they now may be overstating their toxicity -- at least in the view of some of the banks that hold them. 
 The banks argue that the few trades of such securities lately have been at unreasonably low prices -- ones that would be justified only if foreclosures, and losses on foreclosed mortgages, are far higher than now seem likely. 
 But the banks have shown little interest in demonstrating their confidence in the securities by buying more of them from one another. Instead, banks have sometimes been unwilling to trust other banks that hold such securities. 
 That lack of trust, in turn, has spread to the broader international financial system. 
 If many of those troubled assets can be removed from bank balance sheets, and others seem to have a clear market value, economists hope that banks would feel freer to lend -- rather than continuing to hoard capital to protect themselves from further losses. Only then, the experts say, can the banking system get the economy moving again.

HEADLINE: Economic Ripples As Business Trips Are Scaled Back

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE and STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
What's the difference between a business event and a party?
 That may sound like a setup for a joke, but for Corporate America, it is a serious question without a clear answer. Many companies are pulling back on management retreats, junkets for top clients and getaways to reward top producers. 
 And this new austerity is likely to mean new pain for yet another part of the economy: the hotels, resorts, restaurants and event planners that cater to these events, which one trade association has estimated generate $244 million in annual spending and account for 2.4 million jobs. 
 It also means many employees on lower rungs of the corporate ladder are seeing at least a temporary end to what had become a normal perk of business life. 
 ''O.K., time out. Something doesn't feel right,'' writes John Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, in a full-page ad in Sunday's New York Times and Washington Post. In a long letter, he blames misleading news articles that create the impression that ''every employee recognition event is a junket, a boondoggle, a waste, or that it's for highly paid executives. Nonsense!'' 
 Its annual ''recognition events,'' Mr. Stumpf added, were paid for by profits, not the government. ''Events such as this are the heart of our culture because our product is service, delivered by caring, energized, talented, loyal team members who earn competitive, fair wages and benefits,'' his letter states.
 Wells Fargo, which received $25 billion in federal bailout money, has canceled all its ''recognition events'' this year, including plans to fly dozens of its top mortgage officers to Las Vegas for a junket at the Wynn Las Vegas and the Encore Las Vegas. 
 Other companies -- particularly financial firms that have received federal bailout money -- are retreating from anything that might appear overly lavish. 
 ''No company wants to look like they are spending money foolishly at a time when people are losing their jobs,'' said Jack Riepe, a spokesman for the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, the industry trade group.
 Just this weekend, the North Carolina bank BB&T, which had received a $3.1 billion bailout, canceled a four-day retreat in March for its Sterling Performance Club, its top salesmen and their families at the luxury Ritz Carlton in Amelia Island, Fla. 
 The trip included free air fare and hotel, foot scrubs and spa services, a sailing regatta and golf and tennis and sightseeing trips. BB&T did not return phone calls about the cancellation, which was confirmed by the hotel and local vendors.
 ''Everyone is concerned about their image,'' said James Etkin, president of ME Productions, an event planning company in Miami, who said there are far fewer extravaganzas now. ''They don't want to be in the headlines.''
 Meeting Professionals International, a trade group, predicted a 12 percent drop in conference attendance this year and a 9 percent decrease in off-site meetings and other corporate events. The association is the widely cited source on the estimated number of jobs supported by such events, and the spending on them.
 And in a survey released last week, the Association of Corporate Travel Executives said 71 percent of its members planned to spend less on travel this year and would use teleconferences more to replace meetings. 
 The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority issued a statement last week saying that ''it is unfair to punish an entire industry that generates billions of dollars in economic stimulus and jobs for the American public.'' 
 Vivian A. Deuschl, a spokeswoman for Ritz Carlton, a luxury hotel chain, said these cutbacks ''have had a terrible effect on hotels, and luxury hotels have been very vulnerable.'' Even companies not accepting bailout money have canceled events, ''because it is a perception thing and that is very difficult to overcome,'' she added. The Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay, Calif., has received cancellations from 32 groups in the last four months, a loss of $2.3 million in revenue, she said. 
 What is the new test for what's acceptable? ''Anyone investing in a meeting or an event has to have a solid business purpose,'' said Bruce M. MacMillan, chief of Meeting Professionals.
 By that standard, an event organized two years ago by Mr. Etkin for an investment bank would probably be considered out of bounds today. 
 The bank took 150 clients and 30 of its sales staff to a remote Florida island for a ''Miami Vice'' afternoon, Mr. Etkin said. They created a competition using a yacht, Jet Skis, speedboats, paintball guns and plastic bags filled with sugar to simulate cocaine. ''It was all very James Bond, very over the top,'' Mr. Etkin added. 
 Last week, the Treasury Department announced new regulations for financial services companies receiving federal bailout money, barring ''excessive or luxury items'' at corporate conferences and events. And members of Congress are proposing legislation along the same lines. 
 So today's corporate events are more likely to involve an overhead projector in a hotel meeting room than Jet Skis.
 No company, after all, wants to receive the same kind of press that the American International Group did last October. Less than a week after the federal government provided $85 billion in bailout funds to the insurance giant, A.I.G. held a weeklong retreat at the luxurious St. Regis resort in Monarch Beach, Calif. 
 In short order, A.I.G. executives were hauled before Congress and pilloried for providing manicures, pedicures, massages and facials to executives and running up a $440,000 tab on rooms, meals and spa treatments. 
 The Buick Invitational last weekend in La Jolla, Calif., reflected this new moderation. Rather than flying in nearly 75 car dealers, only 25 went, and they had to pay their own way. 
 On the 18th hole, there were soft drinks, potato chips and folding chairs. In previous years, Buick's hospitality suites featured buffets, an open bar and televisions to watch the event. 
 Larry Peck, promotions manager for Buick and Pontiac, said General Motors was taking a more ''bare bones'' approach to corporate advertising and it is ''just flat-out cutting'' anything that it is not obligated to provide under long-term contracts. 
 Even companies not receiving federal money are trimming back. The North Face, the outdoor apparel and equipment company, hosted dealers and business partners at a Squaw Valley resort near Lake Tahoe in California late last year. 
 But to save the cost of 400 hotel rooms for the first night, North Face created a base camp where the group slept outdoors in North Face clothes and sleeping bags. Groups gave presentations around a camp fire. ''The night was freezing cold,'' said Katja Asaro, managing director at Henry V Events, the Portland company that had planned it. ''But people really got into it.'' 
 The austerity has even eaten into Super Bowl festivities. Playboy Enterprises, for example, has routinely held outlandish pregame parties. Last year, the party featured a scantily clad woman in a giant martini glass, New England Patriot cheerleaders and Playmates. This year, it decided not to have a party. 
 ''With everything going on, you don't want to be out there spending frivolously,'' said Robert Tuchman, president of Premiere Corporate Events in New York.

Congressional aides worked Sunday to identify differences between the House and Senate economic stimulus packages in advance of final negotiations scheduled to begin after the Senate's anticipated approval of its measure on Tuesday.
 With Congressional leaders hoping to deliver legislation to President Obama by next Monday, which is Presidents' Day, staff workers for the appropriations and tax writing committees in both chambers were not waiting for the Senate to act before comparing the two measures. Formal talks will not begin before the Senate passes its $827 billion version of the plan; the House bill costs about $819 billion.
 The Senate agreement on a scaled-down bill was reached on Friday when three Republicans signaled that they would back the legislation. Their support would give the Democratic majority the 60 votes needed to clear a procedural hurdle. But Congressional Democrats and the White House were still hoping to pick up more Republicans. 
 Mr. Obama is to travel to Indiana and Florida this week to rally public support for the plan, and the White House has begun emphasizing the endorsement of the proposal by business and industry groups.
 Once the Senate votes, aides said, the first order of business in the bicameral talks will be to set an overall dollar figure and then begin to sort out the differences in spending and tax changes in the two measures.
 ''The overlap is 90-plus percent,'' Lawrence H. Summers, a top economic adviser to Mr. Obama, said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''We've got to work through the differences, find the best bill we possibly can, and get it in place as quickly as possible to contain what is a very damaging and potentially deflationary spiral.'' 
 While the bills have many of the same elements, the exact amounts spent on similar items and programs vary. The House version provides $40 billion more in aid to local governments and is slightly more generous with a middle-class tax credit, while the Senate bill offers tax incentives for home and car purchases. 
 ''Everyone is going to have to give a little,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said on ''State of the Union'' on CNN.
 House Democrats are unhappy with aspects of the Senate bill, particularly cuts in state aid, education and law enforcement, and Mr. Schumer said he favored the House approach. But all sides expect a final agreement to come together quickly, given the state of the economy and the fact that the measure is the top priority of the new president.
 Most Republicans remain strongly opposed to the bills, arguing that they represent grossly excessive spending and do not get at the root causes of the economic crisis. 
 ''We're going down a road to disaster,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who appeared on CNN with Mr. Schumer. ''We've never seen this kind of spending, ever, and there is a lot more to come.''
 Mr. Shelby also took a swipe at the three Republican senators who have endorsed the measure -- Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, and Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine -- saying that if Republicans had remained united, they could have forced a more acceptable bill.
 The three senators, though, were being praised in weekend radio advertisements by a labor-affiliated advocacy group.
 The group, Americans United for Change, bought airtime in Maine and Pennsylvania for commercials commending the breakaway Republicans and urging voters to call and thank them. ''Tell them to keep fighting for a plan to get our economy moving again,'' the advertisement said. 
 A similar commercial was running in Nebraska, the home state of Senator Ben Nelson, a Democrat who helped broker the compromise that brought the three Republicans on board.

HEADLINE: Angelo Who?

 BODY:
After months of delay, Senator Christopher Dodd has offered a fuller but less than satisfactory account of the V.I.P. mortgage loans extended to him by a key player in the subprime mortgage crisis. Mr. Dodd, the banking committee chairman who oversees remedies for the continuing financial crisis, denied any ethical wrongdoing or ''sweetheart deals'' in the $781,000 house refinancings he got through the Countrywide Financial Corporation. 
 Even so, the senator announced his mortgages would be refinanced elsewhere as he decried being listed in internal loan files as a ''Friend of Angelo.'' That's Angelo Mozilo, the Countrywide chief executive who had a lot of Washington friends happy to avail themselves of attractive mortgage deals before being overtaken by the subprime scandal. 
 Last summer, a former Countrywide executive disclosed the V.I.P. program and estimated that it could save Mr. Dodd more than $70,000 across the years of his loans. The senator denied any Angelo friendship or cut-rate favoritism in what he said seemed a mere courtesy service, and he promised a detailed accounting.
 That finally came this month, but in an oddly limited viewing of documents offered by the senator in his Connecticut office, not the Capitol. Reporters could peruse, but not take or copy, the documents. They showed strong credit ratings for Mr. Dodd and his wife, who firmly insisted they received a lower interest rate through normal negotiation, not insiders' pandering. The delay, said Senator Dodd, was due to waiting on a Senate ethics inquiry that has offered no results so far. 
 No one has accused Senator Dodd of serious wrongdoing. Rather, the suspicion is he might have been tripped up by the moneyed Washington subculture where powerful incumbents are invited to get something wholesale. The chastened senator apologized to constituents that he was not more responsive much earlier. He and his colleagues are going to have to do better.

HEADLINE: Full-Tilt Performances And Defiant Bravado

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
At the Grammy Awards, the oldest songs win album of the year. ''Raising Sand,'' the duo album by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss with sparse, evocative versions of songs that date back as far as the 1950s, won awards in pop, country and contemporary folk categories before being named album of the year. It was one in a long line of winning albums with old songs, from last year's winner, Herbie Hancock's Joni Mitchell tribute ''River: The Joni Letters,'' to the soundtrack for ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' to Natalie Cole's ''Unforgettable.''
 Rewarding the time-tested is just about the only dependable behavior from the Recording Academy, which gave its 51st annual Grammy Awards in a CBS broadcast from Staples Center in Los Angeles. This year the Grammys went Anglophile; Mr. Plant was Led Zeppelin's lead singer, and other major awards went to the English band Coldplay. Adele, a 20-year-old English songwriter, was named best new artist. 
 The telecast started with a shout: U2 playing ''Get On Your Boots,'' a song from its coming album, ''No Line on the Horizon,'' proffering a kiss to the future. With a brawny guitar riff between bursts of lyrics about fear and joy, it was full of boisterous bravado, as if defying all portents of economic downturn and recording-business woes. 
 It was only the first of the program's full-tilt performances. In three-and-a-half hours, the awards broadcast handed out only 10 awards; the other 100 categories filled a three-hour pretelecast ceremony that was Webcast beforehand (and can be seen at grammy.com). The CBS telecast is a rare chance for prime-time music promotion, so it sandwiches the awards and thank-yous between as many songs as can be crammed into medleys. 
 Many of the awards themselves went to carefully contained performances, notably Coldplay's stately album ''Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends.'' ''Raising Sand'' won awards for record of the year (a single, ''Please Read the Letter'') and in a range of other categories for songs Mr. Plant rightly described as ''spooky.'' 
 When Coldplay won the award for best rock album, its lead singer, Chris Martin, half-apologized for not being the heaviest rock band, describing Coldplay instead as a ''limestone kind of rock -- a little softer but just as charming.''
 But to hold the attention of a television audience that has increasingly been ignoring the Grammy show in recent years, performers cranked up the instruments and unleashed their vocals. Radiohead had the percussion battery and horns of the University of Southern California's Trojan marching band beefing up the intricate five-beat pattern of ''15 Step.'' Carrie Underwood's ''Last Name,'' a song about getting drunk and waking up married that was named best female country vocal performance, was a rock stomp, complete with a shredding female lead guitarist. 
 Kid Rock's socially conscious ''Amen'' sounded like a hard-rock protest song. Katy Perry's coy dabble with bisexuality, ''I Kissed a Girl,'' had its drums and guitar pumped up in the mix while Ms. Perry's voice bellowed through a dance number. (Both her dress and her stage set had a blatant, peculiar motif: fruit.) 
 The Grammy shows regularly put together collaborations, and the ones on Sunday night had a friendly competitive edge. Four rappers barked their way through ''Swagga Like Us'' (best rap performance by a duo or group). But Kanye West, Jay-Z, Lil Wayne and T. I. -- introduced as ''the Rap Pack'' and shown in black and white -- were upstaged by the song's hook singer, M.I.A., who was nine months pregnant and performed in a skin-tight polka-dotted outfit. 
 Jay-Z also joined Coldplay, rapping his part from a remix of their forlorn ballad ''Lost'': ''If you succeed prepare to be crucified.'' Coldplay went on to perform the song ''Viva la Vida'' (song of the year), wearing pastel Sgt. Pepper-style outfits and sounding more than usual like a pallid imitation of U2, which had performed just minutes earlier. 
 Lil Wayne, the New Orleans rapper whose multimillion-selling ''Tha Carter III'' won best rap album, performed ''Tie My Hands,'' his song about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, then danced to some older New Orleans all-stars: Allen Toussaint, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and Terence Blanchard. 
 Paul McCartney's band got a latter-day hard-rock rhythm transplant with Dave Grohl, the drummer for Nirvana and the Foo Fighters, bashing away behind ''I Saw Her Standing There.'' The Jonas Brothers, the million-selling tween-pop heartthrobs who lost as best new artist, shared a harder-hitting version of their song ''Burning Up'' with Stevie Wonder, who played a wild, swooping keyboard solo before the medley segued into his ''Superstition.'' 
 Even ballads swelled to fill the arena, with Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland in full cry for her other-woman plaint ''Stay'' (best country song) and then trading flourishes with Adele on ''Chasing Pavements.'' Jennifer Hudson (best R&B album) made ''You Pulled Me Through'' a rising, tearful, galvanizing crescendo. 
 The Rev. Al Green -- the great R&B singer who finally won his first Grammy awards for rhythm-and-blues this year, after winning gospel awards -- and a clearly admiring Justin Timberlake traded falsetto whoops in ''Let's Stay Together.'' Mr. Timberlake also sang his part in ''Dead and Gone,'' the rapper T. I.'s song promising to seek redemption; T. I. will soon serve 366 days in jail for gun possession. 
 All the clatter, blare and vocal flamboyance made for a show that had more gusto than the recording business it represents -- if only for a few hours.

HEADLINE: Plant and Krauss Win Big at Grammys

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Defeating hard-core rap and arena-filling rock, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss swept the 51st annual Grammy Awards, at Staples Center here on Sunday night, with an album of gentle and luxuriant renditions of old rockabilly and country songs.
 Mr. Plant and Ms. Krauss's album, ''Raising Sand'' (Rounder), took five prizes, including album of the year and best contemporary folk/Americana album, as well as awards for three songs on that album. ''Please Read the Letter'' -- which Mr. Plant had originally written with Jimmy Page, his former partner in Led Zeppelin, for their 1998 album, ''Walking Into Clarksdale'' -- took record of the year (which recognizes the performers of a single track); ''Rich Woman'' took best pop collaboration with vocals; and ''Killing the Blues'' won best country collaboration with vocals. 
 ''I'm bewildered,'' Mr. Plant said while accepting the award for album of the year, although he appeared fully confident and calm. ''In the old days we would have called this selling out,'' he added while gazing at the Staples Center crowd, ''but I think it's a good way to spend a Sunday.'' ''Raising Sand'' pulled ahead at the end of the night after a tight contest with Lil Wayne and Coldplay, who had the top two best-selling albums of 2008.
 Lil Wayne, the bawdy and gifted New Orleans rapper, began the night with eight nominations in six categories -- the most of any artist -- and ended up with four awards, including best rap album, for ''Tha Carter III'' (Cash Money/Universal Mo-town), and two for tracks on which he was the main performer: best solo rap performance (for ''A Milli'') and best rap song (for ''Lollipop''). He was also one of the winners of best rap performance by a duo or group, for ''Swagga Like Us.'' 
 Coldplay took best rock album for ''Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'' (Capitol), its fourth release, as well as two prizes for the track ''Viva la Vida'': song of the year (which recognizes songwriters) and best pop performance by a duo or group with vocals. But in the end the awards followed a familiar Grammy pattern in which soft, reverent material beats out more aggressive and youthful music. That was the case last year, when Herbie Hancock won over Amy Winehouse and Kanye West, and also in 2002, when the soundtrack to ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' beat albums by OutKast, India.Arie and U2 for the same prize. T Bone Burnett, who specializes in lushly recreated Americana, produced both ''Raising Sand'' and the ''O Brother'' soundtrack. 
 Fighting years of declining ratings, the Recording Academy, which bestows the awards, had booked the most live performances in the history of the show, packing the Staples Center stage with solo turns and starry pairings. 
 The show opened with a rollicking performance by U2, which performed its latest song, ''Get On Your Boots,'' in front of giant video screens displaying kaleidoscopic imagery and wry aphorisms like ''Satan loves a bomb scare,'' recalling the stagecraft from the era of its hit 1991 album, ''Achtung Baby.'' But unlike most of the acts scheduled for the show, which was broadcast live on CBS, U2 was not up for any awards this year. ''Get On Your Boots'' is the first single from the group's new album, ''No Line on the Horizon,'' which will not be released until next month. 
 And U2 was upstaged by one of the most unusual spectacles in the history of the awards, as M.I.A., the outspoken Sri Lankan-British rapper, performed while nine months pregnant -- indeed, she had been due to give birth on Sunday. She joined the rap dream team of Jay-Z, T. I., Kanye West and Lil Wayne, whose song ''Swagga Like Us'' samples M.I.A.'s ''Paper Planes,'' which itself had been up for record of the year.
 Gyrating across the stage in a sheer black costume with her protruding belly wrapped in black and white polka dots, she shared the stage with four of the most popular rappers in music, although most eyes in the arena were surely on her for much of the performance. 
 The ceremony was marred by the absence of two stars who had been set to perform. Shortly before showtime, the Recording Academy issued a terse statement saying that Rihanna would not appear, following by another during the awards saying that her longtime boyfriend, Chris Brown, would also not appear. No explanation was offered, but the Los Angeles Police Department was reportedly seeking Mr. Brown on a domestic violence felony battery report after he began arguing with an unnamed passenger in a car, and The Associated Press reported that on Sunday night Mr. Brown turned himself in.
 As a last-minute replacement for Rihanna, Al Green sang his 1970s hit ''Let's Stay Together'' with the 1990s R&B vocal group Boyz II Men and the country star Keith Urban. Coldplay collaborated with the rap don Jay-Z, and the teenage pop princesses Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus joined to sing Ms. Swift's song ''Fifteen.''
 Other notable performances included Paul McCartney singing the Beatles' ''I Saw Her Standing There'' with Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters pummeling behind him on the drums; Radiohead, doing its song ''15 Step'' with the marching band of the University of Southern California (which had backed up OutKast in 2004); and Mr. Plant and Ms. Krauss, who stood closely together as they sang ''Rich Woman,'' immediately before winning album of the year.
 Although the music industry struggles with a sales crisis that has resulted in a 45 percent decline in the number of albums sold since 2000, the Grammys, the biggest annual televised event in music and crucial promotion for the record companies, struck a celebratory tone. Whitney Houston made a surprise appearance to announce the first award of the night, thanking her mentor, Clive Davis, before introducing the nominees for best R&B album. 
 The early mood did not seem disturbed even by the memory of tragedy, when Jennifer Hudson, the former ''American Idol'' contestant whose mother, brother and nephew were killed in October, accepted the prize for best R&B album, for her self-titled debut on Arista. 
 Choking back tears, Ms. Hudson thanked ''my family in heaven and those who are here today.''
 Rick Rubin was named producer of the year, nonclassical, for his work on albums by Metallica, Neil Diamond, Weezer and others. Metallica also took home its eighth Grammy, for best metal performance, for its latest album, ''Death Magnetic'' (Warner Brothers). The duo Sugarland won the award for best country performance by a duo or group with vocals, for the song ''Stay.'' Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland referred to the abundance of stars at the show while accepting the award, saying between gasps, ''I told myself I was going to be cool because Paul McCartney and Coldplay are here.'' 
 And for several young British women with one-word stage names, it was a very good night. Adele, 20, took best new artist, and best female pop vocal performance for her song ''Chasing Pavements.'' Duffy, 24, from Wales, took best pop vocal album for ''Rockferry.'' Estelle, 29, won best rap/sung collaboration for her song ''American Boy,'' which features Kanye West.
 The awards cover music released from Oct. 1, 2007, to Sept. 30, 2008. Of the 110 awards this year, all but 10 were given out during an afternoon pretelecast ceremony at a convention center next to Staples Center. 
 A recording of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht's 1930 opera ''Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny,'' with James Conlon conducting the Los Angeles Opera Orchestra, led the classical awards, winning best classical album and best opera recording. Extending one of the Grammys' most unusual streaks, Jimmy Sturr won best polka album for the 18th time. As with most other major award shows, the Grammys' ratings have been slipping for years -- the 50th-anniversary broadcast last year was one of the least popular in decades, with 17.2 million viewers, according to Nielsen -- and the performances on Sunday night were part of a broad effort to attract viewers, especially younger ones. Grammy accounts have been set up on the social networking Web sites Facebook and Twitter, and in December the nominations were announced on a prime-time television special for the first time. But it too had disappointing ratings.
 The pageantry of the awards belied the music industry's economic woes, as consumers turn away from the CD format and illegal downloading cannibalizes online sales. Album purchases fell 14 percent in 2008 and are down 45 percent since their peak in 2000, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The poor state of the economy is only hastening the decline: last month sales dropped 12 percent more compared with the same period last year.
 Backstage during the pretelecast awards ceremony, B. B. King, 83, who won his 15th Grammy, for best traditional blues album for ''One Kind Favor'' (Geffen), alluded to the recession.
 ''I believe the blues, the way things are today, is more important now than it ever was,'' Mr. King said. ''Unless you got a lot of money. I don't.''

HEADLINE: Iran's China Option

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
 What Iran fears most is a Gorbachev figure, somebody from within the regime who in the name of compromise with the West ends up selling out the revolution and destroying its edifice.
 The jostling ahead of the June 12 presidential election -- the world's most important since America's -- must be viewed through this prism. The core debate is: can Iran manage a Chinese-style reform where its Islamic hierarchy endures through change, or does opening to America equal Soviet-style implosion?
 The ''Death to America'' chants at rallies, twinned with a punchy ''Death to Israel,'' seem answer enough. The regime will stick to the game it knows. But Iran is rarely what it seems. It goes out of its way to mask its sophistication. 
 Jahangir Amirhusseini, a veteran lawyer once imprisoned by the mullahs, told me, ''To create trust, deception is necessary.'' He was serious. What he meant was politics is about artful gambits; the U.S. has favored the sledgehammer.
 This has proved a lousy instrument. Iranian ascendancy has coincided with American difficulty. Under President Obama, U.S. policy toward Iran should be rooted in convincing Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, that the price of engagement is not extinction.
 Herein lies the key to the Persian theocracy over which Khamenei presides.
 But his rule is less than absolute. Khamenei is the largest minority shareholder (albeit one with God-given preferred stock) in a system where repression and hard-won freedoms vie, as do authoritarianism and democracy.
 Which brings us to the critical June election and former President Mohammad Khatami, the reformist once seen as Iran's Gorbachev-in-waiting. He wasn't. His 1997-2005 presidency left many Iranians disappointed. At the breach, he retreated. Student protests in 1999 and 2003 died before gaining traction.
 Still, liberalizing economic reform and dialogue were as much the Khatami hallmark as bombastic mismanagement has been that of his successor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As tumbling oil compounds the cost of Ahmadinejad's crony-rewarding profligacy, and Iranians wonder where on earth (or beyond) the billions went, the announcement Sunday of Khatami's candidacy galvanized the race.
 Khatami laid to rest days of rumors by saying Iran's ''historical demand for freedom, independence and justice'' obliged him to run. It was significant that he placed freedom, an unfulfilled promise of the shah-toppling revolution, first. 
 His chief opponent will be the incumbent, Ahmadinejad, who remains the favorite. The president's success in projecting Iran as the voice of the world's disinherited, his fast-forwarding of the nuclear program and his popular touch have impressed Khamenei.
 But the impetuosity that has made Ahmadinejad the Unidentified Flying Object of global politics has given the guardian of the revolution -- and many millions of voters -- pause.
 One theory holds that Ahmadinejad would favor Iranian glasnost in response to Obama because he believes it's not Iranian theocracy that would collapse, but America! He's been swayed by signs of capitalism following Communism onto history's trash heap. But I'm not convinced he'd ever shift from a hard line.
 The West's strong interest lies in stopping another Ahmadinejad term. Given that Ahmadinejad thrives on confrontation, this isn't what Obama should dish out. Vice President Joe Biden's recent patronizing tone -- ''Continue down your current course and there will be pressure and isolation'' -- was dead wrong.
 Mostafa Tajzadeh, Khatami's former deputy interior minister, told me: ''Bush did a lot of damage to the reform movement. We would welcome an immediate calming of the atmosphere from Obama, with the military option set aside.'' Kazem Jalali, the spokesman for the parliamentary national security committee, said America should ''stop looking down from a domineering viewpoint.''
 Before the election, Obama must declare that the U.S. does not seek regime change. He should also clarify that America wants an ''honest broker'' role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to supplant Bush's Israel-can-do-no-wrong policy. 
 Such measures would help Khatami or perhaps a conservative pragmatist like Tehran's mayor, Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf, by undercutting Ahmadinejad's tirades. A moderate president wouldn't solve the nuclear issue (Khamenei leans toward intransigence) but would help.
 I wish Obama could visit the British ambassador's residence here to view the table-setting for the dinner on Nov. 30, 1943 (Churchill's 69th birthday) of the British leader, Roosevelt and Stalin. Not one Iranian was among the officials there reviewing the fate of a war-torn world.
 The Iranian Revolution, at 30, has independence at its core. The satellite launch, like the nuclear program, is about national pride. To open the system, without overthrowing it, which must be the U.S. aim, requires ingenious indulgence of that pride, not finger-wagging. The time for change young Iranians can believe in is well before June 12.

HEADLINE: Treasury to Unveil Bailout Plan Tuesday

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN; Stephen Labaton and David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With Congress wrangling over the details of the $800 billion-plus stimulus package, the Treasury Department said on Sunday that it would cede the political stage to those negotiations and delay until Tuesday the rollout of the Obama administration's multibillion dollar plan to assist the nation's troubled banking system. 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner had been scheduled on Monday to present the broad outlines on how his department would spend remaining $350 billion of the bailout funds approved last year by Congress. Instead, economic officials ''will be working and consulting with the senators throughout the day,'' the Treasury Department said in a statement. 
 ''With record high job losses, and weakening economic forecasts, we're focused on working with Congress to pass an economic recovery bill so we can create the jobs and make the investments necessary to get our economy moving again,'' the statement said.
 President Obama, who has been pressing Congress for rapid action on the stimulus package, will appeal directly to the public this week to underscore the urgency of passing a stimulus plan quickly. Before holding a prime-time news conference on Monday night, Mr. Obama will first speak in an afternoon town-hall meeting in Elkhart, Ind., a town with an unemployment rate of 15.3 percent, more than double the national average. On Tuesday, he will hold a similar event in Fort Myers, Fla., where unemployment is 10 percent.
 The need for fast action on a stimulus package was underscored Sunday by the White House economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, who warned that delaying the bill could have serious economic consequences. 
 ''We've got to work through the differences, find the best bill we possibly can, and get it in place as quickly as possible to contain what is a very damaging and potentially deflationary spiral,'' Mr. Summers said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
 ''If there was ever a moment to transcend politics, this is that moment and that's what I very much hope will take place as this legislation moves forward,'' he said.
 Significant differences exist between the House and Senate versions of the stimulus package, primarily over tens of billions of dollars in aid to states and local governments, tax provisions and programs for education, health and renewable energy. Even so, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle said that they expected fast action on the bill, perhaps even getting it to President Obama's desk by week's end.
 The bill produced through negotiations in the Senate late Friday night and into Saturday is a $827 billion package of government spending and tax cuts. It cuts some $40 billion in aid to states from the House version of the bill and scales back President Obama's signature middle-class tax cut. The Senate plan also creates new tax incentives to encourage Americans to buy homes and cars within the next year. 
 Just three Senate Republicans have pledged to support the measure -- Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine. But their votes are enough to lift Democrats over the filibuster-proof number of 60 votes needed to pass the bill. 
 Senator John Ensign of Nevada, who like other Republicans is arguing for more tax cuts and less government spending in the stimulus measure, said that Republicans would try to delay a vote on the Senate version of the bill for a few days, challenging Democratic plans for a Tuesday vote. But he said that he fully expected the measure to pass. 
 ''It will pass this week, but we want some time to go through it,'' he said, speaking on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''This is almost a trillion dollars. You don't get do-overs with a trillion dollars.'' 
 Democratic Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said that he expected an even faster pace, remarking on CNN's ''State of the Union'' that he believes the House of Representatives and Senate will agree to a final economic stimulus bill by the end of the week.
 ''The two bills are quite close,'' Senator Schumer said. The House, Senate and the White House, he said, ''all agree there has to be some give and take.''
 The delay of the administration's bank bailout plans, first indicated by Mr. Summers on ABC's ''This Week,'' comes amid continuing criticism of how the first half of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, released by the Bush administration, was administered and used. But while the program has been taken to task for failing to lead to significant new lending by banks that received the funds, the second half of the money also may not require banks to do additional lending, Obama officials have said.
 A central element of the Obama bailout plan to loosen credit would be a major expansion of a lending facility begun in November by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, when it was headed by Mr. Geithner. The program, which was initially financed by $200 billion in Fed money and $20 billion in seed capital from the $700 billion bailout fund, lent money to investors to buy securities backed by student, auto and credit card loans, as well as loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.
 On Sunday, Mr. Summers did not directly address a question about whether the banks would be required to lend more if they received additional bailout funds, saying only that the Treasury Secretary will ''be proposing a program that will make certain that we are stabilizing this system and increasing credit flows, because that's got to be the objective.'' 
 Mr. Summers also said at least $50 billion of the measure would be directed at preventing foreclosures. But he did not provide details, saying he did not want to step out in front of Mr. Geithner's announcement. 
 One proposal on mortgage assistance involves Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance companies now under government control, to help stabilize the housing markets by providing guarantees on low-rate mortgages. Another proposal, said to be favored by Mr. Summers, would provide incentives to encourage investments in pools of mortgages, as well as in the companies that service mortgages.
 President Obama last week signed an executive order that will limit executive compensation at banks receiving a large share of bailout funds. The administration has also pledged additional transparency in how the money will be distributed. The Senate voted to release the second round of TARP funds on Jan. 16.

HEADLINE: An About-Face on Gay Troops

BYLINE: By OWEN WEST. 
Owen West, a commodities trader, served two tours in Iraq with the Marines.

 BODY:
GENERALS are scolded for preparing to fight ''the last war,'' but if President Obama intends to keep his promise to allow gays to serve openly in the military, he would do well to study President Bill Clinton's attempt of 16 years ago.
 The Clinton argument, based largely on protecting the civil rights of gay troops, was systematically dissected by senior officers and legislators, who focused on how the presence of homosexuals could affect combat readiness. Generals circulated videos made by conservative groups depicting ''gay agendas.'' Senators brought television crews into cramped berthings. Congress reached a bizarre compromise: a law rendering homosexuality incompatible with military service, but allowing gays to serve under a closet-friendly ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy. 
 The lesson for President Obama is that this fight is not about rights, but about combat readiness. This is a propitious moment for seeking change: a nation at war needs all its most talented troops. Last year the principal architects of ''don't ask, don't tell,'' former Gen. Colin Powell and former Senator Sam Nunn, said it was time to ''review'' the policy.
 That's a polite way of saying they've changed their minds. So have many of us who wore the uniform in 1993 and supported a policy that forced some of our fellow troops to live a lie and rejected thousands who told the truth. 
 There are other aspects of history that may be helpful as well. The armed forces initially resisted President Harry Truman's 1948 order to integrate the ranks. But the Korean War forced trials by fire -- in fact, the units with the highest casualty rates in Korea integrated the swiftest -- and the Pentagon ultimately acknowledged that recruiting from across America's socio-economic spectrum produced the best force. After that, the military swiftly set the standard for race relations. 
 Servicemen continue to be fierce believers in the idea that diversity equals strength, yet during the Clinton effort on gay troops most of us rejected analogies to racial integration. The homosexual threat to good order and discipline was behavioral, we argued, not physiological, and therefore unrelated. 
 It was a flawed argument. The underlying fears were the same as with integration: homosexuals jeopardized unit cohesion not because of their own conduct -- after all, military law and command discretion encompass behavioral breaches -- but because of the perceived reaction of those xenophobic troops who didn't want to cohabitate with people different from themselves. Today, this sounds like one of the ''worn-out dogmas'' President Obama identified in his inaugural speech. And it does a disservice to the ranks.
 Maintaining ''don't ask, don't tell'' ignores a vast social shift since 1993. Only 26 percent of Americans supported Truman's order, so it was little wonder that desegregation stalled. When President Clinton announced his initiative, 44 percent of Americans were in favor of homosexuals serving openly, which perhaps explains the split decision of ''don't ask, don't tell.'' 
 But today nearly 80 percent of Americans feel that way. As our troops tend to reflect the values of our society, lifting the homosexual ban will be easier now.
 In addition, six years of war have clarified priorities. The battlefield has its own values, starting with courage. Sexual orientation falls somewhere below musical taste. What a person chooses to do back stateside, off-duty, in his own apartment is irrelevant in a fight. For months I lived with 12 other American advisers on an Iraqi outpost. There was a single pipe shower next to a hole that masqueraded as a sewer. But the reality of combat dominated personality quirks -- nobody wondered about sexual orientation. 
 Most military jobs are office-based and provide sufficient individual privacy. Even in Iraq many of our fighting forces are comfortably housed with compartmentalized showers.
 A 2006 poll of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans showed that 72 percent were personally comfortable interacting with gays. Bonnie Moradi, a University of Florida psychologist, and Laura Miller, a sociologist at the Rand Corporation, summarized the study this way: ''The data indicated no associations between knowing a lesbian or gay unit member and ratings of perceived unit cohesion or readiness. Instead, findings pointed to the importance of leadership and instrumental quality in shaping perceptions of unit cohesion and readiness.'' 
 The other readiness argument concerns recruiting. To fill its swelling ranks, the military now grants one in five recruits waivers for disqualifications that run the gamut from attention-deficit disorder to obesity to armed robbery convictions. In a press conference last fall, Maj. Gen. Thomas Bostick, the head of Army recruiting, said the relevant question in considering such applicants was, ''Does that person deserve an opportunity to serve their country?'' That's exactly right. And to choose a felon over a combat-proven veteran on the basis of sexuality is defeatist. Ask any squad leader. 
 In the end, however, there is one factor that outweighs public opinion, troop morale and recruiting combined. The military is a dictatorship, not a republic. It is built to win in combat. Its strict codes of conduct ensure good order and discipline.
 If ''don't ask, don't tell'' is rescinded, military leaders will ensure smooth compliance, as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, has said. Cohesion depends on leadership. Our troops will follow the lead of our combat-tested professionals who base their opinions on what a soldier brings to the fight, and little else.

HEADLINE: Spending More Than $800 Billion Is the Easy Part

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The easy part is coming to an end.
 Ask just about anyone in Washington involved in the $800-billion-plus economic stimulus legislation churning its way through Congress and they will tell you it is a milestone -- but without question the less expensive, and politically and technically less chancy, part of the Great National Bailout of 2009.
 This week, President Obama and his Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, will prepare the country for the next, and far more difficult, step: another attempt to fill the huge hole blown in the center of the nation's financial system. 
 No one has yet put a price tag on that effort. But the administration's diagnosis of what went wrong with the first attempt to right the financial system -- that it was too small, and that the problem has ballooned in recent months -- suggests that the next effort will almost certainly entail a far bigger commitment of taxpayer dollars than the $350 billion left from last year's $700 billion effort to right the system, and probably far more than the stimulus package. 
 At his first news conference, scheduled Monday evening, Mr. Obama is expected to argue that the nation's recovery depends on simultaneously firing on three cylinders. 
 The stimulus that the House and Senate are now hashing out is one, intended to help create or protect jobs by funneling money to individuals, companies and state and local governments. 
 Unplugging the stoppage in the credit system that has kept consumers and businesses from borrowing the money they need, by shoring up shaky or failing banks, is the second part, and a vital one: offering a $15,000 tax credit to home buyers, administration officials argue, will not do much good if the buyers simply cannot get a mortgage. 
 And the final part, which Mr. Obama is not expected to announce for days, involves spending billions of dollars more to prevent home foreclosures, for fear that the displacement and anger created by throwing people out of their homes, and putting more properties onto a glutted market, will create a psychological and financial death spiral. 
 But while the president and his economic team had a playbook of sorts to follow when it came to the stimulus plan -- since the Great Depression the federal government has been using big increases in spending and reductions in taxes to jolt the economy with varying degrees of effectiveness -- the problems facing the financial system have no real parallels in scale or complexity. 
 The Bush administration tried to address the problems in its final months, but lurched from one approach to another, spending $350 billion with little to show for it, even as analysts came to the conclusion that the ultimate costs could reach into the trillions of dollars. 
 ''There's a deep suspicion throughout the country because none of this worked the last time,'' one of Mr. Obama's top economic advisers said. 
 Even the lessons of what the Japanese did wrong a decade ago -- failing to address their banking crisis quickly enough -- is only of limited value.
 ''There's a real danger in looking at Japan, or even our own experience during the 1930s, for what works or doesn't work,'' said Jeffrey E. Garten, a professor at the Yale School of Management who helped develop the Clinton administration's economic strategies for Asia.
 ''Those problems arose at a different moment in the history of the global economy, when banks around the world were not so intertwined and when the financial sector wasn't so critical to global growth,'' Mr. Garten said. Japan's troubles, he said, barely affected international trade. 
 ''Today we have three interrelated problems: a collapse of the real economy, a collapse of the banking system, and rapidly shrinking world trade,'' he said. ''If you treat one without treating the others, you are doomed. And right now, to the naked eye, nothing seems to be working.''
 The stimulus package is the easiest element of the solution to understand, and the easiest to sell politically: just about every member of Congress can go home and explain how it benefits constituents. But as Mr. Geithner and his team have discovered as they try to put together the bank bailout, the politics are running against them. Bankers have become symbols of excess and greed, making the politics of pouring more money into propping up Wall Street and the financial system that much trickier.
 ''We know what we need to do: inject capital into the banks, clean up their balance sheets, get rid of the bad loans in their portfolios that are clogging up the arteries,'' a senior member of Mr. Obama's economic team said, declining to speak on the record ahead of Mr. Obama's news conference and Mr. Geithner's announcement on Tuesday. ''But the perception is that you are bailing out a bunch of Wall Street bankers, and even many Democrats are going to rebel at that.''
 The new administration will have to develop convincing arguments that it has an approach that will work any better than the Bush approach did.
 Getting the banks to lend more is a prime example of the conundrum.
 Mr. Geithner's first goal is to stabilize the banks, pumping in more capital to assure that they can weather the storms ahead. As a result, while the Obama administration will encourage the banks to lend, top officials say they do not want to issue mandates. Yet they know that the first rescue effort was judged a failure precisely because many banks horded the money -- or used it to acquire other banks.
 ''The challenge is a political one: with the government putting a lot of funds into the banking system, Congress wants to see results, tangible results,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, who served on the Federal Reserve from 1996 to 2002 and is vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers.
 ''But you don't want the government in the position of deciding on loans,'' he said, ''because they are not going to be any better at that than the private sector was last year.'' Moreover, once the government is involved in the decision there will be enormous pressure to lend to borrowers who might not be creditworthy, perpetuating the problem that triggered the problem. 
 ''The fact is,'' Mr. Meyer said, ''there are a lot fewer creditworthy borrowers now than there were a year ago,'' thanks to job losses and the erosion of assets.
 Mr. Meyer and other economists, however, say they are encouraged by the Obama administration's exploration of ways to draw private investors back into the market for ''toxic assets.'' If the price of those assets drops low enough, and the government is willing to guarantee investors against losses, ''I think there is a lot of money on the sidelines that may come in to buy these up,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''There's a great profit opportunity here.''
 To get to that point, however, the moment when the government can leverage private money to supplement taxpayers' investments, will require a change in the national psychology. That, in the end, will be the administration's greatest challenge.

HEADLINE: Already Back on the Trail, Now to Sell a Stimulus Plan

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The presidential campaign trail often loved Barack Obama more than he loved it back. When he was sworn in last month, he told friends he was eager to tackle the rigors of the Oval Office without the drudgery of shuttling to a different part of the country every other day.
 But a road trip is suddenly looking far more appealing. 
 In an effort to build support for his signature economic stimulus plan, Mr. Obama is setting off for Indiana on Monday, holding his first prime-time news conference on Monday night and heading to Florida on Tuesday. In both states, he will be working to counter Republican criticism of his $800 billion recovery package and take greater control of the debate. 
 He also is hoping to refill his reservoir of political capital and escape Washington after a bruising week in the White House. 
 ''Washington can be a little suffocating that way,'' David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president, said in an interview on Sunday. ''It's good to go out where the American people are, where they have a very strong view about what we should be doing.'' 
 When Mr. Obama arrived in Washington on Jan. 4, more than two weeks before he was sworn into office, he said he was glad he would soon be settled after hopscotching from city to city for the last two years. Initially, the president was reluctant to be too far away from Washington, aides said, because he was juggling the economic proposals, meeting with military commanders and still trying to fill his cabinet.
 But last week, as Republicans in Congress stood nearly solidly against Mr. Obama's stimulus plan, some Democrats voiced concern that the president was not following in the path of his predecessors in both political parties by taking his campaign for the plan on the road to help aggressively sell it and guide it through a rough patch.
 This ''tug and pull,'' as Mr. Axelrod called it, has presented a challenge because the president is intent on getting his arms around the enormous problems facing the nation. The political instincts that served Mr. Obama well in his campaign faced new tests after he conceded last week that he had made a mistake by pushing the nomination of Tom Daschle to champion health care.
 Going out into the country offers a chance for Mr. Obama to reboot. And the image of him stepping off Air Force One, with adoring crowds waiting, is a uniquely presidential way to do it. 
 For the first 20 days of his presidency, Mr. Obama has been captive to the fixtures of government, dashing from the White House to Capitol Hill to a series of agencies for an early look at his administration. The images, while presidential, bore only a faint resemblance to the man who charmed voters with an outside-of-Washington persona.
 He is taking to the formality of his new duties. Several people who met with him in the Oval Office or in other rooms throughout the White House said they were struck by how at ease Mr. Obama seemed in his new surroundings. 
 Since moving into the White House on Jan. 20, he has enjoyed a series of firsts, including sitting in the presidential box at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Friday night and flying aboard Marine One to the presidential retreat at Camp David on Saturday.
 But the urgency outside Washington was growing.
 A collection of private and public polls, as well as focus groups convened by Democratic strategists, showed that the public's support for the economic recovery package was eroding as Republicans intensified their criticism of the plan. So advisers to the president told him he had no choice but to fire up Air Force One and return to a mode of campaigning that helped him win the presidency.
 On Monday night, Mr. Obama will address the nation for the first time in a prime-time appearance from the East Room of the White House and make his argument for why the economic bill is necessary. When he does, aides said, he will recount his visit earlier in the day to Elkhart, Ind., a city he visited twice during the presidential race that has seen its unemployment rate rise to 15.3 percent, largely because of layoffs in the recreational vehicle industry.
 ''They've watched their unemployment triple,'' said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary. ''This isn't just something that people debate. It's something that they live every day.''
 Mr. Obama is set to meet with the mayor, Dick Moore, who has assembled a list of 18 construction projects, from rebuilding runways at the local airport to upgrading sewer systems, that he said could help create 2,300 jobs. In Washington, those are the types of projects deemed recipients of pork-barrel spending, but the administration hopes they will be seen differently at closer range.
 To members of Congress who have yet to say how they intend to vote on the economic stimulus plan -- including Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana -- a bit of high-profile arm-twisting by the president will not go unnoticed on Capitol Hill. The White House is taking six members of Congress along for the ride on Monday, including one Republican, Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, whose vote the president is trying to win.
 In Washington, the White House prepared Sunday for its first major presidential trip and a week that could help define Mr. Obama's presidency with the votes on the economic bills. Elkhart, a city of 52,000 just south of the Michigan line, was alive with anticipation of the visit. 
 A headline in The Elkhart Truth declared, ''Don't bother asking -- there aren't any more tickets for Obama visit.''
 The newspaper reported Sunday that a real estate developer had placed a classified advertisement to sell two tickets to see Mr. Obama for $1,000. The developer, Nawab Manjee, said he intended to use the money to help him meet a week's worth of payroll -- if anyone took him up on the offer.

HEADLINE: For Russia's Migrants, Economic Despair Douses Flickers of Hope

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
CHELOBITYEVO, Russia -- The tattered shacks of a shantytown for migrant workers are huddled in the shadow of a nuclear power plant here, just outside sprawling Moscow's last ring road.
A naked bulb flickers on and off in one, a modified shipping crate that serves as the home of Avaz Akhatov and his family. Despite the frigid evening, the air inside is stifling from the heat of a wood-fired stove and the body heat from his two young sons, wife and sister, all of whom live in a space no larger than a walk-in closet.
The conditions are miserable, Mr. Akhatov, a 44-year-old laborer from Tajikistan, admits. And they are getting worse. 
Marginalized and maligned in the best of times, Russia's millions of migrants are facing increasing hardship as the country enters its worst economic decline since the 1998 ruble collapse. Recruited in droves mostly from former Soviet republics in Central Asia to build shopping malls, skyscrapers and luxury homes during Russia's decade-long economic boom, migrant workers now top 10 million people by some estimates, giving Russia the second largest immigrant population in the world, trailing only the United States.
Work on construction sites or renovations in private homes, the two most lucrative migrant professions, are becoming more scarce and employers are increasingly withholding wages for work already completed, leaving migrants increasingly desperate.
Many now live directly on construction sites inside the structures they are building. Others find shelter in ragged shacks cobbled together from particleboard and scraps of sheet metal and lumped together to form ghettos like the one here in Chelobityevo.
Russian officials, themselves besieged by the effects of the economic crisis, are mostly concerned with reining in the number of migrants to preserve jobs for Russian citizens.
Pressed by the gathering economic crisis, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, while acknowledging Russia's dependence on migrant labor, has called for quotas on work permits for migrants to be temporarily cut in half.
For all that, Mr. Akhatov says, opportunities in Russia are still better than they are back home.
''You work and earn 100 rubles, 200 rubles, 500 rubles, and you can feed yourself,'' the equivalents of $3 to $15 for a day's labor, Mr. Akhatov said. ''But in Tajikistan, you couldn't make 500 rubles in a year.''
Mr. Akhatov has decided to stay if he can -- to work for a pittance, suffer extortion from employers and the police and live in fear of racist attacks -- just like many of Russia's millions of other migrant workers, whose lives are mired in similar penury but who have little hope of surviving in their homelands.
''People have no alternative for making money,'' said Bakhrom Khamroyev, an ethnic Uzbek who has become a leading advocate for immigrant rights in Russia. ''There is no source other than Russia right now.''
From here, Moscow, with its expensive cars, boutiques and restaurants, is just barely visible as an orange glow in a cloudy evening sky. Power lines crisscross overhead with the incessant buzz of electricity moving from the nearby nuclear power plant to the city.
At Mr. Akhatov's home, water for tea boils in a bucket on the wood-fired stove as friends and acquaintances come in to talk. They now spend much of their days listlessly, waiting for regular work.
''I have family there -- 15 people,'' Aleksandr Babokhonov said of his life back in Tajikistan. ''They need to be clothed, they need to be fed, but with what?'' he asked. ''There is now enough money only for food.''
Increasing attacks by aggressive nationalists also weigh on their minds, as jobs grow scarcer and a public backlash against migrant labor gains strength. A Moscow-based human rights group recently announced that 10 people had been killed in what were apparently racist attacks just since the start of the year.
On top of these problems, migrants often find themselves at the mercy of the police, who can confiscate cash and other valuables on seemingly any pretext, or without reason at all, experts and witnesses said.
In the last few months, police officers have raided the shantytown at Chelobityevo several times, witnesses said, ostensibly to check for illegal migrants. As often as not, however, legal status is no guarantee of protection.
''Even when all your documents are in order, they can beat you and take your money,'' Mr. Khamroyev said. ''It's not helpful to be here legally.''
In a recent raid, witnesses said, that about a dozen men were made to strip to their underwear in frigid temperatures and burn their clothing when they could not produce enough cash.
Once, the police went into a makeshift mosque during a Muslim holiday and beat and arrested those praying inside. In another recent raid, police officers confiscated presents that had been bought as New Year's gifts for family members back home, residents said.
Frequently, those who do not pay are put to work doing manual labor at police stations or at the homes of officers, the migrant workers said. Passports and work permits are also frequently confiscated, subjecting migrants to further legal hassles and allowing the police another excuse for bribes.
Mr. Akhatov was buying his two children clothes at the market recently when police officers detained all three, accusing them of having false documents. The charge was confirmed by a police official, though Mr. Akhatov says his papers are in order.
His children, Ilkhom, 5, and Idibek, 8, became feverish from several hours spent in detention, and the police have confiscated Mr. Akhatov's passport.
''They said they'd deport me,'' Mr. Akhatov said. ''I don't know what to do.''

HEADLINE: Common Sense On C.E.O. Pay

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER HUGHES and HUGO DIXON

 BODY:
More than 18 months into the financial crisis, some observers are saying that things just might have stopped becoming worse. But even cautious optimism is hard to square with what companies are saying and doing.
True, some recent business surveys in the United States, the euro zone, Britain and China show sentiment rising, albeit from dismal levels. Goldman Sachs said its Global Leading Indicator suggested ''a trough in the global industrial cycle may be in sight.''
But the credit crisis continues to advance with tragic predictability. Ferretti, the Italian yacht maker that epitomized the easy wealth and casual leverage of the credit boom, has skipped an interest payment on its acquisition debt. Hammerson, a British commercial property developer, announced a rights issue on Monday. And the German car parts maker Schaeffler is battling against a breakup after loading up on debt. 
This is a global crisis. India's largest discount retailer, Subhiksha Trading Services, suffered widespread vandalism last weekend after running out of cash to pay its security staff. In the Far East, suffering is the order of the day. Nissan of Japan forecasts big losses, and the Korean electronics producer LG warns that revenue, expressed in dollars, will be down 20 percent this year.
Of course, bad news will keep flowing freely until well after the recession's trough is crossed. So perhaps the worst is indeed almost upon us. But a more plausible interpretation of the less bad surveys is that the rate of decline has slowed.
Yet there are always opportunities to make money, if only from companies under pressure. Private equity firms specializing in secondary buyouts see rich pickings in the portfolios of capital-constrained banks that are looking to sell what assets they can. And Frank Quattrone, the former Credit Suisse banker who became synonymous with the excesses of the technology boom, is expanding his boutique advisory firm into London. He expects a spurt in tech mergers. As they say, there is always a bubble inflating somewhere.
Isolationism's Threat
A new type of protectionism is stalking the world -- financial isolationism. It's fairly subtle. No trade or tariff barriers are erected. But it still threatens to deepen the economic downturn. Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, has rightly been banging the drum about the dangers.
Financial isolationism involves banks retreating behind national frontiers. It is easy to see how this can happen. National governments are pouring billions into local banks. They want to see them increasing -- or at least maintaining -- lending. But many banks are still in deleveraging mode.
The easiest way to reconcile the political pressure to lend more at home with the financial imperative to reduce leverage is to lend less abroad.
But if every country's banks engaged in such a policy of national retreat, the collective effect would be self-defeating. Even if national banking champions kept lending constant, the loss of credit from foreign banks would shrink the overall pie.
In theory, the retreats behind national frontiers would cancel one another out. But in practice, the effects would be terrible.
First, any such retreat wouldn't be even. Some countries -- developing ones reliant on foreign banks and those with big current accounts to finance -- might suffer extreme credit droughts. Second, it would be harder for banks to spread their risks: a bank with all its eggs in one giant national market might become more risk averse.
Finally, without foreigners, national markets would be dominated by a smaller number of large players. That would undermine competition and reduce choice for consumers of financial services everywhere.
The politics are tricky. Why should taxpayer dollars go to subsidize foreigners? The answer depends on whether there really is a foreign subsidy going on. Take Citigroup. It has received a huge capital injection from the United States, but that is needed to refill its depleted coffers at home. Its foreign subsidiaries are well capitalized.
For banks with struggling foreign subsidiaries, the choices are starker. If the parent bank is unable to inject more capital -- and its own government is unwilling to -- the local government will be asked for aid. The normal response will be to give it, but to nationalize the local subsidiary.
This has already happened with Fortis's Dutch operations, and it may happen with some Eastern European banks owned by Western banks. But such hard cases make bad principles. Financial isolationism is a trend that should be strongly resisted.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Waits for Washington to Act

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Wall Street held its breath on Monday as it awaited details on a banking bailout from Washington.
Investors had expected to start the week with an announcement from the Treasury Department outlining its latest plans to stabilize the financial system. But the Obama administration delayed releasing the details until at least Tuesday to keep the focus on its efforts to pass a huge economic stimulus package in the Senate. 
Stock markets treaded water, swinging between gains and losses to close mixed on Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 9.72 points, or 0.1 percent, at 8,270.87. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.29 points, or 0.2 percent, to end at 869.89, while the Nasdaq composite index was almost unchanged, down 0.01 percent to 1,591.56.
''The market's holding tough,'' said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''Everyone's just in a wait-and-see mode for both those government bailouts to come. There are just so many questions.''
Stocks had surged late last week, breaking a month of weekly losses, as optimistic investors speculated about the government's plans to spend the second half of the $700 billion bailout.
In credit markets, the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose above 3 percent for most of Monday, but fell back to 2.99 percent, ending the day essentially unchanged since late Friday. The price of the 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction of the yield, rose just 1/32, to 106 13/32.
As long-term Treasury yields tick up, so do mortgage rates, which fell after the Federal Reserve slashed its key short-term interest rate to nearly zero. Nationwide, the average interest on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 5.44 percent at the end of last week, up from a low of 5.08 percent in mid-January, according to Bankrate.com.
A reboot in the markets will boil down to fiscal stimulus, righting the banking system and increasing investor confidence, analysts said. ''Get those three pieces and we've got a shot here,'' said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management.
Government officials have said the revised banking bailout plan will inject more capital into banks, seek the help of private investors in lifting troubled assets from banks' balance sheets and provide homeowners with some relief from foreclosures.
On Monday, shares of Whirlpool rebounded from earlier losses to close up 2 percent, at $37.13 a share. The appliance maker reported that its fourth-quarter profit fell 76 percent, the latest in a string of disappointing quarterly earnings from struggling American businesses.
Among financial stocks, the American depositary receipts of Barclays rose 11 percent to end at $6.99 after the British bank announced earnings for the second half of the year that beat expectations. Shares of Bank of America rebounded 12.4 percent, building on its gains from last week to finish at $6.89 a share. Citigroup posted a slight gain while JPMorgan Chase fell.
Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: New Senator Vows to New Yorkers to Take Wider View on Gun Issues

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who campaigned upstate for Congress last year as a stalwart opponent of gun control, vowed after meeting with the parents of a slain Brooklyn high school senior on Monday that she would lead the fight against gun violence as a senator for all of New York.
 Ms. Gillibrand, the recipient of a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association, did not disavow any of her previous votes, but said she would work to end illegal gun trafficking and to give young people in cities expanded access to after-school programs, job training and other alternatives to joining gangs. 
 It was the latest stop on a fast-paced tour in which Ms. Gillibrand has been listening to her new constituents, explaining her past positions as the representative of a largely conservative district, and in some cases adjusting them noticeably to conform to the state's Democratic mainstream.
 Her announcement came after a private meeting at Nazareth Regional High School, in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, with the parents and classmates of Nyasia Pryear-Yard, a 17-year-old who was shot in the face and killed at a club on Jan. 18.
 ''There's a very big difference between making sure hunters can hunt in upstate New York, because it's part of our heritage and our history and the Second Amendment to our Constitution, and fighting against gun violence,'' Ms. Gillibrand told reporters. ''And those are values and views that I've always held -- that we do need to fight against gun violence. We do need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.''
 Jennifer Pryear, the killed girl's mother, said she knew of Ms. Gillibrand's background opposing gun control legislation but was hopeful after their conversation. ''You have to give a person the opportunity to show their face, first,'' she said. ''So I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt to do what she says she's going to do. You just have to give a person a chance.''
 Ms. Gillibrand denied that she was changing her stance on guns, saying she had supported House legislation aimed at ending gun violence. And she said her high rating with the National Rifle Association derived from just three House votes, including one supported by Representative Carolyn McCarthy, the Long Island Democrat who was widowed by gun violence and who has raised the idea of challenging Ms. Gillibrand in a primary.
 But an official involved in Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the group formed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, which includes 17 New York mayors and hundreds nationwide, pointed to a bill that the group had asked Ms. Gillibrand to oppose, but that she later agreed to co-sponsor. That bill, which did not come up for a vote, would have permanently codified the so-called Tiahrt Amendment, preventing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from issuing reports on gun trace data that law-enforcement agencies use in anti-trafficking efforts. 
 Later, at a wide-ranging luncheon with editors of The New York Times, Ms. Gillibrand said she favored the latest economic bailout proposal, and insisted that her support for same-sex marriage, which has been highlighted since her appointment, was not a turnabout, noting that she had expressed her support for a New York gay-marriage bill just before the November election.
 On immigration, she said she had sent a letter to the Homeland Security secretary, Janet Napolitano, calling for an end to unwarranted home raids and to the deportations of immigrants taken by force from their homes.
 Asked to describe the process by which Gov. David A. Paterson selected her, Ms. Gillibrand said she had scant contact with the governor before he announced her appointment. She said she was interviewed by him for an hour in mid-December, bumped into him at an inaugural party in Washington, and then in a call the day before the announcement, he asked her to show up in Albany to stand with whoever was chosen. Then, at 2 o'clock the next morning, she got the call from him saying she had been selected.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Utility Plans Major Solar Project

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Public Service Electric and Gas, New Jersey's largest utility, said it would unveil a five-year, one-of-a-kind plan on Tuesday to install solar panels on 200,000 utility poles in its service territory.
 The project, which the utility must first present to state regulators for approval, would also include putting solar panels on schools and municipal buildings, low-income housing and areas like closed garbage dumps. 
 The utility expects to spend $773 million on the project, which it said would generate 120 megawatts of electricity, one-third of which should come from the panels on utility poles. That amounts to barely 1 percent of the power consumed in the state, but is about 7 percent of the state's goal of power generated from renewable energy sources by 2020.
 By then, 22.5 percent of the state's electricity is supposed to come from renewable sources, according to New Jersey's energy master plan.
 Most solar panels on utility and municipal properties power single items, like traffic lights and parking meters. These panels, however, would feed directly into the electrical grid. By selling the electricity into the wholesale market, the utility expects to offset some of the cost of installing the panels.
 The project would add about 10 cents to each customer's monthly bill in the first year and as much as 35 cents in subsequent years. It comes at a time when many renewable energy installations -- including those on homes -- are being scaled back because of the lack of money or the higher cost of loans.
 ''We saw how the financial crunch has really brought renewables to a grinding halt, and this is a way to get it back going and a way to make sure all our customers benefit,'' said Ralph Izzo, the chief executive of Public Service Enterprise Group, the utility's parent company.
 In addition to raising money by selling the panels' electricity, P.S.E. & G. also expects to receive a federal tax credit and income from selling the state renewable energy credits that accrue when solar energy is produced.
 The bulk of the money for the project, however, would come from new bonds and equity from Public Service Enterprise. Mr. Izzo said he did not expect his utility to have difficulty issuing bonds in the shaky debt markets, and added that the price of installing the panels -- about $6.44 for each watt produced -- was far lower than just a few years ago.
 Other power companies in the region, including the Long Island Power Authority and Con Edison, have announced other, less ambitious solar energy projects in recent months. And others have proposed electrifying about 20 dams in New Jersey. A subsidiary of Public Service Enterprise is also part of a venture to install 96 wind turbines as far as 20 miles offshore to produce up to 346 megawatts of electricity.
 But solar power is the most prominent renewable energy source in New Jersey, which ranks second behind California in producing solar energy. As a result, the number of companies that install solar energy equipment has blossomed. By starting such a large-scale project, the utility is providing much-needed stimulus to the state's economy.
 ''P.S.E. & G. is taking solar to another level,'' said Scott A. Weiner, a partner at the solar energy development company Resource Energy Systems and the former commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Protection and Energy. ''They are stepping up to facilitate the solar market in New Jersey and to contribute to achieve public policy objectives.''
 But there are many hurdles. Solar panels mounted on utility poles would not rotate as the sun crosses the sky, which means they would produce peak amounts of power for only about six hours a day, or less time if it is cloudy or snowing.
 Some 40-foot poles cannot be used because their view of the sun is blocked by trees or buildings. If the utility cannot find enough of its own poles to use, it will contract with Verizon and other companies.
 Unlike power plants, which require a large amount of money to spent up front, P.S.E. & G. can begin recouping its investment as the solar panels are installed. Still, rate payers should not expect immediate returns.
 ''This type of investment is long term, so you're not going to see the benefits right away,'' said Upendra J. Chivukula, the chairman of the Telecommunications and Utilities Committee in the State Assembly. ''But if you don't do it now, you're never going to become energy independent.''

HEADLINE: For U.S., an Old Rivalry Resumes in Qualifiers

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
There will be nothing nuanced or refined on display Wednesday night in Columbus, Ohio, when the region's two burly soccer antagonists -- the United States and Mexico -- open the final round of World Cup qualifying.
 ''Like everybody, I was sitting there when we did the draw waiting to see how things go,'' United States Coach Bob Bradley said Monday in a conference call, referring to last November's draw, which was held in South Africa, the site of next year's World Cup finals. ''Initially, the idea of playing Mexico in the first game caught everyone by surprise. The odds were against that happening. Every time we play Mexico, there's a level of excitement. I spoke to the players afterward and they all talked about understanding how important it is representing the United States against Mexico. It's something to treasure.'' 
 The United States will open and close the final round of its 10 qualifying matches in the Concacaf region against Mexico, a slate that stretches from Wednesday in chilly Columbus to Aug. 12, when a game will probably be played at altitude in Mexico City. The United States has never won at Azteca Stadium, while Mexico has an 0-8-1 record on American soil since 1999. That includes two 2-0 losses to the United States in World Cup qualifiers, in 2001 and 2005. Perhaps the most notable game, and the one that still sticks in the craw of Mexican soccer fans, was the match in Jeonju, South Korea, where the United States ousted Mexico in the second round of the 2002 World Cup.
 ''It's interesting and ironic that we ended up playing them first,'' Bradley said. He added, ''For us, we have a good feeling playing in Columbus. We enjoy the crowd that comes to root us on and think the fact that it's a smaller stadium really ensures a great atmosphere.''
 In an effort to aid the team, which often plays home internationals with less than universal support, American soccer officials have asked fans to wear red. But as some fans have pointed out, the United States does not have a red jersey in its wardrobe. (The team's sponsor, Nike, briefly trotted out a retro red shirt before the 2006 World Cup.)
 Ten of 12 players Bradley has called in from outside the United States have arrived in Columbus; only Landon Donovan (on a loan spell in Germany with Bayern Munich) and Jose Francisco Torres, who plays in Mexico for Pachuca, have yet to arrive.
 Although the 20-man roster includes some of the United States' most promising young players -- including Jozy Altidore (Xerez of Spain), Robbie Rogers (Columbus of Major League Soccer) and Sacha Kljestan (Chivas USA of M.L.S.) -- Bradley will most likely stick with players with more experience at the senior international level.
 ''I think that throughout qualifying we have relied heavily on a core of veterans who have helped set the tone,'' Bradley said. ''They understand what these games are all about. In the first game of the final round against a rival like Mexico, that type of experience will be very important.''
 After the match against Mexico, the national team will not play again until its qualifier at El Salvador on March 28. It will then turn around quickly for a game against Trinidad and Tobago in Nashville on April 1. The United States will also play in the Concacaf Gold Cup and the FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa in the middle of the year.
 Bradley appears to be secure in his position, but the same cannot be said about Mexico's coach, Sven Goran Eriksson. Mexico stumbled into the final round on goal differential; lost an exhibition match to Eriksson's native Sweden several weeks ago; and is dealing with injuries (Andres Guardado), suspensions (Carlos Vela) and some players (Giovani dos Santos/Tottenham and Guillermo Franco/Villarreal) who have had limited playing time with their European club teams. 
 ''I'm sure, on the inside, that they have a good mind-set,'' Bradley said of Mexico. ''Eriksson has a record wherever he's coached of not allowing much that is flying around to interfere with the team's mentality.''
 Notes
 There are nine other World Cup qualifying matches Wednesday as the race to South Africa gets serious.
 The six teams in the Concacaf region begin the final round of regional qualifying. The top three finishers will advance to the finals, and the fourth-place team will play the fifth-place team from South America in a home-and-away series in November for another berth. The United States and Mexico are joined by Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Trinidad and Tobago.
 There are only two qualifying matches in Europe, where action does not begin in earnest until next month. But the Asian region has several interesting games: Australia at Japan; South Korea at Iran; and Saudi Arabia at North Korea. A victory by Australia, which is perfect after three matches, would nearly assure the team of a spot in South Africa.
 England will play Spain in a friendly in Seville, a high-profile match because Manager Fabio Capello has named David Beckham to the team. Beckham can tie Bobby Moore's record for international appearances, 108, for an English outfield player.
 Two managers of English Premier League teams found themselves on the unemployment line Monday. 
 Chelsea, which dropped to fourth place after a 0-0 draw against visiting Hull City over the weekend, fired Luiz Felipe Scolari. Scolari was a little more than halfway through his first season at Stamford Bridge. 
 On England's south coast, Tony Adams is out at Portsmouth after only 22 matches. Portsmouth won four matches under Adams and has dropped to 16th place after taking only 2 points from its last nine games.

HEADLINE: Recovery Bill Pared by Senate Nonetheless Offers Vast Sums for Education

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
The economic stimulus bill that is expected to win passage in the Senate on Tuesday would provide about $83 billion for child care, public schools and universities.
 That is a lot less than the $150 billion voted by the House, but would still account for a vast increase in the federal share of the nation's education spending. 
 If the bill passes the Senate, tough bargaining can be expected later this week between House and Senate negotiators over the Senate's decision to eliminate all of $20 billion in direct financing of school renovation, and over its trim of $40 billion from the House's proposed $79 billion stabilization fund for states, much of which would be spent on schools and state universities. 
 The stabilization fund is intended to help states and school districts meet payrolls as tax revenue plummets in the recession. The 50 states and Puerto Rico, which on average spend roughly a third of all revenue on education, are facing budget shortfalls totaling some $132 billion this fiscal year and next, according to a report issued on Jan. 30 by the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Monday that the $39 billion in aid to states proposed in the Senate bill was ''not nearly as much as we need.'' Addressing an audience of college administrators, Mr. Duncan said a forthcoming University of Washington study estimated that ''almost 600,000 education jobs are at risk of state budget cuts.''
 The Obama administration and Democratic lawmakers proposed unprecedented levels of education spending in both the House and Senate stimulus bills. And even after cuts made Friday by a bipartisan group led by Senators Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, the Senate bill would still provide $80 billion in emergency spending for public schools and state universities, well above the Department of Education's current $59 billion discretionary budget.
 Both the House and the Senate would hugely increase spending on Title I, a program of specialized classroom efforts to help educate poor children, and on education for disabled children. 
 The House bill would raise Title I spending over two years by $13 billion; for the current fiscal year, spending would rise to $20 billion from about $14.5 billion. The two-year increase in the Senate bill would be $11.4 billion.
 Both the House and Senate bills would also increase federal spending on special education by $13 billion over two years.
 Spending on Pell Grants, the most important federal program of aid to college students, would also rise. The House bill would raise Pell spending to $27 billion this year, from about $19 billion. The Senate version would increase it a bit less. 
 Aside from their differing levels of aid to the states, the two bills differ most strikingly in school modernization financing, with the House legislation's $20 billion unmatched by any money in the Senate version.
 On Sunday, Lawrence H. Summers, director of President Obama's National Economic Council, called such financing ''absolutely essential,'' suggesting that it would be a priority of the administration during this week's negotiations between the House and the Senate.
 As for the breakdown in spending by state, the House bill would increase it in New York by $9.2 billion for this year and next, the Senate version by $5.2 billion, according to the National Education Association, the largest teachers' union. 
 In New Jersey, the union calculates, the increase would be $3.3 billion under the House bill, $1.9 billion under the Senate's. In Connecticut, the House bill's increase would be $1.3 billion, the Senate's $700 million.

HEADLINE: Hard Times for Informal Home of Wyoming Politics

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: CHEYENNE, Wyo. 

 BODY:
In a state too big, rough and rural for most people to think about going home at the end of a day of lawmaking at the State Capitol, the Hitching Post Inn was the place to hang one's hat. 
 And the Hitch, as lawmakers came to call it, in turn became more than just a hotel. It insinuated itself into how the State Legislature worked by creating an informal space where lawmakers in their socks, sometimes with a highball in hand, could wander down the hall and knock on the door of a neighbor and talk through the day. 
 The Hitch's owners once boasted that more law was made there than under the Capitol dome if only because of propinquity and its rituals: a big restaurant table always on reserve, a staff required to memorize the name and face of every lawmaker, and rock-bottom room rates for senators and representatives, to lure in the lobbyists who paid more.
 ''For years it served as the legislative dormitory,'' said Senator Charles Scott, a Republican and cattle rancher who has stayed at the Hitch at session time for all but a few of his 31 years in the Legislature.
 Until last week. 
 A bankruptcy filing last Wednesday by the hotel's owners -- $3.6 million more in liabilities than assets -- coincided with a grim-faced announcement in the Senate chamber that afternoon that the hotel's electricity might soon be turned off. Senate leaders allowed an extra-long lunch hour for anyone needing to make alternative arrangements.
 In some ways, the Hitch's role was already fading by the time its troubles boiled publicly to the surface. Competition had wooed away some people. New owners, who took over after the last member of the hotel's founding family died in 2006, did not inspire the same loyalty, lawmakers said. At the start of this year's session, only about 18 lawmakers out of 90 were still there, down from perhaps 60 to 70 a few years back.
 Lawmakers said they believed that internal troubles or mismanagement was probably a greater culprit than recession; Wyoming, buoyed by oil and gas production, has the lowest unemployment rate in the nation.
 But the shock of the Hitch's stumble was no less raw. That one hotel could become an adjunct to legislative life is in some ways a Western concept. Big states with small-city capitals -- and in the past, far fewer lodging choices -- tended to foster herd behavior almost by necessity. And congregating became part of the political culture. In Helena, Mont., the Placer Hotel became the Legislature's default bedroom and watering hole. In Bismarck, N.D., the Patterson partnered up the capital's political-social dance.
 Whether good law and public policy resulted is another question, but there is no doubt, lawmakers here said, that coziness has its consequences, for good or ill. Lobbyists living down the hall have access and familiarity day and night, and evening functions at the Hitch bar -- some still recalled decades later with rolled-eyes or laughter -- took a toll as well.
 ''The upshot is that it's a tamer Legislature -- tamer and more well behaved, but a whole lot less fun,'' said Representative Ross Diercks, a Democrat first elected to the State House in 1992. 
 But veterans like Senator John J. Hines, the Senate president, who has slept seasonally at the Hitch for his entire 25-year legislative career -- and who said last week that he planned to stay put, at least for now -- said he thought something had been lost, too.
 Democrats and Republicans rubbing shoulders on a daily basis, chatting over breakfast, can break down barriers and allow people to see one another as human beings rather than as political opponents, Mr. Hines said. The Hitch and an older hotel, the Plains, which served a similar function in the early 1900s, were a bridge that does not exist now.
 ''We don't get to know each other quite as well,'' said Mr. Hines, a Republican. ''It's harder to be disagreeable with a friend.''
 At its core, the relationship between the Hitch and the Legislature was always about smart business, of course, at least from the hotel's perspective. The Hitch deliberately went after lawmakers with a bidding war in the 1960s and '70s, taking a loss on rooms for House and Senate members, at one point charging as little as $5 a night, knowing that a broader payoff in receptions and parties would follow from cornering the legislative market. 
 But the business plan had political implications from the start, too. In the mid-1960s, for example, a delegation from northern Wyoming -- a part of the state that had long chafed over the political dominance of the southern counties in the Legislature -- broke tradition and moved to the Hitch from the Plains. And around the same time, a rising young state representative, Ed Herschler, a Democrat who later served three terms as governor, from 1975 to 1987, staked out the Hitch as new turf and presided there throughout his rise to power.
 By the end of last week, the hotel was still open, the lights still on. A lawyer for the Hitch, Joseph J. DiPasquale, said the bankruptcy put a stay on payment of debts like the electrical bill, currently in arrears by about $38,000. 
 ''The plan is to reorganize the Hitching Post,'' Mr. DiPasquale said. ''The plan is continue operations.''
 Some lawmakers even think the hotel could reverse Cheyenne's legislative diaspora and become the center of social gravity once more, like the old days.
 ''It would take a price war,'' Mr. Scott said. ''But then, that's how they got it in the first place.''

HEADLINE: Retiring From G.M., Lutz Holds Little Back

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Robert Lutz, General Motors' vice chairman, has never been shy about speaking his mind. 
 And on Monday, the day he announced he would retire at the end of this year, he did just that.
 For all of G.M.'s efforts to streamline its operations in recent years, he said, the company was unlikely to ever win over its critics in Congress. 
 ''We are a country that hates its own industry,'' he said. ''The auto industry may be partly at fault for its situation, but not entirely.'' 
 Mr. Lutz, who turns 77 on Thursday, said the automaker's viability plan -- to be submitted Feb. 17 to Washington -- would make a persuasive case that a leaner, more focused G.M. can survive with temporary federal assistance, and that G.M. would secure the last $4 billion loan of a $13.4 billion aid package.
 Mr. Lutz was not part of G.M.'s lobbying efforts late last year to secure the federal loans that so far have helped it avoid bankruptcy.
 But when G.M.'s chairman, Rick Wagoner, came under harsh criticism from lawmakers during Congressional hearings, Mr. Lutz made clear during interviews that he was chafing at how Detroit was attacked for its mounting losses and sliding sales.
 At the time, he argued that the faltering economy and tight credit were principal causes of Detroit's hardship. And on Monday, he said that Toyota and Nissan were now reporting big losses tied to the worst downturn in vehicle sales in more than 25 years.
 ''If this is just the beginning of a very catastrophic economic situation, then all bets are off for everybody, and that includes our most esteemed Japanese competitors,'' he said.
 In its request for loans in December, G.M. said it would drastically downsize its operations in order to become a profitable company that can repay the United States taxpayers.
 Mr. Lutz said that he had no direct knowledge of talks between G.M. and its bondholders to reorganize its debt, or discussions with the United Automobile Workers to reduce labor costs. But he expressed confidence that all the parties would make sacrifices to keep G.M. out of bankruptcy.
 ''I am convinced that when everyone is staring at the reality of the situation, and also staring at the alternative, that they will make the right decisions,'' he said.
 Mr. Lutz, a former Marine fighter pilot, will be stepping down after a 46-year automotive career, with stints at several carmakers before G.M., including Chrysler, Ford Motor and BMW.
 At Chrysler in the 1990s, Mr. Lutz championed products like the Dodge Viper muscle car, the brawny Ram pickup, and the PT Cruiser retrostyled wagon.
 Since joining G.M. in 2001, he has integrated the automaker's sprawling global product teams, helped produce some hits like the new Chevrolet Malibu, and has been a driving force behind the battery-powered Chevrolet Volt, which G.M. has said would go on sale in 2010.
 At various points in his career, Mr. Lutz has been a lightning rod for environmentalists. He once said ''cow flatulence'' was a bigger contributor to global warming than automobile emissions, and last year pronounced climate change to be a ''crock.''
 Yet he often turned his caustic wit on himself and his own company. When asked to assess G.M.'s leadership position in Detroit's Big Three, he said, ''It's similar to being named valedictorian at the reform school.''
 His outsize personality, however, was matched by his skill in orchestrating the design and development of new cars and trucks, said Joseph Phillippi, principal in the firm AutoTrends, in Short Hills, N.J.
 ''I know the media will miss his pithy comments and iconoclastic proclamations, but Bob was so much more than that,'' he said.
 Mr. Lutz will give up his duties as head of global product development on April 1, but will remain a vice chairman and senior adviser until the end of the year.
 G.M. said its board has elected Thomas Stephens, currently an executive vice president for engines and quality, to be Mr. Lutz's successor.

HEADLINE: Losses Mount on Credit Cards for Retailers

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Though only a small corner of the credit card market, cards that can be used only at a single retailer are quickly turning into a big headache for their issuers.
 The cards, known in the industry as private label credit cards, tend to be held by riskier borrowers with fewer credit options. Losses on the cards are rising at a faster pace than the broader credit card market -- reaching a three-year high of 10.51 percent in January, according to Fitch Ratings, up 44 percent from a year ago. That compares with general credit card losses of 7.5 percent, up 40 percent from the year before. 
 While private label cards account for only about 11 percent of all credit card loans outstanding, their troubles offer a window into the deteriorating finances of some of the most distressed Americans. And the losses may prove to be a warning of deeper problems ahead for general cards as the economy weakens and unemployment climbs. 
 ''The higher rate of charge-offs on private label reflects the impact that the economic downturn is having on all customer classes, with a particular strain on lower and middle-class income households,'' said John Grund, a partner at First Annapolis, an advisory firm focused on the payments industry. ''The next 12 months, 2009 into 2010, just doesn't look real pretty as the jobless figures escalate.''
 Perhaps the best indication of the strains on the market is that the largest issuer of private label cards, General Electric, has indicated that it would like to quit the business altogether. 
 G.E., which has a $32 billion portfolio of cards for companies like Wal-Mart and Lowe's, put its unit up for sale in December 2007 but abandoned the effort in September after it failed to find a buyer. 
 The second-biggest issuer, Citigroup, which lends on behalf of retailers like Macy's and Sears, listed its unit as one of its noncore businesses in an announcement last month that it would split the company in two. 
 The troubles in the private label card business may also further affect sales at retailers, which have already been reeling as consumers have cut back. Mr. Grund estimated that 30 to 40 percent of department store sales went on private label cards. 
 ''Credit-tightening will shrink the amount of private label credit outstanding over time, but it will have an immediate impact on retail sales,'' he added. ''Consumers need financing to buy merchandise, especially big-ticket items, and issuers can cut too far to reduce loss exposure, making the recession even more problematic.'' 
 Of course, some retailers, especially those that cater to more affluent consumers, are experiencing fewer losses, Nordstrom among them. And while some retailers continue to offer the cards at their registers in exchange for a same-day discount, the lenders have made it more difficult to qualify, much as they have done with traditional credit cards. 
 Fitch, which tracks $72 billion in receivables issued by banks on behalf of retailers, expects private label card losses to surpass 12 percent by midyear and losses on general cardholders with solid credit to reach 8 percent. 
 ''Credit quality will continue to deteriorate for general-purpose cards, and at a rapid, more urgent pace for retail cards,'' said Michael Dean, managing director at Fitch.
 Though there are exceptions, private label cardholders tend to have less robust credit histories, and thus fewer pieces of plastic to choose from than the general population. They tend to use private label cards to finance bigger-ticket items like appliances and jewelry, experts said. 
 In contrast, traditional credit cards are typically held by consumers with stronger credit histories who seek rewards, like airline miles, or simply prefer the convenience of cards. 
 Delinquent payments on private label cards tend to be about 2 to 3 percentage points higher than on more widely used cards, card experts said. 
 ''If you have a compromised economy, who do you pay last?'' Robert Hammer, president of R. K. Hammer, a credit card advisory firm, said. ''You pay the private label card and maybe your dentist'' after all the other bills.
 To balance their increased risks, private label issuers charge higher interest rates -- from 21 to 24 percent on average, compared with an average of 14 to 17 percent on traditional credit cards, experts said.
 Private card issuers build in other protections, too. ''Limits tend to be lower,'' said Steven Jacowitz, a director at Auriemma Consulting Group, and ''you can't get a cash advance, you can't do a balance transfer and you can't use it outside of the store.''
 For Citigroup, private label and co-branded cards represent about 37 percent of its $149 billion card business. Losses on those cards totaled 9.86 percent at the end of the fourth quarter. And 3.26 percent of its loans were more than 90 days past due. 
 Two of the larger retailers that still operate their own card businesses, the Target Corporation and Nordstrom, have changed their policies, in part to deal with the deepening recession.
 Target, which sold a 47 percent stake in its loans to JPMorgan Chase in May, has about $9.27 billion in loans outstanding. About 6 percent, or roughly $500 million, of the loans are on store-only cards; the rest of the loans are on Target Visa cards. 
 For December, Target said it had annualized losses of 12.28 percent. About 8.44 percent of loans were more than 30 days past due. From the end of 2007 through September, Target had cut total credit lines by 14.6 percent.
 Target's biggest losses first came in areas with the largest drop in home values, according to its third-quarter earnings conference call transcript. Now, those problems are in wider swaths.
 Because most of Nordstrom's customers have top-notch credit, losses in its $1.9 billion portfolio, which includes Nordstrom private label and Nordstrom Visa cards, have not been as severe as those of other private labels. Its losses were about 5.7 percent of its portfolio for the quarter ended Nov. 1, and 3.2 percent of loans were more than 30 days past due.
 Whether their credit lines are shrinking or not, many consumers are choosing to keep a tighter grip on their wallets. 
 ''When everyone is fearful about whether they will have a job in the next year or so,'' said Marc G. Sczesnak, president of TD Retail Card Services, which issues cards for small and midsize retailers, ''they are managing their personal balance sheets and reining in spending that is not absolutely necessary.''

HEADLINE: Roche Seeks to Buy Rest of Genentech

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Genentech's directors told Roche in December that they would consider selling their company for $112 a share, an amount much higher than Roche was willing to pay, according to details of the negotiations made public on Monday. 
 The details, the first public indication of the behind-the-scenes discussions between the companies, are contained in documents related to the tender offer by Roche on Monday. Roche is seeking to buy the 44 percent of Genentech it does not own for $86.50 a share in cash, or about $42 billion. 
 Unable to reach a deal with the Genentech board after first proposing an $89-a-share takeover last July, Roche late last month said it would go directly to Genentech's stockholders through a tender offer. 
 Roche also said in the filings on Monday that after buying tendered shares, it planned to exercise its right to increase its representation on Genentech's board to be proportional to its stake in the company, which would give it a majority on the board. It now holds 3 of 7 seats. 
 A special committee of Genentech's board that has been dealing with Roche urged shareholders on Monday to take no action on the tender offer. The committee said it would issue a formal position on the offer within 10 business days. The committee previously criticized Roche's intention to make a tender offer as a ''unilateral and opportunistic step.'' 
 Genentech's shares closed at $82.70 Monday, down 30 cents, but recovered the same amount in after-hours trading. 
 In Monday's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Roche said Goldman Sachs, which has been representing the Genentech board committee, initially refused to place a value on the company until Roche raised its offer. 
 Greenhill & Company, which represented Roche, told Goldman as early as Oct. 2 that Roche was getting frustrated and might resort to other options. In November, Genentech presented a long-range business forecast, which was used to justify a value of the company at $112 to $115 a share. 
 Roche said that forecast was significantly more optimistic than Genentech's previous long-range plan, which had been provided to Roche in June. Roche said it disagreed with many of the assumptions in the new Genentech forecast. It also said the economic downturn and credit crisis had ''fundamentally altered'' expectations and valuations placed on Genentech and other biotechnology companies since it made its initial offer. 
 Roche said it was somewhat less optimistic than Genentech that Genentech's drug Avastin would be successful in trials testing it as a treatment for colon and lung cancer after surgery. The drug currently is approved only to treat cancers that have recurred or spread. Postsurgical use could add more than $1 billion to sales of Avastin, which were $2.7 billion in the United States in 2008. 
 Analysts expect many stockholders will not tender their shares, on the expectation that if Avastin succeeds in the adjuvant colon cancer trial in April, Genentech's shares will shoot up well past Roche's offer. 
 The tender offer expires at midnight March 12, but Roche has the option to extend it.

HEADLINE: Top Enforcer At the S.E.C. Steps Down

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Signaling that it is time for a new cop to walk the Wall Street beat, the Securities and Exchange Commission accepted the resignation Monday of its top enforcement officer amid blistering criticism that the commission had failed to protect investors in recent years.
 Linda Chatman Thomsen, the embattled director who had led the agency's enforcement division since 2005, tendered her resignation to Mary L. Schapiro, the commission's new chairwoman. A replacement for Ms. Thomsen, 54, has not been named. 
 Critics say her unit failed to detect and prosecute improprieties among mortgage companies, the nation's brokerage firms and powerful investment advisers and hedge funds that led to the financial crisis. 
 In recent weeks, the chorus grew as Congress took Ms. Thomsen to task for turning a blind eye to a series of tips years ago that outlined the huge Ponzi scheme apparently conducted by Bernard L. Madoff, the trader and investment adviser arrested in December. 
 Responding to the withering comments, Ms. Schapiro has announced that she will streamline some procedures. The agency will eliminate the requirement, put in place during her predecessor's tenure, that commissioners approve all enforcement actions before they are elevated from an inquiry to an investigation and before subpoenas go out. 
 The enforcement division, which investigates and files civil suits against securities law violators, has also come under criticism from inside the S.E.C. The most recent report from its inspector general reprimanded the enforcement unit for its ''common practice'' of allowing outside lawyers representing people before the commission to communicate with supervising staff lawyers who are investigating the matters. Such communication may be inappropriate because significant, nonpublic information about investigations could be disclosed, the inspector general's report said. 
 Still, some investor advocates gave Ms. Thomsen the benefit of the doubt, arguing that her task as enforcement chief was especially difficult because she reported to a chairman, Christopher Cox, who had little appetite for regulating. 
 ''The record of enforcement in recent years has not been a good one,'' said Barbara Roper, director of investment protection for the Consumer Federation of America. ''But the entire message coming from S.E.C. leadership in recent years was to back off from enforcement, so it's very difficult to know what kind of enforcement division head she might have been under different circumstances.''
 One legal and financial expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of his continuing work with the agency, said he recently had taken a detailed tip to the commission involving improprieties in the bond market but found that officials he encountered were demoralized. 
 ''I got on the conference call with the team assigned to it and they were so apathetic and uninterested,'' he said. ''They didn't want another case. What was the point? Now we have to write another memo and send it upstairs.'' 
 Shoring up morale at the agency's enforcement division should be a top priority for Ms. Schapiro, said Mercer E. Bullard, a securities law professor at the University of Mississippi. ''Linda Thomsen was in a tough position because she had a boss who was willing to publicly undercut the staff on enforcement issues,'' he said. ''Even though there were a lot of enforcement issues during her tenure, publicly pointing fingers at staff is never acceptable.''
 In accepting the resignation, Ms. Schapiro issued a statement praising her performance. ''Linda's achievements have been nothing short of extraordinary, even heroic, in an era of unprecedented challenges in our securities markets,'' she said.
 Ms. Thomsen said in her own statement that working at the commission was ''an extraordinary privilege.'' Both declined to comment further.
 A leading candidate to replace Ms. Thomsen is Robert Khuzami, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan who has been a lawyer at Deutsche Bank since 2002. 
 But his work at the big foreign firm worries Mr. Bullard. ''The issue going in is this: is his perspective too tainted?'' he asked. ''I think the taint comes from having been an in-house lawyer at a securities firm. They tend to have a less objective perspective on the true culpability of their employers.''
 As the nation's top securities cop, the S.E.C.'s new enforcement chief must be an investor advocate first and foremost, Ms. Roper said. ''In this environment, with all the questions about the independence of our regulatory agencies and the degree to which they serve the industry instead of investors, symbolic gestures are important,'' she said. ''I would like to see people who've earned their reputations as investor advocates in some of those key positions, and enforcement is at the top of the list.''

HEADLINE: Schooled in the Art of Tending to Ailing Bodies

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
As a child, Scott Young was into kung fu, tennis and horseback riding, though not without a few hitches: His parents pulled him from riding for fear of spinal injury, and he hurt his arm playing tennis. Now 25, Dr. Young tends to other people's injuries as a physical therapist at Sports Physical Therapy of New York near Times Square.
 Most common cases: Knees, low back, shoulders, cervical spines and then ankles. And then you get hips, necks, elbows and, I guess, hands and wrists. In New York, there are lots of weekend warriors and tons of runners running on the pavement, so you have a lot of kneecaps out of alignment. 
 Other talents: I played piano from kindergarten through college. My favorite piece is ''On My Own,'' from Les Miserables. It's really nice, though I'm a horrible singer. I'd be one of those outcasts on ''American Idol.'' 
 The ''aha'' moment: When I was volunteering in high school, getting hours to beef up my resume for college. I volunteered at a few offices and the P.T. department of our local hospital, North Shore-Long Island Jewish: Glen Cove Hospital. It's very hands on, and about getting people back to function. 
 Getting buff: I was a tiny, scrawny Asian kid in high school, probably 5-2 and 100 pounds soaking wet. But then I started going to the gym, and I got buffer. At my most, I was probably 5-6 and 165 pounds. Grad school didn't let me go to the gym so much, so I shrank down to 150-ish. 
 And now? Since my job is in the gym every day, I have no excuses. I'm, ehhhh, 150-ish now and trying to get back into better shape. 
 Family trajectory: I'm an only child. My parents are originally from Hong Kong. They met in Oklahoma, at Oklahoma Baptist University, and then moved to New York. My dad works in the toy industry; he makes posable dolls. My mother's a librarian at New York Institute of Technology. She also co-wrote a series of books called the ''Best of Nursing Humor.'' 
 Getting schooled: At N.Y.U., I was an economics major; I thought it would help me open up a practice. Then I got a doctorate in physical therapy at Columbia University. They call it the 19th grade. High school then college for four years and then grad school for three.
 Vices: I eat too much junk food. I love chocolate. I love ice cream. Fried chicken. Sometimes I get the biggest cravings when I watch ''The Biggest Loser.'' I have a pretty fast metabolism, luckily. Though my girlfriend gets grossed out sometimes. 
 Oddest work request: A woman called my boss complaining that she'd fallen down a flight of stairs. It ended up being two steps. But she said she was in agony. Then she showed up with a prescription from her doctor, who had diagnosed her with a bruise. She wasn't really limping. I tried to convince her that P.T. wasn't really medically necessary. We gave her some exercises to create balance and suggested she use ice. That's what keeps it interesting -- you meet all these quirky patients. At our graduation, someone said, ''You'll learn far more from the patients than what you can ever teach them.'' And it's kind of true.

HEADLINE: You Can't Sell News by the Slice

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KINSLEY. 
Michael Kinsley is the founding editor of Slate magazine.

 BODY:
SOMEWHERE at Microsoft, there is a closet packed with leftover Slate umbrellas -- a monument to the folly of asking people to pay for what they read on the Internet. These umbrellas -- a $20 value! -- were the premium we offered to people who would pay $19 for a year's subscription to Slate, the Microsoft-owned online magazine (later purchased by The Washington Post). We were quite self-righteous about the alleged principle that ''content'' should not be free. The word itself was an insult -- as if we were just making Jell-O salad in order to sell Tupperware.
 The experiment lasted about a year. Still, every so often the dream of getting people to pay recurs. It's recurring now because of the newspaper crisis: they have been hemorrhaging subscribers and advertisers for their paper editions, even as they give away their contents online. In the current Time, its former managing editor, Walter Isaacson, urges a solution: ''micropayments.'' 
 Micropayments are systems that make it easy to pay small amounts of money. (Your subway card is an example.) You could pay a nickel to read an article, or a dime for a whole day's newspaper. 
 Well, maybe. But it would be a first. Newspaper readers have never paid for the content (words and photos). What they have paid for is the paper that content is printed on. A week of The Washington Post weighs about eight pounds and costs $1.81 for new subscribers, home-delivered. With newsprint (that's the paper, not the ink) costing around $750 a metric ton, or 34 cents a pound, Post subscribers are getting almost a dollar's worth of paper free every week -- not to mention the ink, the delivery, etc. The Times is more svelte and more expensive. It might even have a viable business model if it could sell the paper with nothing written on it. A more promising idea is the opposite: give away the content without the paper. In theory, a reader who stops paying for the physical paper but continues to read the content online is doing the publisher a favor. 
 If the only effect of the Internet on newspapers was a drastic reduction in their distribution costs, publishers could probably keep a bit of that savings, rather than passing all of it and more on to the readers. But the Internet has also increased competition -- not just from new media but among newspapers as well. Or rather, it has introduced competition into an industry legendary for its monopoly power.
 Just a few years ago, there was no sweeter perch in American capitalism than ownership of the only newspaper in town. Now, every English-language newspaper is in direct competition with every other. Millions of Americans get their news online from The Guardian, which is published in London. This competition, and not some kind of petulance or laziness or addled philosophy, is what keeps readers from shelling out for news.
 Micropayment advocates imagine extracting as much as $2 a month from readers. The Times sells just over a million daily papers. If every one of those million buyers went online and paid $2 a month, that would be $24 million a year. Even with the economic crisis, paper and digital advertising in The Times brought in about $1 billion last year. Circulation brought in $668 million. Two bucks per reader per month is not going to save newspapers. 
 And the harsh truth is that the typical American newspaper is an anachronism. It is an artifact from a time when chopping down trees was essential to telling the news, and when you couldn't get The New York Times or The Washington Post closer to your bed than the front door, where the local paper lies, sopping wet. 
 The Times, The Post and a few others probably will survive. When the recession ends, advertising will come back, with fewer places to go. There will be a couple of surprises -- local papers that execute their transfer to the Web so brilliantly that they will earn a national readership (like the old Manchester Guardian in England). Or some Web site might mutate into a real Web newspaper. 
 With even half a dozen papers, the American newspaper industry will be more competitive than it was when there were hundreds. Competition will keep the Baghdad bureaus open and the investigative units stoked with dudgeon. Competition is growing as well among Web sites that think there is money to be made performing the local paper's local functions. One or two of these will turn out to be right. And then, who will pay even a nickel for the hometown rag?

HEADLINE: Plan to Raise Taxes on the Rich Is Gaining Momentum

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
A plan to raise income taxes on wealthy New Yorkers is gaining momentum in the State Legislature as lawmakers continue to grapple with the state's gaping budget deficit.
 A group of Senate Democrats plans to introduce a bill on Tuesday that would impose an income tax of 10.3 percent on the highest-earning New Yorkers, a rise of 3.45 percentage points, and increase taxes on all households that earn more than $250,000 a year. 
 The plan, which supporters estimated could bring in up to $6 billion annually to the depleted state treasury, is one of several options Albany lawmakers are considering as an alternative to the reductions in social services and smaller, more focused tax increases that Gov. David A. Paterson has proposed. 
 State legislators and the governor are finding themselves under increasing pressure -- from the state's powerful labor unions and liberal groups in particular -- to raise taxes on the wealthy.
 Although an income tax increase on the state's highest-earning residents passed the State Assembly last year, its fate in the Senate is less certain. Republicans, who controlled the chamber until January, blocked it last year. 
 With the Democrats now in control, the bill seems to stand a better chance of passing. But not all 32 Democratic members have signed on, including Malcolm A. Smith, the majority leader, who said on Monday that he was not convinced a tax increase was the right solution for New York's budget crisis.
 ''Let's talk about what the problem is,'' Mr. Smith said to reporters as he was leaving a conference of the New York Bankers Association in downtown Albany on Monday afternoon. ''The problem is foreclosures. The problem is a $15 billion deficit. The problem is trying to figure out how do we create jobs in this economy. So in that regard, I'm not sure if taxes is the way you do that.''
 Among the bill's supporters, there is a sense that they face considerable -- but not necessarily insurmountable -- skepticism from Senate Democrats.
 ''By introducing this bill, we are opening the conversation,'' said Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Democrat who represents parts of the Upper West Side and the Bronx and is the bill's lead sponsor. ''But this is an issue that gathers support the longer people think about it.''
 Called the Fair Share Tax Reform Act of 2009, the plan laid out in Mr. Schneiderman's bill is an expanded version of the so-called millionaires' tax the Assembly passed last year. It would create three new tax brackets at the highest end of the state's income tax scale and apply to taxable income, not gross income.
 Starting this calendar year, New York households that earn more than $250,000 in taxable income a year would see their tax rate rise to 8.25 percent from 6.85 percent -- the highest rate currently paid. Those who earn more than $500,000 would pay 8.97 percent; and those who earn more than $1 million would pay 10.3 percent.
 Although the previous debate in the Assembly has centered on raising taxes on people who earn more than $1 million a year, it appears that Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, is open to the idea of expanding the Assembly's proposal to people who earn less. On Monday, Mr. Silver said he planned to discuss that question with Assembly Democrats.
 ''The real question becomes how broad-based is the tax,'' Mr. Silver said. ''It's conceivable that in the end result we adopt something that may include people who earn less than a million dollars.''
 Another question mark concerns Governor Paterson. He has sent mixed signals in private and in public on the matter, saying on the one hand that he thinks raising taxes would cause wealthy people to move out of New York, and on the other hand that all options to plug the budget gap have to be on the table.
 Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Paterson on Monday was noncommittal. The governor has proposed a range of tax increases, including a tax on sugary sodas and juice drinks and sales taxes on music and video downloads, 
 ''As with every piece of legislation, Governor Paterson will review it if it passes both houses of the Legislature,'' said the spokeswoman, Marissa Shorenstein. ''The best way to close our $13 billion deficit and return this state to fiscal health is to focus on recurring reductions across every area of spending.'' 
 Senate Republicans do not appear to be giving any ground.
 ''There's not a lot of excitement in the conference for any tax right now,'' Thomas W. Libous, the Republican deputy minority leader, said on Monday.
 The bill was still circulating on Monday evening. To try to persuade Senate Democrats and Republicans, supporters of the tax increase said they would frame their debate in philosophical terms, an approach they said appears to be working.
 ''No one likes to pay taxes, but this is the group that is able to bear a little bit more of the burden,'' said Dan Cantor, executive director of the Working Families Party, which has been aggressively lobbying for the tax increase. ''It's common sense and its morally just.''
 He added: ''We know there's a big fight ahead.''

HEADLINE: SUNY Chancellor to Build A Strategy by Consensus

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Nancy L. Zimpher, who is leaving the University of Cincinnati to become the chancellor of the State University of New York, has a long and ambitious to-do list: raise academic quality, find new funds for research, improve student transfer options and develop a strategic plan.
 But topping her agenda as she prepares to take over the largest university system in the nation under a single governing board, with 440,000 students, is perhaps a more daunting goal: personally visit all 64 campuses in the first few months of her tenure -- from the sprawling research universities to the smallest technical colleges. 
 ''I can't imagine not starting that way,'' said Dr. Zimpher, who is expected to be approved by SUNY's full board of trustees Tuesday afternoon. ''I want a mental map. It's such a great way to meet people where they are -- not just the campus itself, but the community which it serves.''
 In a wide-ranging interview on the eve of her appointment as chancellor, Dr. Zimpher, a 62-year-old Midwesterner who can play the dulcimer and dabbles in watercolors (mostly of lighthouses), spoke on Monday about her vision for SUNY at a time of economic turmoil, as the system faces potentially devastating budget cuts.
 She discussed how her experience as president of the University of Cincinnati, where she has led the 37,000-member student body since 2003, might translate to a much larger system. And she gave a preview of the case she planned to make to Gov. David A. Paterson and the State Legislature as she seeks to bolster SUNY.
 ''Being the best state university system in the country, and internationally recognized as a model, means that we have to work with the State of New York to view investments in SUNY as investments in New York's economy,'' said Dr. Zimpher, who was accompanied by Carl T. Hayden, chairman of the board of trustees, in her first interview since being tapped to lead the system.
 ''We produce students, we produce jobs, we serve communities,'' she added. ''So, yes, we're in a rough spot as a country and certainly in Ohio and New York, but I continue to believe that higher education is the economic engine for the future of this state. I think we can grow this state out of its revenue challenges.''
 The appointment of Dr. Zimpher, who is the first woman to lead SUNY, comes nearly two years after the previous chancellor stepped down. The search for a successor was bogged down, in part, by the unexpected resignation of Gov. Eliot Spitzer. During that time, the system has absorbed more than $200 million in state cuts, a significant portion of the state's $1.4 billion annual outlay.
 The leadership vacuum and financial strains have coincided with an ambitious blueprint for the future of SUNY and the City University of New York. In a report released last summer, the New York State Commission on Higher Education called for billions of dollars in new investments for the two systems, to update their campuses and hire 2,000 full-time faculty members, including more than 250 internationally recognized researchers.
 Dr. Zimpher and Mr. Hayden both said the report was still a valuable document, but unlikely to be acted on immediately. ''We haven't forgotten it,'' Mr. Hayden said. ''We may not do it this year, but together Nancy and this board will bring the promise of that plan to life.''
 Dr. Zimpher said she had read the report ''through several times,'' adding: ''We aren't going to step back from our aspirations. This is a great system, and it can be greater.''
 Colleagues at the University of Cincinnati, which includes 16 colleges, schools and divisions, praised Dr. Zimpher for addressing financial problems there -- specifically, reversing a tradition of deficit spending and tackling what one professor called a ''mountain of debt.'' Others said she took pains to build a consensus in the process of creating an academic strategy, called ''UC/21: Defining the New Urban Research University.''
 Dr. Zimpher said she intended to develop a ''home-grown'' strategic plan for SUNY, perhaps as early as the spring of 2010, after consulting with campus presidents, faculty members, students, alumni, business leaders and policy makers. 
 The plan for the University of Cincinnati ''helped us stay on course and stay focused and measure our progress,'' she said, adding that a SUNY plan would serve as a ''road map for the next five years'' and would ''look forward to the five years after that.''
 Dr. Zimpher also made her mark in Cincinnati by standing up to a wildly successful basketball coach, Bob Huggins, whose players frequently got into trouble and who himself was arrested in 2004 on a drunken-driving charge. She forced him out the following year, after declaring that ''character counts.''
 Mr. Hayden, who has overseen the search for a chancellor, seemed visibly relieved to have finally identified a new leader. ''We saw what great talent looks like,'' he said of Dr. Zimpher. ''The combination that really attracted our attention was the ability to collaborate and to remain decisive. Often they're contradictory, but in this woman, they're not.''

HEADLINE: Stimulus Bill Bears Imprint of Technology

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
To rally support for his administration's economic recovery bill recently, President Obama invited about a dozen chief executives, seven of them from technology and energy companies, to the Oval Office.
 Some of their industries' top lobbyists, meanwhile, gathered in another office where Jason Furman, a top White House economic adviser, delivered a private briefing for groups expected to benefit most from the stimulus bill. 
 While much of the sprawling $800 billion legislation consists of tax cuts and broad spending increases for existing programs, like $27 billion on highways and $8.4 billion on public transit, the biggest outlay on new initiatives is essentially a technology industry wish list: in the Senate version, about $7 billion for expanding high-speed Internet access, some $20 billion for building a so-called smart grid power network and $20 billion for digitizing health records. 
 To many on K Street, the stimulus bill was the clearest guide to the new administration's closest friends in the business world. What oil was to President Bush, some say, clean energy and technology are to the Obama White House. 
 ''We have a president who gets it,'' said Dean Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, which recently identified the Senate initiatives in a short list of its top priorities.
 A close look at the history of the stimulus bill -- the first major product of the new administration -- shows that the industries that stand to gain most from the proposed legislation were also working to help shape it even before Mr. Obama had won the election.
 For months, the industry officials had been talking with Obama advisers about how to use taxpayer aid to jump-start the economy while laying the groundwork for both the new president's and their own goals of building a high-tech infrastructure. 
 Mr. Obama's advisers say that the administration was only following through on the public promises he made in a campaign that began with a call two years ago to curb America's dependence on foreign oil and extend broadband access ''through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America.'' 
 And they emphasized that Mr. Obama had taken unusual steps to disclose what those firms were saying, like posting any proposals submitted to the transition on its Web site, in contrast to the Bush administration's fight to keep secret how fossil fuel company executives shaped its energy policy in 2001.
 ''Whatever they shared, we put out there so the public could see it,'' said John Podesta, president of the liberal Center for American Progress and co-chairman of the transition.
 Campaign finance records also show that executives at many of the energy and technology companies that stand to profit from the stimulus bill were also big contributors to Mr. Obama's campaign. His promises about a ''smart grid'' and universal broadband dovetailed with the dreams of many in the technology industry, as well as allied fields like renewable energy and electric power.
 Drawing on renewable energy sources, like wind turbines and solar panels, would be easier with a smart grid that could handle inconsistent electricity production. More energy would lower the cost of running giant computer servers, and because such a grid can send signals in both directions, it would also allow variable pricing for peak hours and could potentially expand the Internet network, as would extending other forms of broadband lines to rural and underserved areas. And moving health records online would open new markets for digitalconnections,data storage and consumer services.
 ''They all converge,'' said Christopher G. Caine, vice president for governmental programs at I.B.M., which is in both the smart grid and health care data businesses. At the transition's request, I.B.M. prepared a research report concluding that $30 billion in spending this year on the smart grid, broadband access and digitized health records would create approximately 949,000 jobs.
 The idea of harnessing such pre-existing proposals to a stimulus package traces back to September 2008, when the financial crisis was worsening and it became clear that a jobs bill could be an early priority if Mr. Obama won the election.
 Obama advisers including Mr. Furman, Julius Genachowski and Austan Goolsbee began soliciting input from the high-tech and alternative energy interests, including General Motors, I.B.M., Google, the Information Technology Industry Council and the electric utilities' Edison Institute.
 By October, ''there was a query that said 'if you had money to spend on broadband as part of this stimulus, what would you propose?' '' said Debbie Goldman, a lobbyist for the Communications Workers of America, which has pushed for greater government spending on broadband. 
 After the election, the campaign's policy teams went through their agenda and selected those items that could have a quick start and natural end date to identify candidates for a jobs bill.
 ''Synergies between our short-term goals and our long-term goals,'' David Axelrod, a top adviser to Mr. Obama, said in an interview, ''that was the sweet spot.''
 The transition also sought expert advice, holding conference calls and meetings at its temporary headquarters in Washington with a parade of industry lobbyists and executives from high-tech and clean energy companies from mid-November to early December. 
 On Dec. 2 for example, Ms. Goldman of the communications workers union made a presentation promoting the jobs that would be created by broadband spending. On the same day, representatives of all the renewable energy trade groups sat around a table making pitches to Carol M. Browner, who is now Mr. Obama's energy policy chief. 
 ''It was nice they were having us all in so early,'' said Karl Gawell of the Geothermal Industry Association, whose members would benefit from $400 million in grants in the House version of the stimulus bill.
 The process reached a climax when members of the economic team flew to Chicago for a Dec. 16 meeting with Mr. Obama. The team laid out the structure of the plan -- increased spending on infrastructure, education, energy and health care, along with tax cuts, financial aid to states and unemployment and food stamp benefits. 
 While much of the presentation involved broad themes, Mr. Furman said it put special focus on ''a number of high-priority flagship details'' like the renewable energy and high-tech components. Mr. Obama signed off on the initial outline, after making a few adjustments.
 ''The president-elect was particularly interested in the energy component of the plan and pushed for a more robust effort on the smart grid,'' Mr. Furman recalled.
 Three days later -- the Friday before Christmas -- transition officials met at the Capitol with Congressional leaders and staff to present the proposals, which Mr. Furman said were couched in the form of ''suggestions'' by the president-elect.
 His team had few staff and relied on Congress to convert their ideas into legislative language. Congressional committees, meanwhile, had been working since November to draft their own version of a stimulus bill, and added their own details to Mr. Obama's blueprint. For example, House Democrats attached privacy protections to measures that promote the online storage of medical records, banning the sale of health data, an idea long pushed by the American Civil Liberties Union.
 Mr. Garfield of the Information Technology Industry Council said technology lobbyists accepted the privacy rules in a spirit of compromise, inlight of the victories they won elsewhere with Mr. Obama's help.
 ''I won't say it is great to be the king, because we are not the king,'' Mr. Garfield said. ''But it is good to be heard.''

HEADLINE: Senate Clears Path for Vote on $838 Billion Stimulus

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats on Monday advanced the $838 billion economic stimulus bill, clearing a major procedural hurdle by a razor thin margin with the help of just three Republicans. A vote on final passage of the bill is expected on Tuesday. 
 The Senate vote, by 61 to 36, to close debate on the stimulus, symbolized the partisanship that still grips Congress despite President Obama's call for new cooperation. It also highlighted the rising power of the centrist Republicans who cast the critical votes. Under Senate rules, it takes 60 votes to invoke cloture and usher a bill to a vote. 
 Those votes, by Senators Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, along with the 56 Democrats and two Independents who regularly vote with them, followed a succession of floor speeches by Republicans criticizing the stimulus as a bloated, wasteful spending bill. 
 But supporters of the measure said that a good, bipartisan effort had been made at drafting a compromise bill.
 ''I am proud of the bipartisan work that we have done during the last 10 days,'' said Ms. Collins, who supplied one of the three crucial Republican votes. ''As with any major legislation, this bill is not perfect, but it can go a long way toward creating jobs and addressing the dire economic crisis facing our nation.'' 
 The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said: ''The United States senators from both parties met the seriousness of the economic crisis with an earnest approach to solving this emergency.'' 
 With Mr. Obama in Indiana Monday afternoon to kick off a heightened effort to sell the stimulus plan to the public, Senate Democrats responded with their own speeches describing the bill as desperately needed to create millions of jobs and halt the recession. But for all the recriminations, it was unclear if Congress, in reconciling the Senate and House version of the bill this week, would take steps to ensure that it provides the quickest, most effective lift for the economy, or if lawmakers would simply take the path of least political resistance in rushing to get the bill to the White House by Monday. 
 Senate Republicans leveled their grievances amid an outcry by some House Democrats and governors and mayors from around the country, who accused Senate Democrats of caving to Republican demands by reducing the aid to states in the bill. 
 If the Senate approves the measure, as expected, negotiations to resolve differences with the $820 billion bill passed by the House are expected to focus in part on the Senate's decision to cut $40 billion from a state stabilization fund.
 That money, while not providing a direct lift to the economy, would reduce pressure on states for layoffs and service cuts that economists say would undercut the efforts by the stimulus bill to create jobs and spur consumer spending and business investments. 
 As it stands now, the Senate bill focuses more on tax cuts, while the House bill provides more aid to state and local governments. The Senate bill does not include $19 billion for school construction included in the House bill, reduces health insurance subsidies for the unemployed, and scales back Mr. Obama's proposed middle class tax cut. 
 The Senate bill also includes nearly $70 billion to prevent millions of middle class families in 2009 from having to pay the alternative minimum tax, originally designed to impose minimum tax payments by the wealthy. Because Congress has made such an adjustment for years now, economists say the provision offers no new help to the economy. 
 Just as the Senate was voting, the Congressional Budget Office released a new analysis showing the total cost of the Senate version of the stimulus bill to be $838.2 billion over 10 years, of which $292.5 billion or roughly 35 percent is in the form of tax cuts. 
 The cost of the bill fluctuated slightly throughout the weekend, as Senate Democrats finalized the legislative language to reflect their deal late Friday night with the three Republicans.
 After a week of the most open floor debate since Democrats won control of the Senate in 2006, the Republicans complained that they had still been largely shut out of developing the huge package of spending programs and tax cuts to revive the economy. 
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, for instance, said that he and other Republicans had been prevented from offering amendments, including one that would place restrictions on an increased in federal aid to states for rising Medicaid costs. 
 ''I'm not convinced the majority wanted to have open debate and take votes on many of these amendments including mine,'' he said. ''It's too bad because this bill still can be made a bipartisan bill and this bill can still be made a more effective states.'' 
 Senator James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, complained that for all the spending in the bill, it does not provide a sufficient number of public works projects. , 
 ''If we're going to spend all this money, let's at least get something for it, provide some jobs and get some roads and highways and bridges, things this country really needs,'' he said. 
 ''This is the largest spending in the history of mankind, the largest spending in the history of the world,'' Mr. Inhofe added. ''It's something that we should not let happen, but it is going to happen right down party line.''
 The Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said he appreciated the more open floor debate but that it had not led to a bill that he could support. ''Just because we get amendments doesn't necessarily mean we will win them,'' he said at a news conference. 
 ''This package, had it been developed in genuine consultation, could have had a different result,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''But at the end of the day, it was -- the administration decided -- let the package be developed in Congress by the majority, and old habits die hard. You know, there was no meaningful consultation in the early part of the process. So if you don't have that on the takeoff, you don't end up having it on the landing.''

HEADLINE: Up Next For Bankers: A Flogging

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest new on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
On Wednesday, eight chief executives of big banks will make their way to Washington -- giving up their private jets and instead riding Amtrak and the Delta Shuttle -- to appear at a Congressional hearing in front of Representative Barney Frank and the House Financial Services Committee.
 Lloyd C. Blankfein, Jamie Dimon, John J. Mack, Vikram S. Pandit and Kenneth D. Lewis will be among them.
 The hearing will no doubt be a spectacle. It is meant to explore what Mr. Frank, the chairman of the committee, described as Wall Street's lack of accountability over how it is using funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. 
 ''Until they are successful in showing Americans that the money is being used reasonably, they don't need to ask for it, because they won't get it,'' Mr. Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said last week when he announced the hearing about whether the next $350 billion of the TARP program would be distributed. 
 Judging by the nation's outrage at Wall Street, however, our representatives are likely to turn the hearing into a public flogging.
 ''I want groveling,'' wrote Patt Morrison, an op-ed writer at The Los Angeles Times, over the weekend, echoing a chorus of others. ''I want show-trial sweating and stammering. I want their nine-figure bonus checks endorsed over to the rest of us. I want my 401(k) money back. I want blood; I'm a vegetarian, but I'd make an exception for a smoking plate of C.E.O. en brochette.'' 
 That sentiment may not seem that unreasonable given that taxpayers are now against-their-will shareholders. But the hearing should really be used to get at some fundamental and meaningful questions that go beyond what mode of transport the bankers used to get there or whether they sponsored an event at the Super Bowl. (In case you're curious, Bank of America did.) 
 Here are 10 questions members of the committee might consider asking:
 1. Pretend for a moment that you are on the biggest road show of your life. Try to sell American taxpayers on why they should invest in your firms and what kind of returns they should expect. Please be specific. Can you provide a 12-month forecast, a 24-month forecast and a 5-year forecast of both your earnings and a price target that you'd put on your own stock?
 2. The government has lent your firms hundreds of billions each at an annual cost of 5 percent. There is speculation in the marketplace that you have turned around and used the money to buy corporate bonds with yields as high as 20 percent, like Alltel debt, for example. If that is the case, this new ''carry trade'' is allowing you to arbitrage the difference using taxpayer money. Is this so? And if it is, should it be?
 3. This question is for Mr. Pandit of Citigroup. When you sold your hedge fund, Old Lane Partners, to Citigroup for $800 million in 2007, you pocketed $165.2 million cash. At the time, you did not reinvest any of that cash in Citigroup's stock; you invested the after-tax proceeds into Old Lane, which you've since shuttered. Since then, your biggest purchase of Citigroup stock amounted to $8.4 million, when it was trading at $9.25 a share. (It closed Monday at $3.95). Only a fraction of your net worth appears to be in the company you run. Why? And why should taxpayers be willing to make a bet on a company that so far you seem unwilling to bet on yourself?
 4. Last month, several banks -- Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, among them -- lent $22.5 billion to Pfizer to help finance its acquisition of Wyeth. The two drug companies said that part of the motivation of the deal was to cut $4 billion in annual costs. Much of that is likely to come in the form of jobs, 19,500 in total according to Pfizer, at a time when the country can ill afford more people out on the street. Given that Congress is considering a stimulus plan to help create and save jobs, is it consistent to allow TARP-funded banks to make loans to corporations that will inevitably hurt the economy, at least in the short run? 
 5. This question is for Mr. Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Lewis of Bank of America and Mr. Pandit. Much has been made of the subprime debacle. But few seem to be willing to talk about another looming crisis: credit card debt. People like Nouriel Roubini, the professor who has predicted much of this crisis, have estimated that you could have losses of as much as $3.6 trillion, which would bankrupt the industry. What do you make of that number? And since credit card defaults are correlated to employment, what happens if unemployment goes as high as 10 percent or more? What is the highest unemployment level that you've used in your forecasting models? And do you have adequate reserves for your worst-case situation? If your assumptions are wrong, what happens? 
 6. The termination of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era laws that separated commercial banking and investment banking, enabled you to run a casino inside your bank because it allowed the combination of traditional banking and the riskier side of Wall Street, investment banking. While the house usually wins, you lost big time. Do you think Glass-Steagall should have been repealed? Do you think there should be a limit on the amount of leverage, or borrowed money, that your banks can employ? (Not just capital ratios.) What's appropriate? 
 7. Your compensation structure has been ''heads I win, tails I win'' for you and many of your employees, despite putting your firm and the nation's fiscal health in jeopardy. What's the right model? And how do you feel about forcing your employees to risk their own money, not just the firm's, when they make a trade or participate in a transaction that puts shareholder capital at risk?
 8. Treasury has proposed a $500,000 cap on compensation for banks that take new TARP money. Many of you have privately complained that you will lose your top talent. Are these the same people that helped lose your banks billions? And can you quantify the impact on your earnings without such ''talent?''
 9. Mr. Blankfein and Mr. Mack, both of you have been outspoken about your firm's intention to repay the TARP money that you received as fast as possible. Mr. Blankfein, you have also hinted that you have little intention of changing your firm's business model despite being granted bank holding company status and access to the Federal Reserve's discount window. Please explain whether we should have provided you the money in the first place and whether your status as a bank holding company should be rescinded? If both took place, could you survive?
 10. Please explain how you feel about the newest TARP proposal from the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. Would you be willing to sell toxic assets into a ''bad bank'' if you are forced to realize serious losses? At what price would you be willing to sell your toxic assets? And finally, should the Bush administration have pursued its original TARP plan to buy assets as opposed to making capital injections? How do you grade the success of the program?

HEADLINE: As Aid Vote Nears, Cash-Pressed Governors Are Dialing for Dollars

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Atlanta, Sean D. Hamill from Pittsburgh and Christopher Maag from Cleveland.

 BODY:
Facing rapidly declining revenues and mounting cuts to state services, governors around the nation scrambled Monday to influence senators to change their positions on the Senate's economic stimulus bill, which is less generous to state governments than the one approved by the House.
 As the bill headed toward final passage in the Senate on Tuesday, state leaders made frantic calls to Congressional committee leaders and amply exercised their thumbs, sending BlackBerry messages from the back seats of cars between appointments, all in the hopes of averting cuts and shoring up their ailing budgets. Though no changes could be made to the bill on Monday, House and Senate representatives still must sit down to reconcile the differences between the measures. 
 The Senate version of the bill, to satisfy the demands of a group of centrist senators, cuts tens of billions of dollars in aid to the states from the measure passed by the House late last month. The single biggest of those cuts was a $40 billion reduction to a state stabilization fund, which angered many governors and state legislatures.
 The begging, cajoling and at times public chastising put some governors in awkward positions as they sought both to gain federal aid but also negotiate with legislatures on cuts and tax increases, knowing that widespread federal aid cannot be counted on. Some Republican governors have also found themselves at odds with members of their own Congressional delegations, and members of their own party as they sought to keep the pressure on. 
 For example, Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, a Republican who was a staunch supporter of Senator John McCain in the presidential race, is to appear with President Obama in Florida on Tuesday to promote the stimulus package and underscore its importance to strapped states. Mr. Crist has also made numerous calls to Senator Mel Martinez, also a Florida Republican, who is firmly against the bill. 
 ''On the car on the way to where we are now he spoke to Senator Martinez,'' said Erin Isaac, the governor's communications director, in what was one of a series of calls over the last several days. Ms. Isaac would not characterize the tone of those calls, other than to say, ''Charlie Crist doesn't get mad.''
 Ken Lundberg, a spokesman for Senator Martinez -- whose telephones have been so clogged with calls from constituents on the matter that they can no longer accept voice mail -- said, ''I get the sense they respect each others' decisions.''
 In some cases, Democratic governors have tried in vain to appeal to Republican members of their delegation, and have expressed open frustration. 
 At a briefing with House Democratic leaders at a retreat in Virginia, Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, which has had to borrow from the federal government to cover its unemployment insurance costs, said he had spoken to Senator George V. Voinovich, a Republican, several times to little avail. Mr. Voinovich opposed the bill in a key procedural vote on Monday.
 ''Sometimes I believe there is a disconnect between what is understood on the Senate side and what is actually happening in the real world,'' Mr. Strickland said.
 In Virginia, Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, invited the entire Congressional delegation to the Governor's Mansion on Monday, and only the Democratic members showed up, said his spokesman, Gordon Hickey. ''No one even sent staff,'' Mr. Hickey said, referring to the Republicans. ''The message was, Keep working on it. We clearly need the stimulus package and the flexibility that was included in the House plan.''
 State governments, pounded by foreclosures and the loss of property taxes, as well as the rapidly falling collection of other taxes, are facing budget gaps unlike any they have known in modern times. More than 40 states now have budget shortfalls. And over 20 states have unemployment rates above 7 percent, which has led to a rise in Medicaid costs and the depletion of unemployment insurance funds, as well as widespread service cuts and some tax increases. 
 As a result, states have high hopes for a stimulus plan that will provide Medicaid relief, money for infrastructure and education, and other support.
 Gov. Martin O'Malley, Democrat of Maryland, said that he regularly contacted Steny H. Hoyer, the House majority leader, and that he constantly e-mailed Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the dean of the state's delegation. Mr. O'Malley said he had also spoken directly to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, over the last 48 hours. 
 ''Just checking in, seeing how everything is going,'' he said of Mr. Reid. ''I try not to bother him too much.''
 Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, said that about 80 percent of his time was being spent on the stimulus bill. 
 Cities are also getting in on the lobbying. Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago flew to Washington on Monday to lobby personally for more money in the bill. Detroit is working through its lobbying firm on the city's top-priority projects; and Valarie J. McCall, Cleveland's chief of government affairs, has met regularly with the Ohio delegation. 
 ''This is a once-in-a-lifetime situation,'' Ms. McCall said. ''We are not letting up.''

HEADLINE: The Chess Master

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
It was just a week ago that the bad-mouthing of Barack Obama seemed to be reaching a fever pitch.
 The president was taking heat for the tax problems of Tom Daschle, Timothy Geithner and other appointees and nominees. Liberal supporters of the president were upset that he was making such a high-profile effort to get Republicans to climb aboard his stimulus package bandwagon. 
 Self-styled middle-of-the-roaders were snarling that Mr. Obama was not doing enough bipartisan outreach, even as Republicans on Capitol Hill were attacking his economic package with the kind of venom usually reserved for the handiwork of Satan. 
 Mr. Obama was called a hypocrite, dismissed as both craven and politically naive and taken to task for being too much in the public eye. 
 The president was even accused -- oh, my goodness -- of working in the Oval Office without his suit jacket on. And what was Mr. Obama doing as this chaos and tension and criticism swirled about him? Not surprisingly, keeping a level head.
 Mr. Daschle, who was supposed to be the administration's point person on health care reform, withdrew his nomination as secretary of health and human services, and Mr. Obama promptly took the blame for the foul-up. ''I've got to own up to my mistake,'' he said.
 Polls showed that this went over very well with the public.
 After making every effort -- and failing -- to generate significant G.O.P. support for the stimulus package, the president ratcheted up his rhetoric, pointing to the stunning job losses in January and sharply criticizing the Republicans' obstructionist tactics. On Friday, a weakened but still enormous stimulus bill was agreed upon in the Senate, a crucial advance for Mr. Obama.
 On Monday, he was on the road, making the case for his stimulus bill in Elkhart, Ind., which is enduring Depression-levels of joblessness and is desperate for federal assistance. Speaking to a crowded town-hall-style meeting, Mr. Obama said: ''Endless delay or paralysis in Washington in the face of this crisis will only bring deepening disaster. I can tell you that doing nothing is not an option.''
 The crowd cheered and supported him enthusiastically throughout his appearance.
 There is always a tendency to underestimate Barack Obama. We are inclined in the news media to hyperventilate over every political or policy setback, no matter how silly or insignificant, while Mr. Obama has shown again and again that he takes a longer view.
 There was no way, for example, that the Daschle flap was going to derail the forward march of a man who had survived the Rev. Jeremiah Wright fiasco. It's early, but there are signs that Mr. Obama may be the kind of president who is incomprehensible to the cynics among us -- one who is responsible and mature, who is concerned not just with the short-term political realities but also the long-term policy implications.
 He has certainly handled himself much better than some of the clowns carrying leadership banners for the G.O.P. Michael Steele, the new Republican Party chairman, could barely contain his glee over the fact that no Republicans voted for the stimulus package in the House. ''The goose egg that you laid on the president's desk was just beautiful,'' he said. 
 ''This bill stinks,'' said Lindsey Graham of South Carolina during the Senate debate on the package.
 Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, made it clear that his party was committed to the low road when he talked about picking up pointers from the Taliban.
 I'm not joking. ''Insurgency, we understand perhaps a little bit more because of the Taliban,'' said Mr. Sessions, in an interview with Hotline, which is part of NationalJournal.com.
 The simple truth is that most Republican politicians would like Mr. Obama to fail because that is their ticket to a quick return to power. I think the president is a more formidable opponent than they realize.
 Mr. Obama is like a championship chess player, always several moves ahead of friend and foe alike. He's smart, deft, elegant and subtle. While Lindsey Graham was behaving like a 6-year-old on the Senate floor and Pete Sessions was studying passages in his Taliban handbook, Mr. Obama and his aides were assessing what's achievable in terms of stimulus legislation and how best to get there.
 I'd personally like to see a more robust stimulus package, with increased infrastructure spending and fewer tax cuts. But the reality is that Mr. Obama needs at least a handful of Republican votes in the Senate to get anything at all done, and he can't afford to lose this first crucial legislative fight of his presidency.
 The Democrats may succeed in bolstering their package somewhat in conference, but I think Mr. Obama would have been satisfied all along to start his presidency off with an $800 billion-plus stimulus program.

HEADLINE: By Narrow Margin, Economic Measure Clears Senate Hurdle

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats on Monday advanced the $838 billion economic stimulus bill, clearing a major procedural hurdle by a razor-thin margin with the help of just three Republicans. Final passage of the bill is expected Tuesday. 
 The Senate vote, 61 to 36, which closed debate on the stimulus, symbolized the partisanship that still grips Congress despite President Obama's call for new cooperation. It also highlighted the rising power of the centrist Republicans who cast the critical votes. 
 Under Senate rules, it takes 60 votes to end debate on a controversial bill. 
 The three Republicans, Senators Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, joined 56 Democrats and two independents in favor. The vote followed a succession of floor speeches by Republicans criticizing the stimulus as a bloated, wasteful spending bill. 
 With Mr. Obama in Indiana on Monday afternoon to sell the stimulus plan to the public, Senate Democrats responded with speeches describing the bill as desperately needed to create millions of jobs. 
 Congressional Democrats are rushing to get the bill to the White House by Monday. Senate Republicans leveled their grievances amid an outcry by some House Democrats and governors and mayors from around the country, who accused Senate Democrats of caving to Republican demands by reducing the aid to states in the bill. 
 Negotiations this week to resolve differences with the $820 billion bill passed by the House will focus in part on the Senate's decision to cut $40 billion from a state stabilization fund.
 That money would reduce pressure on states for layoffs and service cuts that economists say would undercut the federal government's effort to grow the economy.
 While the House bill provides more aid to state and local governments, the Senate bill includes more tax cuts. The Senate bill does not include $19 billion for school construction included in the House bill but adds nearly $70 billion to prevent millions of middle class families from having to pay the alternative minimum tax in 2009. 
 The Congressional Budget Office on Monday released a new analysis showing the total cost of the Senate stimulus bill to be $838.2 billion, based on some new provisions. For instance, a cap on the pay of top executives at companies bailed out by the government would cost the government $10.8 billion in lost tax revenues. The latest numbers show that Mr. Obama's signature tax cut would reach an estimated 106 million households or about 87 percent of American taxpayers. 
 Supporters of the bill called it a good compromise. 
 ''I am proud of the bipartisan work that we have done,'' Ms. Collins said. ''This bill is not perfect, but it can go a long way toward creating jobs and addressing the dire economic crisis facing our nation.'' 
 The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said, ''The United States senators from both parties met the seriousness of the economic crisis with an earnest approach to solving this emergency.'' 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has brain cancer, returned to the Capitol for the first time since suffering a seizure at an Inauguration Day luncheon. He voted for the stimulus, giving Democrats one more than the minimum of 60 votes. 
 After a week of the most open floor debate since Democrats won control of the Senate in 2006, the Republicans complained that they had still been largely shut out. 
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, for instance, said that he and other Republicans had been prevented from offering amendments, including one that would place restrictions on an increase in federal aid to states for rising Medicaid costs. 
 ''I'm not convinced the majority wanted to have open debate,'' Mr. Grassley said. ''It's too bad because this bill still can be made a bipartisan bill and this bill can still be made a more effective bill.''
 The Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said he appreciated the open floor debate but that it had not led to a bill that he would support. ''Just because we get amendments doesn't necessarily mean we will win them,'' Mr. McConnell said at a news conference. ''This package, had it been developed in genuine consultation, could have had a different result.''

HEADLINE: Ex-eBay Chief May Run for Governor

 BODY:
Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay, announced Monday that she had formed an exploratory committee, the first step in seeking the Republican nomination for governor of California in 2010. 
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, faces term limits and cannot run for re-election, leaving the field open for one of the nation's most powerful governorships.
 Like others in the Republican Party, Ms. Whitman, 52, may face an uphill battle for the post, given the economic crisis battering the state. 
 Likely competitors for the nomination are Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner, and Tom Campbell, a former congressman.

HEADLINE: The Showdown Over the Stimulus

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Competing Bills on the Stimulus Divide Congress'' (front page, Feb. 8):
 President Obama is letting bipartisanship stand in the way of what's best for America. 
 We need a still-larger stimulus package, not one pared down to obtain the votes of a recalcitrant Republican minority that has already spurned cooperation. 
 We need to increase immediate aid to the unemployed and the poor and to the states, not dilute the stimulus to placate the party whose bankrupt philosophy got us into this mess. 
 Emphasizing once more the failed conservative theory that tax cuts cure all ills to buy support from Republicans is unnecessary and dangerous.
 It is time to reject the antidemocratic notion that a Republican Senate minority has the right to veto legislation that is supported by the president and by a majority of each house of Congress. If we need to get rid of the filibuster to avoid economic collapse, so be it. But compromise with rule-or-ruin Republicans for the sake of ''unity'' is a sad mistake.
 Mitchell Zimmerman Palo Alto, Calif., Feb. 8, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I have one simple question: Why are conservative Republicans, who never hesitated to sink hundreds of billions of dollars into the Iraq war, now suddenly so concerned about spending an equivalent amount to help us face this awful crisis and invest in the future?
 Clara Coen Chicago, Feb. 8, 2009
 To the Editor:
 With the constant drumbeat of Democrats claiming dire results if the stimulus package is not immediately passed, I wonder if part of the rush might be that they don't want us to know all the ''pork'' it includes.
 Those who crafted the plan demand that senators vote on it with barely a day to look through $800 billion to be spent and possibly squandered on projects, let alone actually study this unprecedented bill for efficiency and effectiveness.
 With one of the lowest Congressional approval ratings in my lifetime, maybe our senators are too lazy or incompetent to comment on it anyway. They are big on rhetoric intended to manipulate public opinion, but keep in mind that they are the ones who should have prevented this financial meltdown in the first place.
 Bonnie O'Neil Newport Beach, Calif., Feb. 7, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 The nation handed President Obama a big stick to carry; Congress is giving him a reason to wield it.
 Byron Alpers Shorewood, Wis., Feb. 9, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman (''The Destructive Center,'' column, Feb. 9) is correct in asserting that so-called moderate senators have effectively gutted the stimulus plan by offering their hard bargain for passage of the measure. But all is not lost. It is reasonably anticipated that when both houses confer, vital elements will be restored. 
 The real test will come when the Senate is faced with approval of the enhanced final version of the bill and the Republicans threaten filibuster. It will then be time for the Congressional and White House leadership to dig in their heels and let them try. 
 The more they talk and delay, the more they will demonstrate that during the greatest economic crisis facing the nation in a lifetime, they were the obstructionists stubbornly standing in the way of relief.
 Arthur L. Yeager Edison, N.J., Feb. 9, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 Paul Krugman's column highlights why the so-called centrist compromise could short-circuit the surge the economy needs to get its pulse rate going again. The heart of the problem is that, constrained by their balanced budget requirements, state and local governments must cut jobs and raise taxes just at the time the opposite is needed. 
 These policies undermine the whole thrust of the stimulus package. The fight to restore the aid levels in the bill that passed the House is thus critical to an early recovery.
 Richard C. Leone Princeton, N.J., Feb. 9, 2009
 The writer is president of the Century Foundation and a former state treasurer of New Jersey.
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Playing With Fire,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Feb. 7):
 For eight years, Republicans passed every spending bill George W. Bush put forward, creating the biggest deficits in our history and the current state of our economy. I have little doubt that if President Obama's economic recovery plan were for Iraq, Republicans would pass it without flinching because, of course, anyone who balked would be considered antipatriotic. 
 But now that the ''spending'' is put forth by a Democratic president for people other than the wealthy, Republicans are playing political Russian roulette with the lives of millions of Americans. 
 There is something '''stinking up the place,'' as Senator Lindsey Graham said, but it's not the economic recovery bill.
 Michele Yulo Tucker, Ga., Feb. 7, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Bank Bailout, Redux'' (editorial, Feb. 8):
 As your editorial implies, how can moral hazard be avoided if you take off the table the option of the temporary nationalization of insolvent banks followed by their reorganization and then rational reregulation? The Obama administration has been shying away from this step, but it shouldn't.
 The opposite of moral hazard might be considered to be moral affirmation. The Obama administration should select a policy that embodies moral affirmation.
 James Bernstein New York, Feb. 8, 2009
